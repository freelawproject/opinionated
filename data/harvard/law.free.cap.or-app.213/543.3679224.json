Although she admitted sexual conduct with defendant to the police and others, K refused to testify at trial, and defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of other evidence of the sexual nature of their relationship, specifically 12 audiotapes of telephone conversations between defendant and K, a videotape of K\u2019s interview with police, and a grand jury clerk\u2019s testimony recounting what K told the grand jury that indicted defendant. We conclude that the trial court erred by admitting the videotape and the grand jury clerk\u2019s testimony over defendant\u2019s hearsay objections, but that there was little likelihood that the errors affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We take the relevant facts from the record. When K was a 14-year-old seventh grader during the 1999-2000 school year, she served as defendant\u2019s teacher\u2019s aide. In the summer between her seventh- and eighth-grade years, K joined a traveling basketball team coached by defendant. In the fall of 2000, she enrolled in defendant\u2019s eighth-grade algebra class and joined the eighth-grade school basketball team coached by defendant. K continued to play on the traveling basketball team during the summer after eighth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Defendant and K developed a relationship outside of the basketball teams and the classroom that K\u2019s mother described during her trial testimony as \u201cfriendly.\u201d K\u2019s mother permitted K, when K was in middle school, to visit defendant at his home and occasionally housesit for him. A witness observed K at defendant\u2019s house on average once a week during her eighth-grade year. One of K\u2019s classmates testified that K also sat in on defendant\u2019s math classes that year, even though she was not enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Defendant\u2019s neighbor described once coming home for lunch during the summer after K graduated from middle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>school and seeing K \u201ctalking on a cell phone and kind of suspicious acting\u201d across the street from defendant\u2019s house. She thought that \u201csomething! was] going on,\u201d so she alerted her daughters to keep watch over defendant\u2019s house, and that same evening her older daughter saw K crawl over defendant\u2019s fence into his backyard. Although the neighbor reported what her daughter had seen to a school board official, no one investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In fall 2001, when K was a high school freshman, however, police investigated defendant after a student told a school counselor that \u201c[t]he whole thought of a teacher and a student just didn\u2019t seem right.\u201d That student was concerned about the relationship between defendant and K based on \u201cobservations and word of mouth.\u201d The police spoke to K\u2019s mother, who told them that she did not think anything inappropriate was happening between K and defendant. K\u2019s mother testified that, although she sometimes felt that something was \u201cnot quite right\u201d about defendant\u2019s interactions with K, she did not think anything romantic was going on between them at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The police closed the investigation, but K\u2019s mother asked defendant to stop contacting K outside of the traveling basketball team that defendant coached. The principal of the middle school at which defendant taught also talked to defendant about a report from a counselor that K had told another student that she was having a sexual relationship with defendant. Defendant denied that he was sexually involved with K, but the principal nevertheless instructed him to refrain from having contact with her. K\u2019s high school basketball coach testified, however, that defendant attended nearly all of K\u2019s home games during her freshman and sophomore years.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Shortly after the investigation was closed, in October 2001, K\u2019s mother became suspicious of the relationship between defendant and K because she discovered birth control pills with K\u2019s name and defendant\u2019s address on the label. When she confronted K, K claimed that the pills were dispensed to a friend, and that K had suggested that the friend use K\u2019s name and defendant\u2019s address. Although K told her mother that the pills were for someone else, several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>of the pills were missing from the pack when K\u2019s mother confiscated them from K.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In fall 2002, when K was a 16-year-old high school sophomore, K\u2019s mother and her husband noticed that they were receiving multiple telephone calls each day in which the caller would hang up after they answered. They obtained caller identification and discovered that many of the calls were from defendant, so they installed a device to secretly record K\u2019s telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">K\u2019s mother recorded several phone calls between defendant and K in January 2003. During the first recorded conversation, K commented that she could not believe that she and defendant had had sex on every piece of furniture in his house, and defendant affirmatively acknowledged K\u2019s remark. Although most of the phone calls centered around the interpersonal dynamics of K\u2019s basketball team and her conflicts with the coach and other players, the romantic overtones of the conversations are unmistakable. K told defendant that he \u201clooked so good,\u201d and she discussed preparing to see him by doing her hair and wearing scented lotion. At one point, K read defendant a love poem that she had written for him, and K and defendant professed their love for one another on multiple occasions. A large portion of their conversations was devoted to discussing how they might arrange to meet without defendant\u2019s roommate or K\u2019s mother knowing, and they expressed disappointment when their plans were thwarted. K and defendant also discussed whether K\u2019s mother knew about the phone calls and took steps to avoid both defendant\u2019s roommate and K\u2019s mother finding out that they were talking to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">After recording several calls between K and defendant, K\u2019s mother turned the tapes over to the police. On January 9, 2003, the police interviewed K at her home, but she denied having a sexual relationship with defendant. Later that evening, K\u2019s mother recorded another phone call in which K told defendant that the police had interviewed her. K and defendant discussed what K had told the officers in an effort to give them a consistent account of events when defendant was contacted by police. They agreed that, if police asked defendant if K was ever at his home alone, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>would say that K came by alone a few days before Christmas to drop off some cards, but that she did not go inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">When the police interviewed defendant on January 13, 2003, he denied having a sexual relationship with K and, and as he and K had agreed, he claimed that he had last seen K a few days before Christmas when she delivered some Christmas cards to his house. Although he initially denied any knowledge of the birth control pills K\u2019s mother found in K\u2019s bag, he later admitted that he did know about the pills, but he denied that they were for K\u2019s use. Rather, he claimed that K\u2019s boyfriend at the time took her to the clinic to obtain the pills for a friend, but that he had known that K intended to use his address to obtain the prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Later that day, K was questioned in a videotaped interview at the police station by two detectives. After initially denying the sexual nature of their relationship, when pressed, K admitted that she and defendant had been sexually involved but that they had not engaged in sexual activity for \u201cquite a while.\u201d K explained that she and defendant had grown emotionally close during her eighth-grade year, and that they first shared a kiss in January 2001, and that they engaged in mutual oral sex in February 2001. She told the detectives that she and defendant had oral sex between 10 and 15 times since then. K also told detectives that she and defendant had intercourse later in February 2001, and then about once a month for the next year and a half. Each encounter occurred at defendant\u2019s house. After her interview, K called defendant and, in another conversation taped by her mother, recounted what she had told police, including that the police \u201cknew we had kissed, and they knew that we had had sex at least five times, and they had known that we had had oral sex at least ten times.\u201d Defendant asked K, \u201cHow did they know this?\u201d and K replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I. My guess is they tapped the phone. And so I just, so I just told them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">That afternoon, defendant\u2019s roommate called K and told her to call defendant. When they spoke, on another audiotaped call, defendant told K that he had intentionally overdosed on aspirin. Defendant told K that he could not go to jail, and K said, \u201c[I]f you can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do this. And I am gonna be right there with you.\u201d After the call concluded, K <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>intentionally overdosed on ibuprofen. She became ill at basketball practice that afternoon. She explained to her mother, who attended the practice, that she had taken some pills, and her mother decided to take her to the emergency room. Defendant also decided to seek emergency medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The same emergency-room doctor treated both K and defendant. That physician testified that defendant was \u201c[v]ery despondent about having been caught having had a sexual affair with an underage woman.\u201d Defendant admitted the \u201csexual relationship\u201d to the doctor, but \u201cwithout any specific details.\u201d Defendant also told the doctor that, before coming to the hospital, he had called K\u2019s mother to apologize. Defendant acknowledged to the doctor that his relationship with K \u201chad progressed at least as far as a sexual relationship, and he understood his teaching career had ended. His coaching career had ended.\u201d The doctor also testified that, during his treatment of K, she \u201chad ample opportunity to deny that it had been sexual, and that didn\u2019t occur. It was kind of like it was understood.\u201d He testified without objection that K\u2019s mother told him that K and defendant had a \u201csuicide pact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Several days later, according to the grand jury clerk\u2019s testimony, K testified before the grand jury that she and defendant had begun a sexual relationship in February 2001 with mutual oral sex, and that later that same month she and defendant first had sexual intercourse. K told the grand jury that defendant had helped her obtain birth control. She also explained that she called defendant and told him what she had told the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">K recovered from her suicide attempt and returned to school, where she spoke to her basketball coach about her feelings for defendant. K told the coach \u201cthat she cared very much about him, that she didn\u2019t know what she was going to do without being able to contact him and compared it to me not being [allowed] to have contact with my husband.\u201d K also told a friend that \u201cshe loves [defendant] and that she\u2019s worried about what was going to happen\u201d and that she and defendant \u201cwere like soul mates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>When called as a witness at defendant\u2019s trial, K refused to testify and invoked her right to be free from self-incrimination. Although the court granted her immunity, K continued to refuse to testify and was held in contempt. <em>See </em>ORS 33.015(2); ORS 33.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Although K never testified at trial, the state introduced other evidence of the sexual nature of K\u2019s relationship with defendant, including the testimony of the emergency room doctor, evidence of K\u2019s possession of birth control pills with K\u2019s name and defendant\u2019s address on the label, the 12 audiotapes that K\u2019s mother had made of defendant\u2019s conversations with K, the videotape of defendant\u2019s interview with police, the videotape of K\u2019s interview with police, and K\u2019s grand jury testimony as recounted by the clerk of the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">At trial, defendant objected to the admission of the audiotapes of his telephone conversations with K, arguing that they were inadmissible pursuant to 18 USC section 2515, which prohibits the use of illegally intercepted wire communications in court proceedings. He acknowledged to the trial court that the audiotapes were admissible under <em>State v. Capell, </em>156 Or App 582, 966 P2d 232 (1998), but he argued that <em>Capell </em>was wrongly decided. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the audiotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Defendant also argued both that the videotape of K\u2019s interview with police and the testimony of the grand jury clerk were inadmissible hearsay, and that their admission would violate his rights to confront witnesses against him under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state argued that the evidence should be admitted over defendant\u2019s hearsay and state and federal confrontation-clause objections because defendant had forfeited those objections due to the wrongful nature of his conduct towards K. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mack, </em>337 Or 586, 592 n 8, 101 P3d 349 (2004) ; <em>State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 80-81, 104 P3d 616 (2005) (both recognizing the common-law doctrine known as \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The trial court concluded both that K\u2019s statements on the police videotape and as recounted by the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>clerk were admissible under the residual hearsay exception, <em>former </em>OEC 804(3)(f) (2003), <em>renumbered as </em>OEC 804(3)(h) (2005),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that defendant had forfeited his rights to confront K under both the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution. Noting that K was a \u201cparticularly fragile child as a result of other traumatic events which had occurred in her life\u201d and who \u201cplaced enormous trust and confidence in [defendant],\u201d the court reasoned that defendant had manipulated K into refusing to testify. The jury convicted defendant on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The first assignment of error pertains to the admission of the 12 audiotapes made by K\u2019s mother. On appeal, defendant argues that <em>Capell </em>should be overturned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree, and we reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error concern the admission of statements that K made during her videotaped police interview and to the grand jury, respectively. We first consider whether K\u2019s statements were properly admitted under OEC 804(3)(f). We review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence for legal error. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 618, 853 P2d 256 (1993) (explaining that we consider statutory questions before constitutional claims); <em>State v. Rodriguez-Castillo, </em>210 Or App 479, 488, 151 P3d 931 (2007) (\u201cWe review for errors of law the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion as to whether the statement is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d). Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d OEC 801. It is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the exceptions set out in OEC 801 to 806 or as \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d OEC 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by applying OEC 804(3)(f) to K\u2019s statements because those statements are \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by another exception, namely, OEC 803(18a)(a). We agree. OEC 804(3)(f) applies only if a witness was unavailable and the statement to be admitted is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\"><em>\u201cnot specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions </em>but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of the Oregon Evidence Code and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">(Emphasis added.) The trial court specifically found that K\u2019s statement at the police station was \u201ca statement not specifically covered by any of the previous portions of Rule 804, although it is covered in [Rule] 803.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court reasoned that \u201csince [K] is unavailable, that brings into play Rule 804, rather than [Rule] 803.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The applicability of OEC 803(18a), however, is not limited to situations in which a declarant is available. <em>See State v. Campbell, </em>299 Or 633, 702, 705 P2d 694 (1985) (\u201c[T]he legislature, in placing OEC 803(18a) as an OEC 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>exception, must have decided that the availability * * * of the declarant [ ] was immaterial.\u201d). Thus, we must determine whether the videotaped police interview of K and the grand jury clerk\u2019s testimony fall within the category of statements \u201cspecifically covered by\u201d OEC 803(18a). <em>State ex rel Children\u2019s Serv. Div. v. Page, </em>66 Or App 535, 539, 647 P2d 1196 (1984) (\u201c[W]here there is a specific hearsay exception applicable to a clearly defined category of evidence * * *, but the evidence fails to satisfy the requirements of the specific exception, the evidence should not be admitted under the residual exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">OEC 803(18a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by ORS 40.455, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">* % * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201c(18a)(a) A complaint of sexual misconduct[ or a] complaint of abuse as defined in ORS 107.705 or 419B.005 * * * made by the witness after the commission of the alleged misconduct or abuse at issue. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, such evidence must be confined to the fact that the complaint was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201c(b) A statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse as defined in ORS 107.705 or 419B.005 * * * is not excluded by ORS 40.455 if the declarant either testifies at the proceedings and is subject to cross examination, or is unavailable as a witness but was chronologically or mentally under 12 years of age when the statement was made * * *. However, if a declarant is unavailable, the statement may be admitted in evidence only if the proponent establishes that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide indicia of reliability, and in a criminal trial that there is corroborative evidence of the act of abuse and of the alleged perpetrator\u2019s opportunity to participate in the conduct and that the statement possesses indicia of reliability as is constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">OEC 803(18a) applies to statements made by the victim of a sex crime about that crime, including statements made by child victims, elderly victims, and developmentally disabled adults. OEC 803(18a)(d); <em>Campbell, </em>299 Or at 641-46. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Page, </em>the state sought to admit the testimony of a child psychologist and caseworker narrating the details of a complaint of sexual misconduct allegedly made by the defendant\u2019s eight-year-old daughter. Although the psychologist and caseworker were permitted to testify that the daughter had made a complaint of sexual misconduct under OEC 803(18a)(a), OEC 803(18a)(b) prohibited the witnesses from describing the sexual misconduct. Thus, we held that the trial court erred by permitting the witnesses to testify under the residual hearsay exception about the details of what the daughter had told them because that evidence was specifically excluded by OEC 803(18a). 66 Or App at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Here, defendant was charged with multiple counts of rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse as those acts are defined in ORS chapter 163. Therefore, K\u2019s statements to the police and to the grand jury inculpating defendant for those crimes fall within the \u201cclearly defined category of evidence\u201d covered by OEC 803(18a). <em>Page, </em>66 Or App at 539 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>OEC 803(18a)(a) (permitting the admission of a hearsay statement that is \u201c[a] complaint of sexual misconduct [ or a] complaint of abuse as defined in ORS * * * 419B.005 * * * made by the witness after the commission of the alleged misconduct or abuse at issue\u201d); ORS 419B.005(1)(a) (defining \u201cabuse\u201d to include rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse as those acts are defined in ORS chapter 163).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Although both the police detectives who interviewed K and the grand jury clerk who recounted K\u2019s testimony would have been permitted under OEC 803(18a)(a) to testify \u201cto the fact that the complaint was made,\u201d under the rule, their testimony should have been confined to that fact alone. The details of a complaint of sexual misconduct or abuse may not be admitted under OEC 803(18a) unless the witness is available or, if the witness is unavailable, \u201cchronologically or mentally under 12 years of age when the statement was made.\u201d OEC 803(18a)(b). Because K was unavailable and 16 years of age at the time she made the statements to the police and to the grand jury, the details of her statements were not admissible under OEC 803(18a) or the residual exception of OEC 804(3)(f). <em>See Page, </em>66 Or App at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The state contends that the entirety of K\u2019s statements was nevertheless admissible because defendant forfeited his right to object on hearsay grounds by virtue of his wrongful relationship with K.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing rule bars a defendant from asserting the constitutional right to confront a declarant whom the defendant has caused to be absent from trial, and, in this case, is also being asserted by the state as an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Mack, </em>337 Or at 592 n 8; <em>Page, </em>197 Or App at 680-81. We need not decide whether the trial court correctly applied the doctrine to overcome defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of K\u2019s statements to police and to the grand jury on hearsay or confrontation-clause grounds because we conclude that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Evidentiary error is not presumed prejudicial, and the burden is on a defendant who appeals his conviction to show that a court\u2019s error affected a substantial right. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3; OEC 103(1); <em>State v. Torres, </em>206 Or App 436, 445, 136 P3d 1132 (2006). An evidentiary error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights when, based on the totality of the record, the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict. If there is little likelihood that the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict, then the evidentiary error was harmless. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">To determine whether an error was harmless, we examine the record as a whole and consider the nature of the error and the context in which it occurred. <em>Torres, </em>206 Or App at 445. For instance, if the erroneously admitted testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence that established the same fact, then the evidence is less likely to have affected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>verdict. <em>See Davis, </em>336 Or at 33-34. Similarly, the less substantial the evidence of guilt, the more likely it is that an error affected the result. <em>State v. Roller, </em>201 Or App 166, 173, 118 P3d 804 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"> Although under the Oregon Constitution a verdict must be affirmed if there is little likelihood that the error affected it, for violations of federal constitutional rights, the error must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 231, 809 P2d 81 (1991). In determining whether an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we consider the importance of the improperly admitted testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 135 P3d 260 (2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the errors were harmless under any standard because the evidence was cumulative and uncontradicted and there was other substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. After K had been interviewed at the police station, she told defendant over the phone that the police \u201cknew that we had had sex at least five times, and they had known that we had had oral sex at least ten times.\u201d Thus, from the properly admitted audiotaped phone call, the jury heard K recount to defendant the substance of what she told police (and later the grand jury). The jury also heard the properly admitted audiotape of a phone call during which K told defendant, \u201cDo you realize that there is not a piece of furniture in your house that I haven\u2019t had sex with you on?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cYep,\u201d thereby adopting K\u2019s statement. Moreover, the emergency room doctor who treated both K and defendant testified that defendant admitted that he and K had engaged in a \u201csexual affair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Defendant\u2019s agreement that the 12 audiotaped conversations showed that defendant and K were romantically involved, as well as his argument that the jury should not rely on K\u2019s statements to police and the grand jury, further support our conclusion that the evidence was not likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. In closing, defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that defendant and K \u201cfell in love, and it was genuine love.\u201d Counsel also argued that the jury should question the reliability of K\u2019s statements to police because the officers did not follow the protocol for interviewing children when investigating cases of suspected child abuse, and that the jury should distrust the grand jury clerk\u2019s testimony because the state destroyed the notes of the other grand jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">In addition to the significant amount of direct evidence that K and defendant had engaged in intercourse and sodomy, there was substantial circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Several witnesses testified that K and defendant were rumored to be sexually involved, and that their relationship \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem right.\u201d The jury also heard the telephone conversations between defendant and K, in which the romantic nature of those calls was unmistakable. During those calls, defendant and K often discussed their love for each other. They also discussed how they might meet in secret, and defendant\u2019s neighbor testified that she once saw K climb the fence into defendant\u2019s backyard, as if she were trying to avoid detection. The jury also heard K and defendant discuss how to keep their stories straight, and they viewed a videotape of defendant\u2019s police interview in which he repeated the story that he and K had agreed upon. Defendant himself admitted to police that he had played a role in assisting K to obtain birth control pills by allowing her to use his address. Although defendant claimed those pills were for K\u2019s friend, K\u2019s stepfather testified that several of the pills were missing when K\u2019s mother confiscated them from K. Lastly, the evidence established that K and defendant had entered into and attempted to carry out a \u201csuicide pact.\u201d We conclude that there is little likelihood that the error in admitting K\u2019s statements to the grand jury and to the police affected the jury\u2019s verdict because those statements were cumulative of other evidence, there was no other evidence contradicting them, and there was substantial other evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In his fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error, defendant argues that the trial court ran afoul of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>US 466,120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), when it imposed consecutive sentences, failed to merge his multiple convictions for the same offenses, and reconstituted his criminal history score. In <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 86-87, 150 P3d 31 (2006), we considered whether imposition of consecutive sentences based on facts not found by a jury or admitted to by a defendant was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>We concluded that the jury-trial right of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution did not extend to facts that concern the manner in which sentences for separate crimes should be served. Thus, the trial court did not err by imposing consecutive sentences on counts two and three after finding that each offense constituted a separate criminal episode. <em>See </em>ORS 131.123(2); <em>State v. Carson, </em>211 Or App 606,156 P3d 71 (2007) (applying <em>Tanner </em>to ORS 137.123(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We also conclude that the trial court did not err by declining to merge defendant\u2019s convictions for multiple violations of the same statutory provision. The merger statute, ORS 161.067(3), requires merger of multiple violations of the same statutory provision involving a single victim only if the violations were committed during the same conduct or criminal episode. Here, the jury found that each criminal act was a \u201cseparate act\u201d after being instructed by the trial judge that a \u201cseparate act\u201d is \u201can act that does not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted conduct as another act.\u201d Accordingly, the jury found that each offense constituted a separate criminal episode. <em>See </em>ORS 131.505(4) (defining \u201ccriminal episode\u201d as \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that establishes at least one offense and is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective\u201d); <em>see also State v. Knight, </em>160 Or App 395, 403, 981 P2d 819 (1999) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018same act or transaction\u2019 is synonymous with the term \u2018criminal episode.\u2019 \u201d (citing State <em>v. Boyd, </em>271 Or 558, 565-66, 533 P2d 795 (1975))). It follows that the trial court did not err by declining to merge defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Based on the jury\u2019s finding that each offense constituted a separate criminal episode, we also conclude that the trial court did not err by reconstituting defendant\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>history score when imposing sentence on counts two and three. <em>See Knight, </em>160 Or App at 403 (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s criminal history can be enhanced by a conviction based on a concurrently sentenced offense provided that the offenses do not arise from \u2018the same transaction or series of specifically connected transactions.\u2019 The phrase \u2018same act or transaction\u2019 is synonymous with the term \u2018criminal episode.\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; citing <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 315, 855 P2d 1100 (1993), <em>and Boyd, </em>271 Or at 565-66)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> This action was commenced before the effective date of the 2005 revisions to the Oregon Evidence Code. All subsequent references to provisions of the Oregon Evidence Code refer to the 2003 version of those statutes unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> Defendant also argues on appeal that <em>Capell </em>is distinguishable on its facts from this case. At trial, he argued that K\u2019s mother was acting on behalf of the state when she recorded the conversations, and that therefore the audiotapes were subject to the exclusionary rule. Nevertheless, he candidly told the trial court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cthe Court of Appeals has resolved this issue [the state-actor issue] squarely against me. I believe that the Court of Appeals was in error, and in the event that we\u2019re ever in a position to ask them to overturn its decision, have the Oregon Supreme Court do that. This \u2014 the purpose of this exercise is to make a record so that we don\u2019t waive anything. But I should lose it according to the state of the law as exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Pursuant to the argument presented by defendant, the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress focused entirely on whether K\u2019s mother \u201cact[ed] on behalf of, or act[ed] as an agent, of the state\u201d when she recorded the calls. We conclude that, under such circumstances, defendant did not preserve at trial the issue of whether <em>Capell </em>is distinguishable, and we do not consider it on appeal. ORAP 5.45(4); <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (\u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 344-46 (appellate courts have an independent obligation to determine whether an argument advanced on appeal was preserved at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> The trial court apparently did not revisit this issue when ruling on the admissibility of K\u2019s statements to the grand jury as recounted by the grand jury clerk. Those statements were also \u201cspecifically covered\u201d by OEC 803(18a) and thus, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, inadmissible under OEC 804(3)(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> The state raised this contention to the trial court in response to both defendant\u2019s hearsay objections and his confrontation clause objections. Following defendant\u2019s trial, the legislature codified the common-law doctrine as OEC 804(3)(f) (2005) (applicable if a defendant causes the death, incapacity, or incompetence of witness) and OEC 804(3)(g) (2005) (applicable if a defendant otherwise wrongfully caused a witness to be unavailable) in the context of the rule against hearsay. Or Laws 2005, ch 458, \u00a7 1. Those amendments to OEC 804 \u201cdo not apply to an action or proceeding commenced before [January 1, 2006].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2. This action was commenced when defendant was indicted on January 22, 2003. <em>See </em>ORS 131.135 (\u201cA prosecution is commenced when a warrant or other process is executed * * *.\u201d). Accordingly, we need not construe OEC 804(3)(g) (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
