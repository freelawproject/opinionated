Defendant challenges only his conviction on Count 2 for assault, arguing, first, that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal, and second, that the trial court made an impermissible amendment to the indictment. We agree with defendant that the trial court made an impermissible amendment to the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we vacate defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 2, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. On November 3, 2003, defendant was driving east along Highway 26 in Washington County when the car he was driving crossed the median and struck a west-bound vehicle head-on. Although defendant was not hurt, both occupants of the other car and the passenger in defendant\u2019s car were seriously injured. Defendant left the scene of the accident without rendering aid or providing information.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The grand jury indicted defendant. Counts 1 through 3 charged defendant with assault in the second degree \u2014 one count for each person injured in the accident. With the exception of the injured parties\u2019 names, the counts were nearly identical. However, Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment used the phrase \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d whereas Count 2 used the phrase \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d Count 2 of the indictment alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cThe defendant on or about November 3, 2003, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life cause serious physical injury to Debra Loveless by means of a <em>deadly weapon, </em>to-wit: a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>At the end of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to Count 2. Defendant conceded that he was driving the car; however, he argued that the state had failed to prove that the car was a <em>deadly </em>weapon as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The state acknowledged that defendant\u2019s car was not a deadly weapon, but suggested that the wording in Count 2 was a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error,\u201d and that Count 2 should have alleged \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d to mirror the language in Counts 1 and 3. The state argued that all three counts accurately listed the \u201cweapon\u201d that defendant used to commit the assaults as the motor vehicle he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Without explanation, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. It then amended Count 2 by striking \u201cdeadly\u201d weapon and inserting \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon, despite defendant\u2019s objection that such an amendment was a material change to the substance of the indictment. The jury found defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We address defendant\u2019s challenge to the amended indictment, because it is dispositive. Defendant argues that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, when it amended Count 2 of the indictment to charge assault in the second degree by means of a dangerous \u2014 as opposed to a deadly\u2014 weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> We review a trial court\u2019s amendment of an indictment for errors of law. <em>State v. Wimber, </em>315 Or 103, 113-15, 843 P2d 424 (1992). Under the Oregon Constitution, only a properly convened grand jury can indict a person for a felony or make an amendment to the substance of a felony indictment. Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201c(3) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, a person shall be charged in a circuit court with the commission of any crime punishable as a felony <em>only on indictment by a grand jury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">\u00ab\u00edk * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">\u201c(6) * * * The district attorney may file an <em>amended indictment </em>* * * whenever * * * an indictment * * * is held to be defective in <em>form.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In <em>Wimber, </em>the Supreme Court divided the universe of amendments into two categories \u2014 form and substance. It reasoned that a change that affects the substance of an indictment can be made only by a grand jury. 315 Or at 113. However, a trial court may amend an indictment so long as the change goes to form only. The court then held that deleting dates to shorten the relevant time frame alleged in the indictment was a permissible change to the form of the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 116 In reaching its conclusion, the court adopted a four-part test to determine whether an amendment of an indictment was a permissible change to form or an impermissible change to substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Wimber </em>set out those four questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201c(1) Did the amendment alter the essential nature of the indictment against defendant, alter the availability to him of defenses or evidence, or add a theory, element, or crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201c(2) Did the amendment prejudice defendant\u2019s right to notice of the charges against him and to protection against double j eopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201c(3) Was the amendment itself sufficiently definite and certain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201c[If] the amendment deleted allegations, we ask one additional question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">\u201c(4) Did the remaining allegations in the indictment state the essential elements of the offenses?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 114-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">When we analyze this case under <em>Wimber, </em>we conclude that the answer to the first question is \u201cyes.\u201d Although the amendment did not alter the essential nature of the indictment against defendant, it did alter the availability to him of a defense. Count 2 charged defendant with committing assault in the second degree by means of a deadly weapon. Defendant attempted to defend against that charge by arguing that the motor vehicle he was driving did not meet the statutory definition of a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>court amended Count 2 of the indictment to allege assault by means of a dangerous weapon, defendant could no longer avail himself of the defense, nor effectively present evidence, that his car was not a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">We next consider whether Count 2, once we remove the disputed language, would still allege a crime. Count 2 of the indictment, without the disputed language, would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">\u201cThe defendant on or about November 3, 2003, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life cause serious physical injury to Debra Loveless by means of a weapon, to-wit: a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">ORS 163.175 provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">\u00ab\u00edj\u00ed \u00edfr \u2756 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">\u201c(c) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Defendant argues, and we agree, that such language is insufficient to allege assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The state, however, responds that we have already held that a trial court may amend an indictment by deleting \u201cdeadly\u201d weapon and inserting \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon in <em>State v. Hanson I Hughes, </em>14 Or App 586, 513 P2d 1202, <em>rev den, </em>(1973). In <em>Hanson/Hughes, </em>the two defendants were convicted of first-degree robbery. The indictment charged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>defendants with use of a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d however, the proof at trial was that the defendants used a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d Despite the confusion over the proper weapon classification, the state consistently argued the same theory of the case: The defendants used a pocketknife.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The defendants in <em>Hanson / Hughes </em>argued that the court\u2019s jury instructions usurped the grand jury\u2019s role when the trial court altered a material element of the indictment by substituting \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon for \u201cdeadly\u201d weapon. On appeal, we affirmed the convictions and held that \u201cthe variance in this case was not material or prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Thus, the state is correct that we have previously held that the trial court could amend an indictment by deleting \u201cdangerous\u201d and inserting \u201cdeadly.\u201d However, we again addressed the dangerous versus deadly issue in <em>State v. Alben, </em>139 Or App 236, 911 P2d 1239, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 153 (1996). There, the defendant appealed his conviction for robbery in the first degree. The defendant was charged by a grand jury indictment that stated that he was armed with a \u201cdeadly weapon, to-wit: a firearm,\u201d but the jury instructions given by the trial court included an instruction that permitted a conviction if the jury found \u201cthat * * * <em>defendant </em>* * * <em>was armed with a deadly weapon or used a dangerous weapon </em>or attempted to use a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Initially, the state argued that the defendant had used a nine-millimeter handgun in the robbery. The defendant, however, testified that he had participated in the robbery, but that he did not have a handgun; rather, he used only a BB pistol \u2014 a dangerous, but not deadly, weapon under the circumstances. In its closing argument, the state reasserted its theory that the defendant possessed a deadly weapon \u2014 a handgun \u2014 but also introduced an alternate theory in which the defendant would be equally culpable if he had used a dangerous weapon \u2014 the BB pistol. <em>Id. </em>at 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We reversed the conviction for first-degree robbery and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction was an impermissible amendment to the indictment. We applied <em>Wimber\u2019s </em>analytical framework and reasoned that \u201c[t]he amendment provided the state with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>a different theory of the case, altered the availability of defendant\u2019s defense, and prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to notice of the charges against him.\u201d Ib. at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The state argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Albert </em>and is most closely analogous to <em>Hanson /Hughes. </em>Despite the similarities between <em>Hanson /Hughes </em>and this case, we cannot overlook that <em>Hanson/Hughes </em>was decided before <em>Wimber. Wimber </em>is now the law in Oregon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, when we analyze the amendment to Count 2 in light of Wimber\u2019s four questions, we conclude that the amendment to the indictment was one of substance and, as such, the trial court erred, as a matter of law, when it made the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Finally, we must determine the proper disposition of this case. According to the state, if we conclude that the trial court committed reversible error when it amended Count 2, the proper remedy is to remand for entry of a conviction of assault in the third degree on that count. The state relies on <em>State v. Cook, </em>163 Or App 578, 581, 989 P2d 474 (1999), in which we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cGenerally, a court does not have jurisdiction to convict on a charge for which the defendant was not indicted * * *. However, jurisdiction does exist to enter a conviction for an offense not expressly charged if that offense is one that is lesser included within the offense charged in the indictment * * *. An offense is lesser included of a charged crime if either of the following tests is satisfied: (1) one offense is necessarily included within the other because the elements of the former are subsumed in the latter; or (2) the facts alleged in the charging instrument expressly include conduct that describes the elements of the lesser included offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Here, defendant was charged with assault in the second degree. Because the indictment did not allege assault in the third degree, we must determine whether assault in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>third degree is a lesser-included offense of assault in the second degree. If it is, the trial court has jurisdiction to enter a conviction for assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">We first consider whether the elements of assault in the third degree are subsumed in the elements of assault in the second degree. Pursuant to ORS 163.165(1)(b), a person commits assault in the third degree if the person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cRecklessly causes serious physical injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">ORS 163.175 provides, in part, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the second degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201c(c) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Here, third-degree assault is identical to second-degree assault, except that third-degree assault does not include the words, \u201cby means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d Stated differently, assault in the third degree is necessarily included within assault in the second degree because the elements of the former are subsumed in the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Defendant concedes that the indictment, read without the disputed language, charges assault in the third degree. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to enter a conviction for the lesser-included offense of assault in the third degree. Accordingly, we vacate defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 2 for assault in the second degree, and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction on Count 2 for the offense of assault in the third degree. Pursuant to ORS 138.222(5)(b), we remand for resentencing as to all convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Judgment of conviction on Count 2, assault in the second degree, vacated; remanded with instructions to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>a judgment of conviction for assault in the third degree on Count 2, and for resentencing as to all convictions; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\"> Because both parties agree that the state introduced sufficient evidence to support a conviction for assault in the third degree, we need not address defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\"> ORS 161.015 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u201c(1) \u2018Dangerous weapon\u2019 means any weapon, device, instrument, material or substance which under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">\u201c(2) \u2018Deadly weapon\u2019 means any instrument, article or substance specifically designed for and presently capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-14\"> We recognize that, pursuant to Counts 1 and 3, defendant already had to defend against assault by means of a dangerous weapon; however, ORS 132.550(4) provides that an indictment must contain \u201c[a] separate accusation or count addressed to each offense charged * * What is more, this court has held that each count in a multiple count indictment must separately allege sufficient facts to charge the crime. <em>State v.
