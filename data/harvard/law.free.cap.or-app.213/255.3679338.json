J.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Plaintiff appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s allowance of summary judgment for defendant property owners in this action based on premises liability. Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in determining that, regardless of whether plaintiff was an invitee or licensee, defendants were entitled to prevail because plaintiff was aware of the dangerous condition and, thus, defendants had no duty to warn of, or remedy, that condition. We conclude that (1) the uncontro-verted facts establish that plaintiff was an invitee, not a licensee, and (2) there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether defendants eliminated the danger posed by steps on defendants\u2019 premises and whether plaintiff adequately appreciated the hazard posed by those steps. Consequently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Summary judgment is proper if the \u201cpleadings, depositions, affidavits, declarations and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d ORCP 47 C. \u201cNo genuine issue as to a material fact exists if, based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the allowance of summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party, here plaintiff, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Bachmeier v. Tuttle, </em>195 Or App 83, 85, 96 P3d 871 (2004). Except where specifically noted, the following facts were undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Plaintiff has worked as a delivery person for United Parcel Service (UPS) since 1977. Defendants have a home in Independence, Oregon, which they use as a residence and not to conduct business. Before October 30, 2001, plaintiff had delivered packages to defendants\u2019 home, on average, every month or two for five or six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">On October 30,2001, plaintiff went to deliver a package \u2014 a birthday present from a third party \u2014 to defendants\u2019 home. The weather was \u201cyucky,\u201d \u201cdewy, drizzly, [and] gray.\u201d Plaintiff approached defendants\u2019 home from the side, where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>set of gray steps led up to the porch. As plaintiff was about to go up the steps, he noticed that they looked \u201cvery slick\u201d because they were completely covered in wet moss or algae. Plaintiff was \u201cexceedingly cautious\u201d as he went up the steps. There was another set of steps \u2014 a few feet to the left of the first set \u2014 that also led to the porch. As addressed more fully below, there is no direct evidence that plaintiff was aware of the second set of steps at the time of his injury, and there is no evidence regarding the condition of those steps at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Upon reaching the porch, plaintiff dropped off the package on defendants\u2019 doorstep (defendants were not home at the time) and then went back down by the same route, on the same mossy steps. As he did so, plaintiff held onto the side of the house, in an attempt to keep his balance. Nevertheless, plaintiff slipped and fell, injuring himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Plaintiff brought this action, alleging one count of negligence. Specifically, he alleged that he was an invitee on defendants\u2019 property and that defendants failed to maintain a reasonably safe premises and warn him of the potential risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Defendants moved for summary judgment, raising two alternative arguments. First, defendants asserted that plaintiff was a licensee and, consequently, because the danger presented by the slippery steps \u201cwas open and obvious,\u201d they owed him no duty either to correct that condition or to warn him of that condition. Second, defendants contended that, even if plaintiff was an invitee, they could not be held liable because (1) by providing an alternative route of \u201csafe\u201d steps, they had, effectively, eliminated or remedied the \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d condition of the slippery set of steps and (2) because plaintiff recognized the hazards posed by the slippery steps and used them anyway, any failure to warn of that condition could not have contributed to plaintiffs injuries. Plaintiff responded that the determination of whether he was a licensee or an invitee implicated disputed issues of fact and that, regardless of his status at the time of the injury, defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because there were disputed issues of fact as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>they had failed to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn him of potential hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment. The court determined that it need not address plaintiffs status because, regardless of whether plaintiff had been a licensee or an invitee, defendants were not liable because they had \u201celiminated\u201d the dangerous condition by providing the alternative set of steps and because plaintiff recognized the danger and proceeded anyway:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">\u201cIf Johnson came upon the premises as a mere licensee, the only duty owed to him was to warn him of any concealed, dangerous conditions of which the owners had knowledge. It is undisputed that Johnson saw, and fully appreciated the dangerous nature of the steps. As such, the danger was not concealed, and no duty was breached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cEven if Johnson is regarded as an invitee, the Shorts\u2019 only duty was to protect him from \u2018an unreasonable risk of harm\u2019 by either \u2018eliminating] the condition that created the risk or to warn any foreseeable invitee of the risk so as to enable the invitee to avoid the harm.\u2019 It was obvious that the steps that Johnson chose to use were dangerously slick. There was another set of steps leading to the porch a few feet away. There is no contention that those steps were slippery or in any way dangerous. By providing a safe route, the Shorts had, in effect, eliminated the condition creating the risk. Further, defendants can discharge their duty either by eliminating the condition or by giving adequate warning. Johnson was very familiar with these premises, and was fully aware of the dangerous condition of the steps. Aware of the risks, Johnson chose to ascend the steps. Then he chose to go down the same route.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">(Footnote omitted; brackets and boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">On appeal, the parties essentially reiterate their arguments before the trial court. As amplified below, we conclude that the uncontroverted evidence establishes, as a matter of law, that plaintiff was an invitee at the time that he slipped on the steps and injured himself. We further determine that there are disputed issues of material fact pertaining to whether defendants breached their duty of care owed to plaintiff as an invitee. Accordingly, we reverse the allowance of summary judgment and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>We begin with the question of plaintiffs status. In general, a business invitee is a \u201cperson who is invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 332(3) (1965); <em>see also Cassidy v. Bonham, </em>196 Or App 481, 486, 102 P3d 748 (2004) (applying that formulation). The requisite invitation can be express or implied by the landowner. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, a licensee is a person who, \u201cwith the [possessor\u2019s] permission, comes upon a premises for the licensee\u2019s own purposes, often social.\u201d <em>Nelsen v. Nelsen, </em>174 Or App 252, 256, 23 P3d 424 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The distinction is significant because of the differences in the duty of care the possessor of the property owes the visitor, depending on the visitor\u2019s status. The possessor\u2019s duty to an invitee is to \u201cwarn of latent dangers\u201d and to \u201cprotect the invitee against dangers in the condition of the premises about which the [possessor] knows or should reasonably have known.\u201d <em>Cassidy, </em>196 Or App at 486 (citation omitted). In contrast, a possessor of land is liable to a licensee for harm resulting from a condition on the land only if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201c \u2018(a) the possessor knows or has reason to know of the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such licensees, and should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201c \u2018(b) he fails to exercise reasonable care to make the condition safe, or to warn the licensees of the condition and the risk involved, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201c \u2018(c) the licensees do not know or have reason to know of the condition and the risk involved.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\"><em>Nelsen, </em>174 Or App at 258 (quoting with approval <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The distinction between \u201cinvitation\u201d and \u201cpermission\u201d to come upon land can be ephemeral. Nevertheless, in <em>Cassidy, </em>we invoked, as instructive, <em>(he Restatement\u2019s </em>discussion of that distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201c \u2018Although invitation does not in itself establish the status of an invitee, it is essential to it. An invitation differs from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>mere permission in this: an invitation is conduct which justifies others in believing that the possessor <em>desires </em>them to enter the land; permission is conduct justifying others in believing that the possessor is <em>willing </em>that they shall enter if they desire to do so. Any words or conduct of the possessor which lead or encourage the visitor to believe that his entry is <em>desired </em>may be sufficient for the invitation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><em>Cassidy, </em>196 Or App at 486 (quoting <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 332 comment b) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Finally, in this context, even if the injured visitor can prove an express or implied invitation to enter, he or she must also establish that the entry was for purposes pertaining to the possessor\u2019s \u201ceconomic advantage.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Parker v. Hult Lumber &amp; Plywood Co., </em>260 Or 1, 8, 488 P2d 454 (1971), the court summarized the substance of that \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cIt defines an invitee as one who comes upon the premises at the occupier\u2019s invitation, express or implied, upon business which concerns the occupier. <em>It proceeds upon the assumption that the economic advantage of plaintiff\u2019s presence to the occupier imposes upon him the duty to use due care for plaintiffs safety</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See Walsh v. C &amp; K Market, Inc., </em>171 Or App 536, 539-40, 16 P3d 1179 (2000) (describing \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test); <em>see generally </em>Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James, and Oscar S. Gray, 5 <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 27.12, 219 (2d ed 1986) (\u201cThe economic benefit theory proceeds on the assumption that affirmative obligations are imposed on people only in return for some consideration or benefit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We return to this case: Is a delivery driver who has routinely delivered packages to a person\u2019s home over a substantial period of time an \u201cinvitee\u201d under the \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test? No reported Oregon decision directly addresses that question. <em>Cf. Woolston v. Wells, </em>297 Or 548, 550, 557-58, 687 P2d 144 (1984) (presuming, without explaining, that the plaintiff, a television repairman who \u201cfell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>while ascending stairs to deliver a television set to defendants\u2019 tenant,\u201d was an invitee).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Defendants contend that the answer must be negative for several reasons, including (1) defendants did not order the package that plaintiff delivered and, thus, did not even impliedly or indirectly \u201cinvite\u201d plaintiffs entry onto the premises; (2) the delivery was not business related \u2014 it was a birthday present; and (3) the premises was defendants\u2019 home and, thus, there was no business-related \u201cnexus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Conversely, plaintiff contends that defendants derived an \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d from his provision of delivery services and that, by accepting the regular provision of those services without objection over a period of several years, defendants implicitly invited his entry on October 30, 2001. Moreover, plaintiff suggests, it would be unworkable in the context of the regular provision of delivery services to distinguish between whether a particular package had been ordered by the homeowner or was being sent unsolicited to the homeowner \u2014 or, similarly, to predicate the determination of premises liability on the nature or value of the particular item being delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We agree with plaintiff. Although, as noted, there is no controlling Oregon authority, the preponderant view of other jurisdictions adhering to the \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test is that persons in circumstances analogous to plaintiffs are \u201cbusiness visitor\u201d invitees. We concur in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We observe, at the outset, that the residential character of the premises is hardly conclusive \u2014 and, in this case, is ultimately immaterial \u2014 in determining plaintiffs status. As noted, <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 332(3) defines a \u201cbusiness visitor,\u201d within the \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d formulation, as \u201ca person who is invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose directly or indirectly connected with business dealings with the possessor of the land.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 332 comment e amplifies that definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cBusiness visitors fall into two classes. The first includes persons who are invited to come upon the land for a purpose connected with the business for which the land is held open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to the public, as where a person enters a shop to make a purchase, or to look at goods on display. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">\u201cThe second class includes those who come upon land not open to the public, for a purpose connected with business which the possessor conducts upon the land, or <em>for a purpose connected with their own business which is connected with any purpose, business or otherwise, for which the possessor uses the land. Thus a truck driver from a provision store who enters to deliver goods to a private residence is a business visitor; </em>and so is a workman who comes to make alterations or repairs on land used for residence purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See Taylor v. Baker, </em>279 Or 139, 147, 566 P2d 884 (1977) (citing comment e with approval, subject to certain qualifications that are inapposite here).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Consistently with that view, other jurisdictions have deemed a variety of visitors performing beneficial services on residential property to be \u201cbusiness visitor\u201d invitees. Those services range from garbage and trash removal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to meter reading,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to delivery of packages and other items, including pizzas, that the residential occupant has ordered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Woolston, </em>297 Or at 550, 557-58 (presuming that plaintiff, who was injured while returning a repaired television to defendants\u2019 tenant, was an invitee). Similarly, mail carriers who have been injured while delivering mail to residential premises have been deemed to be invitees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In sum, where, as here, plaintiff asserts that he was a \u201cbusiness visitor\u201d invitee, the residential character of defendants\u2019 property is immaterial. Rather, consistently with the \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test, the inquiry is whether, at the time that plaintiff was injured, he was on defendants\u2019 premises pursuant to an express or implied invitation and whether his presence was of material benefit to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We acknowledge that, in this case, unlike in those involving trash collectors or meter readers, the injured plaintiffs entry onto defendants\u2019 property was not an implicit condition of a continuing contract for the provision of services. We also appreciate that here, unlike in most, and perhaps all, of the reported decisions involving residential deliveries, defendants did not order the item that plaintiff delivered. Nevertheless, \u201cinvitee\u201d status need not be express \u2014 it may also be implied \u2014 and the totality of the undisputed circumstances here establishes an implied invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Our determination in that regard rests on plaintiffs regular provision of services beneficial to defendants over a period of years and defendants\u2019 ongoing acceptance, without objection or qualification, of those beneficial services, which were, necessarily, dependent on plaintiffs entry onto defendants\u2019 property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This was not, for example, a case in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>some of defendants\u2019 friends, as a one-time surprise, hired a chanteuse to deliver a \u201csinging valentine\u201d to defendants at their home. Rather, it is undisputed that plaintiff, for a period of at least five years, delivered packages on an average of once every other month to defendants\u2019 home. Thus, plaintiff had entered defendants\u2019 property roughly 30 times previously to provide services benefitting defendants and, given their lack of any objection to his entry and the nature and requirements of plaintiffs work, defendants had every reason to believe that plaintiff would continue to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The line between a landowner\u2019s mere acquiescence to entry and implied invitation can, in some cases, be elusive. This is not such a case. The totality of the circumstances here \u2014 the frequency and regularity of plaintiffs business-related visits over an extended period of time and defendants\u2019 unqualified acceptance of the material fruits of those visits\u2014 gave rise to an implied invitation. <em>See generally Premises Liability, </em>62 Am Jur 2d 473 \u00a7 94 (2006) (noting that invitation may be implied from, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csome relationship inuring to the benefit of both the injured party and the occupier of the premises\u201d and the \u201chabitual acquiescence of the owner\u201d); 21 ALR 3d 1099, 1103 (1969) (\u201cBecause of the nature and the regularity of his visits [,] the courts generally have treated a mail carrier as a business visitor or invitee[.]\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Finally, with respect to plaintiffs status as an invitee or licensee, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the nature of the item delivered might affect plaintiffs status. None of the reported cases involving delivery people or postal carriers suggests such a distinction. In all events, it would be insupportable. The proper focus is on the services provided, not the nature or value of the item delivered. <em>See </em>32 ALR 3d 9, 21 (1970) (noting that, in reported cases applying the \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d test, \u201c[t]he type of goods delivered or picked up\u201d is \u201cimmaterial in determining the status of the person who delivers the goods or picks them up\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>We proceed, then, to whether there are disputed issues of material fact pertaining to defendants\u2019 alleged breach of the duty of care owed to plaintiff as invitee. As noted, the trial court concluded that, even assuming that plaintiff was an invitee, defendants were nevertheless entitled to summary judgment for two reasons: (1) by providing the second set of steps as a route to the porch, defendants \u201chad, in effect, eliminated the condition creating the risk\u201d; and (2) plaintiffs recognition of the hazards posed by the slippery steps and his decision to use the steps notwithstanding that recognition abrogated causation and liability for any breach of the duty to warn of that condition. <em>See </em>213 Or App at 259 (quoting trial court\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The trial court\u2019s first rationale depends on an erroneous factual premise. Even assuming that, in some circumstances, a possessor of property could \u201celiminate\u201d an otherwise unreasonably dangerous condition by providing an obvious and easily accessible alternative, safer route,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is no evidence in the summary judgment record regarding the condition of the second set of steps, much less that they were, in fact, \u201csafer\u201d than the slippery steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">To be sure, the trial court, in granting summaryjudgment, noted that \u201c[t]here is no contention that those [alternative] steps were slippery or in any way dangerous.\u201d But, respectfully, that formulation impermissibly shifts the burden of production and, ultimately, persuasion regarding the alleged \u201csafer\u201d alternative to plaintiff. To the extent that defendants contend that a manifestly unsafe condition was somehow remedied because of their provision of a safer alternative, it was incumbent upon them, not plaintiff, to proffer proof of the efficacy of those efforts. <em>See, e.g., Behrendt v. Ahlstrand, </em>264 Minn 10, 13, 19, 118 NW2d 27, 29, 33 (1962) (where plaintiff business invitee slipped on icy patch at defendants\u2019 dairy while \u201cus[ing] the entrance customarily used by all drivers,\u201d and the defendants asserted that the plaintiff should have taken an alternative route to avoid the icy condition, the plaintiff did not bear the burden of \u201cestablishing the impracticability or impossibility of using\u201d other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>routes; rather, \u201cthe burden of proving the favorability of a safer route of travel\u201d was on the defendants).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The trial court\u2019s second rationale, which depends on plaintiffs recognition and appreciation of the hazards presented, also implicates disputed issues of material fact. As defendants emphasize, plaintiff acknowledged that the steps looked \u201cvery slick,\u201d and that he attempted to be \u201cexceedingly cautious\u201d as he used the steps. At the same time, however, plaintiff also testified in his deposition \u201cthat everything! ] [was] fine. I mean it looked good, looked like I could do it, so that\u2019s the attempt that I made.\u201d Given the latter testimony, there is a disputed issue of fact as to whether plaintiff had such an appreciation of the danger presented that there was, as the trial court concluded, \u201cno causal connection\u201d between plaintiffs injury and \u201cdefendants\u2019 failure to either discover the danger or to provide warning of it.\u201d <em>See generally Shum v. Venell, </em>273 Or 143, 157, 539 P2d 1085 (1975) (\u201c \u2018There is a difference between seeing something in the roadway and realizing that danger was likely to result therefrom.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Kehm v.

However, as a legal and practical matter, our analysis and conclusion would be the same if plaintiff had been one of a succession of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d delivery persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> Given, that conclusion, we avoid the incongruities that could arise if a longtime parcel delivery person\u2019s status were deemed to vary depending on whether the homeowners had ordered the item or someone else had ordered the item for them. Under such a construct, the status of a delivery person who had delivered dozens or hundreds of parcels to the same residence could vary day-to-day and parcel-to-parcel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> That proposition is, at least, problematic where, as here, the unsafe condition remained freely accessible to visitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> We note, further, that the summary judgment record here also discloses a disputed issue of fact as to whether, at the time of his injury, plaintiff was aware of the existence and availability of the second set of steps. Although plaintiff had often previously left packages on defendants\u2019 porch, which could support an inference of awareness of the second set of steps, there is no direct evidence that he knew of those steps, including evidence that he had ever used them. Moreover, from the photographs submitted by defendants, it is by no means obvious that a person approaching the porch as plaintiff did would necessarily have seen the second set of steps.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
