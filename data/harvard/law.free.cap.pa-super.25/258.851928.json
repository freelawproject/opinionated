Marpelandthe Episcopal Foreign Methodist Missionary Society, to be paid over to them as soon as circumstances will permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that since she has survived the testator, and also the widow who was life tenant, and since she has had issue which survived them and still survives, she has taken an estate in fee simple. It is stated that this was the view taken by the court below, and it seems clear to us that this interpretation effectuates the intention of the testator and is amply sustained by the authorities cited in the appellee\u2019s brief. It follows that the court was right in giving judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
