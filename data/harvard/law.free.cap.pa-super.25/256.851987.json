This motion must be sustained. The decree as to the execution and delivery of the deed is conditioned upon the confirmation of the sale, thus showing that something remains to be done before the power of the orphans\u2019 court will be exhausted, and the decree become final. See Titusville Oil Exchange\u2019s Dissolution, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 496, and case there cited; also Eckfeldt\u2019s Appeal, 13 Pa. 171; Palethorp\u2019s Est., 160 Pa. 316; Starr\u2019s Est., 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 212; In re Garvey\u2019s Lunacy, 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">The appeal is quashed, the costs thereof to be paid by the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
