Therefore an appeal will not lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">It is very clear that, when the appeal was taken, there was nothing from which to appeal. No judgment had been entered and, as none could be entered under the order of the court until the jury fee was paid, that order cannot be regarded as a final decree or judgment from which an appeal would lie. See Kimmel v. Johnson, 18 Pa. Superior Ct. 429, and Dorscheimer\u2019s Estate, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The appeal being premature, the motion to quash must avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
