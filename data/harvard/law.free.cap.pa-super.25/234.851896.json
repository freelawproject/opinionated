Proceedings in partition were had under which said land on February 1,1869, was awarded by the orphans\u2019 court to Susan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Hamilton, who on same day entered into recognizance with David Smith as surety in the sum of $22,000, conditioned to pay the owelty and \u201c pay to Sarah Hamilton, widow of said decedent the interest or $3,690.66 \u201d and at her death shall pay the principal thereof to the heirs of said deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">Susan Hamilton died, leaving no husband or issue seized in fee of said land, and on April 28,1869, letters of administration on her estate were granted by the register to Hon. Jeremiah Lyons to whom an order of sale to sell said real estate was by the court awarded to pay the debts of said decedent, in which decree is contained. \u201c The sum of $3,690.66 to remain in the property as dower, the interest whereof to be paid Susan Hamilton,\u201d and at her death the. principal to be paid to the -heirs of Samuel Hamilton, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">David Smith, the aforenamed surety, became the purchaser of said land, sale thereof being confirmed to him on September 11,1869, at the price of $9,200, under terms of the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">The estate of Susan Hamilton was insolvent and David Smith, the surety upon the recognizance, was compelled to pay on the owelty deficiency the sum of $1,100, the date of which payment does not appear, but presumably about 1870 or 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-9\">On May 6,1870, David Smith sold and conveyed the same premises to John R. Van Ormer by deed duly recorded, which said deed contains, inter alia, \u201csubject, however, to a recognizance for the sum of $3,690.66, in favor of Sarah Hamilton dated February 1,1869, and entered in orphans\u2019 court docket E, 586, in register\u2019s office of Mifflintown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">John R. Van Ormer died March 20,1890, intestate, seized of said land, partition was had thereon, there being no acceptance by heirs the said real estate was sold under order of the orphans\u2019 court to Isaac Witmer \u201c subject to a dower principal and interest in favor of Sarah Hamilton, widow and parties legally entitled thereto, as set forth in recognizance in orphans\u2019 court, etc., said principal being $3,690.66,\u201d which sale was confirmed. The purchaser entered recognizance which provided that \u201cthe said Isaac Witmer shall pay the amount of said dower recognizance (recorded in orphans\u2019 court docket E, 586), to wit: the sum of $3,690.66 to the parties found to be legally entitled hereto at and immediately after the death of Sarah Hamilton, now Sarah Wetzler. Said widow Sarah Wetzler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>died March 19, 1902, when shortly thereafter Isaac Witmer paid out the four fifths of said sum of $3,690.66 to the four surviving heirs of Samuel Hamilton, deceased, and under permission the remaining one fifth, to wit: the sum of $738.13, was paid into court pending the determination of the right to said sum by the parties claiming it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\">David Smith, surety on the recognizance of Susan Hamilton, and purchaser of the real estate, died testate, and in his will it is contained inter alia: \u201cI will and bequeath to John R. Van Ormer my interest which I hold against Susan Hamilton, that is to say, her interest in the dower. And Mary, his wife, to be charged with that amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">The heirs of John R. Van Ormer, who was legatee of David Smith, now claims this fund or sum of $738.13, because David Smith as surety on the recognizance of Susan Hamilton was required to pay on said recognizance to the other heirs of Samuel Hamilton, deceased, more than the amount of this fund and that such payment was an extinguishment of any right that the heirs of Susan Hamilton could hold through her and that there was nothing due her at the death of her mother, because David Smith, by payments as surety, was by operation of law substituted to any rights which Susan Hamilton or her heirs would have therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">The heirs of Susan Hamilton, to wit: her brother John and sisters, Frances, Margaret and Mary, contend that they are the sole heirs of Susan Hamilton, that when the decree in partition placing title to land in Susan Hamilton was made, her interest or share in the dower fund merged in the title, and that when the property was sold by her administrator subject to the sum of $3,696.66, \u201cthe principal at which at death of Samuel Hamilton\u2019s widow was to be paid to the heirs of Samuel Hamilton, deceased,\u201d there were only the four heirs last above named, who are now claiming this fund and that therefore these parties are thereto entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">The court directed the fund to be paid in accordance with the prayer of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-9\"><em>J, Howard </em>Neely, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANk\">The right of an accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>heir in partition to participate in the dower charge merges in his title to the land: Baldwin v.

But in equity he may keep it in force, and it will be preserved or extinguished in accordance with the equities involved: Pennock v. Eagles, 102 Pa. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">In the present case the vesting of the estate in Susan Hamilton, the creation of the charge thereon, and the engagement of David Smith as surety for the payment of that charge were simultaneous. In consequence of the insolvency of Susan Hamilton, her share of the purchase money payable in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>year was practically sunk, and the surety was obliged also to pay $1,110 to make good the shares of the other heirs. Had her interest alone been involved in the proceedings, her share of the deferred payment would have merged, in the absence of any act or agreement of the parties manifesting a different intent. Nothing of this kind appears. On the contrary, everything bearing on the point indicates a purpose to keep alive her interests in the deferred payment. The recognizance of Susan Hamilton and David Smith, while requiring payment to the other four heirs of Samuel Hamilton, by name, of their shares.of the money payable in one year, provided 'for payment \u201c to the heirs of the decedent,\u201d upon the death of his widow, of $8,690.66 (one third of the purchase price), one fifth of which represented the interest of Susan Hamilton. The same provision was continued through the subsequent changes of title, in the hands of the last purchaser, payable \u201c to the heirs of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The contention of the appellants that the interest of Susan Hamilton in the deferred payment merged in the fee, if tenable, really proves too much. If it merged, the merger took effect against them as well as against her and those claiming under her, and left nothing for them to claim. The only basis for this demand is that there was no merger. They cannot claim the money in controversy as heirs of Samuel Hamilton, for without it they have received their full shares of his estate, and if there has been no merger it belongs to Susan Hamilton\u2019s estate. Nor, upon their own contention, can they claim as next of kin to Susan Hamilton, for they assert a merger that extinguished her interest in it. And any claim they may have as next of kin is subject to the paramount right of the surety to subrogation. Since the money is now in the hands of the appellee, there has clearly been no merger in fact. As this result has been reached and the surety has the primary claim on the fund, Susan Hamilton\u2019s interest in the deferred payment, as an heir of Samuel Hamilton, must be regarded as having, in equity, been preserved for his benefit. Hence the money must be awarded to his legatee. Though the surety\u2019s right originated in his engagement, right of action on it did not accrue until the death of Samuel Hamilton\u2019s widow, when the money became payable. It was debitum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>in praesenti, solvendmn in futuro. Therefore the claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Henderson, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
