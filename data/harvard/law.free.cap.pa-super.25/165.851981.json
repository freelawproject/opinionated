The affidavits further stated that the distinctive variety of the trees would be .exclusively known to the seller, that there was prompt notice of the defect, that plaintiffs requested defendant to leave the trees standing for another season to see if they would not do better, and that after that season defendant cut them down as worthless. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit of defense was sufficient to prevent judgment, that defendant was entitled to a trial, and that the question of the measure of damages could only be determined at the trial.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b199-6\">Argued November 18, 1903.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxB6\">Appeal, No. 124, Oct.

The. affidavit set forth the number and kind of trees ordered, and continued as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">Of the trees that were ordered the variety known as Foxe\u2019s Seedlings, to the extent of 275 trees, were not furnished with the exception of five or six of said variety, but in their place and stead, the plaintiffs furnished to the defendant, without his knowledge or consent, other and a different variety of trees than those purchased (and known as Foxe\u2019s Seedlings), which other and different trees proved to be comparatively worthless, and the defendant has suffered damage and loss by reason of said plaintiffs failing to perform their contract, to the extent of $600. The defendant relied wholly upon the promises and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>representations of the plaintiffs as to the kind and variety of trees which they furnished him, inasmuch as it was impossible for him, the defendant, to know until the trees came into bearing, what were their kinds and varieties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">A supplemental affidavit of defense was in part as follows: '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">Said Rakestraw thereupon expressly agreed and guaranteed to furnish defendant the specific kind or variety of trees that he ordered; and defendant, gave the order for peach trees as set out in the original affidavit filed, relying wholly and solely upon the said representations and guarantee of plaintiffs, inasmuch as it was impossible for him, the defendant, to know, until the trees came pnto bearing, of what varieties the said peach trees consisted. Defendant having had a large experience in the'growing of peaches, knew the varieties of the same which were most profitable and included in his said order the varieties which were most profitable, of all of which facts the plaintiffs were then and there fully cognizant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The trees were planted by said defendant upon his farm shortly after they were delivered by plaintiffs, in the spring of 1898. The 275 peach trees that were purchased as Foxe\u2019s Seedlings, and which were so labeled by plaintiffs when delivered by them, proved, with the exception of five or six, to be another and a comparatively worthless variety. In the fruit bearing season of 1901, to wit: in September, when defendant was first able to determine conclusively that the peaches in question were not Foxe\u2019s Seedlings, he showed some samples of said peaches to plaintiffs, and notified them of said fact, and invited them to go and see the trees themselves, which they did not do. In the spring of 1902 defendant again called on plaintiffs to endeavor to come to some settlement with them, on which occasion defendant stated to them that he intended cutting said trees down, as being comparatively worthless, whereupon said Rakestraw told him to leave them standing for another season to see if they would not do better, in consequence whereof defendant left said trees standing until another peach bearing season had passed, and the defendant having been further satisfied of the worthlessness of said trees has. cut them down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">By reason of said facts, the. defendant suffered loss and damage as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The 5 or 6 true Foxe\u2019s Seedling trees bore during the seasons of 1900 and 1901 about J basket per tree, the market price of which was $.80 per basket; 275 Foxe\u2019s Seedlings would therefore have brought in 1900,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-15\">$110.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-3\"><em>do. do. do. do. </em>do. in 1901,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-16\">110.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">During the season of 1902, said 5 or 6 true Foxe\u2019s Seedling trees bore about 2 baskets per tree, at a market price of $1.00 per basket; 175 Foxe\u2019s Seedlings would therefore have brought in 1902,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-17\">550.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">Total,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-18\">$770.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">From this deduct price actually received from the 270 wrong trees (about 5 baskets in 1900, 10 in 1901, and 150 in 1902, total, 165 baskets at market price of <em>62% </em>cts. per basket),</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ani\">$108.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">Also deduct price received from the 5 or 6 true Foxe\u2019s Seedling trees ($4.00 in 1900, $4.00 in 1901, and $10 in 1092),</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxL\">18.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">Also deduct approximate cost for picking, etc.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvS\">$49.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">$170.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-10\">Total loss, $600.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-11\">Defendant therefore claims said amount of loss as a set-off to plaintiff\u2019s claim, as alleged in his original affidavit filed, and will ask to recover a verdict of the difference, between $600 and the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-12\">The court discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-13\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-14\"><em>George B. </em>Johnson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6M\">Where the article has not been returned, the measure of damages ordinarily is the difference between the value of the article delivered and the value of the article agreed to be delivered, at the time and place of delivery: Seigworth v.

There was as prompt a notice of the defense as could have been given, and the plaintiffs\u2019 request \u201c to leave them standing for another season to see if they would not do better \u201d was in their interest as much as the defendant\u2019s. The defendant wanted trees of a specified kind, these he had a right to have before being obliged to pay, and these the plaintiffs agreed to furnish. The controverted facts are set out with sufficient precision to pass the case to a jury for its determination. The measure of damages need not be passed upon as the case is now presented, inasmuch as the rule for which the plaintiffs contend is not applicable under the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>disclosed by the record. The mere difference in market value of young fruit trees, without considering loss of time, use of land, and other elements, would not be the true guage to determine the damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">It is urged that the damages claimed are too uncertain, remote and speculative to be definitely compensated, and cannot be considered. Taking the affidavits together, the necessary inference is that the plaintiffs knowingly failed to furnish the kind and quality of trees required by the contract. The fact that some of' them grew and were true to name might tend to minimize the amount of damages sustained, and might reasonably furnish a standard of value of the whole orchard if all. the trees had been of like kind, but this would depend upon other items of proof not necessary to consider here.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Many authorities might be cited which hold that the damages claimed as a set-off must be direct and capable of being ascertained by some known legal standard, such as are the natural, necessary and immediate result of, and directly traceable to the breach; such as might be properly deemed to have been stipulated for and in contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into; and such as may be ascertained with approximate' accuracy. See Wade v. Haycock, 25 Pa. 382; Adams Express Co. v. Egbert, 36 Pa. 360; Fleming v. Beck, 48 Pa. 309; Wolf v. Studebaker, 65 Pa. 462; Kinports v. Breon, 193 Pa. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">As stated in Andrews v. Blue Ridge Packing Co., 206 Pa. 370, \u201c an affidavit of defense should set forth fully and fairly facts sufficient to show prima facie a good defense, and if it fails to do so, either from omission of essential facts, or manifest evasiveness in the mode of statements, it will be insufficient to prevent judgment. But if not deficient in either of these respects, and on its face fairly setting forth a prima facie defense, it is not to be subjected to as close a technical examination as if it was a special plea demurred to. Its office is to prevent a summary judgment, and for that purpose a showing of a defense with certainty to common intent is sufficient.\u201d The only question before us is the sufficiency of the affidavits, and it is not necessary to point out in advance the rule by which the damages should be measured ; that ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tion will arise on the trial of the case, and will depend upon the evidence produced in support of the defendant\u2019s contention. See Dixon-Woods &amp; Co. v. Phillips Glass Co., 169 Pa. 167; Miller v. Wilkes-Barre Gas Co., 206 Pa. 254; Wallace v. Penna. R. R. Co., 52 L. R. A. 33, and notes; Wells v. National Life Association, 53 L. R. A. 33, and notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">For reasons above given defendant is entitled to atrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
