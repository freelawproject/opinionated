The fact that the fund may be classified as a mutual or co-operative company, or the fact that membership in the fund is limited to members of the association, and that it does not undertake to insure outsiders, does not operate to exempt the instant case from the operation of the Insurance Law. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Alley, </em>96 Miss. 720; <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn., </em>155 N.

Wolf son </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab6\">A contract of insurance contemplates a contractual obligation on the part of the insurer and an assumption of risk of loss by the insurer. Both of these factors are non-existent under the facts in the case at bar. <em>(Brownell </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>239 N. Y. 369; <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>71 Misc. Rep. 422.) The operation of the plate glass fund does not constitute the engaging in the business of insurance. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>16 N. Y. 310; <em>People ex rel.

St. 636; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Hamblin, </em>162 Mo. App. 242.) The operation of the fund is not violative of the public policy of the State as manifested by legislative enactment or otherwise. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gillson, </em>109 N.

Laws, ch. 28). The judgment of conviction was reversed by the Appellate Division on questions of law. Whether the defendant \u201c engaged in the business of insurance \u201d within the intendment of the statute is the single question to be determined upon the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Manhattan &amp; Bronx Retail Grocers\u2019 Association is a domestic membership corporation. It maintains a so-called \u201c Plate Glass Fund \u201d for members only which is administered by the defendant as its secretary. He serves without compensation. Any member may pay a certain sum of money annually into the fund, \u201c according to the amount of glass he wishes protected.\u201d As many as thirty members contributed thereto at <em>\u201ca </em>definite rate per square foot.\u201d They <em>\u201c </em>paid pro-rata for their glass to be replaced in case of breakage.\u201d (See Insurance Law, \u00a7 70, subd. 6.) All understood that should the fund become exhausted at any time it \u201c would automatically close up,\u201d and that there were to be \u201c no assessments or anything in the event the money would be used up.\u201d The aggregate of contributions at all times exceeded anticipated payments. \u201cAt the end of the year, after a saving of about sixty per cent, fifty per cent is paid back to the members, maybe ten per cent is kept as a reserve for next year.\u201d Each contributor received a \u201c certificate of membership \u201d attesting that he had deposited a stated sum with the secretary. It was therein asserted that, \u201c The fund is not an insurance or indemnity company, nor does it take insurance risks or issue insurance policies.\u201d This recital was followed by a \u201c Description of Glass \u201d by \u201c size \u201d and \u201c location.\u201d On the instrument received in evidence as a specimen appears the phrase, \u201c Balance sheet glass not covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>We think the evidence established the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">This fund was a device whereby the contributors, through a chain of reciprocal agreements, undertook to insure each other at cost. In its essentials it was \u201c that system whereby individuals, partnerships, or corporations engaged in a similar line of business undertake to indemnify each other against a certain kind or kinds of losses by means of a mutual exchange of insurance contracts, usually through the medium of a common attorney in fact appointed for that purpose by each of the underwriters, under agreements whereby each member separately becomes both an insured and an insurer with several liability only.\u201d (G. J. Couch, Reciprocal or Inter-insurance, 94 A. L. R. p. 836.) What is in substance a contract of insurance cannot be changed into something else by giving it another name. <em>(Trustees of First Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., </em>19 N. Y. 305; 28 N. Y. 153,161; <em>First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>National Surely Co., </em>228 N. Y. 469, 472.) Inter-insurers are within the statute (Insurance Law, art. 10). The prohibition against engaging in the business of insurance without the prescribed authority is absolute. (Id. \u00a7 54.) Since it is conceded that the defendant was not so authorized he was validly convicted. (Id. \u00a7 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>Colaizzi </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co. </em>(208 N. Y. 275) is here beside the mark. There the parties were employer and employee and the relief benefits secured to the latter were but the incidents of the contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of the Court of Special Sessions affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Crane, Ch. J., O\u2019Brien, Hubbs, Pinch and Rippey, JJ., concur; Lehman, J., dissents and votes to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
