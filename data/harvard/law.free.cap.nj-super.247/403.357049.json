Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-10a, a victim\u2019s consent may also be considered a defense to forceful sexual assault by negating the force element or by precluding the harm sought to be prevented by the statute. <em>See State in the Interest of M.T.S., </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 259, 588 A.2d 1282, 1284 (App.Div.1991). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-10c provides, however, that a victim\u2019s \u201cassent\u201d is not \u201cconsent\u201d if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">(2) [i]t is given by a person who by reason of ... mental ... defect ... is manifestly unable or known by the actor to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature of the harmfulness of the conduct charged ...; or (3) [i]t is induced by force, duress or deception of a kind sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">While lack of consent and force may not be co-extensive terms, CANNEL, CRIMINAL CODE ANNOTATED, <em>Comment N.

PROBABLE CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We have detailed the elements of the crimes before examining the judge\u2019s finding that probable cause had not been established as to any of the offenses involving force or coercion, but that probable cause had been established to believe all of the crimes, including conspiracy, had been committed knowingly against a mentally defective person.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Probable cause is \u201ca well-grounded suspicion or belief that an offense [has taken] place and the individual [was] party to it.\u201d <em>State in the Interest of A.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 286, 556 A.2d 1283 (App.Div.1989) (citing <em>State v. DeSimone, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>319, 322, 288 A.2d 849 (1972)). While \u201cthe suspicion of guilt must be something more than a raw, unsupported suspicion, it may be something less than the proof needed to convict.\u201d <em>A.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286, 556 A.2d 1283. The probable cause phase of a waiver hearing is a preliminary proceeding. <em>State in the Interest of J.L.W., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 346, 565 A.2d 1106 (App.Div.1989). Probable cause may be established on the basis of hearsay evidence alone, because a probable cause hearing \u201cdoes not have the finality of trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 344, 346, 565 A.2d 1106, and \u201cneed not be based solely on evidence admissible in the courtroom.\u201d <em>A.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286, 556 A.2d 1283. In such proceedings, the judge does not act as a trier of fact to determine guilt or innocence. <em>State in the Interest of A.T., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 227-228, 584 A.2d 861 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">1. FORCE OR COERCION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In support of the motion judge\u2019s ruling that there was no probable cause for a finding of force, respondents rely on <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 527 A.2d 834 (1987), the seminal case on the standard of review concerning Family Part decisions to waive jurisdiction to the adult court. There the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>said that a reviewing court may only reverse the action of the trial court upon a finding that the action was not grounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence, that correct legal principles were not applied, or that the judgment shocks the judicial conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">That standard, however, did not primarily concern probable cause. In <em>R.G.D. </em>the Supreme Court found probable cause to have existed to believe that two juveniles acting together had been guilty of aggravated sexual assault by force or coercion, despite considerable contrary evidence. <em>R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 16, 527 <em>A.</em>2d 834. Such contrary evidence included proof that the victim had voluntarily accompanied the boys to a not very secluded place within their school, and \u201conce there and after sexual advances had been made, she not only remained but moved twice to get away from others [strangers] who came into the auditorium.\u201d <em>State v. R.G.D., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 391, 506 A.2d 36 (App.Div.1986), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, 527 A.2d 834 (1987). We review the record in this case with R.G.D.\u2019s instructions in mind, that probable cause requires far less than a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 16, 527 A.2d 834. Moreover, because the probable cause evidence in the case was hearsay, we are free to reexamine it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">M.G. was 17 years old at the time of the incident. She was classified as educably mentally retarded, with an overall I.Q. of 64, a verbal I.Q. of 70 and a performance I.Q. of 59.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She was a lifelong special education student. Medically, she was classified as neurologically impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The State\u2019s only witnesses concerning probable cause were two detectives who testified to various statements. The first statement came from the school swimming teacher that on March 3, 1989, M.G. had told her that she had been to \u201ca party and there were ten guys there\u201d and \u201csomething happened.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The next day M.G. elaborated to the teacher, that \u201cthe boys asked me to suck their dicks,\u201d and that \u201cit really hurt me because they stuck something really big up my butt and it hurt.\u201d At first M.G. could not remember what the \u201csomething\u201d was called, but later called it a \u201cdrumstick.\u201d The statement went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Then they asked me how many fingers I could put up myself. I told them I don\u2019t do that. They said yes I do and wanted me to show them. I don\u2019t know what to do. They said they would not be my friends if I didn\u2019t. They said if I tell anyone I would have to leave ... like I had to leave my other school. I love [my school] and I don\u2019t want to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The swimming teacher reported the incident to the school social worker, who gave another statement to the police. Separately, a vice-principal reported a story from a child-study meeting in which a student had been heard talking about what appeared to be the same incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">At this point the police juvenile officer (one of the State\u2019s witnesses) was contacted. An extensive investigation ensued, beginning with a March 27, 1989 oral statement by M.G. to the police, which was memorialized in an April 7, 1989 written statement. The detective said that several statements had to be taken because M.G. was subject to many distractions and was difficult to speak to, becoming irritable over time, and backing off when it appeared she was getting someone in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In evidence were four written statements M.G. gave to the police, describing that she was approached by respondent juvenile C.A. and enticed into a basement because she liked respondent juvenile P.A. who was there. In the basement, she found a group of boys whom she knew for \u201cat least six years,\u201d including respondents. M.G. said that she was in that basement for about an hour. M.G.\u2019s April 7 statement reflects the following: M.G. said respondent juvenile B.G. asked her to \u201csuck his dick.\u201d When she refused, \u201che forced me by grabbing the back of my head and forcing it down.\u201d K.S. (one of the adults) said, \u201clet\u2019s play a joke [illegible] on her.\u201d He got a bat and broom, put a plastic bag and vaseline on each. C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>proceeded to insert the broomstick into M.G.\u2019s vagina. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d then K.S. \u201cput the bat up my vagina. It hurt.\u201d Others encouraged the conduct, yelling, \u201c[p]ut it up further.\u201d M.G. said her clothes were removed, and that some of the boys who were there in the beginning left- while the penetration was taking place. When M.G. left, she went to a friend\u2019s house. She was embarrassed and scared to tell her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In a May 5, 1989 statement M.G. added the names of others to the list of boys present. She then said that, although she performed fellatio on B.G. and her head was pushed down, she also was asked to masturbate him, saying, \u201cThis I did. I wasn\u2019t forced. While I was performing oral sex on [B.G.], [C.A., K.S., P.A.] were saying how far can you go &amp; if I swallowed cum [sic].\u201d She said that C.A. inserted the broomstick before the bat, while he and K.S. both laughed, and \u201c[K.S.] put the bat into my vagina, it was a regular size bat. He forced my legs open, saying how far could I go in.\u201d He was laughing. P.A., along with others, was just watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In a May 18, 1989 statement, M.G. said that before the fellatio, B.G. and C.A. asked her how many fingers she could insert into her vagina. She inserted five fingers while the boys cheered her on. When asked if she was forced to do this, her answer was \u201cno.\u201d She also described other sexual activity which she said she was not forced into doing, which did not include the fellatio or the bat and broomstick penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In her fourth and final August 3, 1989 statement to the police, there was the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[M.G.], during the interview yesterday which took place in our office, you stated that there were additional acts forced done upon you March 1st 1989, at the ... house. Tell me about them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">M.G. (or someone) had crossed out the word, \u201cforced\u201d and inserted the word \u201cdone.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this statement, M.G. said that after \u201cthey used the bat &amp; broomstick,\u201d R.C. \u201cput a stick up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>my vagina. It hurt. I told him that it hurt but he didn\u2019t stop. He was asking me if it made me feel good. Everyone was laughing.\u201d No vaseline had been used on this occasion because M.G. was going to take the stick home and the boys did not want the stick to smell. \u201cThe stick hurt because it was up me further than the bat and broomstick.\u201d This was followed by several instances of M.G.\u2019s masturbating the boys, including P.A., at their instigation, before M.G. was told to \u201ckeep this a secret, not to tell anybody,\u201d and to \u201churry up <em>&amp; </em>get out of here.\u201d She gave reasons for not mentioning R.C. before, primarily to protect the juvenile officer. She had not previously mentioned the P.A. masturbation because she liked him. M.G. said she had first mentioned these new events at lunch with the juvenile officer the preceding day.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In the course of the investigation the police took statements from others at M.G.\u2019s school, ultimately concluding that there were originally no fewer than 13 young men in the basement. One statement was given by the student whose remarks right after the incident had been partially responsible for the investigation. There were statements made by other students, including many who claimed to have been present at the beginning, but who left the basement upon seeing M.G. in various forms of undress. The detective testified that the student informant told her that on the day after, \u201ceveryone was talking. [K.S.] said that they used a bat on her. [C.A.] said something but I don\u2019t remember what. Someone said they took a splinter off the bat because they didn\u2019t want to be mean. They were talking about the broomstick but I don\u2019t remember who said what.\u201d His full statement was a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We need not, however, detail the extent of the evidence of probable cause that fellatio, masturbation and the insertion of the bat and broomstick occurred, and that the respondent juveniles were involved. The judge so found. At issue is the judge\u2019s finding that the State had failed to sustain its burden of providing probable cause to demonstrate the element of force or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>On that topic, respondents were permitted to proffer a transcript of conversations between M.G. and a \u201cfriend.\u201d There M.G. said at one point that the \u201cblow job\u201d given B.G. was \u201cexciting.\u201d M.G. gave monosyllabic answers to certain questions upon which respondents relied heavily. Concerning the broomstick, the following was recorded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">[Q]. It didn\u2019t hurt? Did it hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">[A]. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">[Q]. Did it feel like you were having sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">[A], Yea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">At other points M.G. was asked by her inquirer,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">[Q], Did you\u2014did you do the broomstick at all yourself? ... \u201cLike if I wanted to, could I do it? Like did they let you do it yourself?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">To which M.G. replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">[A], You want to do that to yourself (inaudible)? <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">At one point M.G.\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d suggested that M.G. should just \u201ctell the truth.\u201d To which M.G. replied, [A]. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I mean, all the years I knew these kids, I can\u2019t do it. I mean especially [C.A.]. I used to go, I used to go to the soccer league with him.\u201d Elsewhere, M.G. said that she had not lied about respondents, only about R.C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The judge rejected the State\u2019s request that he personally listen to the tapes in order to evaluate its experts\u2019 position that the answers M.G. gave were not spontaneous. While respondents\u2019 expert, Dr. Kern, said these tapes were relevant to the extent of M.G.\u2019s understanding, he described the contents as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d He said they showed sexual naivete and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>sponses to leading questions to which M.G. would be susceptible because of her mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Respecting the allegation of forced fellatio, Dr. Kern testified that because M.G. did not resist and there was no fighting, although her head was pushed down, \u201cin a sense, she allowed it to be pushed down.\u201d He then retracted that statement after having his recollection of M.G.\u2019s first two statements refreshed. He conceded that M.G.\u2019s statement that K.S. put a bat in her vagina, that \u201c[h]e forced my legs open saying, \u2018How far could I go in,\u2019 \u201d indicated force. To redirect and leading questions, Dr. Kern said that counsel\u2019s statement was \u201ccorrect,\u201d that his view that no force was used was \u201cbased on an overall evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The evidence concerning whether M.G. was forced was presented as the antithesis of the evidence that she was defective within the meaning of the statute. If she was vulnerable but not defective, and her vulnerability caused her to accept what was done to her, then she was not forced or coerced. Thus, respondents argued that the State\u2019s expert reports failed to prove that she was defective, but did prove that she was not forced. Accordingly, we examine these reports in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Dr. Susan Esquilin reported that M.G. told her of the fellatio, broomstick and bat insertions in a manner consistent with the statements given to police. M.G. told the doctor she did not want these things to happen, but felt that she was \u201csupposed to do\u201d them. B.G. said that if M.G. did not perform the fellatio, he would tell her mother, and she was afraid that her mother would be told. She also said that fellatio experiences in the past \u201cdidn\u2019t bother her.\u201d M.G. said the doctor would \u201cprobably think I\u2019m sick to let them do that [insert a broom or bat],\u201d but, \u201c[w]hen it was going up me, it felt like a D ... dick ... penis.\u201d M.G. felt bound by a pledge of silence which she did not break until after she heard rumors that the boys must have been talking, but that although she did not want to get \u201canybody in trouble,\u201d she wanted to tell because she \u201cfelt it was important ... it\u2019s serious ... people don\u2019t just do that.\u201d M.G. said her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>prior sexual experiences were different because she had never been faced with a group before and \u201cno one ha[d] ever inserted any objects into her.\u201d The doctor reported that, \u201c[i]t was the use of the baseball bat and the broomstick that made this incident particularly bad in [M.G.\u2019s] eyes.\u201d M.G. told the doctor that following the incident it hurt when she urinated. The doctor noted that M.G. did not understand the meaning of the word \u201cforce\u201d except as physical pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Dr. Esquilin concluded that M.G. was a fairly highly-functioning retarded young adult, but \u201cwilling to do almost anything to gain some modicum of social acceptance,\u201d seeing her own sexuality as a means of pleasing others ...,\u201d and that \u201c[s]he does not seem to have the concept that she should be able to choose what to do with her body sexually and should not be subject to the whims of \u2018friends.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Dr. Gerald Meyerhoff reported that M.G. was in the mildly retarded range, and suffered from a defect which rendered her incapable of understanding the nature of her conduct. He described interviewing those who knew M.G., including a social worker who overheard M.G. shout, loudly, in the middle of the hall, at school, ... \u201cwhy is everybody so upset about this, making such a big deal, it was fun.\u201d As a characteristic of M.G., he said, \u201cshe permits without fleeing, the intrusion of potentially dangerous foreign objects, even though she feels pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In a subsequent report, Meyerhoff said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">I have concluded that... [M.G.] did know her body was being invaded and that she was engaging in sexual conduct. However, ... the special circumstances of 3/1/89 involved such <em>insidious coercion </em>that, owing to her diminished ability to be assertive or exercise the ordinary judgment expected of a nondefective person (who would refuse to comply and who would attempt to flee) [M.G.] was \u2018unable\u2019 to resist. Moreover, <em>as the sexual activity proceeded that day she must have become more and more bewildered. </em>A nondefective person would have, finally, registered alarm, and displayed prudence, and left, or would have attempted to leave. But, <em>[M.G.] did not ultimately \u2018understand,\u2019 that day, that she could refuse to participate. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Dr. Alvin Friedland classified M.G. as \u201chaving a primary attention deficit disorder associated with moderate to severe mental retardation,\u201d \u201csignificant learning deficits,\u201d but driven by her concept of friendship, without regard to repercussions. Dr. Friedland gave a second report, noting that \u201cit is to be understood that [M.G.] is aware that the boys manipulated and mistreated her to force her into sexual activity,\u201d but she also knew \u201cthat these acts were wrong.\u201d Her primary motivation was to be liked by the boys and a fear that she will be blamed if \u201cthey get what they deserve.\u201d He described M.G.\u2019s later ambivalence in minimizing the events as, \u201cshe knew she was manipulated and abused and unconsciously repressed the trauma of the incident.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In his written decision, the judge said that the only evidence concerning force or coercion was M.G.\u2019s initial statement with respect to fellatio, a statement which had been repudiated. We disagree. The testimony was taken sporadically from December 11, 1989, to July 2, 1990, ending with that of Dr. Kern. As Dr. Kern noted, M.G. referred specifically to \u201cforce\u201d in the use of the bat in her May 5 statement, notwithstanding expert opinion concerning her limited understanding of the meaning of the word. We do not find that reference to have been repudiated. Moreover, the record was uncontradicted concerning the insertion of foreign objects held by others, including one respondent. A factual issue was raised that these actions were \u201cphysical force ... applied to the victim\u2019s body.\u201d <em>State v. Queen, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 606, 535 A.2d 539. The judge found, and we agree, that there was probable cause to find that the group acted in concert, which tied that force to all of these respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We have earlier recited some relevant statutory definitions, including that of \u201ccoercion.\u201d M.G. said that there were threats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>to tell her mother. She first said that there were threats that she might be removed from the school. Even in her taped conversations, she characterized the way in which she was persuaded to accompany the boys as being \u201cconned.\u201d Other proof of coercion includes the number of youths in the basement; their use of M.G.\u2019s known attraction to P.A. as enticement, and M.G.\u2019s history of believing in the sanctity of secrets in relation to peer acceptance. Respondents\u2019 conduct demonstrably represented an express and implied threat that if she did not do as they wished, they would harm M.G.\u2019s \u201ccareer ... reputation or personal relationships.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Truth finding is not our function, nor was it that of the motion judge. Although there were conflicts in the record, we find there was enough of a showing concerning coercion respecting all of the charges, including the masturbation incident charged against P.A., to constitute probable cause. <em>R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 15, 527 A.2d 834. Accordingly, we reverse the motion judge\u2019s contrary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">2. MENTAL CAPACITY</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We have discussed some of the testimony concerning M.G.\u2019s mental capacity in the section of this opinion concerning \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cforce.\u201d We now review the remainder of the testimony concerning M.G.\u2019s mental capacity. The judge found probable cause to believe that M.G. was mentally defective under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(5)(b) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3, after reviewing the standards enunciated in <em>State v. Olivio, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 568 A.2d 111 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. granted, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>123, 584 A.2d 200 (1990).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There Judge Antell said that the Legislature had limited \u201cmentally defective\u201d persons to include only those \u201cincapable of <em>understanding </em>the nature of their conduct, <em>i.e., </em>that they are engaged in sexual activity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Id. </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 430, 568 A.2d 111 (emphasis in original). Thus, to be \u201cmentally defective,\u201d a complainant must be one who could not appreciate the inviolability of her person or understand that others could not, without her consent, invade her person for carnal gratification <em>Id. </em>at 430-431, 568 A.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Asked to render an expert opinion on M.G.\u2019s ability legally to consent to sexual conduct in light of <em>Olivio, </em>Dr. Esquilin reported that M.G. \u201cdid and does understand the immediate acts of sexual congress,\u201d but \u201cdid not truly, operationally understand that she had a right to refuse to participate.\u201d In this opinion, Dr. Esquilin also referred to coercion in the events recounted by M.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Dr. Friedland was also called upon to render an evaluation of M.G.\u2019s ability to consent to sexual activity in light of <em>Olivio. </em>It was his conclusion that at the time of the incident, M.G. had a significant mental deficiency, was \u201cmentally deficient\u201d and \u201cdid not have the capacity to say no because she was \u201cmentally defective,\u201d causing her to have poor judgment and making her susceptible to manipulation and control by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Despite the provisions of <em>R. </em>3:4-3, that a probable cause hearing consists of evidence offered by the State, subject to cross-examination, <em>see A.T., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 227 n. 1, 584 A.2d 861, the defense was permitted to proffer Dr. Kern, who had examined the State\u2019s expert reports and M.G.\u2019s statements. He testified that M.G.\u2019s I.Q. was close to the normal range of 70 and, coupled with her relatively high functioning level and ability to understand social behavior and form concepts, M.G. had the ability to consent to sexual acts and to make a determination as to whether sexual acts are right or wrong.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Kern gave M.G.\u2019s mental age to be \u201cabout 8 or 9.\u201d He agreed with the State\u2019s experts that \u201c[M.G.] to some degree ... sees the world through the eyes of a young child who wishes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>please and maintain the affection of those around [her].\u201d He also said that M.G.\u2019s mental condition would make her more compliant and likely to do what was asked of her. He testified that \u201cI think that they [the boys]\u2014they knew that she was different; that she was strange. I think that they must have known that she had a lower intelligence than the average.\u201d (This opinion accorded with other statements in the record.) In his view, because M.G. refused to return to the basement the following day (to be videotaped) and showed reticence with adults but openly discussed sex when questioned by her peer, she was not defective in the <em>Olivio </em>sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Respondents point to the similarities between M.G. and the victim in <em>Olivio, </em>who was sixteen years old and classified as \u201ceducable mentally retarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 568 A.2d 111. The <em>Olivio </em>complainant attended special education classes at a high school, and had an I.Q. in the 60-65 range. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 568 A.2d 111. They suggest that the description of the complainant in <em>Olivio </em>could be equally applied to M.G., that is \u201c[w]hat emerges, certainly, is the picture of a slow-thinking, poorly-functioning individual, but not one without the capacity to understand that she had the right to refuse defendant her favors and that defendant was using her to gratify his own sexual desires.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Respondents also urge that, while the State\u2019s psychological reports concluded that under <em>Olivio, </em>M.G. would be considered mentally defective, these conclusions are inconsistent with many of the facts adduced, as well as with statements by M.G. concerning her sexual conduct. The judge found otherwise, and we agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>We first distinguish <em>Olivio </em>for many of the reasons that we have previously distinguished a probable cause determination from proceedings which require the establishment of a <em>prima facie </em>case. The State properly relied entirely on expert reports to establish its probable cause, as it had a right to do, whereas <em>Olivio </em>followed an appeal from a trial in which a jury had determined that one incident of vaginal intercourse was not the result of force or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Moreover, unlike the circumstances described in <em>Olivio, </em>the evidence presented in this case suggested that, even acknowledging M.G.\u2019s general similarity to the <em>Olivio </em>complainant, probable cause could have been derived from Dr. Meyerhoff\u2019s report concerning M.G.\u2019s becoming \u201ctemporarily\u201d mentally defective in the sexual sense. Dr. Meyerhoff noted the combined and cumulative effect of M.G.\u2019s underlying disability and the progressive sexual requests from seven to thirteen young men after she was enticed into a small space and there surrounded. He characterized these special circumstances as insidious coercion which made her \u201cultimately\u201d unable to resist. Dr. Kern admitted that he did not remember whether he had considered such a temporary condition when he rendered his opinion, although he later said M.G.\u2019s \u201cmental state ... was that way before the incident, during the incident ... [and] the same [today].\u201d Assuming a factual issue on temporary mental defectiveness, the State had no obligation to present its full evidence concerning M.G.\u2019s deficits, nor to prevail in the dispute. The judge\u2019s finding of probable cause to believe that M.G. was mentally defective and that respondents knew or should have known of her vulnerability is amply supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">3. RESPONDENTS\u2019 REMAINING PROBABLE CAUSE POINTS</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The nature of the proceeding also disposes of respondents\u2019 claim that they were denied a variety of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>rights<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by virtue of the trial court\u2019s (1) refusal to issue an order to release grand jury testimony; (2) refusal to allow respondents the opportunity to examine M.G.; (3) refusal to grant an order allowing defense attorneys to speak with Dr. Friedland; (4) decision to admit Bruton<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> testimony; (5) decision to allow testimony from a lay witness regarding how M.G. would be perceived by respondents; and (6) decision to exclude testimony vis-a-vis M.G.\u2019s sexual history. While waiver hearings are \u201ccritically important,\u201d they require only the \u201cprocedural regularity sufficient in the particular circumstances to satisfy the basic requirements of due process and fairness.\u201d <em>R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 4, 5, 527 A.2d 834.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">[C]onstitutional guarantees arising from the question of admissibility of evidence at a trial on the merits do not apply to a preliminary jurisdictional hearing which simply determines whether the accused is to be tried in one court or another. Such a hearing is a preliminary proceeding to determine the propriety of transfer under the statutory criteria. The portion of the hearing relating to probable cause can be analogized to the probable cause hearing prior to indictment or the determination of a grand jury to indict. In either of these instances, rules of evidence and constitutional guarantees involving the trial process are inappropriate. Since the result of a preliminary judicial proceeding as involved herein does not adjudicate the guilt of the accused, the type of permissible evidential material used by the court in reaching its conclusion is not circumscribed by the limited evidential rules applied at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">The demands of due process at such a preliminary stage of the proceedings are no more extensive than to afford the accused a fair hearing where he is represented by counsel and has an opportunity to be heard and present evidence. Such rights are guaranteed in this State with respect to a transfer hearing. Otherwise, the full panoply of [Constitutional] rules and rights guaranteed to defendants ... have no relevancy or application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\"><em>State in the Interest of B.T., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 273, 367 A.2d 887 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif. denied, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>49, 372 A.2d 314 (1977), (citations omitted), cited with approval in <em>R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 16, 527 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>We find no denial of due process in the extended record and the twenty volumes of transcript.

Respondents\u2019 due process arguments are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Clearly also, there is no violation of the principles of double jeopardy in our finding that probable cause was established concerning the charges of force and coercion, given the preliminary nature of these proceedings. <em>See J.L.W., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 346, 565 A.2d 1106 (upon judge\u2019s ruling that the State\u2019s probable cause evidence is insufficient, State may renew motion for waiver with additional evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">B. REHABILITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Upon a finding of probable cause, the court was obliged to make a determination as to whether respondents had been (or could have been with respect to C.A.) rehabilitated by their nineteenth birthdays. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(3). It was respondents\u2019 burden to make the showing, and even if that burden was carried, it was proper for the court to decide whether society\u2019s interest in deterrence for its own protection outweighed the juveniles\u2019 rights. <em>State in the Interest of C.A.H. &amp; B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>326, 338-339, 446 A.2d 93 (1982). After expert psychiatric testimony, the judge issued a second written opinion. We summarize that holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">1) In light of the fact that C.A. had received no therapeutic intervention, and that he was unlikely to receive sufficient therapy in the six months remaining before his nineteenth birthday, he had not been rehabilitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">2) P.A., having been two weeks short of his eighteenth birthday at the time of the incident and beyond nineteen at the time of the rehabilitation hearing, had not been rehabilitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">3) B.G., having had some therapeutic intervention, and having shown signs of remorse, had been rehabilitated. However, since the law also contemplates the need to weigh rehabilitation against the reasons for waiver (i&amp;, deterrence), and since B.G. was a central figure in a serious offense committed two months short of his eighteenth birthday, public interest demanded waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s rulings concerning the absence of probable timely rehabilitation of P.A. and C.A. was supported by credible evidence. The court\u2019s further determination, that the probability of rehabilitation for B.G. did not substantially outweigh the reasons for waiver, was within the appropriate exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion, which was informed by relevant standards. <em>See R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 11, 527 A.2d 834; <em>C.A.H. &amp; B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 333, 446 A.2d 93; <em>A.J., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 284, 556 A.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The order appealed from is reversed in so far as it denied the State\u2019s motion to transfer to the adult courts those charges involving force and coercion and is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-11\">At the time of the hearing, both P.A. and B.G. were nineteen years old.

Were this an assault case involving a lone actor, even if there had been a claim that the actor was aided or abetted by another, I would subscribe to Judge Antell\u2019s analysis of mental defect in <em>State v. Olivio, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 568 A.2d 111 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. granted, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>123, 584 A.2d 200 (1990). In such a less-stressful situation, and applying the <em>Olivio </em>standard, the alleged victim most probably could not have been deemed mentally defective under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(5)(b) or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3a. For all of the reasons stated in <em>Olivio, </em>a contrary finding would cause virtually all sexual activity with a mildly retarded individual to be considered criminal in the eyes, of the law. I cannot read either the current statute or the <em>New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission Report and Commentary </em>upon which our present <em>Code of Criminal Justice </em>was largely based, as intending such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Here, however, testimony concerning the group sex and situational confusion it allegedly engendered in <em>M.G. </em>at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>provided probable cause for a finding that she was \u2018\u2018mentally defective\u201d at the time of the occurrence under review. The statutory definition of \u201cmentally defective\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-lh notes that the defect is sufficient if it renders the victim <em>\u201ctemporarily </em>or permanently incapable of understanding the nature of [her] conduct____\u201d By the use of the term \u201ctemporarily,\u201d the Legislature can be said to have recognized not only a defective state caused by a temporary physical or mental defect (such as an operable brain lesion or a severe temporary depression), but also a situational inability of the victim to cope with a sexual situation. This reason is in accord with Dr. Meyerhoff s opinion, explained in the majority opinion, <em>supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 421, 589 A.2d at 646. Since the focus is upon M.G.\u2019s ability to understand the nature of her conduct, I by no means would find that the court\u2019s conclusions were mandated by the evidence, but only that probable cause was a permissible finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">With this brief explanation, I concur with the balance of the majority opinion in its reversal in part on the issue of force and coercion, and affirmance in part on the issue of sexual relations with a mentally defective person.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
