It claims that the assessment was precluded by the Freeze Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8, and, in any event, constituted an illegal \u201cspot assessment\u201d in violation of <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947) Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, par. 1(a). The Tax Court, in a published opinion, dismissed the complaint, ruling that (1) the \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim was precluded by the taxpayer\u2019s failure to pursue it in a prior action, and (2) the prior Tax Court judgment based on the unilateral withdrawal of a challenge to a prior assessment did not give rise to Freeze Act protection. The facts and procedural history are detailed in the Tax Court opinion, 10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>581 (1989), and need not be repeated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">On appeal from the prior Tax Court proceedings, the Supreme Court held that plaintiff was not entitled to Freeze Act protection for the 1985 assessment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-26 by virtue of a 1983 judgment of the Hudson County Board of Taxation because the previous filing of a complaint in the Tax Court preempted the County Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Union City Associates v. Union City, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>583 (Tax Ct.1986), <em>rev\u2019d </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 538 A.2d 836 (App.Div.1988), <em>rev\u2019d </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>17, 556 A.2d 769 (1989). The Tax Court in this case ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to Freeze Act protection under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8 stemming from its judgment on the appeal from the 1983 assessment because that judgment was entered as a result of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cunilateral withdrawal.\u201d Judge Crab-tree concluded that Tax Court judgments are entitled to Freeze <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Act protection after adjudication or settlement, but not \u201cunilateral withdrawal.\u201d <em>See </em>10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 587-588. As he stated, \u201c[a] Tax Court judgment of withdrawal has none of the attributes of an adjudication on the merits, nor does it reflect the good-faith accommodation of the parties embodied in a settlement stipulation.\u201d 10 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 588. We agree and conclude that the unilateral withdrawal of a complaint, which could occur without the taxing district\u2019s opportunity to be heard on the merits or to state its view as to the propriety of an assessment or settlement, cannot be deemed an adjudication or resolution warranting Freeze Act protection. <em>Cf. South Plainfield v. Kentile Floors, Inc., </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>483, 486-89, 457 A.2d 450 (1983) (application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:2-43 Freeze Act protection to settlement); <em>Newark v. Fischer, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199-200, 84 A.2d 547 (1951) (noting purpose of Freeze Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on Judge Lasser\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>2nd Roc\u2014Jersey Associates v. Morristown Town, </em>11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>45 (Tax Ct.1990), a Freeze Act case involving multiple parcels, does not require a different result. There, \u201cthe withdrawal was a part of a settlement of the complaints.\u201d 11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 54. As Judge Lasser noted in <em>2nd Roc, </em>\u201cit is well accepted that the Freeze Act will apply to a settlement,\u201d 11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 55, which is a negotiated disposition involving the taxing authority,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201c[ojrdinarily a withdrawal will not entitle a taxpayer to an application of the Freeze Act.\u201d 11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 54. <em>See also Purex Corp. v. Paterson, </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>121 (Tax Ct.1986), where the taxpayer unsuccessfully sought to withdraw a complaint. While the withdrawal in <em>Purex </em>was denied, the taxpayer there also sought to maintain its appeal with respect to a related parcel, and the two properties had been treated by the taxpayer as \u201creally one.\u201d 8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 125. <em>Purex, </em>therefore, does not control the ability to unilaterally withdraw an entire controversy. <em>R. </em>8:3-9 requires leave of court for withdrawal of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>complaint only after \u201cthe close of proofs\u201d and can even occur over defendant\u2019s objection, <em>Cherry Hill Tp. v. U.S. Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 261-262, 1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>236, 422 <em>A.</em>2d 810 (Tax Ct.1980). <em>Compare, Clinton Tp. Citizens Committee v. Clinton Tp., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 448 A.2d 526 (Law Div.1982). Thus, the unilateral withdrawal cannot have any preclusive or Freeze Act affect in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Judge Crabtree further concluded that the \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim was precluded by the \u201centire controversy\u201d doctrine as well as the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>We need only address the former and therefore decline to pass on the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It is true, as the taxpayer suggests, that <em>R. </em>8:1 does not expressly or specifically incorporate rules embodied in Part IV of our Rules. Nevertheless, as Judge Pressler has stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAX\">[t]he basic scheme of Part VIII is to conform the practice and procedure of the Tax Court as nearly as possible to that applicable to all other trial courts in the State and yet to retain insofar as possible a high degree of expedition in the initiation, progress and determination of the matters constituting the business of the Court. These rules also are designed to prescribe with particularity the practice of the Tax Court in respect of these procedural considerations unique to it. Thus, to a large extent the rules of Part IV have been incorporated by reference where appropriate. [PRESSLER, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment R<em>. </em>8:1 (1991 ed. at 1393)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Significantly, <em>R. </em>4:1 provides that \u201c[t]he rules in Part IV, insofar as applicable, govern the practice and procedure of civil actions in the ... Tax Court except as otherwise provided in ... Part VIII.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">There is nothing in Part VIII which suggests that <em>R. </em>4:27-1 (joinder of claims) and <em>R. </em>4:30A (entire controversy doctrine) do not apply in the Tax Court. <em>See also R. </em>4:27-2 (joinder of remedies); <em>R. </em>4:5-1. Further, while this matter was decided in the Tax Court long before the non-joinder preclusion of <em>R. </em>4:30A was adopted, our courts have previously recognized that the entire controversy doctrine bars successive litigation of claims with respect to the same parties. <em>See Cogdell by Cogdell v. Hospital Center at Orange, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>7, 17, 560 <em>A.</em>2d 1169 (1989); <em>Crispin v. Volkswagenwerk AG, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>336, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>348-349, 476 A.2d 250 (1984) (Handler, J., concurring); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Gilchrist Brothers, Inc., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556-557, 428 A.2d 1254 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore agree that the entire controversy doctrine precludes this challenge to the 1985 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Finally, plaintiff insists that in the prior action addressed to the 1985 assessment the Tax Court judge ruled that the \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim should be pursued separately from the Freeze Act relief he dismissed. In May, 1986 plaintiff apparently endeavored to amend its complaint in the prior Tax Court action to include a \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim, but as counsel \u201creadily concedefd]\u201d before Judge Crabtree when this matter was argued, \u201cthere was no \u201985 complaint\u201d timely filed challenging the spot assessment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the short answer to plaintiff\u2019s contention is that it never pursued the \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim in a timely fashion in the initial complaint challenging the 1985 assessment, or even by an expeditious new complaint after its 1986 motion was denied or when it appealed the dismissal of the prior Freeze Act claim based on the 1983 Hudson County Tax Board judgment. Had plaintiff challenged the denial of its motion on the appeal, it may well have prevailed and obtained a remand by this court or the Supreme Court in light of the \u201centire controversy\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We recognize that plaintiff has never obtained any review on the merits of the 1985 assessment. However, we are convinced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that the Tax Court was properly concerned in these circumstances with the need for adherence to proper procedural requirements. As plaintiff itself recognized during the first Tax Court case, if it prevailed on one theory the other did not have to be considered. The taxpayer chose not to diligently pursue its \u201cspot assessment\u201d claim on the first challenge. Therefore, we affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by the Tax Court, as supplemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The settlement can include an agreement as to application or lack of impact of the Freeze Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> 77. 4:30A applies to non-joinder of parties as well as claims. <em>Cogdell's </em>non-retroactivity applies to non-joinder of parties, not claims. <em>See </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 560 A.2d 1169.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Pursuant to 7?. 4:5-1, plaintiffs counsel certified in the complaint in this case that \u201cthis is the first pleading in which Plaintiff has attacked the subject assessment for the tax year 1985 as violative of the Constitution.\u201d The complaint and certification were dated January 7, 1986 but were filed January 16, 1987, with proof of service dated January 7, 1987. Because the certification also referred to the opinion in the prior matter which was filed on December 3, 1986, 8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>583, we conclude that this complaint challenging the 1985 assessment was not filed until January, 1987. <em>But see N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-21; 54:51A-9(b); <em>FMC Stores Co. v. Borough of Morris Plains, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>418, 423, 495 A.2d 1313 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
