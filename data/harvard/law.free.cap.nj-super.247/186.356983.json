Appellants had filed an action in the Law Division against Denville claiming that the township\u2019s zoning violated the <em>Mount </em>Laurel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>date that it provide its fair share of low and moderate income housing. The matter was transferred from the Law Division to COAH following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hills Dev. Co. v. Township of Bernards, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>1, 510 A.2d 621 (1986). While Denville\u2019s fair share plan was pending before COAH, appellant Cali Associates moved for a builder\u2019s remedy which COAH denied. Cali appeals from that denial and joins in the arguments raised by the Public Advocate. We have consolidated the appeals for purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The Public Advocate has raised an array of challenges to Denville\u2019s plan. However, the single contention addressed here is that COAH should have rejected Denville\u2019s proposed 201-unit development because the development is made up of all low and moderate income housing units and is \u201cisolated\u201d from other residential communities in Denville. According to the Public Advocate, this component of Denville\u2019s fair share plan will result in a \u201cghetto\u201d of poor people and racial minorities, contrary to the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (FHA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 to -329 state and federal civil rights laws and the federal and New Jersey constitutions. We hold that a development consisting of all <em>Mount Laurel </em>units is sustainable under the FHA. However, we remand to COAH for a determination as to the suitability of the proposed site for <em>Mount Laurel </em>housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Denville, a suburban municipality located in the northcentral section of Morris County, is part of the Northwest Housing Region, consisting of Essex, Morris, Sussex and Union Counties. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-2.1. In 1980, Denville had a population of 14,380. Blacks and Hispanics make up 1.1 percent of the population of the township and 64.1 percent of the low and moderate income households of the region.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">COAH assigned Denville a fair share of 417 units, 31 representing indigenous need and 386 representing the present and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>prospective fair share of the region\u2019s need. Denville\u2019s plan, approved by CO AH, includes a request for a 29-unit credit for rehabilitated units; the construction of 201 rental, low and medium income units on a 40-acre site in Denville; a regional contribution agreement (RCA) with Newark for the construction or rehabilitation of 136 units, an RCA with Boonton for the construction of 38 units, and a rental bonus credit of 13 units.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The 201-unit development, pertinent here, will consist of all low and moderate income units constructed on the \u201cMcGreevy\u201d site, a 40-acre tract purchased by the township. Seventy-five units will be constructed by the Morris County Housing Authority under a $5.4 million grant from the Federal Housing and Urban Development Agency, and 126 rental units by St. Francis Lifecare, Inc. The proposed development will be subject to an \u201coccupancy preference\u201d under which 50 percent of the units are reserved for those who live or work in Denville. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-15.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On appeal, the Public Advocate raises the following points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\"><em>Point </em>I\u2014In determining whether to grant Denville Township\u2019s petition for substantive certification, the Council is obligated to determine not only whether the municipal housing element and fair share plan complies with the Council\u2019s own regulations and policies, but also whether it violates the New Jersey Constitution as construed in the <em>Mt. Laurel </em>decisions, the Fair Housing Act of 1985 and the relevant state and federal civil rights laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\"><em>Point </em>//\u2014By failing to render specific findings of fact and conclusions of law and by failing to grant an evidentiary hearing on controverted issues, the Council violated principles of procedural fairness and due process and the requirements of the Fair Housing Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak0\"><em>Point </em>III\u2014The Council unlawfully approved the housing element and fair share plan submitted by Denville Township which perpetuates exclusionary zoning in violation of the New Jersey Constitution and the Fair Housing Act of 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2N\"><em>Point </em>IV\u2014The housing element and fair share plan submitted by Denville Township constitutes illegal racial discrimination and therefore could not lawfully be approved by the Council on Affordable Housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>A. The plan submitted by Denville Township incorporates criteria for selection of occupants of lower income housing that constitutes unlawful racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">B. The plan submitted by Denville Township incorporates Regional Contribution Agreement between Denville Township and Newark that constitutes unlawful racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">C. The various components of Denville Township\u2019s plan, taken together, have a magnified racially discriminatory effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\"><em>Point </em>V\u2014The Council unlawfully approved the housing element and fair share plan submitted by Denville Township which creates an isolated and insular \u201cghetto\u201d of poor people and racial minorities in violation of the New Jersey Constitution and the Fair Housing Act of 1985 and state and federal civil rights laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\"><em>Point </em>VI\u2014Because it does not provide one housing unit in the receiving municipality for each unit credited to the sending municipality, the proposed Regional Contribution Agreement between Denville and Boonton violates the Fair Housing Act and the New Jersey Constitution and could not lawfully be approved by the Council.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The contentions raised in Points I through IV challenge the \u201cresidency preference\u201d and Newark-RCA components of Den-ville\u2019s plan. We reject the contentions substantially for the reasons expressed in our opinion in <em>In re Petition for Substantive Certification filed by the Township of Warren, </em>247 <em>N.J Super. </em>146, 588 A.2d 1227 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">In Point V, the Public Advocate argues that Denville\u2019s \u201c100-percent lower income project to be located [on] a single 40-acre site,\u201d which is \u201cisolated\u201d from other residential developments, will result in an \u201cinsular enclave of poor people and racial minorities.\u201d The Public Advocate asserts that if the occupants of the development \u201cfairly reflect\u201d the racial makeup of the low and moderate income population of the region, the development will have a population that is 64.1 percent black and Hispanic. Such a development, it is argued, is contrary to \u201csound regional planning\u201d and in violation of state and federal civil rights laws and the federal and New Jersey constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">We do not agree with the Public Advocate that COAH was required to reject Denville\u2019s proposal because of the poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tial for an undue concentration of minorities. The <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine was conceived in order to dismantle economic barriers resulting from exclusionary zoning, which effectively deprived the poor of realistic housing opportunity. <em>Mount Laurel I, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 173-87, 336 <em>A.</em>2d 713. In order to \u201cput some steel\u201d into that doctrine, the court in <em>Mount Laurel II </em>devised a mechanism to enforce each municipality\u2019s constitutional obligation to provide \u201ca realistic opportunity for the construction of its fair share of the present and prospective regional need for low and moderate income housing.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 200, 205, 456 <em>A.</em>2d 390. Thus, the doctrine\u2019s primary focus is to cure economic discrimination, not to assure that the cure results in economic or racial balance. In accomplishing that mission, <em>Mount Laurel </em>is essentially race-neutral.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The FHA, the legislative response to the <em>Mount Laurel </em>problem, carries out the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-301 to -329. Under the FHA, COAH is empowered to create a regulatory scheme by which it determines whether a municipality\u2019s proposed housing element creates a realistic opportunity for the construction of affordable housing, consistent with its constitutional obligation. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-302, -303, -307. Thus, COAH\u2019s primary focus is not on the racial makeup of the probable occupants of <em>Mount Laurel </em>housing, but whether the plan adheres to sound regional planning and satisfies the constitutional obligation \u201cenunciated by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In any event for the reasons expressed in our opinion in <em>In re Petition for Substantive Certification filed by the Township of Warren, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 165-170, 588 A.2d at 1237-1239, we reject the Public Advocate\u2019s assertion that Denville\u2019s plan violates the equal protection clauses of the federal and New Jersey constitutions, the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, and the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3601 to 3631. There is no showing here of a discriminatory intent in Denville\u2019s scheme, thus foreclosing any finding that there has been a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5. <em>See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>252, 264-65, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>555, 562-63, 50 L.Ed.2d 450, 463-64 (1977); <em>Taxpayers Ass\u2019n of Weymouth Tp. v. Weymouth Tp., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>249, 285 (1976), (reprinted in corrected form at 80 <em>N.J. </em>6, 364 A.2d 1016), <em>appeal dismissed </em>and <em>cert. den. </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>977, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1672, 52 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>373 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The argument that the Fair Housing Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3601 to 3631, will be violated if the proposed development is approved must also be rejected. The Public Advocate\u2019s argument that the development will result in a \u201cghetto\u201d of racial minorities is at best speculative. There simply is no basis to conclude that since 64.1 percent of the region\u2019s low and moderate income families are minorities, Denville\u2019s development will contain a similar percentage of minorities. Denville has a 1.1 percent black and Hispanic population. The limited experience to date has demonstrated that most residents of <em>Mount Laurel </em>housing come from the same or nearby municipalities. See Lamar, Mallach &amp; Payne, <em>Mount Laurel at Work: Affordable Housing in New Jersey, 1983-1988, </em>41 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>1197, 1257 (1989). It therefore seems highly doubtful that the Public Advocate\u2019s hypothesized percentage of minority households that will reside in the development will be a reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Moreover, even if a prima facie case of discriminatory effect is established, we are satisfied that COAH\u2019s approval of the plan advances a legitimate governmental interest and \u201cno alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.\u201d <em>In re Petition for Substantive Certification filed by the Township of Warren, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 169, 588 A.2d at 1239 (quoting <em>Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, </em>844 <em>F.2d </em>926, 936 (2d Cir.), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>15, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>276, 102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>180 (1988)). A development of all <em>Mount Laurel </em>units clearly best serves the governmental interest and advances the statutory purpose of providing affordable housing to the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">' A municipality, in satisfying its allocated share, may submit \u00e1 housing element and fair share plan to COAH and petition for substantive certification. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-313. The FHA provides COAH with broad powers, including the power to grant or deny substantive certification in a \u201cmultitude of ways\u201d in order to achieve statewide compliance with the <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation. <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Tp., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>234, 245, 576 A.2d 819 (1990) (quoting <em>Hills Dev. Co. v. Township of Bernards, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 56, 510 A.2d 621). A COAH-certified plan is accorded presumptive validity in exclusionary zoning cases against the municipality. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-317a. COAH\u2019s exercise of statutorily delegated responsibility \u201cis accorded a strong presumption of validity and reasonableness,\u201d <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Tp., supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 244-45, 576 A.2d 819, as is its interpretation and application of the FHA. <em>See Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n v. Township of Holmdel, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>550, 574, 583 A.2d 277 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> Implicit in the Public Advocate\u2019s challenge to Denville\u2019s proposed development is that a project which contains <em>all Mount Laurel </em>units violates the spirit of <em>Mount Laurel </em>and the FHA because it invites economic imbalance. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>nothing in the FHA compels the inclusion of affordable and market-rate units in a single development. To the contrary, a municipality may provide its fair share of affordable units \u201cby means of <em>any technique </em>or combination of techniques\u201d which satisfies its <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-311a (emphasis added). Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-304f an \u201cinclusionary development\u201d must at a <em>minimum </em>contain a \u201csubstantial percentage\u201d of <em>Mount Laurel </em>units; the statute does not preclude a development consisting of <em>all </em>such units. Indeed, COAH\u2019s own regulation defines \u201cinclusionary development\u201d as including \u201chousing developments comprised <em>completely </em>of low and moderate income units.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-1.3 (emphasis added). Such a scheme is no different than most if not all federally subsidized housing projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The fact that a development may be occupied by all poor people may well foster rather than frustrate the <em>Mount Laurel </em>mandate, that the poor be given a realistic housing opportunity. The project is of particular benefit in eradicating economic discrimination when, as here, it provides a substantial number of rental units, a source of housing most affordable to the very poor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Mount Laurel I, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 336 A.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Moreover, in accepting the development, COAH recognized the practical difficulties Denville faced in building a complex with both affordable and market-rate units. Such a development, constructed by the private sector, might have included as many as 800 market-rate units in order to generate the 201 low and moderate income units proposed by Denville. <em>See N.J.A. C. </em>5:92-8.4(e). The municipality rejected such a scheme because it desired to preserve existing sewer and water resources and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>minimize the impact such a substantial development would have on its infrastructure. Denville\u2019s proposal is a rational alternative to such a substantial inclusionary development. The proposed development is therefore fully sustainable under the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Although we hold that an all <em>Mount Laurel </em>unit development is sustainable under the FHA, we agree with the Public Advocate that when such a development is proposed, COAH must determine the suitability of the site in light of the <em>Mount Laurel </em>mandate and purposes of the FHA. <em>Mount Laurel I </em>and <em>II </em>do not expressly address the question of the \u201csuitability\u201d of a site for <em>Mount Laurel </em>housing. <em>Mount Laurel II </em>holds that once a municipality has revised its land use regulation and taken other steps affirmatively to provide a realistic opportunity for affordable housing, \u201cthe <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine requires it to do no more.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 456 A.2d 890. The court emphasized that <em>\u201cMount Laurel </em>is not an indiscriminate broom designed to sweep away all distinctions in the use of land,\u201d and that municipalities may continue to zone for upper-income housing and \u201cmay continue to require certain community amenities in certain areas, may continue to zone with some regard to their fiscal obligations: they may do all of this, provided that they have otherwise complied with their <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine was not intended to dictate where, within a community, a <em>Mount Laurel </em>development should be situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">However, the court noted that <em>\u201cspecific location </em>of such housing will of course continue to depend on <em>sound municipal land use planning.\u201d Id. </em>at 211, 456 A.2d 390 (emphasis added). Moreover, it suggests that reasonable access to community service.' may be an important factor in site selection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWi\">[w]here set-asides are used ... municipalities ... should attempt to assure that lower income units are integrated into larger developments <em>in a manner that both provides adequate access and services for the lower income </em>residents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>and at the same time protects as much as possible the value and integrity of the project as a whole.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 268, n. 32, 456 A.2d 390 (emphasis added). Although the comment has limited application here because it is made in the context of mandatory set-asides within an inclusionary development, it implies that some consideration must be given to \u201cadequate access and services for the lower income residents\u201d within the community as a whole in considering the suitability of a site for <em>Mount Laurel </em>development.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Other pre-FHA cases have focused on the \u201csuitability\u201d of the site in the context of compliance with <em>Mount Laurel </em>and sound zoning concepts. For example, Judge Serpentelli in <em>Allan-Deane Corp. v. Township of Bedminster, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>87, 115, 500 A.2d 49 (Law Div.1985), noted that a factor in site selection, as part of the compliance procedure, is a review of \u201csite suitability,\u201d which relates to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">the physical appropriateness of the parcel. Such factors as environmental suitability, availability of infrastructure, proximity to goods and services, regional accessibility and compatibility with neighboring land uses may impact upon whether the court finds a parcel suitable for <em>Mount Laurel </em>development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The FHA and its attendant regulations embrace this theme of \u201csuitability.\u201d The Legislature declares that \u201cthe statutory scheme ... is in the public interest in that it comprehends a low and moderate income housing planning and financing mechanism in accordance with regional considerations and <em>sound planning concepts which satisfies the constitutional obligation enunciated by the Supreme Court.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-303 (emphasis added). The FHA directs COAH to carry out its statutory duties \u201cin accordance with sound regional planning[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-304a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The interest of all citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cincluding low and moderate income families in need of affordable housing\u201d are best served by a \u201ccomprehensive planning and implementation response\u201d to these constitutional obligations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-302c. In order to \u201cachieve the goal of access to affordable housing to meet present and prospective housing needs, with particular attention to low and moderate income housing,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-310, a municipality\u2019s housing element shall contain a \u201cconsideration of the lands <em>that are most appropriate </em>for construction of low and moderate income housing ... including a consideration of lands of developers who have expressed a commitment to provide low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-310f (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">COAH\u2019s regulations require municipalities to establish priorities for low and moderate income sites. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-9.-1(a). Sites should be \u201cavailable, suitable, developable and approvable as defined in <em>N.J.A. C. </em>5:92-1.3.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAvailable site\u201d is one with clear title free of encumbrances which preclude development of low and moderate income housing. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-1.3. A \u201csuitable site\u201d is defined as \u201ca site that is <em>adjacent to compatible land uses, has access to appropriate streets </em>and is consistent with the environmental policies delineated in Sub-chapter 8, Municipal Adjustments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cDevelopable site\u201d is defined as a site having access to appropriate water and sewer infrastructure, and \u201capprovable site\u201d as a site that may be developed for low and moderate income in a manner \u201cconsistent with the regulations of all agencies with jurisdiction over the site.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Implicit in these legislative and regulatory directives is that amendments to the master plan and zoning ordinances, necessary to implement a housing element and fair share plan, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>not only be consistent with the FHA and COAH regulations, but with \u201csound municipal land use planning,\u201d <em>Mount Laurel II, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 456 A.2d 390; that is, with the purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -129. Such purposes include the appropriate use or development of land in a manner which promotes the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2a, and the establishment of appropriate population densities and concentrations that will contribute to the \u201cwell-being of persons, neighborhoods, communities and regions and preservation of the environment[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2e. Also, the zoning scheme must provide \u201csufficient space in appropriate locations for a variety of agricultural, residential, recreational, commercial and industrial uses and open space, ... in order to meet the needs of <em>all New Jersey citizens </em>[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2g (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">COAH must therefore focus on the \u201csuitability\u201d of the site in its review of a fair share plan component, consistent with its own regulations and sound planning concepts. Of course in doing so, COAH must be mindful of the presumption of validity afforded the zoning ordinance adopted by the municipality. <em>See Lusardi v. Curtis Point Property Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>217, 226, 430 A.2d 881 (1981); <em>Bow &amp; Arrow Manor, Inc. v. Town of West Orange, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>335, 343, 307 A.2d 563 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Here, COAH made no findings with respect to the \u201csuitability\u201d of the \u201cMcGreevy\u201d tract. Indeed, the record is sparse regarding the characteristics of Denville\u2019s overall land use. Absent is any evidence of the availability of recreational and governmental facilities at or near the proposed site. All we know is that the \u201cMcGreevy\u201d tract has access to Eoute 10, with a secondary access by way of Smith Eoad and that the site is affected by wetlands and excessive sloping. We know nothing about the availability to the proposed site of facilities such as schools, churches, public and private recreational facilities, public transport, community services, or proximity of the site to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>other goods and services. We also know nothing about the compatibility of the site with neighboring land uses, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-1.3, or whether the site is one of the parcels in Denville\u2019s available land inventory that is \u201cmost appropriate for construction of low and moderate income housing[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-310f. In short, a remand to COAH is necessary for comprehensive fact-findings as to \u201csuitability\u201d of the proposed site in the context of sound planning concepts. COAH should make the threshold determination as to whether an evidentiary hearing before the Office of Administrative Law is mandated. <em>See Hills Dev. Co. v. Township of Bernards, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 340-41, 551 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In Point VI the Public Advocate challenges Denville\u2019s RCA with Boonton which provides for a transfer of 38 units to Boonton at a cost to Denville of $570,000, or $15,000 per unit. As stated, Boonton has declined to enter into the RCA. The issue is therefore moot. <em>See Sente v.
