The issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in refusing to find the defense of parental immunity a bar to the claim by the child against her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">On May 11, 1986 Paul and Susan Chiapetta drove with their two children, plaintiff Jacqueline Mancinelli and Megan Chiapetta, to a family boardwalk outing in Point Pleasant Beach. The Chiapettas parked their car in a municipal lot adjacent to Ocean Avenue. The boardwalk and amusement rides were located across the street from the parking lot on Ocean Avenue. The Chiapettas left their car and walked to the curb of Ocean Avenue. Despite the presence of controlled intersections with marked pedestrian crosswalks to their north and south along Ocean Avenue, the Chiapettas decided to cross in the middle of the block.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Automobile and pedestrian traffic flow on Ocean Avenue was heavy on this bright, warm Sunday, (Mother\u2019s Day), at 4:30 p.m.. Susan Chiapetta led seven-year-old Jacqueline by the hand and Paul Chiapetta followed with ten-month old Megan in a stroller. Susan Chiapetta stepped off the curb onto Ocean Avenue with Jacqueline in tow. Almost immediately, a car owned by defendant Display Die Service (Display) and driven by defendant Edward Crosby struck and injured both Susan and Jacqueline. Several eyewitnesses said that Susan Chiapetta \u201cdarted\u201d or \u201crushed\u201d out into the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Plaintiff Jacqueline Mancinelli, by her then-guardian <em>ad litem </em>Susan Chiapetta, Susan Chiapetta individually, and Paul Chiapetta, filed suit against Edward Crosby and Display for Jacqueline\u2019s personal injuries. Defendants Crosby and Display answered and counterclaimed against Susan and Paul Chiapetta alleging her negligence as a cause of the accident and seeking contribution under the Joint Tort Feasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-1 to -5. Jacqueline, by her newly-appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>guardian <em>ad litem </em>Barbara McGuire and McGuire individually, then filed an amended complaint adding her mother, Susan Chiapetta, as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Prior to trial, counsel for defendants Crosby, Display and Susan Chiapetta and their carriers agreed to stipulate the damages for Jacqueline\u2019s personal injury case at $75,000. Responsibility for and apportionment of the liability among the defendants would abide (1) a jury trial on the issue of liability and (2) resolution of Susan Chiapetta\u2019s legal defense of parental immunity as a bar to the claim by her child. The jury returned a verdict finding Susan Chiapetta 100% negligent and exonerating Crosby. The judge then denied Susan Chiapetta\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict based on the bar of parental immunity and entered judgment of liability in favor of plaintiff Jacqueline Mancinelli solely against her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Defendant Susan Chiapetta appeals the judge\u2019s rejection of the defense of parental immunity as a bar to the claim. Defendants Crosby and Display cross-appeal from the judge\u2019s supplementary finding that Susan Chiapetta\u2019s conduct was not willful and wanton, thus precluding any legal bar of parental immunity, and his refusal to submit that issue to the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Public policy reasons exist for retention of the doctrine of parental immunity for matters arising out of the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care. <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>533, 546, 461 A.2d 1145 (1983) (failure to carefully supervise two and one-half-year old playing in yard not actionable). \u201cThere are certain areas of activities within the family sphere involving parental discipline, care, and control that should and must remain free from judicial intrusion. Parents should be free to determine how the physical, moral, emotional, and intellectual growth of their children can best be promoted.\u201d <em>Foldi, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 545, 461 A.2d 1145. Willful or wanton supervisory misconduct however is not protected by immunity. <em>Foldi, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 548, 461 A.2d 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number> Although the Supreme Court retained the doctrine of parental immunity in areas involving the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care, it specifically deferred to the lower courts for further refinements of the doctrine \u201con a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Foldi, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 546, 461 A.2d 1145. We had an opportunity to apply the doctrine recently in <em>Murray by Olsen v. Shimalla, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 555 A.2d 24 (App.Div.1989). There a ten-year-old brought an action against his father for personal injuries sustained when the minor was pouring gasoline which he had taken from his father\u2019s unlocked storage shed onto a fire. The father had given his son access to and instructions on how to pour gasoline for purposes of refueling the minor\u2019s all-terrain vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In an opinion by Judge Brody, we clarified the analysis used in determining whether parental immunity existed under <em>Foldi.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acm\">The first step in applying the <em>Foldi </em>analysis requires the judge to determine what acts or omissions by the parent a fact finder could reasonably find were the proximate cause of the child\u2019s injury. The next step is to determine whether that conduct is protected by parental immunity, <em>i.e., </em>whether it involves the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care. If it does, the next step is to determine whether the conduct constitutes a lack of parental supervision. If it does, the final step is to determine whether a fact finder could reasonably find that the conduct was willful or wanton thereby removing it from the immunity. <em>[Shimalla, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 555 <em>A.</em>2d 24].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In applying this analysis in <em>Shimalla, </em>we ruled that the minor\u2019s injuries could be attributable to the father\u2019s simple negligence in leaving gasoline in an unlocked storage shed accessible to minors in general or in giving his son permission to use gasoline without supervision. The latter conduct, although negligence, would be protected by parental immunity absent a finding that it was willful or wanton misconduct in the supervision of the child. The former conduct would be actionable. <em>Shimalla, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 109-110, 555 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Applying the <em>Foldi </em>analysis, we conclude that the parent\u2019s negligence in this pedestrian knockdown case before us is not protected by parental immunity. According to the jury\u2019s verdict, Susan Chiapetta alone caused her daughter Jacqueline\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>injuries (and her own injuries) when she carelessly led her onto Ocean Avenue directly into the path of a moving vehicle. This was not a matter of customary child care, discipline or supervision. This was simple, garden-variety negligence by the parent which exposed both the parent and the child to injury. Although Susan Chiapetta may have literally exercised parental authority in transporting her child across the street, this is not the sort of exercise of parental authority in child-rearing intended for protection by the parental immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The doctrine of parental immunity was intended to protect a parent\u2019s determination of how the physical, moral, emotional or intellectual growth of a child can best be promoted. <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 545-546, 461 A.2d 1145. This case simply involves a mother\u2019s negligence in attempting to cross a street with the child at a dangerous location without making proper observation. Denial of parental immunity in this action does not constitute judicial intrusion into a parent\u2019s philosophy of child rearing but only simple recognition of the parent\u2019s breach of a duty of due care which we all generally owe to both ourselves and others in the community. While we recognize that a duty to safely lead a child (and oneself) across a street will usually arise in the parent-child relationship, we are not persuaded that a breach of this ordinary duty of care and common sense should be immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">A review of the varied decisions in our sister states which recognize the doctrine of limited parental immunity does not dissuade us from our decision. <em>See </em>Annotation, \u201cLiability of Parent for Injury to Unemancipated Child,\u201d 6 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 1066 (1981 and Supp.). In <em>Sandoval by Rodriquez v. Sandoval, </em>128 <em>Ariz. </em>11, 623 P.2d 800 (1981), a minor child was injured when he drove his tricycle through a gate negligently left open by his parents and was hit by a car. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the parent\u2019s negligence in leaving the gate open arose out of an act of parental care and control and was immune from suit. This is very similar to our <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, supra, </em>applying immunity to careless supervision of a two and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>year old while she was playing in the garden. An Illinois appellate court decided that a minor child struck by an automobile in front of his mother\u2019s home could maintain an action against the parent for negligently failing to trim trees in front of the home which obstructed the driver\u2019s view. <em>Cummings v. Jackson, </em>57 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>68, 14 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>848, 372 N.E.2d 1127 (1978). That court decided that the mother\u2019s actions violated a city ordinance which imposed a duty owed to the general public and she was not immune. In <em>Ard v. Ard, </em>414 So.2d 1066 (Fla.1982), the Florida Supreme Court allowed a minor to maintain a suit against his mother for injures received after the parent negligently \u201cunloaded\u201d the child from her car into a street, \u201cplacing him in a dangerous and perilous position,\u201d and the child was struck by another vehicle. That court retreated from the doctrine of full parental immunity but only to the extent of the parent\u2019s insurance coverage. The Florida Supreme Court decided that the policy reasons behind the doctrine of parental immunity: protection of family tranquility, preservation of family assets, and preventing fraud and collusion among parties to a lawsuit, were not persuasive concerns when automobile liability insurance existed to protect the mother and satisfy the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Agin v. Likens, </em>81 Misc.2d 690, 366 N.Y.S.2d 798 (Spec. Term 1975), a minor was injured when his mother was struck by a moving vehicle while attempting to carry the child across an unlit highway at night. The New York trial-level court barred the minor from suing his mother. The court concluded that the mother\u2019s decision to control the child by oral directions, physical guidance or picking him up should not be the subject of court supervision. <em>Agin, </em>at 691, 366 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>798. The court thought that the parent\u2019s decision to transport a child from one place to another and the manner in which that transportation should be effected should be beyond judicial review and not actionable. <em>Id. </em>at 692, 366 N.Y.S.2d 798. Another New York trial-level court, in <em>Yun Jeong Koo v. St. Bernard, </em>89 <em>Misc.2d </em>775, 392 N.Y.S.2d 815 (Spec. Term 1977), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>reached the opposite result when the driver of a motor vehicle, defending an action by a minor for negligence asserted that the child\u2019s parents had \u201cpushed\u201d the child \u201cin such a way as to cause contact\u201d with defendant\u2019s vehicle. That court held the defendant was not precluded from seeking recovery of contribution from the parents when the parents\u2019 conduct toward the child would have been tortious if done by one ordinary person to another. <em>Id. </em>at 779, 392 N.Y.S.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We do not view the judge\u2019s ruling or the jury\u2019s verdict in the case before us as an intrusion into \u201cthose highly subjective factors\u201d involving a parent\u2019s philosophy of child care and supervision. <em>See Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 546, 461 A.2d 1145. The only judgment involved here is how to safely cross a street, not how to care for or rear a child. <em>See Gross v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 386 A.2d 442 (App.Div.1978) (no immunity for father\u2019s negligent operation of a power mower); <em>cf. Carey v. Davison, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 437 A.2d 338 (Law Div.1981) (telling child when to cross the street was apparently protected by immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">As Justice Garibaldi said in <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 461 A.2d 1145, \u201c[we] start with the fundamental principle that liability ordinarily should be imposed upon the those who wrongfully injure others.\u201d Minor children are entitled to the same redress for wrongs as anyone else. <em>Id. </em>In the case before us, we must characterize the mother\u2019s conduct in carelessly crossing the street and towing her child into a zone of danger as either (1) immunized parental supervision or (2) simple, ordinary negligence. We chose the latter characterization. Again, as the Supreme Court said in <em>Foldi: </em>\u201cTo justify a prohibition of the enforcement of [children\u2019s] rights, a very substantial showing must be made that such prohibition will achieve an important countervailing policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We see no such showing of any countervailing policy in this instance which justifies shielding the mother from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Affirmed; the cross-appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
