An indictment against defendant is now pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Before us, defendant argues that it seeks an order only with respect to \u201cinterrogation of CIBA-GEIGY employees whose acts or omissions the State sought to impute to CIBA-GEIGY for the purpose of establishing corporate criminal liability\u201d. The trial judge denied the motion concluding that the rule did not prohibit the Attorney General from conducting <em>ex parte </em>interviews of current or former employees of a corporate defendant, even though that corporation is represented by counsel. The court expressly ruled that those communications could include employees whose acts or omissions the State sought to impute to the defendant. We granted leave to appeal and accelerated oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">CIBA-GEIGY does not contest the general proposition under existing New Jersey law that evidence obtained in violation of a disciplinary rule need not be suppressed. <em>See State v. Riley, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 390, 523 A.2d 1089 (App.Div.1987); <em>State v. Darby, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 376, 511 A.2d 1222 (App.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Div.1986), <em>certif. denied </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>559, 523 A.2d 192 (1986);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Porter, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 393-94, 510 A.2d 49 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied </em>105 <em>N.J </em>556, 523 A.2d 191 (1986). Therefore, we question whether there is an issue for appropriate consideration in the criminal, as opposed to some future disciplinary, proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the State does not raise this procedural defense; it seeks to avoid any disciplinary wrongdoing, and defendant seeks to protect its interests. Further, no published opinion appears to decline consideration of the issue based on appropriate forum, the trial court ruled upon the merits of defendant\u2019s application in this case, and the parties are entitled to know their rights and responsibilities with respect to the immediate concern. The Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics would probably be required to decline consideration of the issue because it involves \u201ca pending action where its opinion might affect the interests of the parties----\u201d <em>R. </em>1:19-2. Accordingly, there is a real dispute between the parties affecting a pending case, and we consider the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">There is no doubt that RPC 4.2 applies to corporations. Nor is it limited to civil proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The real issue before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>therefore, is whether any employees, and if so which employees, are \u201cparties\u201d for purposes of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Defendant essentially urges that the State wants to speak with employees who would not be \u201cinterviewed as <em>witnesses </em>but as corporate employees whose acts the State is trying inappropriately to impute to the corporation.\u201d According to the defendant, it \u201cdoes not wish to \u2018restrict the flow of information\u2019 available to the State, and [it] is willing to make available to the State any of its present or former employees who wish to be interviewed.\u201d In fact, a party cannot generally ask a witness \u201cto refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party,\u201d RPC 3.4(f). All that defendant requests (in addition to the witnesses\u2019 \u201cright to accept or refuse to be interviewed\u201d, a right which is acknowledged by the State, <em>see State v. Roszkowski, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 317-318, 323 A.2d 531 (App.Div.1974), <em>certif. denied </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>325, 331 A.2d 25 (1974); <em>State v. Boiardo, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 412 A.2d 1084 (Law Div.1980); <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>313 <em>F.Supp. </em>486, 491 (D.N.J.1970), <em>aff'd U.S. v. Addonizio, </em>451 F.2d 49 (3d Cir.N.J.1971), ce<em>rt. denied </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>936, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>949, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972)), is the right of defendant\u2019s counsel to be present at all such interviews. In defendant\u2019s words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">[t]his procedure will strike the proper balance between protecting the corporation\u2019s interests and allowing the State to conduct additional post indictment interviews. In thus promoting the interests of fairness, this procedure will not impose any unfair burden upon the State\u2014it will be able to interview any CIBA-GEIGY employees who wish to be interviewed. This procedure also complies with the ethical rules while the State\u2019s insistence on <em>ex parte </em>procedures does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Our rule was patterned after the model A.B.A. rule, <em>see American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, </em>and the commentary thereto notes that the rule prohibits <em>ex parte </em>contact \u201cwith persons having a managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization, and with any other person, whose act or omission in connection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability, or whose statement may constitute an admission on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the part of the organization.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company v. Associated Electric &amp; Gas Ins. Services, Ltd., </em>745 <em>F.Supp. </em>1037, 1039-1042 (D.N.J.1990) (quoting commentary). While the commentary is supportive of defendant\u2019s position, RPC 4.2 does not expressly distinguish between certain types or levels of officers or employees and others employed by a corporation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The defendant also relies upon <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>383, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>677, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>584 (1981). However, that case is distinguishable because it concerns the attorney-client privilege which was held applicable to communications of employees of a corporate party at all levels.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This case does not concern communications between a corporate employee and the corporation\u2019s counsel but with communications between a prosecutor, or attorney for the corporation\u2019s adversary, and a corporate employee who may or may not have previously communicated with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">There is a distinction between the attorney-client privilege discussed in <em>Upjohn, supra, </em>and the protection afforded by RPC 4.2. <em>See Wright by Wright v. Group Health Hospital, </em>103 <em>Wash.2d </em>192, 691 <em>P.</em>2d 564 (1984). The <em>Upjohn </em>court expanded the definition of \u201cclient\u201d for the purposes of the attorney-client privilege, but \u201c[t]he purpose of the disciplinary rule, on the other hand, is to protect the corporation so its agents who have the authority to prejudice the entity\u2019s interest are not unethically influenced by adverse counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>691 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>P.2d at 570. Thus, <em>Upjohn </em>deals with the policy objections with respect to communications between a corporate employee and its counsel, a subject having little relationship with the purposes of the disciplinary rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">First, the privilege applies only to <em>confidential communications </em>with counsel ..., it does not immunize the underlying factual information\u2014which is in issue here\u2014from disclosure to an adversary____ Second, the attorney-client privilege serves the societal objective of encouraging open communication between client and counsel ..., a benefit not present in denying informal access to factual information. Thus, a corporate employee who may be a \u2018client\u2019 for purposes of the attorney-client privilege is not necessarily a \u2018party\u2019 for the purposes of DR 7\u2014104(A)(1) [the disciplinary rule]. <em>Niesig v. Team I, </em>76 <em>N.Y.2d </em>363, 371-372, 559 <em>N.Y.S.2nd </em>493, 497 [558 N.E.2d 1030] (N.Y.1990) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>See also Stempler v. Speidell, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>368, 495 A.2d 857 (1985) (defendant could interview decedent\u2019s treating physician and plaintiff could be required to authorize same).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Defendant acknowledges the right of the State to interview witnesses and to subpoena witnesses before the grand jury. It apparently acknowledges that employees can be called to testify before the grand jury, subject of course to their Fifth Amendment rights, although not before a prosecutor. <em>See e.g. In re Addonizio, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>107, 116, 248 A.2d 531 (1968); <em>State v. Hilltop Private Nursing Home, Inc., </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 426 A.2d 1041 (App.Div.1981); <em>see also Matter of Nackson, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 205, 534 A.2d 65 (App.Div.1987), <em>aff'd </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>527, 555 A.2d 1101 (1989). In distinguishing between pre-indictment and post-indictment situations, the defendant appears to acknowledge that the right to counsel attaches only after formal legal or adversarial proceedings are commenced, <em>see e.g. Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>285, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988); <em>Michigan v.

Earle, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>550, 552, 292 A32d 2 (1972); <em>State v. Darby, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372-376, 511 A.2d 1222.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See also R. </em>3:16; <em>R. </em>7:4-4(a). At that time, the defendant becomes a \u201cparty.\u201d As noted in <em>United States v. Ryans, </em>903 <em>F.2d </em>731, 740-741 (10th Cir.1990), the commencement of formal proceedings and the shift \u201cfrom the investigation to accusation\u201d also shifts \u201cthe balance of interests at stake\u201d, thereby affecting the right to <em>ex parte </em>interviews once \u201cadversary proceedings [have] begun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">As noted in a recent comment, <em>Krulewitch, \u201cEx Parte </em>Communications with Corporate Parties: The Scope of the Limitations on Attorney Communications with One of Adverse Interest,\u201d 82 <em>Northwestern Law Rev. </em>1274, 1275 (1988), under the prior disciplinary rule, DR 7-104(A)(l), the forerunner of RPC 4.2 (which contains substantially the same language):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">An attorney cannot communicate with the individual who is the opposing party. If the case involves several different parties that are all individuals, ... the application of the rule is sufficiently clear. When a corporation is a party to a suit, however, the term \u2018party\u2019 suddenly becomes ambiguous. The rule fails to define the term \u2018party\u2019 when applied to a corporate entity. Since a corporation is an artificial entity, it is often impossible to point to any one person or thing that represents the corporation. When the corporation becomes involved in a law suit, the corporate entity is the party, not the employees or the agents. The fundamental conundrum is this: if the corporation is a faceless entity run by agents and employees, and yet the agents and employees are not the corporation, then who or what is a \u2018party\u2019 under DR 7-104(A)(l)? [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>There are a number of reasons for suggesting that the word \u201cparty\u201d cannot include any employee of a corporate defendant. For example, a defendant employee of the corporate defendant could not be represented by the corporations\u2019s attorney in the action. <em>See e.g., In re Garber, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>597, 472 A.2d 566 (1984); <em>In re Abrams, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>271, 276, 266 A.2d 275 (1970); <em>In re Russell, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>315, 282 A.2d 42 (1971). This is at least true in the absence of a knowing waiver post-indictment on the record by both parties. <em>See R. </em>3:8-2; <em>State v. Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>531, 410 A.2d 666 (1980). \u201cIt is inherently wrong to represent both the employer and the employee if the employee\u2019s interest may, and the public interest will, be advanced by the employee\u2019s disclosure of his employer\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>In re Abrams, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 276, 266 A.2d 275. Reading the rule to prohibit <em>ex parte </em>interviews might treat the employee as if represented by the corporation\u2019s attorney. Further, this approach, requiring notice to corporate counsel, would apply to corporate officers and employees, even if independently represented or an adverse party in the proceeding, such as in a stockholder\u2019s or worker\u2019s compensation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Our judicial policy is to promote the admission of evidence and, therefore, to construe privileges narrowly, <em>see State v. Briley, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>498, 251 A.2d 442 (1969); <em>see also In re Farber, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>259, 394 A.2d 330 (1978), <em>cert. denied New York Times Co. v. N.J., </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>997, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>598, 58 L.Ed.2d 670 (1978); <em>Kurdek v. West Orange Educ. Bd., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 226, 536 A.2d 332 (Law Div.1987). Further, it may be difficult for the prosecutor to tell whether a corporate employee\u2019s statements can be imputed to the defendant before an initial interview occurs, and there is nothing to suggest that our disciplinary rule was designed to require <em>ex parte </em>or <em>in camera </em>hearings to obtain judicial permission or authorization for a pretrial interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Perhaps the simplest and, in many ways, the appropriate approach would be to hold that the word \u201cparty\u201d means exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>what it says, the corporate entity named as a party in the litigation. <em>Cf. R. </em>4:16-l(c) relating to representatives of a corporate \u201cparty.\u201d This \u201cplain language\u201d construction is consistent with the wording of RPC 4.2, promotes the search for truth and avoids many of the problems caused by any other approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The \u201cplain language\u201d construction, and the other \u201cbright line\u201d extreme prohibiting all <em>ex parte </em>interviews of corporate employees, produce the benefit of avoiding the risk of a disciplinary rule violation and make it easier for an attorney to know when an interview can be conducted and when it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The \u201cplain language\u201d construction finds no support, however, in authority and is inconsistent with the purpose of the Rule as explained in the A.B.A. explanatory commentary. <em>See </em>n. 3 <em>supra. See also Curley v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>134 <em>F.R.D. </em>77, 79 (D.N.J.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The other \u201cbright line\u201d extreme, prohibiting all <em>ex parte </em>interviews, has been endorsed in this federal district by Judge Politan in <em>Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., supra, </em>745 <em>F.Supp. </em>1037, which prohibited all <em>ex parte </em>communications with a corporation\u2019s former employees. But, as noted in Magistrate Simandle\u2019s subsequent opinion adopted by Judge Brotman in <em>Curley v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>134 <em>F.R.D. </em>77, 86 (D.N.J.1991) the other cases which applied that approach to former employees were subsequently \u201cvacated and withdrawn by the deciding courts, and are of no precedential value.\u201d These opinions dealing with former employees have limited value in this context because ex-employees can rarely, if ever, make an admission which can bind, or take action which can be imputed to, a former principal. <em>See Curley, </em>134 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 88-91; <em>Amarin Plastics, Inc. v. Maryland Cup Corp., </em>116 <em>F.R.D. </em>36 (D.Mass.1987). <em>See also Evid.R. </em>63(8), 63(9). <em>Compare, Fed.Rules Evid. </em>Rule 801(d)(2)(D). Moreover, as the New York Court of Appeals recently noted in <em>Niesig v. Team I, </em>76 <em>N.Y.2d </em>363, 559 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>493, 496, n. 3, 558 <em>N.E.2d </em>1030, 1033 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>n. 3 (N.Y.1990), the only opinion which by then had adopted the \u201cblanket rule\u201d prohibiting <em>ex parte </em>interviews with all employees was \u201c \u2018depublished\u2019 by the California Supreme Court and thus is without precedential significance.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, as Magistrate Simandle has noted, \u201c[i]f the framers of RPC 4.2 wished to ethically restrain all contact with a corporation\u2019s employees (let alone ex-employees), the rule would undoubtedly have been fashioned differently.\u201d 134 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In <em>Curley, </em>Judge Brotman adopted Magistrate Simandle\u2019s interpretation that RPC 4.2 applied to employees with management responsibility, or whose \u201cact or omission is believed to be so central and obvious to a determination of corporate liability that the person\u2019s conduct may be imputed to the corporation,\u201d 134 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 91. or whose statements may constitute admissions against the organization which employs them. 134 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 91-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Last year in <em>Niesig v. Team I, supra, </em>the New York Court of Appeals found that the \u201cblanket rule\u201d prohibition test was too extreme. As Judge Kaye stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">The single indisputable advantage of a blanket preclusion\u2014as with every absolute rule\u2014is that it is clear. No lawyer need ever risk disqualification or discipline because of uncertainty as to which employees are covered by the rule and which not. The problem, however, is that a ban of this nature exacts a high price in terms of other values, and is unnecessary to achieve the objectives of DR 7\u2014104(A)(1) [the predecessor to R.P.C. 4.2 which contains substantially the same language]. [559 <em>N.Y.S.2</em>d at 497, 558 At A.2d at 496].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">However, the Court found that the \u201cproposed intermediate tests ... give too little guidance, or otherwise seem unworkable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>559 N.Y.S.2d at 498, 558 N.E.2d at 1035. For example, the \u201ccontrol group\u201d test urged by the civil defendants in that case, which included \u201conly the most senior management exercising substantial control over the corporation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 497, 558 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1034, was found to \u201coverlook[] the fact that corporate employees other than senior management also can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>bind the corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 558 N.E.2d at 1035. The Court of Appeals therefore concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">The test that best balances the competing interests, and incorporates the most desirable elements of the other approaches, is one that defines \u2018party\u2019 to include corporate employees whose acts or omissions in the matter under inquiry are binding on the corporation (in effect, the corporation\u2019s \u2018alter egos\u2019) or imputed to the corporation for purposes of its liability, or employees implementing the advice of counsel. All other employees may be interviewed informally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Unlike a blanket ban or a \u2018control group\u2019 test, this solution is specifically targeted at the problem addressed by DR 7-104(A)(l). The potential unfair advantage of extracting concessions and admissions from those who will bind the corporation is negated when employees with \u2018speaking authority\u2019 for the corporation, and employees who are so closely identified with the interests of the corporate party as to be indistinguishable from it, are deemed \u2018parties\u2019 for purposes of DR 7-104(A)(l). Concern for the protection of the attorney-client privilege prompts us also to include in the definition of \u2018party\u2019 the corporate employees responsible for actually effectuating the advice of counsel in the matter. <em>[Id. </em>at 498, 558 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1035].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We are not the Supreme Court which can amend or clarify its rule, and we fully recognize that the broader we define the word \u201cparty\u201d, the more we narrow pretrial discovery of facts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we know no better way than the New York Court of Appeals to balance the purpose of the Rule with the realities and practicalities of conducting litigation. That balance may at first, as in New York, be somewhat difficult to apply. It may even deter some <em>ex parte </em>communications, <em>see Niesig, supra, </em>559 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 499, 558 N.E.2d at 1036. If the Rule deters some <em>ex parte </em>civil discovery, there is no great social or policy sacrifice; it will promote other types of discovery, such as by deposition upon notice to the adversary. In the criminal setting, it may prevent some ability of the prosecutor to interview potential witnesses (who are employees of a corporate defendant) before trial, but the Rule only deals with a \u201cparty,\u201d that is after the commencement of an adversarial proceeding. Moreover, most criminal cases filed against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>corporation are commenced by complaint or indictment after investigation\u2014corporations do not generally commit \u201cstreet crimes\u201d\u2014and by then the investigation clearly should have been developed through the employee witnesses or otherwise. Accordingly, we find no reason to interpret RPC 4.2 more broadly than intended nor more narrowly than necessary to permit proper pretrial investigation. On balance, we give the Rule the same interpretation as rendered by the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Niesig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">As stated by Judge Greenberg in <em>Darby, supra, </em>\"... it does not follow that if a prosecutor violates an ethical rule in gathering evidence he necessarily violates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights so that the evidence obtained is inadmissible.
