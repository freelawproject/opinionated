J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa8\">Following a jury trial, Yvonne Lindo Brown (hereafter appellant) was found guilty of robbery in violation of Penal Code section 211<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to state prison for the midterm of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">On appeal appellant asserts: (1) the trial court erred in ruling that a prior robbery conviction (\u00a7 211) was admissible for impeachment purposes; and (2) she was denied her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">On January 13, 1983, at approximately 1:50 p.m., a young black woman robbed the South Airport Boulevard branch of Wells Fargo Bank. The robber waited in line for several minutes and then walked up to the merchant teller window where Ms. Chandra Gaston was working. She placed a large bag on the counter and ordered Ms. Gaston to \u201cFill it up. No funny stuff. Bottom drawer only. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">Ms. Gaston did as she was told and placed approximately $8,000 from the bottom drawer into the bag. She testified that she placed \u201cbait money\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>in the bag but it failed to activate, i.e., explode red dye, when the robber exited the bank and she forgot to pull the money clip which operates the bank\u2019s cameras in the event of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The robber fled and jumped into a 1965-1967 two-door green getaway car driven by a black male in his mid-20\u2019s or early 30\u2019s. The car had been stolen that morning in San Francisco and was abandoned later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Four eyewitnesses positively identified appellant, Yvonne Lindo Brown, as the bank robber. Gaston and Ruth Martinez, the bank\u2019s utility teller, both testified that they had observed the robber for approximately five minutes while she waited in line for Gaston\u2019s teller window. Gaston observed the robber close up for an additional 30 or 40 seconds during the commission of the robbery. Both witnesses gave the police detailed descriptions of the robber\u2019s facial features, height, weight and clothing immediately after the robbery. They assisted an artist in drawing several composite sketches and shortly thereafter selected appellant\u2019s picture from among six photographs in a police photo spread. At a live lineup held about two weeks after the robbery and in court at trial, both Martinez and Gaston positively identified appellant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In addition, Debra Rogers, a teller at a nearby window, identified appellant as the robber in the police photo spread and in court at trial. Norman Lecointre\u2019s attention, while standing across the street from the bank, was directed to a speeding vehicle which came to an abrupt stop, picked up appellant and instantaneously sped away. He identified appellant in the photo spread and in court as the woman who jumped into the getaway car.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Appellant challenged the accuracy of the identifications by calling two witnesses who saw a black female in the bank but were unable to positively identify appellant as that woman in either the photo spread or in court. She also presented an alibi defense. Nevertheless, on the basis of the above testimony, she was found guilty of robbery (\u00a7 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">II. Admissibility of a Prior Felony Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">At trial appellant moved to bar impeachment with a prior robbery conviction (\u00a7 211) should she elect to testify.  Relying on the plain language of article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Constitution (Proposition 8),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court stated that it had no discretion to exclude evidence of a prior conviction. The court denied the motion and as a result, appellant chose not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that the prior robbery conviction was admissible; she contends that even after the enactment of Proposition 8 the trial court retains its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 to exclude evidence of a prior conviction where the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Respondent argues that article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution mandates the admission of <em>all </em>prior felony convictions and leaves no room for judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">This issue has recently been addressed by the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111]. Defendant Maria Castro was convicted by a jury of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496). Before trial, the court denied Castro\u2019s motion to bar impeachment with two then unspecified priors should she elect to testify on the ground that all prior felonies are admissible under article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution. Castro did testify at trial and both priors (possession of heroin and possession of heroin for sale) were used for impeachment purposes. (At pp. 305, 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The <em>Castro </em>court set forth a two-part analysis for a trial court to follow in determining whether a prior felony is admissible for impeachment purposes. First, the trial court must determine whether the prior conviction involves \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d If the court finds that it does not involve moral turpitude, then the prior may not be admitted. Second, if the prior does involve moral turpitude, then the court must exercise its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 in deciding whether to admit or exclude the prior. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Applying the above rules, the Supreme Court found that the trial court in <em>Castro </em>had committed two errors. First, the court found that possession of heroin for sale does involve moral turpitude as it involves the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>corrupt others whereas mere possession of heroin does not. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>at p. 317.) Thus, the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility with the simple possession charge. (Ibid.) Second, the court erred in stating that it had no discretion with respect to the admission of either of the priors. <em>{Ibid.) </em>However, applying the standard in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], the <em>Castro </em>court found that the errors were harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>at pp. 318-319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Applying the rule in <em>Castro </em>to the facts of the present case, we must first determine whether robbery, appellant\u2019s prior conviction, involves moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The Supreme Court gives us little guidance in ascertaining which crimes involve moral turpitude. We are told that crimes which reveal a defendant\u2019s dishonesty, \u201cgeneral readiness to do evil,\u201d \u201cbad character\u201d or moral depravity do involve moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>at p. 315.) Furthermore, we know that possession of heroin does not involve moral turpitude whereas possession for sale does. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 317.) Where does robbery fit on this scale of possession versus possession for sale?</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">First, we note that even under the more narrow standard of <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1] and its progeny requiring that a prior conviction involve <em>dishonesty, </em>robbery was admissible for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We logically infer that under the broader moral turpitude standard, robbery is necessarily admissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 317, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Secondly, we turn to the substantial body of law defining crimes involving moral turpitude which has developed in the area of attorney discipline. As early as 1940, the California Supreme Court in <em>In re Rothrock </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 449 [106 P.2d 907, 131 A.L.R. 226] recognized that robbery and moral turpitude are practically synonymous. The court stated: \u201cIn cases such as those involving convictions of murder, forgery, extortion, bribery, perjury, robbery, embezzlement and other forms of theft, no difficulty would attend the question of moral turpitude from a consideration of the record of conviction alone.\u201d (At p. 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>In <em>In re Fahey </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 842 [106 Cal.Rptr. 313, 505 P.2d 1369, 63 A.L.R.3d 465], a proceeding to discipline an attorney, the court explained that conviction of certain crimes establishes moral turpitude on its face. (At p. 849.) The court need not look to the circumstances surrounding the offense because (1) those crimes necessarily involve the intent to defraud or intentional dishonesty for the purpose of personal gain; or (2) the crime, such as murder or a serious sexual offense, is so repugnant to accepted moral standards that it is clear that moral turpitude is involved. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Like theft <em>(In re Rothrock </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 588, 591 [154 P.2d 392]), receiving stolen property <em>(In re Plotner </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 714, 726 [97 Cal.Rptr. 193, 488 P.2d 385]) and extortion <em>(Barton </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 294, 297 [40 P.2d 502]), robbery involves intentional dishonesty for the purpose of personal gain. (See <em>In re Hollinan </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 243, 247-248 [272 P.2d 768].) Accordingly, we hold that robbery is one of those offenses where conviction alone compels the conclusion that moral turpitude was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Since appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction meets the threshold requirement of involving moral turpitude, it was within the discretionary power of the court to grant or deny appellant\u2019s motion in accordance with Evidence Code section 352. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 316.) The failure of the trial court, in the present case, to exercise its discretion was clearly error under Castro.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We must now determine whether the trial court\u2019s error requires reversal. Under <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 837, reversal is permitted only if after a review of the entire record \u201cthe court is of the opinion \u2018that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">For the purpose of our harmless error analysis we will accept as true appellant\u2019s assertion that had the trial court exercised its discretion and ruled the prior conviction inadmissible, she would have testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We recognize that in cases arising prior to the enactment of Proposition 8, the Supreme Court had cast doubt upon the applicability of the usual harmless error standard of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at page 836, in cases where a defendant elected not to testify due to <em>Beagle</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error in the admission of a prior conviction. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 211, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>223, in attempting to calculate the prejudicial effect of the error, the court stated that \u201cthe usual tests for concluding that an error requires reversal of a judgment of conviction are not applicable. \u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 222, 233-234, the court set forth what can best be characterized as a reverse <em>Watson </em>test: \u201cAbsent any basis for concluding that [appellant\u2019s] testimony would not have affected the result, \u2018the court is of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to [appellant] would have been reached in the absence of this error.\u2019 \u201d This test is much more demanding than <em>Watson </em>because it announces something akin to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, i.e., unless the reviewing court can determine what the contents of the defendant\u2019s testimony would have been and that the jury would have been completely unswayed by it, reversal of the judgment is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Spearman </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 107 [157 Cal.Rptr. 883, 599 P.2d 74], the court cited <em>Watson, </em>but again deviated somewhat from that standard stating, in essence, that although the case against the appellant was strong, it was not irrebuttable and the court \u201chas no basis for concluding that appellant\u2019s testimony would not have affected the result of the trial.\u201d (At pp. 118-119.) The <em>Spearman </em>court states a nearly per se reversal rule\u2014 unless the incriminating evidence is \u201cirrebuttable,\u201d i.e., the defendant could give no testimony which if believed would have resulted in acquittal or conviction of a lesser offense, reversal is automatic if a defendant is deprived of his right to testify because of Beagle error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\"><em>The Castro </em>court labels <em>Rist, Fries </em>and <em>Spearman </em>as part of the \u201cAntick<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> line of cases.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 308.) The court found that article I, section 28 of the California Constitution, which governs the admissibility of the prior in this case, was framed by the drafters and legislated by the voters in a direct attempt \u201cto counter the effect of the <em>Antick </em>line of cases.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 308-309.) We therefore conclude that the voters intended to counter this rule of nearly per se reversal in cases where error results in a defendant\u2019s failure to exercise his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">This conclusion is supported by the <em>Castro </em>court itself which uses a \u201cpure\u201d <em>Watson </em>test in determining the prejudicial effect of the trial court\u2019s error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 319.) Unlike the present case, the defendant in <em>Castro </em>did testify; however, the court makes no distinction between testifying and nontestifying defendants. Absent further guidance from the Supreme Court, we conclude that the effect of the error in the present case must be evaluated under the <em>Watson </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">A review of the record herein convinces us that the error which appellant alleges caused her to forego testifying was nonprejudicial since it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have occurred in the absence of that error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The prosecution\u2019s case consisted of one positive eyewitness identification by the teller who was robbed, and that identification was strongly corroborated by the testimony of three other witnesses\u2014two who saw appellant immediately before the robbery (Rogers and Martinez) and one who observed her immediately thereafter (Lecointre).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Defense counsel challenged the accuracy of the identifications by calling witnesses who were in the bank at the time of the robbery and who testified that they saw the robber but could not identify appellant as that robber. Appellant also presented an alibi defense. Lori Marshall, appellant\u2019s friend, testified that appellant was with her at Marshall\u2019s home watching soap operas from 11:35 a.m. until 3:30 or 4 p.m. on the day of the 1:50 p.m. robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Thus, it cannot be said that appellant\u2019s testimony was essential to the presentation of her defense as other witnesses presented alibi and misidentification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As there was overwhelming direct and indirect evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, we conclude that it is not reasonably probable that appellant\u2019s testimony would have affected the result of the trial. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836). Accordingly, we hold that the error complained of was nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Effective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A3U\">Channell, J., and Sabraw, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution provides in full: \u201c \u2018Use of Prior Convictions. Any prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding. When a prior felony conviction is an element of any felony offense, it shall be proven to the trier of fact in open court. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">We note that the trial court was correct in using Proposition 8 as the measure of admissibility of appellant\u2019s prior conviction since the instant offense arose after the effective date (June 9, 1982) of article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 262 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211, 219-220 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 222, 229 [155 Cal.Rptr. 194, 594 P.2d 19], the Supreme Court states that robbery is probative of honesty.
