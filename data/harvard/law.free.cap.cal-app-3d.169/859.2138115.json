J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3D\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment dismissing her action against an insurer for bad faith after a demurrer to her original complaint was sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Plaintiff Toshiko Afuso filed a complaint against United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, Inc. (USF&amp;G), and two of its employees, alleging unfair claims settlement practices in violation of Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleged she was injured in a motor vehicle accident on June 10, 1982, which was proximately caused by the negligence of Joseph Roybal, the driver of a vehicle owned by USF&amp;G\u2019s insured. Plaintiff further alleged that on September 14, 1983, she accepted USF&amp;G\u2019s offer to settle the suit for $40,000. She stated that, pursuant to the settlement, she executed \u201ca release of all claims;\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, \u201c[njothing contained in said release purported to waive Plaintiff\u2019s right to proceed against Defendants . . . for their breach of duty under Insurance Code section 790.03.\u201d Plaintiff did not attach a copy of the release to her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Defendants demurred to the complaint and attached a copy of the release. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground the release barred plaintiff\u2019s suit for violation of section 790.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">On appeal, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to her complaint. Initially, she argues the language of the release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>does not preclude her from litigating her claim against defendants for their violation of section 790.03. However, we need not address this issue since the release was not properly before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u201cA demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 430.30, 430.70). The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action [citation].\u201d <em>(SKF Farms </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [200 Cal.Rptr. 497].)  Defendants here did not request that the trial court take judicial notice of the release. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 453.) However, even if they had, judicial notice would not have been proper.  Although a trial court may properly take judicial notice of the records of any court of record of any state of the United States (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d); <em>Day </em>v. <em>Sharp </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914 [123 Cal.Rptr. 918]), there is no indication that the release in this case was part of any court record. Typically, the release in a personal injury suit is not filed with the court. Thus, the trial court here improperly considered the contents of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Both parties agree the cases to be considered on this appeal are <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 46 [190 Cal.Rptr. 705] and <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>Yosemite-Great Falls Ins. Co. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 26 [200 Cal.Rptr. 26]. Plaintiff, however, urges this court not to follow <em>Trujillo. </em>The <em>Trujillo </em>court interpreted <em>Rodriguez </em>as requiring a plaintiff to plead \u201c. . .the allegedly inadequate settlement [of the underlying personal injury action] was accompanied by an express reservation of the right to claim more in a bad faith action . . . .\u201d in order to state a cause of action for bad faith against an insurer. <em>(Trujillo </em>v. <em>Yosemite-Great Falls Ins. Co., supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at p. 28.)  However, before reaching the <em>Trujillo </em>issue, we must address the threshold question of whether plaintiff\u2019s underlying personal injury action was \u201cconcluded\u201d for purposes of <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 880 [153 Cal.Rptr. 842, 592 P.2d 329].</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In <em>Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 884 the Supreme Court held a third party claimant may sue an insurer for violating section 790.03, subdivision (h), only after the action between the injured party and the insured is \u201cconcluded.\u201d The court explained the purpose of this requirement as follows: \u201c. . . unless the trial against the insurer is postponed until the liability of the insured is first determined, the defense of the insured may be seriously hampered by discovery initiated by the injured claimant against the insurer. In addition, damages suffered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>injured party as a result of the insurer\u2019s violation of subdivisions (h)(5) and (h)(14) may best be determined after the conclusion of the action by the third party claimant against the insured.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d at p. 48 expanded the concept of the \u201cconclusion\u201d of the action to include acceptance of a statutory offer (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 998) in addition to a final judgment. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>plaintiff accepted the statutory offer from Fireman\u2019s but notified Fireman\u2019s she was reserving her right to proceed against it and was releasing only its insured from further liability. After voluntarily dismissing her action against the insured with prejudice, she brought suit against Fireman\u2019s, alleging it violated section 793.03, subdivision (h). She also alleged at the time she accepted the settlement offer she advised Fireman\u2019s she was \u201c \u2018reserving her right to proceed\u2019 \u201d against it for claims she might have for \u201c \u2018bad faith and tortious conduct\u2019 arising in the handling of her claim.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 50.) The trial court sustained Fireman\u2019s demurrer to her complaint without leave to amend, holding no action by a third party claimant against an insurer should lie unless a judgment is first entered against the insured. The trial court also held plaintiff\u2019s reservation of rights to proceed against Fireman\u2019s had no legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On appeal, the <em>Rodriguez </em>court reversed, holding \u201c[wjhile a preferred <em>conclusion </em>of an action is by final judgment, in cases where the liability of the insured is admitted and the underlying lawsuit is concluded by the statutory acceptance of an offer (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 998) followed by a judgment entered thereafter or an injured plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, the requirements of <em>Royal Globe </em>are satisfied.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 CaI.App.3d at p. 53.) The court held plaintiff\u2019s action was \u201cconcluded\u201d when she dismissed it with prejudice. <em>9Id., </em>at p. 54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Here, plaintiff alleged settlement of her personal injury claim, accompanied by execution of a release of all claims. In our view, this allegation is sufficient to show her underlying personal injury claim was concluded within the meaning of <em>Royal Globe. Rodriguez </em>contained several factors establishing the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s action which are not present here\u2014 a statutory offer, an admission of liability by the insured, and a dismissal with prejudice. However, the existence of these factors is not necessary to a finding that a plaintiff favorably concluded her underlying personal injury action. We hold, by pleading a settlement and release, plaintiff has met the minimum requirements for establishing her action was concluded within the meaning of <em>Royal Globe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We next address plaintiff\u2019s argument that her failure to plead a reservation of the right to pursue a bad faith action does not render her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>plaint for unfair claims practices demurrable. The court in <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>Yosemite-Great Falls Ins. Co., supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at pp. 28-29 interpreted <em>Rodriguez </em>to authorize a bad faith action against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer after settlement only if the plaintiff had pled an express reservation of her right to pursue such an action. However, in reaching its decision, the <em>Trujillo </em>court placed undue emphasis upon a footnote in <em>Rodriguez </em>which was intended merely to show that Fireman\u2019s \u201c. . . must have known that the settlement reached was not the end of the matter.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d at p. 56, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In refusing to follow <em>Trujillo, </em>we instead emphasize that portion of <em>Rodriguez </em>in which the court recognized the possibility that a decision in plaintiff\u2019s favor might encourage the filing of bad faith lawsuits and discourage settlement, but noted it was \u201c. . . not so naive as to not recognize the equal if not greater possibility of abuse by insurance companies who might entice a settlement by unfair practices, then seek to hide behind the cloak of that settlement.\u201d <em>(Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.3d at p. 56.) Accordingly, we hold a plaintiff\u2019s failure to plead a reservation of her right to pursue a bad faith action does not render her complaint for unfair claims practices demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed. The case is remanded to the superior court with directions to enter an order overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Crosby, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-11\">All statutory references are to the Insurance Code, unless otherwise provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Section 790.03 provides: \u201cThe following are hereby defined as unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">\u201c(h) Knowingly committing or performing with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice any of the following unfair claims settlement practices:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">\u201c(5) Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-15\">Plaintiff did not allege in her complaint that she had filed a personal injury action.
