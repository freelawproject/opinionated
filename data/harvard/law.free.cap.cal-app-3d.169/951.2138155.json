J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZZ\">Defendant Darrell Williams was found guilty by a jury\u2019s verdicts of receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496) and, having previously been convicted of a felony, with possession of a concealable firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021). He had admitted three prior felony convictions. The appeal is from the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">No contention is made of a lack of substantial evidence of Williams\u2019 guilt of receiving stolen property. Nor could he reasonably do so for, among other things, he was admittedly in possession of a handgun and bullets stolen in a recent burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">For reasons as will presently appear we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">Upon a so-called <em>Beagle (People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1]) motion, Williams had sought to suppress evidence of his prior felony convictions for purposes of impeachment should he become a witness on his own behalf. The superior court denied the motion, stating: \u201cNothing within [the state\u2019s Constitution, article I] section 28, subdivision (d), could affect section 352. Thus, subdivision (f), dealing with the use of priors, is not included within this limitation. Consequently, section 352 cannot limit the constitutional mandate of subdivision (f) that priors may be used for impeachment without limitation. . . . <em>There is no law, at least to date, that would indicate to the court that it can exercise its </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>discretion with regard to Evidence Code section 352 </em>as it relates to use of priors.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Williams thereafter testified at the trial, and was impeached by proof of his prior felony convictions for burglary, automobile theft, and battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The issue of the appeal is whether the trial court erred in holding that it had no discretion, under Evidence Code section 352, to suppress evidence of such prior felony convictions for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">As noted, the appeal concerns the application of the recently adopted (June 8, 1982) article I, section 28 of the state\u2019s Constitution, commonly known as \u201cProposition 8.\u201d Hereafter we shall refer to the constitutional amendment as \u201cSection 28.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Subdivision (f) of Section 28, as here relevant, provides: <em>\u201cUse of Prior Convictions. </em>Any prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used <em>without limitation </em>for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding.\u201d (The latter italics only, is ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">And Section 28\u2019s subdivision (d), entitled <em>\u201cRight to Truth-in-Evidence,\u201d </em>recites in part: \u201c. . . Nothing in this <em>section </em>[our italics] shall affect any existing statutory rule of evidence relating to . . . Evidence Code, Section[] 352, ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">(Our reference hereafter to subdivisions (d) and (f) will be to those subdivisions of Section 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">An ambiguity will be seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Prior felony convictions are patently, at least in most cases, <em>relevant evidence </em>bearing upon the credibility of a witness. Subdivision (f) says that such prior convictions <em>\u201cshall ... be used without limitation </em>for purposes of impeachment,\u201d while subdivision (d) recites that the use of such priors <em>shall be restricted </em>according to Evidence Code <em>section 352, </em>and other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">Evidence Code section 352, states: \u201cThe [trial] court <em>in its discretion </em>may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d (Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>The ambiguity has been resolved by the state\u2019s high court\u2019s very recent (Mar. 11, 1985) decision of <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], hereafter <em>\u201cCastro. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">A threshold question appears. Some disagreement seems to exist among judges and lawyers as to the controlling effect of <em>Castro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><em>Castro's </em>principal opinion was authored and signed by Justice Kaus, and signed by Justices Mosk and Broussard. Its holding was dichotomous.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The principal opinion first held that the \u201cwithout limitation\u201d language of subdivision (f) was nevertheless modified by subdivision (d)\u2019s continuation of discretion in the trial court under Evidence Code section 352. In this holding the three justices were joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Reynoso, for a total of <em>five </em>justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The principal opinion\u2019s second holding was that any such prior felony conviction must be <em>relevant </em>to the issue of credibility, <em>and </em>that accordingly subdivision (f)\u2019s \u201cwithout limitation\u201d provision related <em>only </em>to prior felony convictions involving \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d In this, the principal opinion\u2019s justices were joined by Justice Grodin\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion. On that holding the total was <em>four </em>justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">It will be seen that the holdings of <em>Castro </em>were accordingly by a majority of the Supreme Court. And they are binding upon all of the lesser reviewing and trial courts of this state. (See <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">We elaborate upon the application of Section 28, and <em>Castro, </em>to the appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">At the start of this discussion we observe the high court\u2019s comment in respect of Section 28: \u201cFaced with a constitutional amendment adopted by initiative, . . ., we are obliged to set aside our personal philosophies and to give effect to the expression of popular will, as best we can ascertain it, within the framework of overriding constitutional guarantees.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 879 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\"><em>Castro's </em>subject, Maria Castro, was charged with, and convicted of, receiving stolen property. At her trial, the court ruled that if she testified on her own behalf, she might be impeached by proof of her prior convictions of possession of heroin, and possession of heroin for sale. The trial court, as here, deeming itself without discretion under Evidence Code section 352, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>had felt bound by the absolute \u201cwithout limitation\u201d language of subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The issues before the high court were whether the trial court had erred in relation to Section 28 and, if so, whether the error was harmless. The first assertion of error to be addressed was whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was compatible with Section 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>Castro\u2019s </em>opinion was, understandably, extensive. Its gist, for our purposes, may reasonably be condensed to the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The Supreme Court was convinced \u201cthat section 28 was not intended to abrogate the traditional and inherent power of the trial court to control the admission of evidence by the exercise of discretion to exclude marginally relevant but prejudicial matter\u2014as, indeed, is provided by Evidence Code section 352.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 306.) It was said that there were considerations before the voters \u201cwhich suggest that the trial court should not be stripped of [prior conviction] discretion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 313.) And, \u201cthe [Section 28] initiative itself expressed continued trust in the discretion of the trial courts; despite the mandatory admonitions, that discretion under section 352 was expressly retained.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) At Castro\u2019s </em>conclusion it was \u201creemphasized\u201d that \u201csuch admissibility is subject to <em>trial court </em>discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The opinion had pointed out that the court in <em>Beagle (People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 441) had \u201cmade it clear that <em>we did not intend to establish rigid standards </em>to govern the exercise of [the trial court\u2019s] discretion.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 307.) Nevertheless, it said, \u201cwe handed down a series of decisions delineating the boundaries of permissible discretion.\u201d Such restrictive decisions were named: <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43], <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833], <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 109 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771], <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodard </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 329 [152 Cal.Rptr. 536, 590 P.2d 391], <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 222 [155 Cal.Rptr. 194, 594 P.2d 19], <em>People </em>v. <em>Spearman </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 107 [157 Cal.Rptr. 883, 599 P.2d 74], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrick </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 115 [187 Cal.Rptr. 716, 654 P.2d 1243]. \u201c[Hjowever [the <em>Castro </em>opinion said] the dissents [of such cases] expressed a minority view that the guidelines of <em>Beagle </em>had, in fact, become rigid limitations on the discretion of the trial court.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">And the <em>Castro </em>court emphasized that: \u201c[T]here seems to be little doubt that the drafters of section 28 <em>wanted a change and that the voters legislated it.\u201d (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number><em>Castro </em>must fairly be read as holding that Evidence Code section 352\u2019s trial court discretion, where prior felony convictions are offered for impeachment, will not lightly be disturbed by the state\u2019s reviewing courts. The \u201crigid limitations\u201d of the above-noted <em>Beagle-Antick-Rist, </em>etc. line of cases no <em>longer </em>stand as a matter of law, but the holdings of those cases are nevertheless legitimate considerations in the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion under Evidence Code section 352. But in such a case the trial court may <em>not </em>abdicate, but <em>must </em>exercise, its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Ruling on the remaining assertion of error, <em>Castro </em>held \u201cthat\u2014always subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under section 352\u2014subdivision (f) authorizes the use of any felony conviction which necessarily involves <em>moral turpitude, </em>even if the immoral trait is one other than dishonesty.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The rationale of <em>Castro </em>on this issue was stated as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\u201cIt is . . . appropriate that we remind ourselves of the precise progression of inferences which may lead a trier of fact to conclude that proof of a felony conviction may affect the credibility of a witness. The classic statement of the rationale for felony impeachment is that of Justice Holmes, written when he was still a member of the Supreme Judicial Council of Massachusetts: \u2018[Wjhen it is proved that a witness has been convicted of crime, the only ground for disbelieving him which such proof affords is the <em>general readiness to do evil </em>which the conviction may be supposed to show. It is from that general disposition alone that the jury is asked to infer a readiness to lie in a particular case, and thence that he has lied in fact. The evidence has no tendency to prove that he was mistaken, but only that he has perjured himself, and it reaches that conclusion solely through the general proposition that he is of <em>bad character </em>and unworthy of credit.\u2019 ... It follows, therefore [the plurality opinion said] that if the felony of which the witness has been convicted does not show a \u2018readiness to do evil,\u2019 the fact of conviction simply will not support an inference of readiness to lie. . . . Nevertheless, it is undeniable that a witness\u2019 moral depravity of any kind has some \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 ... to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty. . . . There is then some basis\u2014however tenuous\u2014for inferring that a person who has committed a crime which involves moral turpitude other than dishonesty is more likely to be dishonest than a witness about whom no such thing is known. Certainly the inference is not so irrational that it is beyond the power of the People to decree that in a proper case the jury must be permitted to draw it, if it wishes, and the \u2018no limitation\u2019 language of subdivision (f) makes it abundantly clear that the People so decreed.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at pp. 314-315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number><em>Castro </em>then pointed out, in aid of the trial courts\u2019 future exercise of discretion, that prior convictions involving <em>moral turpitude </em>ordinarily included those for such offenses as involved dishonesty, or child abuse, or those committed by force and violence or brutality or threat thereof, or as in <em>Castro </em>possession of heroin for sale, or \u201cmoral depravity of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">And the high court\u2019s previous rulings that prior convictions with moral turpitude which were \u201cremote\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 79), or \u201csimilar\u201d to the charged offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rist, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra; </em>24 Cal.3d 222; <em>People </em>v. <em>Spearman, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 107), or of a nonparty witness <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodard, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 329), were inadmissible, were as noted, questioned. Prior convictions with moral turpitude which were only \u201cmarginally relevant\u201d might be properly admitted; in such cases their probative value would be for the determination of the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We now apply <em>Castro </em>to the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">It will be remembered that the prior convictions of the case before us were burglary, automobile theft, and battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate. As to the burglary and automobile theft convictions, moral turpitude was clearly involved. And, we opine, that battery by a jail inmate upon a noninmate, a crime of violence, demonstrates \u201ca general readiness to do evil,\u201d and thus moral turpitude. All reasonably lay within the broad discretion reposed in the trial court by <em>Castro </em>and Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">But here, as we have pointed out, the trial court believing that it had none, <em>did not exercise its discretion. </em>In this it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">But, having read the entire record furnished us, we conclude that the evidence of Williams\u2019 guilt will reasonably be described as exceedingly strong. Upon our review of the entire record we are of the opinion that it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have occurred in the absence of error. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">NEWSOM, J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion reached by the majority opinion that our high court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111] held that article I, section 28, of the California Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>tution (section 28) insofar as it can be understood at all, requires a balancing of relevance against prejudice in the trial court as a limitation upon the admission into evidence of prior felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">A perusal of the political context in which the amendment was adopted leaves no doubt that the electorate intended by it to abolish all restrictions on the admissibility of prior felonies, as Justice Grodin\u2019s concurrence in <em>Castro </em>concludes. However, led by blind guides who were apparently unable to point in any clear direction, the People adopted instead a constitutional amendment which is a masterpiece of ambiguity and which cries out\u2014 not for explication which the majority opinion in <em>Castro </em>bravely attempted\u2014 but for extinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The second holding of <em>Castro, </em>as delineated by the majority opinion here, is that henceforth the test of admissibility shall also require a finding that, to be admissible, the felony must be one involving \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d the equivalent, as said in <em>Castro, </em>of Justice Holmes\u2019 celebrated aphorism, \u201ca general readiness to do evil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">It is a measure of the degradation of our language that a distinction between felonies which do or do not involve \u201cturpitude\u201d should have to be made. While it is true that the antecedents of the concept of felony are obscure and the reasons why a criminal act should be regarded as a felony rather than a misdemeanor are imperfectly understood, it had until fairly recent times been agreed that a felony is a crime involving wicked, base or shameful conduct. Thus, Eric Partridge gives as the root of \u201cfelony\u201d the Middle English \u201cfell,\u201d which meant \u201ccruel,\u201d and itself derived from the Old French for \u201cwicked.\u201d (Partridge, Origins (2d ed. 1959) p. 739.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Today, however, in California among other jurisdictions, it is perfectly possible to commit a felony which, as Justice Kaus points out in <em>Castro, </em>\u201cdo[es] not connote moral laxity of any kind.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 316.) Thus, for example, the new genre of corporate securities crimes wherein the doing of a morally neutral but statutorily forbidden act merely \u201cwillfully\u201d is by a convenient fiction said to comport with the requirement of mens rea as set forth in Penal Code section 20 and ignored with regularity by our courts. (Cf., i.e., <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonda </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 774, 779 [188 Cal.Rptr. 295], and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Under such circumstances of strict criminal liability, it is no wonder that our high court hesitates to permit the impeachment of a criminal defendant with the use of prior convictions which are entirely consonant with moral probity and from which even a Holmes would agree that no inference of a propensity toward evildoing could reasonably be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>In my view, too, our high court has entered the murkiest of waters in charging trial courts with the duty of defining <em>which </em>felonies fall within the penumbra of moral turpitude, since that phrase has no fixed meaning in law and is usually defined in the vaguest terms as, for example, describing \u201can act of baseness, vileness or depravity\u201d (2 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rawles\u2019 3d rev. ed.) p. 2247), i.e., the language traditionally used to distinguish a felony from a misdemeanor. The difficulty of determining whether such vileness inheres in a given act is well illustrated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolfe </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 795 [40 Cal.Rptr. 271, 394 P.2d 959], wherein the court struggled with the question of whether a teenage boy\u2019s murder of his mother involved a sufficient degree of personal turpitude to justify his conviction for first instead of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In conclusion, I think section 28 is a document so deeply flawed that it cannot be salvaged except at the cost of profound ongoing confusion in our judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">On the facts of the case at bench, I agree that the trial court\u2019s refusal to exercise its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 was harmless error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
