J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">The minor, appellant Roy C., appeals from the order continuing him as a ward of the juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602) following a finding that he committed an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)). We determine that the juvenile court erred in allowing the People to amend the petition after the close of the People\u2019s case-in-chief to charge a crime which was not a necessarily included offense to the offenses charged in the petition. Such amendment made without adequate notice to appellant violates the holding of our Supreme Court in <em>In re Robert G. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 437 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837], and we must reverse. <em>(Auto Equity Sales </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Appellant was charged in a petition filed July 2, 1984, with having committed robbery and battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 242).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the adjudication hearing concluded on July 18, 1984, evidence was presented that on May 29, 1984, 17-year-old Joel G. was waiting for a bus when Arnold H. requested that he accompany him behind a gas station to \u201chold his zigzags for him.\u201d Approximately 10 of Arnold\u2019s friends, including appellant, were waiting behind the gas station. As Joel held a \u201czigzag\u201d for Arnold to fill with marijuana, appellant struck Joel on the right ear with a closed fist, knocking him down. Appellant then kicked Joel several times in the stomach and, when Joel stood up, appellant struck him again in the face. One of appellant\u2019s companions tried unsuccessfully to remove Joel\u2019s wallet from his hip pocket. Another youth snatched a gold chain and medallion from Joel\u2019s neck. Appellant and his companions then boarded a bus and left the location. Joel saw appellant at San Fernando High School two days later and asked him to return his gold chain. Appellant said, \u201cI don\u2019t have it. Go ask somebody else. I don\u2019t know nothing. Don\u2019t come to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">At the conclusion of the People\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant moved to dismiss the robbery count, arguing a lack of sufficient evidence to support the charge as to appellant. The court denied the motion to dismiss and stated that it \u201cwould allow the prosecution to amend, to conform to the proof\u201d an additional count alleging a violation of section 245, subdivision (a). The petition was so amended over the objection of appellant\u2019s attorney who stated to the court that he was \u201cnot prepared to proceed on a 245.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Immediately thereafter, and without any discussion of a continuance, the court indicated to appellant\u2019s counsel that the defense may proceed. Appellant and Arnold H. testified on defense that appellant was a mere bystander as three other youths attacked Joel G. Upon conclusion of testimony and argument, the court sustained the allegation that the minor committed assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)) and found the allegation that appellant had committed robbery untrue (\u00a7 211). The battery charge (\u00a7 242) was dismissed as \u201cit\u2019s a same crime and . . . included ... in [the assault].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in amending the petition to allege a violation of section 245, subdivision (a), is meritorious. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is not an offense necessarily included within the crimes of battery or robbery, the offenses with which appellant was originally charged in the petition filed on July 2, 1984. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Yeats </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 874, 878 [136 Cal.Rptr. 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Amin </em>(1978) 88 Cal.App.3d 637, 640 [152 Cal.Rptr. 9].) Furthermore, the elements of the felonious assault were not expressly pleaded in the petition filed on July 2, 1984, and appellant did not receive adequate notice of the assault charge sufficient to comport with due process. <em>(In re Robert G. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 437, 440-445 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364, 368-373 [173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183].) The only notice of the amendment occurred at the conclusion of the People\u2019s case-in-chief; and appellant\u2019s counsel was \u201cnot prepared to proceed on a 245.\u201d Furthermore, no continuance was offered to prevent prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The situation presented in this appeal is on \u201call fours\u201d with our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Robert G., supra. </em>In <em>Robert G., </em>the minor was declared a ward of the juvenile court based on the finding that he had committed a battery (\u00a7 242). The petition alleged that the minor had committed an assault with a deadly weapon, a rock (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)). Although the juvenile court agreed with the minor that the small rock he had thrown could not be a deadly weapon, it denied his motion for acquittal. The juvenile court also acknowledged that battery was not a lesser offense necessarily included within the assault with a deadly weapon charge, but it nevertheless permitted amendment of the petition to conform to the evidence presented during the adjudication hearing and sustained it as so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Robert G. </em>reversed the finding of wardship and held that a petition filed pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 may not be sustained on findings that the minor had committed an offense or offenses other than those specifically alleged in the petition or necessarily included within an alleged offense, unless the minor consents to a finding on the substituted charge. The unanimous opinion authored by Justice Richardson states: \u201cIn <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Lohbauer </em>[(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364] we reversed an adult criminal defendant\u2019s conviction of trespass (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602.5) on an information which charged him with burglary <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 459). We noted that \u2018 \u201cWhen a defendant pleads not guilty, the court lacks jurisdiction to convict him of an offense that is neither charged nor necessarily included in the alleged crime. [Citations.] This reasoning rests upon a constitutional basis: \u2018Due process of law requires that an accused be advised of the charges against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at his trial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 595, 612 ....)\u2019 <em>(Lohbauer, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>\u201cWe explained further in <em>Lohbauer </em>that the notice required by due process is given, with respect to lesser offenses, <em>either </em>\u2018when the specific language of the accusatory pleading adequately warns the defendant that the People will seek to prove the elements of the lesser offense\u2019 <em>(Lohbauer, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 368-369; see <em>West, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 612 [91 Cal.Rptr. 385, 477 P.2d 409]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 394, 405 [309 P.2d 456]), <em>or </em>when \u2018the lesser offense is \u201cnecessarily included\u201d within the statutory definition of the charged offense . . . . \u2019 <em>(Lohbauer, supra, </em>at p. 369; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1159.) .... [Italics in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201cThe People urge, however, that because appellant is a juvenile, different rules apply. They note that Welfare and Institutions Code section 678 provides for the application to juvenile court proceedings of the liberal rules relating to variance and amendment of pleadings set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure. Drawing upon this statute, they argue that the juvenile court has authority to permit the amendment of the accusatory pleading to conform to the proof so long as the juvenile has not been misled to his prejudice in maintaining his defense. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 469, 470.) Under the present circumstances, the People conclude, no such prejudice occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cWe cannot agree. In <em>Lohbauer </em>we rejected a strikingly similar contention that any variance between an offense charged and a lesser offense of which a defendant is convicted should be deemed immaterial unless it could be shown that \u2018 \u201cthe defendant was misled to his prejudice and prevented from preparing an effective defense.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Lohbauer, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 369-370.) We first noted that statutory authorization for convicting a defendant of a \u2018necessarily included\u2019 offense had uniformly required application of the <em>Pendleton </em>test. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 370; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">\u201cEqually important to our rejection of a new standard for immaterial variances, however, were due process implications. We observed: <em>\u2018It may be very difficult to ascertain from developments which occur during trial whether a defendant is \u201cmisled to his </em>prejudice\u201d <em>and \u201cprevented from preparing an effective defense. </em>\u201d <em>It may never be known with any confidence after a conviction what defenses might have been asserted had defendant been given adequate and advance notice of the possible offenses for which he was criminally vulnerable. </em>[Italics added.] <em>Insisting that he be informed in the accusatory pleading of the charges against him, on the other hand, fully satisfies a well established fundamental of due process. </em>\u2019 <em>(Lohbauer, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at p. 370 [italics in original].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>\u201cThe foregoing concerns are no less relevant to juvenile court proceedings. \u2018[D]ue process requires that a minor, like an adult, have adequate notice of the charge so that he may intelligently prepare his defense. <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 33 . . . .)\u2019 <em>(In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 233 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].) Compliance with this requirement has been held by the Supreme Court to mandate that the minor \u2018be notified, in writing, of the specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing, and that such written notice be given at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation. \u2019 <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at p. 33 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, at p. 549, 87 S.Ct. 1428].)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201cWe carefully explained in <em>Arthur N. </em>the effect of the foregoing notice requirement upon the statutory authorization for applying rules of civil procedure to juvenile court matters (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 678), as follows: \u2018In thus permitting amendments to conform to proof (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 470, 471) when the minor has not been misled in preparing his defense and will not be prejudiced thereby (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 469), the Legislature has demonstrated its intention to permit the court to sustain a petition if the evidence, while insufficient to establish that the minor committed the charged offense, is nonetheless adequate to prove <em>a lesser, included of</em>fense. \u2019 <em>(Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 233-234 [italics in original].) From our previous discussion of the issue in that case, it is clear that the italicized language referred to a \u2018necessarily included\u2019 offense. <em>(Id., at </em>p. 233.) Thus, in <em>Arthur N., </em>the rules permitting liberal amendment in civil matters to cure immaterial variances were reconciled with the requirements of due process of law in juvenile proceedings. The limitation there imposed upon the former represents a reasonable accommodation to the demands of the latter.\u201d <em>(In re Robert G., supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 440-443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In <em>Robert G., </em>the minor moved for acquittal on the grounds that the People\u2019s evidence did not show a deadly weapon as charged. While the court agreed with the minor that the rock could not be a deadly weapon, the court denied the motion for acquittal. When the minor rested his case without presenting evidence, the prosecution requested that the court sustain the petition on another sentence, namely, battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Respondent argues that the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Robert G. </em>because the petition was duly amended at the close of the People\u2019s case-in-chief prior to any defense proffered by appellant. This argument lacks merit because the prejudice to appellant had already attached because of the lack of adequate notice of the new charge, whether or not a defense was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>sented or regardless of the nature of such defense. For example, given adequate time appellant could have developed a defense that the attack was not felonious in nature because it was not an assault which would likely lead to great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">It is fundamental that a defendant may rest his case without presenting evidence and move for an acquittal on grounds that the People had not presented sufficient evidence to sustain the charges filed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Townsend </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 919, 923-924 [98 Cal.Rptr. 8] and CALJIC No. 2.61 (4th ed. 1979).) When the juvenile court denied the motion for an acquittal in the instant case and allowed the People to amend the petition to include an additional charge which was not necessarily included in the offenses contained in the petition, the appellant was faced with a Hobson\u2019s choice:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1) present no defense, risk being continued in custody at juvenile hall on a sustained petition and appeal the court\u2019s ruling based on the decision in <em>Robert G. </em>(which would have mandated certain reversal); or, (2) give up the right to a speedy trial, move for a continuance and prepare a defense to meet the new charges; or, (3) give up the due process right to receive adequate notice of the new charge filed, present whatever defense counsel could make given the time allowed and submit the matter to the court for decision. Given this dilemma, we cannot conclude that the minor\u2019s decision to proceed with the defense of the case could be construed as a waiver of his right to appeal the violation of his due process right to receive adequate notice of the amended charge. The holding in <em>Robert G. </em>mandates reversal because prejudice must be presumed since we cannot speculate what \u201c \u2018defenses might have been asserted had defendant been given adequate and advance notice of the possible offenses for which he was criminally vulnerable.\u201d\u2019 <em>(In re Robert </em>G., <em>supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The order continuing wardship is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\">All subsequent references shall be to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-14\">For instance, a criminal defendant may often be faced with the dilemma of choosing between Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. (See <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 377, 389-393 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1258, 88 S.Ct. 967].) Here the dilemma could have been easily avoided if the prosecution had more carefully pleaded and prepared the case prior to trial. The People\u2019s failure to plead what they could reasonably expect to prove should not fall upon appellant\u2019s shoulders to his detriment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b756-8\">DANIELSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">I concur in the opinion and decision in the light of <em>In re Robert G. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 437 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837], and the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b756-13\">ARABIAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap-\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>\u201cIf rogues did but know all the pains that the law has taken for their benefit, honest men would have nothing left they could call their own.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Appellant relies on <em>In re Robert G. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 437 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837], in contending the order of wardship must be reversed. He argues that inasmuch as an assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)) is not an offense with which appellant was originally charged, and is not an offense necessarily included within the charged crimes of battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 242) or robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), he did not receive adequate notice of the felonious assault charge sufficient to comport with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In <em>Robert G. </em>a minor was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602) based on a finding that he had committed a battery in violation of Penal Code section 242. The petition, however, alleged that the minor had committed an assault with a deadly weapon, a rock, in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a). The juvenile court agreed that the small rock Robert G. had thrown could not be a deadly weapon and acknowledged that battery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 242) was not a lesser offense necessarily included within the assault with a deadly weapon charge (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)), but it permitted amendment of the petition to conform to the evidence and sustained it as so amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cthat a wardship petition under \u00a7 602 may not be sustained upon findings that the minor has committed an offense or offenses other than the one specifically alleged in the petition or necessarily included within an alleged offense, unless the minor consents to a finding on a substituted charge.\u201d <em>(In re Robert G., supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The Court summarized its due process concerns as follows: \u201c \u2018[D]ue process requires that a minor, like an adult, have adequate notice of the charge so that he may intelligently prepare his defense. [Citations.] Compliance with this requirement has been held by the Supreme Court to mandate that the minor \u2018be notified, in writing, of the specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing, and that such written notice be given at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Robert G., supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In the instant case, although there was a technical departure from the notice requirements of <em>Robert G., </em>appellant received adequate notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>charges against him before he was required to present his defense. In <em>Robert G. </em>the petition was amended after the defendant had rested without presenting evidence. (31 Cal.3d at pp. 439-440.) Here, after the petition was amended, appellant presented a full defense. His defense, based on his own testimony and that of Arnold H., was that he was merely a bystander who witnessed the events and that someone else hit and kicked the victim Joel. Not only was that defense of mistaken identity appropriate for all allegations of the petition, including the newly added felonious assault allegation, but even had appellant been charged with the offense before the hearing, he could not have presented a stronger defense than to say, \u201cIt was not I.\u201d As such, he was not misled, surprised,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor prejudiced and we need not speculate as to his assertible defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Moreover, following the People\u2019s case-in-chief, when the court indicated it was going to amend the petition to add the Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a), violation, appellant\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to, and did, argue that the charge should be dismissed because the evidence was insufficient to show the assault was made by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">I conclude, therefore, that because the petition was amended at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, before appellant presented his defense, this case is clearly distinguishable from <em>In re Robert G.; </em>appellant was not denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 25, 1985.
