Plaintiff filed in the probate proceeding a creditor\u2019s claim for $222,770 which included $840 as rent for the property which the executor of the estate wrongfully collected from plaintiff in view of the decedent\u2019s promise to plaintiff that she could occupy an apartment on the property rent-free for so long as she chose; and specific performance of decedent\u2019s promise to devise the property to plaintiff, or alternatively damages of $200,000 (the estimated value of the property). The executor rejected the claim. From September 21, 1981 to June 8, 1982, at the express request of the decedent and upon her express promise to pay the sums and do the other things described in the claim, plaintiff performed the services and did the things described in the claim. Prior to November 10, 1981, plaintiff and decedent entered into an oral contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cmemorialized in part\u201d by a writing dated November 10, 1981, and signed by decedent. By the terms of said contract plaintiff agreed to supply personal services to decedent and decedent agreed to devise the property to plaintiff. The contract \u201cwas just and reasonable as to decedent\u201d and the \u201cconsideration accruing to decedent was adequate\u201d in that she desired to reward plaintiff for past services, spiritual assistance, help and friendship and had need of the future personal services plaintiff agreed to supply. In reliance on the contract plaintiff performed numerous and varied services for decedent from September 21, 1981 to June 8, 1982, and thus has performed all conditions, covenants and provisions required of her by the contract. Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law in that the writing of November 10, 1981, does not qualify as a valid will. Attached to the complaint, and incorporated therein by reference, were copies of the writing of November 10, 1981, and of a writing dated October 1981 which was the basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim of the right to reside rent-free in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Defendant answered the complaint and cross-complained for declaratory relief. The cross-complaint sought a declaration that plaintiff and decedent did not enter into an oral contract or a written contract whereby decedent agreed to devise the property to plaintiff; that plaintiff is not the beneficiary of a constructive trust on the property; and that the writing of October 1981 did not give plaintiff any possessory right to occupy the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">After plaintiff answered the cross-complaint defendant moved for summary judgment in its favor on the complaint and for an order determining that the following issues in the cross-complaint are without substantial controversy: plaintiff\u2019s claim of the right to live rent-free on the property after decedent\u2019s death is barred by her failure to file a creditor\u2019s claim in decedent\u2019s estate asserting that right; plaintiff is not entitled to the equitable remedy of declaratory relief in her favor because the equities favor defendant. The motion was granted. Judgment was entered ordering that plaintiff take nothing as against defendant; that plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration that a constructive trust be imposed for her benefit against the property; and that plaintiff has not acquired a possessory right to occupy the property rent-free for any period following the death of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In its answer to the complaint defendant alleged, as an affirmative defense, that the alleged oral agreement between plaintiff and the decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>is invalid under the statute of frauds. Defendant also made that argument in support of its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">At the time the oral contract to devise property allegedly was made, Civil Code section 1624 (statute of frauds) provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe following contracts are invalid, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by his agent: . . . [|] 6. An agreement which by its terms is not to be performed during the lifetime of the promisor, <em>or an agreement to devise or bequeath any property, or to make any provision for any person by will; . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)  The statute of frauds does not apply where the plaintiff is entitled to the imposition of a constructive trust, for such a trust arises by operation of law. <em>(Briggs </em>v. <em>Nilson </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 342, 346 [38 Cal.Rptr. 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The purpose of the within constructive trust action is to enforce an oral contract to devise property, in equity, by quasi-specific performance. (See <em>Dini </em>v. <em>Dini </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 506, 513 [10 Cal.Rptr. 570].)  \u201cThe relief which may be granted in an action for quasi-specific performance of a contract to bequeath or devise property is the imposition of a constructive trust upon the property in favor of the promisee-plaintiff. It differs from the relief which would be available in a traditional specific performance action, and the remedy bears a different name, because the court cannot compel the making of a will.\u201d <em>(Porporato </em>v. <em>Devincenzi </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 670, 674 [68 Cal.Rptr. 210].)  The elements requisite to relief in such an action are: (1) a contract sufficiently definite in its terms to be enforced; (2) that the contract was just and reasonable; (3) that plaintiff performed his side of the bargain; (4) that the promisor failed to perform; (5) that the contract was supported by adequate consideration; (6) that the remedy at law is inadequate; and (7) where the contract was oral, the complaint also must allege that defendant is estopped to rely on the statute of frauds because failure to enforce the contract would result in either unconscionable injury to plaintiff or the unjust enrichment of defendant. <em>(Porporato </em>v. <em>Devincenzi, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at pp. 674-675.)  The complaint in the present action did not allege, either expressly or by implication from facts which were alleged, that defendant is estopped to rely on the statute of frauds to establish the invalidity of the alleged oral contract whereby decedent agreed to devise the property to plaintiff. Accordingly, the complaint fails to state a cause of action for imposition of a constructive trust on the property effecting quasi-specific performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number> Failure to state a cause of action is a proper ground for granting summary judgment* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since \u201ca motion by a <em>defendant </em>under section 437c of the Code of Civil Procedure necessarily includes a test of the sufficiency of the complaint .... Motions for summary judgment in such situations have otherwise been allowed as being in legal effect motions for judgment on the pleadings. [Citation.]\u201d (C. <em>L. Smith Co. </em>v. <em>Roger Ducharme, Inc. </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 735, 745 [135 Cal.Rptr. 483]; original italics. See also <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Legal Process &amp; Courier Service </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1245-1246 [209 Cal.Rptr. 189]; <em>Stance </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 838, 844 [202 Cal.Rptr. 480]; <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Delta Lines, Inc., supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d 674, 682; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Critchfield </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 858, 862, fn. 1 [161 Cal.Rptr. 342]; <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 710 [136 Cal.Rptr. 871].) Inasmuch as summary judgment on the complaint is sustainable on that ground, we need not determine whether a triable issue of fact exists regarding plaintiff\u2019s right to the imposition of a constructive trust based on the alleged oral agreement. (See <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Legal Process &amp; Courier Service, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1244-1245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The complaint alleged that the oral contract whereby decedent agreed to devise the property to plaintiff was \u201cmemorialized in part\u201d by a writing dated November 10, 1981, and signed by decedent. Thus, plaintiff apparently relies on a written contract, as well as an oral contract, as the basis for imposition of a constructive trust. The writing of November 10, 1981 reads:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cNov. 10, 81</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201cTo whom it may concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cIn gratitude to lone Dominique Lombardo for her dear friendship, love &amp; many services rendered for my comfort &amp; welfare it is my sincere desire that she remain in house at 938 2nd St. Upon my death I bequeath to her the said property at 938 2nd St. &amp; an allowance to feed the pets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">/s/ Clara C. Hollowell\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">In order to satisfy the statute of frauds a written note or memorandum of a contract must state with reasonable certainty (1) each party to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>contract, (2) the subject matter to which the contract relates, and (3) the terms and conditions of all promises constituting the contract and by whom and to whom the promises are made. <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>Klaff </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 471, 476-477 [216 P.2d 15]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1973) Contracts, \u00a7 206, p. 187.)  The writing of November 10, 1981, fails to meet the third requirement inasmuch as it contains no promise by either the decedent or plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Where a writing discloses no promise or agreement and cannot be made clear as to its significance without resort to parol evidence, it is inadequate to satisfy the statute of frauds. <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 570, 574 [30 Cal.Rptr. 530, 381 P.2d 386].)  \u201cThe parol evidence rule operates to bar extrinsic evidence which contradicts the terms of a written contract. [Citation.] It \u2018is not a rule of evidence but is one of substantive law. It does not exclude evidence for any of the reasons ordinarily requiring exclusion, based on the probative value of such evidence or the policy of its admission. The rule as applied to contracts is simply that as a matter of substantive law, a certain act, the act of embodying the complete terms of an agreement in a writing (the \u2018integration\u2019) <em>becomes the contract of the parties. </em>The point then is, not how the agreement is to be proved, because as a matter of law the writing is the agreement. Extrinsic evidence is excluded because it cannot serve to prove what the agreement was, this being determined as a matter of law to be the writing itself. \u2019 (Italics in original.) [Citations.]  [f] In contrast to the rationale of the rule barring parol evidence, the \u2018Purpose of the statute of frauds is to prevent fraud and perjury with respect to certain agreements by requiring for enforcement the more reliable evidence of some writing signed by the party to be charged . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Thus the statute of frauds excludes proof of certain types of agreements which are not sufficiently evidenced by a writing. [Citation.] <em>Every material term of an agreement within the statute of frauds must be reduced to writing. No essential element of a writing so required can be supplied by parol evidence. </em>\u201d <em>(Riley </em>v. <em>Bear Creek Planning Committee </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 500, 508-509 [131 Cal.Rptr. 381, 551 P.2d 1213]; latter italics added. See also <em>Ellis v. Klaff, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 471, 477; 1 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 204, pp. 184-185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Where no extrinsic evidence bears upon the interpretation of a contract, its construction becomes a matter of law. <em>(Yamanishi </em>v. <em>Bleily &amp; Collishaw, Inc. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 457, 462 [105 Cal.Rptr. 580].)  Inasmuch as parol evidence was not admissible to supply the missing element of the terms and conditions of the respective promises of decedent and plaintiff, the sufficiency of the November 10, 1981 writing to satisfy the statute of frauds presented an issue of law which the trial court was autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>rized to determine in the summary judgment proceeding. (See <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 372, 376 [203 Cal.Rptr. 706].) The court properly resolved that issue in favor of defendant. The writing in question does not qualify as a memorandum of contract within the meaning of the statute of frauds; it sets forth no promises by either the decedent or plaintiff, but merely expresses decedent\u2019s intention or desire to devise the property to plaintiff in appreciation of plaintiff\u2019s friendship for the decedent and her rendition of services to decedent. Accordingly, the writing furnishes no basis for the imposition of a constructive trust on the property in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The judgment declares that plaintiff did not acquire a possessory right to occupy the property rent-free following the death of decedent. Plaintiff\u2019s claim of such right was based on a writing dated October 1981. That writing, entirely in plaintiff\u2019s handwriting except for the decedent\u2019s signature, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\u201cOct 1981</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cTo whom it may concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cI entrust all my banking to lone Dominique Lombardo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201cI have complete &amp; utter trust in her to care for my well being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">\u201cShe is to rent &amp; care for apts. to remain rent free at 938 2nd St apt. D so long as she chooses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">/s/ Clara Hollowell\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">In her declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment plaintiff stated that by the above writing decedent transferred to plaintiff a life estate in the property. The trial court properly sustained defendant\u2019s objection to such evidence on the grounds that it constituted a legal opinion of a lay witness and further was not relevant to any issue in the action inasmuch as plaintiff did not claim a life estate either in her complaint or in her answer to the cross-complaint. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 350, 800; <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 280, 289 [198 Cal.Rptr. 517].)  No other evidence bearing on the October 1981 writing was presented by either party. Accordingly, the construction of that writing likewise presented an issue of law determinable in the summary judgment proceeding. (See <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp., supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 372, 376; <em>Yamanishi </em>v. <em>Bleily &amp; Collishaw, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 457, 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">Where no extrinsic evidence is presented in the trial court on the issue of the meaning of contractual language, the appellate function is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>same as that of the trial court, i.e., to arrive at a reasonable interpretation of the language in keeping with applicable rules of construction. <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 772, 775 [193 Cal.Rptr. 745].)  A contract must be considered as a whole and construed to give meaning to all of its parts if reasonably practicable. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641; <em>Vale </em>v. <em>Union Bank </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 330, 336 [151 Cal.Rptr. 784]; <em>Masonite Corp. </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 1, 8 [135 Cal.Rptr. 170].)  Viewed in accord with this rule of construction the writing of October 1981 appears to create an agency, the relation that results from the act of one person, the principal, who authorizes another, the agent, to conduct one or more transactions with one or more third persons and to exercise a degree of discretion in effecting the principal\u2019s purpose. <em>(Workman </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 36, 38 [72 Cal.Rptr. 509].) The opening line of the writing (\u201cto whom it may concern\u201d) indicates that the writing is to be shown to third persons; the first paragraph gives plaintiff broad authority to conduct decedent\u2019s banking; the second paragraph sets forth decedent\u2019s reason for conferring such authority; the third paragraph authorizes plaintiff to care for and rent apartments and to remain rent-free in the property \u201cso long as she chooses.\u201d  While consideration is not essential to the creation of an agency <em>(Housewright </em>v. <em>Pacific Far East Line, Inc. </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 259, 265 [40 Cal.Rptr. 208]), consideration here is expressed in the form of plaintiff\u2019s rent-free occupancy of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">An agency is terminated by the death of the principal unless the power of the agent is coupled with an interest in the subject of the agency. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2356, subd. (a)(2).) The requirements for the creation of an agency coupled with an interest are (1) that the agency be held for the benefit of the agent and not the principal, (2) that the agency is created to secure the performance of a duty to the agent or to protect a title in him, and (3) that the agency is created at the same time the duty or title is created or is created for consideration. <em>(Becket </em>v. <em>Welton Becket &amp; Associates </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 815, 820 [114 Cal.Rptr. 531].)  The first two requirements are not met in the present case. Accordingly, the death of the decedent effected the termination of the agency, including plaintiff\u2019s right to continue receiving compensation for her services as agent in the form of rent-free occupancy of her apartment.  Also pertinent is the principle that \u201c \u2018[i]f a person occupies premises belonging to his employer as a part of his compensation, he has no right to continue his occupation of the premises on the termination of his employment . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Eichhorn </em>v. <em>De La Cantera </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 50, 56 [255 P.2d 70].)  While there are certain differences between an agent and an employee, both are workers for another under an express or implied employment; one may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>both an agent and an employee. <em>(Gipson </em>v. <em>Davis Realty Co. </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 190, 205 [30 Cal.Rptr. 253]; <em>Ingle </em>v. <em>Bay Cities Transit Co. </em>(1945) 72 Cal.App.2d 283, 286 [164 P.2d 508].)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Much of plaintiff\u2019s opening brief is devoted to the argument that the trial court improperly sustained defendant\u2019s evidentiary objections to plaintiff\u2019s declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. It is unnecessary to consider this contention for the following reasons: (1) without regard to the evidentiary showing made by the respective parties, summary judgment was proper because the complaint failed to state a cause of action for imposition of a constructive trust based on the alleged oral contract to make a will; (2) parol evidence was inadmissible to supply the terms lacking in the writing of November 10, 1981, which were necessary in order to make that writing a sufficient memorandum of contract under the statute of frauds; and (3) there was no extrinsic evidence bearing upon interpretation of the writing of October 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Plaintiff also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment if it did so on the sole ground that plaintiff\u2019s opposing papers failed to set forth a separate statement responding to the material facts claimed by defendant to be undisputed. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The granting of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is supported by grounds other than plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Thompson, J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The parties henceforth are referred to as plaintiff and defendant, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">In addition to the Y.M.C.A., the complaint named as a defendant First Interstate Bank of California in its capacity as executor of the estate of Clara Hollowell, deceased.
