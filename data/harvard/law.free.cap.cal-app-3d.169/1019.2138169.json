We affirm all but the order for sanctions, which we reverse for failure adequately to specify the conduct or circumstances for which it was rendered (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.5, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Plaintiff Joan Celia Lavine, an attorney, is the surviving daughter, sole heir, and executor of the estate of Morris Lavine (Lavine). Lavine died at age 86 on November 25, 1982, while under treatment for numerous illnesses at defendant the Hospital of the Good Samaritan (hospital). Plaintiff, in all of the capacities mentioned above, has instituted an action against the hospital and certain of its staff charging tortious conduct resulting in Lavine\u2019s wrongful death and other damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">On October 14, 1982, one month before Lavine\u2019s death and before commencing the above-mentioned malpractice case, plaintiff filed on Lavine\u2019s behalf a separate action against the hospital, from which this appeal arises. Plaintiff sought declaratory, injunctive, and statutory relief under Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Code section 1158 (hereinafter, section 1158),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring the hospital to make Lavine\u2019s hospital records available for her inspection and copying. In her complaint, plaintiff alleged that the hospital and its agents had refused to provide her, as Lavine\u2019s authorized attorney, access to the records as required by section 1158, and that she had seen hospital personnel altering those records. She prayed for injunctions not only requiring that she be furnished copies and accorded \u201ccontinuous access\u201d to the records but also prohibiting the hospital from further altering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">At the hearing on plaintiff\u2019s application for temporary restraining order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction, counsel for the hospital explained that it had previously denied plaintiff access to Lavine\u2019s hospital records because it was in doubt as to the validity of his written authorization she had submitted, and because plaintiff had been attempting to interfere with Lavine\u2019s treatment to the point that his attending physician had directed the records not be afforded her (albeit they would be provided to any consulting physician). However, counsel also then stipulated, to ensure compliance with section 1158 and avoid incurring attorneys\u2019 fees thereunder, that the hospital would forthwith prepare copies of the records for plaintiff and allow her reasonable access to the originals. The trial court then denied plaintiff\u2019s applications for provisional injunctive relief on the ground that an adequate remedy at law was available, if necessary, by motion to compel production of the records pursuant to section 1158.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>obtain initial injunctive relief against alteration of the hospital records was thus denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Three weeks later, plaintiff filed in a law and discovery department a \u201cmotion for judgment on the pleadings,\u201d which incorporated her prior moving papers and sought the issuance of \u201cpreliminary and permanent\u201d injunctive relief as prayed in the complaint, on grounds that the hospital had not yet complied with its stipulation to produce the records and copies thereof. The hospital\u2019s opposition to this motion recited that after initial misunderstandings between the parties, plaintiff\u2014following the filing of the motion-had paid for and received copies of her father\u2019s hospital records, to and including November 3, 1982. The hospital further documented plaintiff\u2019s numerous prior episodes of interference and conflict with hospital staff ministering to Lavine, and prayed that sanctions be awarded under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 for what it deemed a frivolous motion. In reply papers filed November 19, 1982, plaintiff complained that she had been furnished neither copies of her father\u2019s X-rays nor his records of treatment subsequent to November 3, 1982 (the latter having been admitted by the hospital). This motion was taken off calendar at plaintiff\u2019s request due to the rapidly deteriorating condition of Lavine, which caused plaintiff to be unavailable on the noticed hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Following Lavine\u2019s death, plaintiff, as his executrix, moved to be substituted in his place as plaintiff in this action; the motion was granted. On March 21, 1983, plaintiff filed a renewed \u201cmotion for production of medical records pursuant to Evidence Code section 1158,\u201d in which she alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>the records she had received from the hospital were materially incomplete. Simultaneously, plaintiff noticed a motion to disqualify the hospital\u2019s counsel, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (Gibson, Dunn), from participating in the lawsuit, on three grounds: that Gibson, Dunn\u2019s representation of an insurer involved in the Medicare program placed the firm in a conflict of interest inasmuch as Lavine\u2019s hospitalization had been partially paid for by Medicare; that the hospital had occupied a fiduciary relationship with Lavine, which relationship extended to hospital\u2019s counsel and thereby prevented them from appearing against Lavine\u2019s interests; and that Gibson, Dunn had represented a class of California judges in a class action involving their salary and pension rights (Olson v. Cory, Los Angeles County Superior Court case No. CA 000437), with the result that the firm\u2019s appearance before any judge in that class was barred by conflict-of-interest principles. On the latter ground, plaintiff also moved to disqualify all judges in the Olson v. Cory class from hearing this action. Prior to the hearing of these motions plaintiff filed (and apparently served) a subpoena duces tecum requiring the hospital\u2019s director of administrative services to produce at the law and motion hearing such of the hospital records as were sought by her section 1158 motion. Moreover, in her reply papers in support of that motion plaintiff requested the court to order the original hospital records surrendered to it, so that plaintiff could inspect them without interference by the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In its response to the motion to produce, the hospital averred that all existing records which plaintiff now sought had been supplied to her, except copies of Lavine\u2019s X-rays. As to these, hospital explained, copying would be far more expensive than the 10 cents per page maximum allowed by section 1158 for conventional medical records; hospital therefore offered to provide plaintiff such copies at cost or to allow them to be copied by plaintiff\u2019s own copying service. In addition to opposing plaintiff\u2019s several motions on their merits, hospital urged that they were frivolous and presented in bad faith, and again requested that the court award it attorneys\u2019 fees by way of sanctions, under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">At a hearing at which plaintiff appeared through substitute counsel, the trial court denied the motion to produce on grounds it was moot since all relevant hospital records had been supplied,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also denied the motions to disqualify counsel and judges. The court further found that the motion to produce was frivolous, had not been taken in good faith, and had.caused unnecessary delay, and accordingly awarded the hospital sanctions of $364.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>Plaintiff proceeded to file a motion for reconsideration of these rulings, wherein she contended that the motion judge had been and still was obligated to refer the matter of <em>his </em>disqualification for interest, as an Olson v. Cory class member, to another judge for determination; she also contended that the rulings made in advance of such a determination were void and hence should be vacated. In a supplemental memorandum in support of this motion, plaintiff urged that the order allowing sanctions against her was deficient and should be vacated because the court had failed to recite in detail therein the reasons for that order, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (b). In the alternative, plaintiff requested that the court supplement its order to comply with the statutory requirement of specificity. Plaintiff also purported to renew her request that the original hospital records be deposited in custody of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration\u2014as well as the hospital\u2019s request for further sanctions in connection therewith\u2014except that the motion judge did refer the question of his disqualification to the master calendar department for appointment of another judge to decide it. The Chairperson of the Judicial Council thereafter designated such a judge, and he denied the application for disqualification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff then filed a \u201crenewed request for statement of decision,\u201d reiterating a written request, which she had filed after denial of her motion for reconsideration, that a formal statement of decision be prepared regarding the denial of her several motions. The renewed request was denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Plaintiff then instituted this appeal, from the latter order, the order refusing to disqualify the trial judge, the orders denying her motions for production of hospital records and to recuse hospital\u2019s counsel and the Olson v. Cory class judges, and also the order awarding sanctions and the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal revisits the subject matter of each of her requests for relief below, challenges the trial court\u2019s award of sanctions, and also seeks direct relief from this court by way of findings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 909 and an order directing that the hospital\u2019s records be deposited <em>in custodia legis. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s briefing in turn has elicited counter-motions for appellate relief by the hospital, which has moved to strike portions of plaintiff\u2019s reply brief and requests we award further sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>against plaintiff on the grounds that this appeal is frivolous. We address first plaintiff\u2019s challenges to the rulings below and then the parties\u2019 motions for special appellate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">1. <em>Production and Inspection of Hospital </em>Records.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">4. <em>Statement of Decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s request for rendition of a statement of decision on the matters determined adversely to her was denied on grounds it was untimely. That it was, assuming plaintiff\u2019s motions had qualified for a statement of decision in the first place, for Code of Civil Procedure section 632 requires that a statement of decision be requested before the matter is submitted for decision in cases where \u201cthe trial has lasted less than one day.\u201d* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But an even more fundamental reason why the refusal of a statement of decision must be affirmed is that such a statement, as was true of findings of fact under the former version of Code of Civil Procedure section 632, is neither required nor available upon decision of a motion, including one for preliminary injunction. (See 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 306, p. 3115; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mobile Magic Sales, Inc. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 1, 12, fn. 4 [157 Cal.Rptr. 749],)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">5. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Award of Sanctions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">At the hearing of plaintiff\u2019s motion for production of hospital records, the hospital\u2019s counsel argued at length that the motion constituted a frivolous, harassing tactic, in that all of the relief to which plaintiff was entitled under section 1158 had been voluntarily provided her well before that motion was noticed. Counsel recited, as had the hospital\u2019s declarations in opposition to the motion, the tedious litany of demands\u2014both extrajudicial and by motion\u2014which plaintiff had leveled against the hospital notwithstanding its amenability to providing her with access to and copies of Lavine\u2019s hospital records. Accordingly, counsel urged that payment of the hospital\u2019s expenses in resisting the motion, by way of sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>section 128.5, was appropriate and necessary to deter plaintiff from further relentless pursuit of what she had already obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Independent counsel representing plaintiff at this hearing ably but necessarily unsuccessfully attempted to defend his client\u2019s behavior. The court then observed as follows: \u201cWell, I think I have the issues well in mind. Perhaps Miss Lavine is too close to the case. It is her father, but I\u2019m afraid I have to agree, and reluctantly, that this is a rare case that qualifies under 128.5 . . . . Given what has occurred in this litigation\u2014not collateral litigation, but this very file\u2014I just don\u2019t think the motion is well based or can be said to be based on good faith. It obviously has engendered unnecessary delay and expense. So I do make a finding that under section 128.5, the tactic with respect to the motion insofar as it\u2019s a motion to produce records under 1158\u2014that\u2019s all I\u2019m addressing\u2014not the rest of it\u2014was not being in good faith, and it is a tactic in action specifically not in good faith. I believe it was frivolous under the circumstances and it has caused unnecessary delay.\u201d The court accordingly awarded the hospital $364 for expenses incurred in resisting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We agree with the trial court that plaintiff\u2019s conduct in connection with this unnecessary and ungrounded motion, viewed separately and also in context of the other, antecedent proceedings to the same end in this action, justified imposition of sanctions under section 128.5, which empowers trial courts \u201cto order a party or the party\u2019s attorney, or both, to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of tactics or actions not based on good faith which are frivolous or which cause unnecessary delay.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s present assertion that sanctions were inappropriate because the motion to which they were directed was ordered \u201coff calendar,\u201d rather than being denied in so many words, is without legal basis. Similarly, her argument that in-court production of the records was warranted and that she was sanctioned for interposing a novel but appropriate request for relief is not well taken, given that plaintiff did not show sufficient cause for judicially ordered production of the records (as we have discussed above).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Plaintiff also contends that sanctions under section 128.5 could not properly have been awarded in connection with her motion to produce because that motion constituted an \u201capplication for a final adjudication\u201d of her lawsuit, rendering the request for sanctions on account thereof an impermissibly premature effort to hold plaintiff liable for malicious prosecution of the entire case. (Cf. <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) We disagree. The motion under section 1158 did not purport to seek disposition of the entirety of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, which included prayers for declaratory judgment and injunction. Moreover, hos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>pital\u2019s request for sanctions was expressly directed to, and approved concerning, only its expenses in opposing this single motion, not the costs of the case as a whole. In fact, the amount of expenses awarded was less than one-half of the $750 the hospital estimated it had incurred in opposing the motion to produce alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Plaintiff further argues that the procedure by which the sanctions were awarded, under section 128.5, \u201csuffers constitutionally from being a summary procedure that denies the [sanctioned party] the rights associated with due process to have evidentiary hearings, the subpena power of the court, to call witnesses and to be generally given a reasonable opportunity to defend oneself as well as the right to a jury trial on a money judgment. \u201d This constitutional contention too is mistaken. Nothing in section 128.5 precludes a party against whom sanctions are sought thereunder from subpenaing and producing evidence and witnesses or otherwise defending against the request; the scope of a hearing on an application for sanctions is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, as with motions generally. <em>(Reifler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 479, 483-485 [114 Cal.Rptr. 356].)  And as for the claimed right to a jury trial, the short answer is that that right, insofar as civil actions and remedies are concerned, is not an element of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. (E.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Sauvinet </em>(1876) 92 U.S. 90, 92-93 [23 L.Ed. 678, 679]; <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1937) 302 U.S. 319, 323-324 [82 L.Ed. 288, 291, 58 S.Ct. 149].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">A final contention concerning the award of sanctions, which plaintiff has pressed since she filed her motion for reconsideration below, does have merit. Subdivision (b) of section ,128.5 provides in part that \u201cAn order imposing expenses [under this section] shall be in writing and shall <em>recite in detail </em>the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d (Italics added.) We agree with plaintiff that the written order entered in this case did not satisfy the demand of the statute for a detailed recitation of the circumstances or conduct giving rise to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The minute order in question reads as follows: \u201cCourt determines that motion under Evidence Code \u00a7 1158 was not made in good faith, was frivolous and caused unnecessary delay. Court imposes sanctions on counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>for moving party in the amount of $364, payable to counsel for responding party. CCP 128.5.\u201d This order, which stated no more than the trial court\u2019s conclusions, in the words of the statute, as to why sanctions were being awarded, did not comply with the statutory directive. By definition, the requirement that the order imposing sanctions \u201crecite <em>in detail </em>the conduct or circumstances justifying\u201d it contemplates some recital beyond the court\u2019s conclusions that the conduct being sanctioned comes within the statutory qualification of \u201ctactics or actions not based on good faith which are frivolous or which cause unnecessary delay\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.5, subd. (a)). (Accord, <em>Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 812, 816 [214 Cal.Rptr. 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">The purpose of section 128.5\u2019s provision for a recitation of the facts justifying a sanctions order is to fulfill the \u201crudiments\u201d of due process required for governmental imposition of a penalty upon an attorney or party\u2014both for due process\u2019 own, constitutional sake and to ensure that the power conferred by the statute will not be abused. (See <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 652-654 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179]; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Cseh </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 957, 962 [196 Cal.Rptr. 409].) Moreover, in some cases the court\u2019s recitation will be an invaluable aid to a reviewing court determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions. (Cf. <em>Miramar Hotel Corp. </em>v. <em>Frank B. Hall &amp; Co. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1126, 1129-1130 [210 Cal.Rptr. 114] (concerning the necessity for a statement of decision where required by Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632).) Although our review of the record in this case has satisfied us that the trial court\u2019s award of sanctions against plaintiff was eminently justified, other cases may not present as clear a scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We couple this holding with an assurance that the requirement that a sanctions order \u201crecite in detail\u201d the circumstances justifying it should impose no undue burden upon trial courts. No more is required than a <em>factual </em>recital, with reasonable specificity, of the circumstances that have led the trial court to consider the matter before it what the trial court here properly termed \u201ca rare case that qualifies under [section] 128.5.\u201d Thus, for example, in the present case the trial court\u2019s order would have satisfied the statutory requirement had it stated that the motion in question had been brought and prosecuted after the relief it sought had been fully afforded by the hospital, and that this was plaintiff\u2019s third application for the same relief. However, as we have explained, an order that merely recites that a particular motion or tactic is \u201cfrivolous\u201d and thereby has invoked sanctions is insufficient under the terms of section 128.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The insufficiency of the formal order for sanctions requires that we reverse it. (Cf. <em>Miramar Hotel Corp. </em>v. <em>Frank B. Hall </em>&amp; <em>Co., supra, </em>163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>Cal.App.3d at pp. 1130-1131.) However, that reversal does not exonerate plaintiff from responsibility for her conduct, or from reckoning with the penalty properly imposed therefor. On remand, the trial court will be able to reenter its order in compliance with section 128.5, subdivision (b), whereupon the award of sanctions will again take effect. (Cf. <em>Fegles </em>v. <em>Kraft, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d 812, 817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">6. <em>Motions for Special Appellate Relief </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The order awarding expenses under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter a new order in accordance with subdivision (b) of that section.

(Cf. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 862, 871, fn. 9 [196 Cal.Rptr. 69]; <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 304, 310 [139 P.2d 13].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">More specifically, it took two Orange County Superior Court judges to decide the disqualification issue. The judge initially appointed by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council recused himself from determining the issue on grounds he too was a member of the plaintiff class in Olson v. Cory. Thereafter a second judge was designated and denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1019.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that her motions \u201clasted more than one day\u201d because they were pending from the time the notice of motion was filed is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b848-11\"> Although, as discussed <em>infra, </em>Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 provides for rendition of a detailed written order upon awarding sanctions against a party or attorney, that requirement is distinct from section 632\u2019s provisions for a statement of decision, which do not apply to proceedings under section 128.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The right to jury trial, of course, is also guaranteed by article I, section 16 of the California Constitution. However, that provision extends the right only so far \u201cas it existed at common law at the time the Constitution was adopted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 283, 286-287 [231 P.2d 832].) The process of awarding sanctions for frivolous tactics recognized and prescribed by section 128.5 is a new creature of statute, unknown at common law.
