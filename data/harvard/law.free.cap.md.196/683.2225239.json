He was represented by counsel, and after a motion for new trial was overruled, no appeal was taken to this court. In his petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>he alleged that the trial court did not have jurisdiction \u201cbecause perjured testimony was deliberately used to obtain a conviction\u201d and \u201cbecause it clearly appears from the transcript of record of the case that the Relator * * * was wrongly identified as the perpetrator of the crime * * Judge Niles granted the petition, but at the hearing, ruled that the petition was insufficient and signed an order remanding the relator \u201cwith leave to file an amended petition\u201d. This leave was \u201cwithdrawn by request of relator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>counsel, after motion for immediate amendment denied\u201d, to which motion the state objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We think the court\u2019s ruling was correct. A bald assertion that perjured testimony was deliberately used against him is insufficient, in the absence of \u201cfacts showing that the State\u2019s officers used testimony known to be perjured, or participated in any conspiracy to defraud petitioner of his rights.\u201d <em>Sembly v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 744, 745, 60 A. 2d 526. To the same effect, see <em>State ex rel. Sisk v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 759, 59 A. 2d 790; <em>State ex rel. Celetano v. Wright, </em>192 Md. 713, 63 A. 2d 635; and <em>State ex rel. Heddings v. Superintendent, </em>193 Md. 723, 68 A. 2d 675. In <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 293, 55 A. 2d 847, Judge Markell, speaking for the court, said: \u201cEven if these assertions in the brief had been allegations in the petition for <em>habeas corpus, </em>they would not have been sufficient to entitle petitioner to a writ. There are no allegations or assertions or supporting affidavits as to <em>facts </em>showing that evidence was perjured and known by the State\u2019s officers to be perjured (Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103, 112, 55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791, 98 A. L. R. 406; <em>Pyle v. State of Kansas, </em>317 U. S. 213, 63 S. Ct. 177, 87 L. Ed. 214; <em>Lisenba v. People of State of California, </em>314 U. S. 219, 62 S. Ct. 280, 86 L. Ed. 166), or was suppressed by threats of State\u2019s officers, or that petitioner\u2019s counsel betrayed him or acted corruptly or collusively <em>(Woods v. Nierstheimer, </em>328 U. S. 211, 66 S. Ct. 996, 90 L. Ed. 1177) * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Moreover, it is apparent from the memorandum brief filed by the present counsel for the petitioner in connection with his replication to the State\u2019s general denial, that he has no new evidence of perjury or misconduct, but relies entirely upon the transcript of record at the trial to show alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecuting witness in regard to the commission of the crime, and the alleged weakness or uncertainty of her identification of the accused. He argues from the record that the State\u2019s officers \u201cknew or should have known that the relator was innocent\u201d. These arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>were open to the accused at the trial, and on motion for new trial. They go to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence, not to the question of due process. Likewise, the contention that there was error in the charge to the jury is not open in this proceeding. In the absence of particulars tending to show that the trial was a sham, the dismissal of the petition without hearing testimony was within the court\u2019s discretion.
