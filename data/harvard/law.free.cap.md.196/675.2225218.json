He contends that he is entitled to a parole because the Board of Correction has appointed a Classification Committee not authorized by law to make recommendations to it, and this Committee has not recommended him. The court has no authority to parole a prisoner on application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>and the mere fact that the Board of Correction has appointed a committee to assist it in its duties does not deny any fundamental or other rights of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>Application denied without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
