He says that the charge of escape was placed against him \u201cat the whim of the Warden and without being heard,\u201d and that on January 6, 1950, he was sentenced by the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Court for Anne Arundel County to one year in the House of Correction on the charge of escape from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Petitioner contends that his trial, conviction and sentence for escape were illegal. The record on its face shows that the term for which petitioner was originally sentenced has not expired, and therefore his application is premature. In any event, the record is so incomplete that we cannot pass upon his contentions as to his second conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
