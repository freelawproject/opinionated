Judge Tucker said \u201cThe petitioner, Joseph B. Loane, alleges that he was convicted on February 28, 1949, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore of larceny by trick and was sentenced to two years in the Maryland Penitentiary. He also alleges that he requested Judge Robert France to appoint counsel for him, but the Judge declined to do so. The petitioner does not allege any fact that would necessitate the appointment of counsel for him. The matter was in the descretion of the trial judge, unless the circumstances were such as to require the appointment of counsel under provisions of the State or Federal Constitution. The petition does not indicate that the petitioner was deprived of any of his fundamental rights and the issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Application denied without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
