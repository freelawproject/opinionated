He does not allege any error in his trial, but contends that he was deprived of his constitutional rights by being arrested in Frederick without a warrant and held in jail there for ten days until the Baltimore police arrived with a warrant and took him to Baltimore. As we have previously held, the legality of an arrest before trial cannot be challenged in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>State ex rel. Williams v.
