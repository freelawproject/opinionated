The defendant claims that, because the crimes with which he has been charged are nonviolent offenses involving the recreational use of marijuana, as opposed to the sale and distribution of that drug, the trial court improperly concluded that the state\u2019s interest in determining his guilt or innocence outweighs his right to refuse the administration of medication. We reject this claim and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On June 30, 2006, the defendant pleaded guilty to production or preparation of a controlled substance without a license in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 21a-246. The trial court sentenced the defendant to two years incarceration, execution suspended, and three years of probation. On or about September 18,2007, during an unannounced visit to the defendant\u2019s home with the defendant\u2019s probation officer, officers from the Torrington police department discovered approximately 1.8 pounds of marijuana in the defendant\u2019s refrigerator,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> fifty marijuana plants, a digital scale, growing lights, pots, fertilizer and soil. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>dant was arrested and charged with the following offenses: (1) possession of drug paraphernalia within 1500 feet of a school by a person who is not enrolled in such school as a student in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-267 (c), which carries a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment; (2) possession of four ounces or more of marijuana in violation of General-Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (b), which carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment for the first offense; (3) possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-277 (b), which carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment for the first offense; (4) possession of four ounces or more of marijuana within 1500 feet of a school by a person who is not enrolled in such school as a student in violation of \u00a7 21a-279 (d), which carries a mandatory, nonsuspendable sentence of two years imprisonment that is to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed in connection with the underlying conviction under \u00a7 21a-279 (a), (b) or (c); (5) production or preparation of a controlled substance without a license in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 21a-246 (a), which carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment for a second or subsequent offense;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) sale of one kilogram or more of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (b), which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment for the first offense;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (7) violation of probation; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32; which, in the present case, carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">A pretrial hearing was held on September 3, 2008, at which time the state moved for a competency hearing pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At that time, the assistant state\u2019s attorney informed the trial court that, in addition to the charges pending in the present case, the defendant also had a charge of harassment in the second degree<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> pending in the judicial district of New Haven at Meriden. In the Meriden case, the trial court found the defendant incompetent to stand trial and committed him to the custody of Connecticut Valley Hospital, Whiting Forensic Division (Whiting), for restoration of competency. During his commitment, however, the defendant refused to take psychotropic medication as prescribed by his treating physicians, and the trial court in the Meriden case subsequently determined that it would be inappropriate to medicate him forcibly in view of the relatively minor nature of the crime with which he had been charged. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s psychiatric history in the Meriden case, the trial court in the present case granted the state\u2019s motion for a competency evaluation, and the defendant subsequently was evaluated by a clinical team at the New Haven community correctional center, where the defendant was being detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On September 23, 2008, the trial court conducted a hearing to ascertain the results of the competency evaluation. Bruce Knox, a licensed clinical social worker and member of the clinical team that had evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ated the defendant, testified that it was the unanimous opinion of that team that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial. According to the team\u2019s evaluation report, which was admitted into evidence without objection, the defendant suffered from bipolar disorder, was \u201cpervasively delusional,\u201d and was incapable of understanding the proceedings against him. Knox testified, however, that, with appropriate treatment, a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d existed that the defendant could be restored to competency within sixty days through inpatient psychiatric hospitalization that included the administration of psychotropic medication. Knox further testified that the defendant previously had been restored to competency very quickly using standard medication for bipolar disorder and, further, that the medication likely would prove effective again in treating the defendant\u2019s symptoms. Knox confirmed the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s report to the court, however, that the defendant had refused to take any medication during his most recent admission to Whiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Knox whether there were any health risks associated with psychotropic medication. Knox responded that \u201cthere\u2019s always some potential risk with any medication, but the treatment team at Whiting is familiar with the defendant. They\u2019ve known him for many months, and I\u2019m sure they would monitor any medication very closely, given [the defendant\u2019s] . . . concerns about [the] matter.\u201d The trial court then asked Knox whether, when the defendant previously had been restored to competency, he had suffered any adverse side effects from the medication. Knox responded that, as far as he knew, the defendant had suffered no such side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">After Knox completed his testimony, the trial court found the defendant incompetent to stand trial. The court further found, however, that the defendant could be restored to competency within sixty days through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>inpatient treatment at Whiting if that treatment included the administration of psychotropic medication. The court then inquired of defense counsel as to whether the defendant would be willing to take such medication. Defense counsel responded that the defendant would be willing to take medication as long as it was not detrimental to his health. The trial court observed that the defendant previously had been restored to competency through the use of standard bipolar medication and inquired of defense counsel whether the defendant had experienced any adverse side effects from that medication. The defendant himself interjected that he had not experienced any side effects during the restoration period but that, later, he had experienced several side effects that he believed were adverse to his health. Specifically, the defendant stated that his veins turned purple, his hands shook, he saw bright auras around every light and periodically lost his balance. After the defendant finished speaking, defense counsel informed the court that the defendant also believed that the side effects he had experienced may have been attributable to the dosage of the medication that he had received. In light of the defendant\u2019s representation that he would be willing to take medication on the condition that it was not harmful to him, the trial court committed the defendant to the custody of Whiting for a period not to exceed sixty days for the purpose of restoring him to competency. The court observed, however, that, if at any point during that period the defendant refused to take his medication, the parties were to return to court to consider other options.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A second competency hearing was held on November 18, 2008, at which Susan McKinley, a licensed clinical social worker, testified. McKinley informed the court that she and a clinical team from Whiting recently had evaluated the defendant for competency to stand trial and had found him to be incompetent. McKinley testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>fled that, although the defendant understood the charges against him and the general workings of the judicial system, he was unable to assist in his defense because \u201chis persecutory and delusional [thinking] interfere [d] with his ability to think logically and rationally about the proceedings . . . [to] [c]onsider advice from counsel . . . [and to] [m]ake reasonable decisions about his case.\u201d McKinley explained that, since his commitment to Whiting on September 23, 2008, the defendant had refused to take any \u201csynthetic\u201d medications, insisting on \u201corganic remedies\u201d only, which were not available at Whiting. According to McKinley, the members of the evaluation team agreed unanimously that the defendant could be restored to competency within sixty days if he were to be medicated involuntarily. When the trial court asked McKinley if any less intrusive means were available to restore the defendant\u2019s competency, she responded that all less intrusive means already had been attempted but had failed. McKinley added, however, that she and the evaluation team believed that medicating the defendant involuntarily would not only restore him to competency but likely would benefit him by improving his mental health generally, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the trial court found the defendant incompetent to stand trial. The trial court then noted that, because the state was seeking an order of involuntary medication, the state bore the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the charges against the defendant were sufficiently serious to justify such an intrusion on the defendant\u2019s liberty. The assistant state\u2019s attorney responded that the state had a substantial interest in restoring the defendant to competency in view of the serious nature of the numerous drug felonies with which he had been charged and the fact that the defendant was a repeat offender. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>conclusion of the assistant state\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument, the trial court found that the charges against the defendant were serious and that the state had an overriding interest in restoring him to competency. The trial court further found that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication would render the defendant competent to stand trial and that no less intrusive means existed for doing so. In light of these findings, the trial court appointed Betsy Graziano, a licensed clinical social worker, as the defendant\u2019s health care guardian to represent the defendant\u2019s best interests in accordance with \u00a7 54-56d (k) (3) (A).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On December 24, 2008, after reviewing the defendant\u2019s medical and psychiatric records and meeting with the defendant on two occasions, Graziano filed a report with the court in which she concluded that it was in the defendant\u2019s best medical interest to receive a therapeutic dose of antipsychotic medication and mood stabilizer, involuntarily, if necessary. Graziano noted that she had consulted with John Dubozcy, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>dant\u2019s treating psychiatrist, among others, and that he had informed her that all possible, less intrusive means for restoring the defendant to competency had been attempted and had failed. With respect to the appropriate medication, Dubozcy recommended that the defendant be administered \u201ca therapeutic dose of Risperdal and lithium . . . .\u2019\u2019If the defendant were to refuse that medication, which is administered orally, Dubozcy then would prescribe a single, five milligram dose of Haldol, which would be administered intramus-cularly. Graziano noted that the defendant\u2019s symptoms successfully had been treated with Risperdal and lithium on prior occasions with minimal side effects. Grazi-ano further noted that, although a variety of side effects can occur with the administration of psychotropic medication, they generally are associated with long-term use and a failure to monitor a patient\u2019s vital signs and symptoms. Graziano then explained that Dubozcy had assured her that Whiting has sufficient staff to monitor the defendant around the clock, seven days a week, for any possible side effects, and that the staff would intervene appropriately should any adverse effects be detected.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">A hearing on Graziano\u2019s report was conducted on January 5, 2009, at which she testified regarding her findings and recommendations. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that involuntary medication would \u201crender the defendant competent to stand trial,\u201d an adjudication of his guilt or innocence could not be accomplished using less intrusive means, the proposed treatment plan was \u201cnarrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant\u2019s liberty and privacy interests,\u201d and the proposed drug regimen would not cause any \u201cunnecessary risk to the defendant\u2019s health\u201d in view of the fact that the defendant would be closely monitored for side effects by his clinical team. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>further found that the charges against the defendant were sufficiently serious to justify the state\u2019s intrusion on the defendant\u2019s liberty interests. In light of its findings, the trial court remanded the defendant to the custody of Whiting for an additional sixty days and ordered that he be medicated involuntarily for the purpose of restoring him to competency. In doing so, the trial court emphasized that it had considered the defendant\u2019s concerns regarding possible adverse side effects to the medication and that its order was predicated on the understanding that the defendant would be monitored closely for any such side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The defendant subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to stay the order of involuntary medication pending the outcome of his appeal. We transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal from the Appellate Court to this court. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">On appeal, the defendant challenges only the trial court\u2019s finding under \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) that the crimes with which he is charged are serious and, therefore, that the state\u2019s interest in trying him overrides his right to be free from unwanted medication. The defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s other findings under \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2), namely, that involuntary medication will render him competent to stand trial, an adjudication of his guilt or innocence cannot be accomplished using less intrusive means, the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize the intrusion on his liberty and privacy interests, and the proposed drug regimen will cause no unnecessary risk to his health. The defendant also does not challenge \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>constitutional grounds or contend that the trial court failed to apply the proper standard for determining when an order of involuntary medication constitutionally is permitted for the purpose of rendering a person competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s sole claim, rather, is that, because the crimes with which he has been charged are all nonviolent offenses involving the recreational use of marijuana, the trial court improperly concluded that the state\u2019s interest in trying him overrides his right to self-determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The following legal principles guide our analysis of this claim. It is well established that \u201c[a]n individual has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs \u2014 an interest that only an essential or overriding state interest might overcome. <em>Sell </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 178-79, 123 S. Ct. 2174, 156 L. Ed. 2d 197 (2003)] (quoting <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>504 U.S. 127, 134, 135, 112 S. Ct. 1810, 118 L. Ed. 2d 479 [1992]). This is because [t]he forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person\u2019s body represents a substantial interference with that person\u2019s liberty. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 229, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1990). Indeed, it has been observed that when the purpose or effect of forced drugging is to alter the will and the mind of the subject, it constitutes a deprivation of liberty in the most literal and fundamental sense. [Id., 237-38] (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u201cAt the same time, the government has a significant interest in bringing a person accused of a serious crime to trial. See <em>Sell </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 180]. The power to bring an accused to trial is fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty and prerequisite to social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>justice and peace. <em>Illinois </em>v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 347, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). It surely is not an overstatement to observe that the government\u2019s ability to enforce the criminal laws in accordance with due process is the foundation on which social order rests and from which individual liberties emanate. Thus, when an individual commits a crime, he forfeits his liberty interests to the extent necessary for the government to bring him to trial. Recognizing this important governmental interest, the [United States] Supreme Court has held that in some circumstances, forced medication to render a defendant competent to stand trial for a crime that [that person] is charged with committing may be constitutionally permissible, even though the circumstances in which it is appropriate may be rare. See <em>Sell </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 180]. As the [United States Supreme] Court stated . . . [in <em>Sell]:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u201c[T]he [constitution permits the [g]ovemment involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial, but only if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests. [Id., 179].</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cArticulating a standard for determining the circumstances in which the government may obtain a court order to medicate involuntarily a defendant to render him competent to stand trial, the [United States] Supreme Court has focused on the competing interests of the defendant and the government.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>585 F.3d 806, 813 (4th Cir. 2009). This standard requires the government to satisfy a four part test. \u201cFirst, it must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that important governmental interests are at stake. . . . An important governmental interest exists when the defendant is accused of a serious crime and [sjpecial circumstances do not undermine the government\u2019s interest in trying him for that crime. . . . Second, it must show that involuntary medication will significantly further the state\u2019s interest. ... In other words, it must show that the involuntary administration of the medication is both (a) substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial and (b) substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant\u2019s ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense, thereby rendering the trial unfair. . . . Third, it must show that involuntary medication is necessary to further its interests by showing that any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same result. . . . Fourth, it must show that the administration of the drugs is medically appropriate, or that it is in the defendant\u2019s best medical interest in light of his medical condition.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>404 F.3d 227, 235 (4th Cir. 2005), quoting <em>Sell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly determined that the charges against him are sufficiently serious to justify involuntary medication. A trial court\u2019s determination as to the seriousness of a crime for purposes of applying the first <em>Sell </em>factor presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Vasquez, </em>513 F.3d 908, 915 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>387 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1128, 125 S. Ct. 1094, 160 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Although this court has not yet had occasion to apply the <em>Sell </em>factors in reviewing the propriety of an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of involuntary medication,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> all of the federal circuit courts that have done so have looked to the potential penalty that may be imposed in determining whether a crime is serious. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. Fazio, 599 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>532 F.3d 538, 547 (6th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1270, 129 S. Ct. 2735, 174 L. Ed. 2d 250 (2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>supra, 387 F.3d 160-61. \u201cCourts of appeals have split [however] on which test to employ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>in determining [the] seriousness of [a] crime. Some [courts] look to the maximum statutory penalty, while others calculate the defendant\u2019s probable sentencing range under the [federal] [sentencing [guidelines . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grape, </em>549 F.3d 591, 600 (3d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In adopting the maximum statutory penalty approach in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 404 F.3d 227, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that, \u201c[although the [c]ourt in <em>Sell </em>offered no guidance on how to determine the seriousness of an offense, the [United States] Supreme Court has described \u2018serious\u2019 crimes in other contexts. In <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968), for example, the Supreme Court observed that the [s]ixth [a]mendment\u2019s right to trial by jury exists only in \u2018serious\u2019 criminal cases. [Id., 158]. It admonished that \u2018the penalty authorized for a particular crime is of major relevance in determining whether it is serious.\u2019 [Id., 159] .... In fact, it explicitly rejected Louisiana\u2019s argument that the proper focus of whether a crime is \u2018serious\u2019 for purposes of the [s]ixth [a]mendment right to trial is the actual \u2018length of punishment.\u2019 [Id., 162n.35]. More recent right-to-jury cases have explicitly found that the primary measure of seriousness is \u2018the maximum penalty attached to the offense.\u2019 . . . <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>518 U.S. 322, 326, 116 S. Ct. 2163, 135 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1996).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Fourth Circuit concluded: \u201c[I]n light of <em>Duncan </em>and its progeny, it is appropriate to focus on the maximum penalty authorized by statute in determining if a crime is \u2018serious\u2019 for involuntary medication purposes. Such an approach respects legislative judgments regarding the severity of the crime . . . while at the same time giving courts an objective standard to apply . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 532 F.3d 549 (\u201cthe maximum statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>penalty is the most objective means of determining the seriousness of a crime and the standard we adopt\u201d); cf. <em>United States </em>v. Gomes, supra, 387 F.3d 160 (\u201cthe seriousness of the crime and [the defendant\u2019s] perceived dangerousness to society are evident from the substantial sentence [that the defendant] faces if convicted\u201d); but cf. <em>United States </em>v. Hernandez-Vasquez, supra, 513 F.3d 919 (\u201cAlthough the sentencing guidelines no longer are mandatory, they are the best available predictor of the length of a defendant\u2019s incarceration. While the statutory maximum may be more readily ascertainable, any difficulty in estimating the likely guideline range exactly is an insufficient reason to ignore <em>Sell\u2019s </em>direction that courts should consider the specific circumstances of individual defendants in determining the seriousness of a crime. Accordingly, we disagree with the Fourth Circuit and conclude that the likely guideline range is the appropriate starting point for the analysis of a crime\u2019s seriousness.\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Puentes, </em>479 F.3d 1220, 1226 (10th Cir. 2007) (analyzing seriousness in light of both statutory maximum and likely guideline sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Because Connecticut does not have sentencing guidelines, the sentencing guideline approach to assessing the seriousness of a crime is not an option available to the courts of this state. As we previously have indicated, however, the defendant faces a mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentence of seven years imprisonment if he is convicted of three of the crimes with which he has been charged, namely, \u00a7 2 la-278 (b), which provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment, \u00a7 21a-279 (b), which provides for a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment for the first offense, and \u00a7 2 la-279 (d), which provides for a mandatory, nonsus-pendable sentence of two years imprisonment that is to run consecutively to any sentence imposed for violating \u00a7 21a-279 (a), (b) or (c). Moreover, one of the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>with which the defendant has been charged, namely, \u00a7 21a-278 (b), carries a maximum possible sentence of twenty years imprisonment. Even if we consider only the mandatory minimum sentence that the defendant faces if convicted under \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 and 21a-279, however, and not the maximum <em>combined </em>sentences that could be imposed if he is convicted of all charges, it is apparent that the charges pending against the defendant are serious.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 532 F.3d 549 (possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, which carried mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment, \u201c[unquestionably\u201d constituted serious crime); <em>United States </em>v. <em>HernandezVasquez, </em>supra, 513 F.3d 911-12 and n.1, 919 (stating in dictum that crime of illegal reentry into United States by person who previously had been deported for being convicted of aggravated felony, which carried probable sentence of approximately seven and one-half to nine and one-half years imprisonment under federal sentencing guidelines, could be deemed serious); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 404 F.3d 238 (\u201c[w]e think it beyond dispute that the [g]ovemment . . . [has] an important interest in trying a defendant charged with a felony carrying a <em>maximum </em>punishment of [ten] years imprisonment\u201d [emphasis added]). In focusing on only three of the six drug offenses with which the defendant has been charged, we \u201cdo not imply that [a court] may not aggregate charges when determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>[state] has an important interest.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 238 n.8. In the present case, however, we believe that the state\u2019s interest is important on the basis of the seriousness of those three offenses. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Our conclusion that the charges in this case are serious, however, does not end our inquiry. As we previously have explained, in evaluating the state\u2019s interest in prosecuting the defendant, we also \u201cmust consider the facts of the individual case,\u201d bearing in mind that \u201c[s]pecia! circumstances may lessen the importance of that interest.\u201d <em>Sell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 180. In <em>Sell, </em>the court offered two examples of special circumstances that might undermine the state\u2019s interest in proceeding against a defendant. First, it observed that a defendant\u2019s unwillingness to take medication could result in \u201clengthy confinement in an institution for the mentally ill,\u201d an eventuality that \u201cwould diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime.\u201d Id. Second, the court noted \u201cthe possibility that the defendant has already been confined for a significant amount of time ... for which he would receive credit toward any sentence ultimately imposed . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the present case, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s interest in bringing him to trial is undermined by the fact that the crimes with which he has been charged are all nonviolent, victimless offenses involving the recreational use of marijuana rather than the sale or distribution of that drug. At oral argument before this court, the defendant further contended that, in assessing the state\u2019s interest, this court should take into account society\u2019s growing tolerance of marijuana use, as evidenced by the movement in some states to decriminalize the recreational use of that drug and by the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that several states already have permitted it to be used for medical purposes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">First, the defendant is not charged merely with possession of marijuana; he is charged with manufacturing the drug and possessing it with the intent to sell. As we previously have indicated, at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, the police discovered fifty marijuana plants growing in his home and approximately two pounds of marijuana in his refrigerator, along with a digital scale and various accoutrements associated with the cultivation of marijuana. In light of the quantity of marijuana involved and the nature of the other seized evidence, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the charges against the defendant are not serious, or that they are unfounded or otherwise lacking in significance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the defendant may be able to rebut the state\u2019s contention that the large quantity of marijuana found in his home was intended for sale or distribution and not merely for personal use, that issue is one for the jury, not this court, to evaluate and decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We also disagree with the defendant that the nonviolent nature of the offenses militates against the state\u2019s interest in bringing him to trial. As the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated in rejecting a similar claim: \u201c[W]e simply cannot conclude that only violent crimes are serious for purposes of this analysis. There are any number of criminal behaviors that do not involve crimes of violence that are serious matters. Indeed, the [court in] <em>Sell </em>. . . [concluded] that fraud was a serious crime. See <em>Sell </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 180]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Puentes, </em>[supra, 479 F.3d 1226-27] (finding . . . charge [of unlawful reentry into the United States by a person who previously had been deported for being convicted of an aggravated felony] a serious crime despite there being no indication that the [underlying] conduct . . . was violent or harmful to others for purposes of <em>Sell </em>analysis). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201c[Furthermore], we do not subscribe to the theory that the legislative branch considers drug-trafficking crimes as victimless, regardless of the scale of the operation. If a criminal defendant possesses an illegal substance with the intent to distribute that substance to others, unquestionably there are victims. The lack of an identifiable person . . . does not equate to a completely victimless crime. . . . Society as a whole is the victim when illegal drugs are being distributed in its communities.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 532 F.3d 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Vasquez, </em>supra, 513 F.3d 908, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently expressed a similar view. \u201cNo circuit court has interpreted <em>Sell </em>as allowing a categorical analysis of a crime\u2019s seriousness, such as a distinction between crimes malum in se and malum prohibitum. Similarly, we read <em>Sell\u2019s </em>reference to crimes against property and the person as describing only a subset of the crimes serious enough to support an important govemment[al] interest in prosecution. A contrary reading would ignore the breadth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>[United States] Supreme Court\u2019s concern that the [government be able to bring an accused to trial, which it described as fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty and prerequisite to social justice and peace. <em>[Sell </em>v. <em>United </em>States, supra, 539 U.S. 180] .... <em>Sell </em>does not suggest that non-property, non-violent crimes, such as those arising under federal drug or immigration laws, are not fundamental to a scheme of ordered liberty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Vasquez, </em>supra, 917-18. Consistent with the view expressed in <em>Green </em>and <em>Hernandez-Vasquez, </em>we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the nonviolent nature of his offenses undermines the state\u2019s interest in prosecuting him. On the contrary, for the reasons set forth previously, we are persuaded that, as a general matter, the proper measure of a crime\u2019s seriousness is the penalty that the legislature has attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In addition, we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that society\u2019s increasing tolerance of marijuana use, or the fact that some states have taken steps to decriminalize the recreational use of that drug, diminishes the state\u2019s interest in this case. Notwithstanding the movement afoot in some quarters to repeal or modify laws banning the use and possession of marijuana, the fact remains that \u201c[m]arijuana is a schedule I controlled substance [in Connecticut]. See General Statutes \u00a7 21a-243 (c); Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 21a-243-7 (c) (20) .... [Sections] 21a-277 (b) and 21a-278 (b) make it illegal to manufacture, distribute, sell, prescribe, dispense, compound, transport with intent to sell or dispense, possess with intent to sell or dispense, offer, give or administer marijuana to another person. . . . Additionally, a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (b), 21a-278 (b) or 21a-279 (c) within 1500 feet of a public or private elementary or secondary school, licensed child day care center, or public housing project carries a more stringent penalty.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>273 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Conn. 138, 152-54, 869 A.2d 192 (2005). \u201cThus, the Connecticut legislature has made the clear determination that marijuana is a dangerous substance from which [all of our citizens and] children, especially, should be protected.\u201d Id., 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Thus, if we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s position, we necessarily \u201cwould [be] usurp [ing] the legislature\u2019s role and . . . vitiat[ing] what is an inherently legislative determination\u201d that marijuana is a dangerous substance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinemann, </em>282 Conn. 281, 310, 920 A.2d 278 (2007). \u201cThe categorization of offenses is a legislative judgment, and, generally speaking, it is not the prerogative of courts in this area lightly to launch an inquiry to resolve a debate which has already been settled in the legislative forum. . . . [Rather] [w]e defer to the broad authority that legislatures possess in determining the types and limits of punishment for crimes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, we consider whether \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s failure to take drugs voluntarily . . . may mean lengthy confinement in an institution for the mentally ill . . . [a fact] that would diminish the risks that ordinarily attach to freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime.\u201d <em>Sell </em>v. <em>United </em>States, supra, 539 U.S. 180. As <em>Sell </em>directs, we also must consider whether the defendant already has been confined for a significant amount of time for which he would receive credit toward any future sentence. Id. With respect to the first factor, the defendant does not contend, and there is nothing in the record to indicate, that he would be a candidate for civil commitment if he is not restored to competency through involuntary medication. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>supra, 387 F.3d 161 (noting that lack of evidence that defendant would qualify for civil commitment weighed in favor of government\u2019s interest in prosecuting him). With respect to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>factor, at oral argument before this court on March 15, 2010, appellate counsel represented that the defendant already had been confined for twenty-eight months. Adding to that the time that has elapsed since that date, in addition to the two months that it is likely to take to restore the defendant to competency,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we calculate that the defendant will have been confined for approximately three years and three months if his trial commences at the earliest possible moment. In view of the fact that the defendant faces a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years imprisonment, and, in the discretion of the court, the possibility of an even longer period of incarceration, we are persuaded that the length of the defendant\u2019s pretrial confinement, although not insubstantial, does not significantly undermine the state\u2019s interest in trying him. This is so because, even if the defendant is sentenced to no more than the mandatory minimrim term of seven years imprisonment, he still would have the majority of that sentence to serve. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>supra, 585 F.3d 815 (\u201ceven though [the defendant] can make a serious argument that the time she has already served in prison is sufficiently long to cover, or almost cover, any sentence that reasonably could be anticipated, this fact alone [did] not defeat [the government\u2019s interest]\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 532 F.3d 551 (\u201chaving . . . been confined [only] for three years, [the defendant] would still have the majority of a ten year mandatory minimum sentence to serve, at the least\u201d). Accordingly, consideration of all of the special circumstances that exist leads us to conclude that the state has an important interest in trying the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In reaching our conclusion, however, we are mindful that the experts who previously testified at the hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>on the defendant\u2019s competency agreed that the defendant would be restored to competency quickly and with minimal side effects using medication that is standard in the treatment of bipolar disorder. The defendant has not challenged that testimony on appeal. Indeed, the defendant himself represented to the trial court that he had experienced no side effects during a prior restoration. We also are mindful that the trial court, in entering its order, did so on the condition that the defendant would be closely monitored for possible adverse side effects, thereby minimizing any risk to the defendant\u2019s health. In light of these considerations, and for the reasons previously set forth in this opinion, we agree with the state that the trial court properly determined, in view of all the special circumstances that had been brought to its attention, that the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s alleged crimes justifies an order of involuntary medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) provides: \u201cIf the court finds that the defendant will not attain competency within the remainder of the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>covered by the placement order absent administration of psychiatric medication for which the defendant is unwilling or unable to provide consent, and after any hearing held pursuant to subdivision (3) of this subsection, the court may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial, (B) an adjudication of guilt or innocence cannot be had using less intrusive means, (C) the proposed treatment plan is narrowly tailored to minimize intrusion on the defendant\u2019s liberty and privacy interests, (D) the proposed drug regimen will not cause an unnecessary risk to the defendant\u2019s health, and (E) the seriousness of the alleged crime is such that the criminal law enforcement interest of the state in fairly and accurately determining the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence overrides the defendant\u2019s interest in self-determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ani-dedup-0\">Although \u00a7 54-56d was amended in 2009 and 2010; see Public Acts 2010, No. 10-28, \u00a7 1; Public Acts 2009, No. 09-79, \u00a7 1; those amendments have no bearing on the merits of this appeal.

In the absence of an adequate record, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory claims implicating his right to religious freedom. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>279 Conn. 39, 55, 901 A.2d 1 (2006) (reviewing court will consider unpreserved constitutional claim raised by defendant for first time on appeal only if trial court record pertaining to claim is adequate for appellate review), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1212, 127 S.

At all times relevant to the competency proceedings and in its brief to this court, however, the state has maintained that the police seized 8.4 pounds of marijuana from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator. At oral argument before this court, the state acknowledged the discrepancy between the police report and its position concerning the amount of marijuana that the police had seized from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator. The state indicated at that time that it was not prepared to concede that only 1.8 pounds of marijuana, rather than 8.4 pounds, had been seized from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator. Moreover, at no time prior to our release of this decision on December 7,2010, did the state advise this court of any material change in its position with respect to the amount of marijuana seized or with respect to whether it intended to reduce or drop any of the charges pending against the defendant in light of the police report. Consequently, in our decision released on December 7, 2010, we referred to the seizure of 8.4 pounds of marijuana from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator. Subsequent to the release of this decision, however, the state filed a motion to correct, acknowledging for the first time that the police did, in fact, seize only 1.8 pounds of marijuana from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator. We granted the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>motion, and, consequently, the corrected decision refers to the seizure of 1.8 pounds of marijuana from the defendant\u2019s refrigerator.

In <em>Jacobs, </em>the trial court granted the state\u2019s request that the defendant, Earl Jacobs, be medicated involuntarily pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 397-98. Jacobs appealed from the court\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that that decision violated his rights under the first, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. Id., 398. The state contended that \u201creview of the trial court\u2019s [decision] was limited to whether involuntary medication would violate [Jacobs\u2019] fourteenth amendment rights.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court agreed with Jacobs that the trial court\u2019s decision implicated his \u201cfirst and sixth amendment rights\u201d; id.; but concluded that that decision comported with the standard set forth in <em>Garcia </em>and, therefore, affirmed. Id., 398-99. Both Jacobs and the state sought certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant had first and sixth amendment rights that the trial court must consider during a hearing pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>[supra, 44]?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>261 Conn. 929, 930, 806 A.2d 1068 (2002). While the appeal was pending, however, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Sett. Thereafter, in a per curiam opinion, we remanded the case to the trial court for a determination of the constitutionality of involuntarily medicating Jacobs in light of the standard set forth in <em>Sell. State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 400. In so doing, we noted that the standard that the United States Supreme Court adopted in <em>Sell </em>\u201cdiffer[ed] from the standard adopted by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, [84-86], in several lespects.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 399. In particular, we noted that, \u201c[r]elevant to the limited certified question before this court, <em>Sell </em>requires that the trial court consider a defendant\u2019s fair trial rights, which are encompassed by the sixth amendment [and made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment].\u201d Id., 400.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\"> We do not discount the possibility that, at a hearing conducted in accordance with \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2), an accused might be able to adduce probative, credible evidence of the likely penalty that he or she faces if convicted as charged. In such circumstances, the trial court would be required to consider that evidence, together with all other relevant evidence, in assessing the state\u2019s interest in bringing the defendant to trial. In the present case, however, the defendant offered no evidence with respect to the sentence that he likely would receive if convicted of the charged offenses. In fact, at no point during the competency proceedings did the defendant expressly challenge the state\u2019s assertion that, as a matter of law, those crimes were serious for purposes of \u00a7 54-56d (k) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The defendant also claims that the state\u2019s interest in trying him is undermined by the fact that he does not pose a threat to himself or others. As the state maintains, however, the standard set forth in <em>Sell </em>is applicable <em>only when </em>involuntary medication is <em>not justified </em>on the ground of dangerousness. See <em>Sell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539 U.S. 181-82 (\u201c[a] court need not consider whether to allow forced medication [to render a defendant competent for trial], if forced medication is warranted for a different purpose, such as the purposes set out in <em>[Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>supra, 494 U.S. 210] related to the individual\u2019s dangerousness\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>supra, 387 F.3d 160 C\u2018[t]he <em>Sell </em>factors control when the sole purpose of the forced chemical treatment is to render a defendant competent for trial; therefore, a threshold inquiry is whether the forced treatment is justified for other reasons, such as those related to [the defendant\u2019s] dangerousness\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> We note that the defendant does not claim that the state has overcharged him to increase his maximum exposure for an improper purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> Experts testified at the defendant\u2019s prior competency hearings that it would take approximately two months to restore the defendant to competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
