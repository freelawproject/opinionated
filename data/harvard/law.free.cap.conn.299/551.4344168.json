App. 596, 614, 960 A.2d 1045 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We granted certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the defendant waived his claim that the jury instructions were constitutionally deficient?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Akande, </em>290 Conn. 918, 919, 966 A.2d 237 (2009). We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the defendant waived his claim, and affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following facts. \u201cThe defendant and the victim, Nelson Estremera, became acquainted at It\u2019s A Gee Thang barber shop on Main Street in Hartford. The defendant drove a black Mercedes-Benz and was dressed professionally each time Estremera saw him at the barber shop or around Hartford. The defendant told Estremera that his name was James Limerick. In conversation, the defendant told Estremera that he had a degree in computer engineering, that he was in the process of opening his own insurance business and that if Estremera ever needed any insurance to let him know.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\u201cIn October, 2004, Estremera\u2019s nephew gave him a car, a 1992 Chevrolet Lumina, and Estremera contacted the defendant to obtain automobile insurance for it. Estremera called the defendant, who told him to meet the defendant at what was known as the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u2018spot,\u2019 on a street off of Main Street, and to bring his birth certificate, social security card, the title to the car and his driver\u2019s license. The defendant arrived in his Mercedes-Benz and Estremera got into the defendant\u2019s car, where the transaction took place. The defendant told Estremera that it would cost only $250 to insure the Chevrolet Lumina because older people pay lower rates. Estremera gave the defendant all of the paperwork, and the defendant told Estremera that he would contact him within a few days. Once the defendant got in touch with Estremera, the two men met again in the defendant\u2019s car in the same spot. Estremera gave the defendant $250 in cash, and the defendant gave him an insurance card. The defendant told him that he would be able to register the car with the department of motor vehicles with this insurance card, and Estremera was in fact able to register the Lumina with no problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u201cAbout one month later, in November, 2004, Estrem-era needed insurance for another vehicle, an Oldsmobile, and he got in touch with the defendant again to obtain insurance for this vehicle. The defendant told Estremera that he needed to bring the defendant only the title to the new car because he already had all of Estremera\u2019s other information on file. The defendant again met with Estremera at the same location as their previous meetings, in the defendant\u2019s car, to complete the transaction. The defendant gave Estremera an insurance card in exchange for another $250 cash. This second insurance card had both of Estremera\u2019s cars listed on it, which Estremera found odd.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u201cOn November 18, 2004, Estremera went to the department of motor vehicles in Wethersfield to register the Oldsmobile. Estremera gave an agent the new insurance card he had received from the defendant. After taking it, the agent indicated that a supervisor would be coming to speak to Estremera. The supervisor ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>tioned him about where he got the card and eventually the police arrived. Estremera spoke to an officer and later went, of his own volition, to the Wethersfield police department where he gave a written statement and was shown a photographic array, from which he identified the defendant\u2019s photograph. The defendant was arrested in February, 2005, and charged with two counts of forgery in the second degree and two counts of larceny in the sixth degree.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Akande, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Id., 599-600. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to five years incarceration, execution suspended after time served, followed by three years probation. Id., 600. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on the elements of forgery in the second degree, which consisted of an initial instruction and a written supplemental instruction, violated his constitutional due process rights by failing to sufficiently emphasize certain elements of the forgery offense. Id., 604. Specifically, the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s instruction should have \u201cdefine [d] the issues or possesses elements of the crime of forgery in the second degree . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 606. Because the defendant had failed to preserve his claim at trial, he sought review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239\u201440, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Akande, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 606. The Appellate Court held that the defendant was not entitled to <em>Golding </em>review because his acquiescence to the content of the trial court\u2019s supplemental jury instruction constituted a waiver of his claim of instructional error, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 608-609. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly held that he waived his instructional error claim because \u201cdefense counsel did- not affirmatively express his satisfaction with the charge\u201d and because \u201c[t]here is no indication in the record . . . [of] any substantive discussion between the court and the attorneys concerning the instruction on the elements of forgery.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant claims that his claim of instructional error is reviewable under <em>Gold</em>ing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state claims that the Appellate Court correctly construed defense counsel\u2019s acquiescence to the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction as an implied waiver of the defendant\u2019s claim. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The following additional facts relate to the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error. The source of that claim \u2014 the trial court\u2019s alleged incomplete description of the elements of forgery in the second degree\u2014 appeared in both the trial court\u2019s initial jury instruction and a later written supplemental instruction that the trial court provided in response to a specific request from the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel failed to submit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>request to charge or to take exception to any instructional language during the trial. Indeed, there is no indication in the record that any discussion of the proposed instructional language occurred prior to the trial court\u2019s recital of its initial jury charge. At the conclusion of the initial charge, however, the trial court solicited input from both parties by asking: \u201cAnything about the charge?\u201d The state replied: \u201cNo, Your Honor,\u201d but defense counsel failed to respond to the trial court\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">During deliberations, the jury sent out a note signed by the foreman that stated: \u201cWe would like a copy of the text listing the points of forgery and of larceny for reference.\u201d In a discussion outside the presence of the jury, the court stated: \u201cMy suggestion on this is that we make copies of \u2014 I make a copy of what I read to them earlier on forgery and larceny given the length of those \u2014 those instructions. And given the late hour, since it\u2019s now 4:25 and we still haven\u2019t gotten through this and counsel\u2019s got to take a look at it, I will dismiss the jury now, tell them at 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow they will get copies of that, and they can begin their deliberations again tomorrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u201cThey really haven\u2019t even started because they sent a note out and then they asked for a break, which was understandable also. So what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll make copies of this. I\u2019ll give it to both counsel. We\u2019ll meet before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>court tomorrow, make sure it\u2019s all \u2014 everything\u2019s in order, and then we\u2019ll give it to them and they can get started fresh at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The trial court then solicited input from both counsel by asking: \u201cAnybody have any other thoughts?\u201d Defense counsel and the state both answered: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The next morning, the trial court addressed the adequacy of its proposed written supplemental instruction by stating: \u201cWe had some discussions yesterday. We made some copies of the charge that they asked for, the forgery and the larceny. I \u2014 we made copies last night for both sides here. Anybody have any comments on what we want to do with this?\u201d Again, defense counsel declined an opportunity to object to the proposed instructional language and simply answered: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The trial court then directed both counsel to review the written supplemental instruction that the jury would receive to \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t have anything that\u2019s odd.\u201d After pausing to allow both parties to review the proposed language, the court indicated that it was assured that both counsel had examined the copy and asked a final time whether either counsel had \u201c [anything else?\u201d Again, defense counsel failed to comment on the proposed instructional language by answering: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The trial court then provided the jury with a copy of the written supplemental instruction as an exhibit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">We have recently held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to a trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction constitutes waiver of a claim of instructional error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>293 Conn. 327, 342, 977 A.2d 199 (2009). In <em>Foster, </em>at the conclusion of the court\u2019s initial charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>defense counsel expressly stated that the trial court\u2019s instructions were proper but requested that the trial court remind the jury that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was at the crime scene. Id., 340. The court responded by proposing a supplemental instruction that essentially repeated a portion of its initial alibi instruction. Id., 340-41. Defense counsel failed to object to either the proposed supplemental instruction or the supplemental instruction that the trial court actually delivered to the jury. Id., 341. Despite his express agreement at trial, on appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Id., 339. Relying on our decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002), we held that the defendant had waived his claim of instructional error by \u201cassent[ing] to the [trial] court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant relies, in part, on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ebron, </em>292 Conn. 656, 975 A.2d 17 (2009), to distinguish his claim from the claim in <em>Foster. </em>In <em>Ebron, </em>this court held that, so long as the defendant did not actively induce the trial court to act on the challenged portion of the instruction, acquiescence to atrial court\u2019s instruction as given at trial does not amount to waiver. Id., 680. Accordingly, the defendant claims that, unlike the defendant in <em>Foster, </em>he did not actively induce the alleged instructional error by requesting or affirmatively advocating for the instruction he now challenges on appeal. Instead, he alleges that he merely acquiesced to the instructional language that the trial court delivered in response to the jury\u2019s request. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 10 A.3d 942 (2011), however, we recently overruled the distinction between active inducement and acquiescence set forth in <em>Ebron </em>and held that certain conduct short of active inducement may be deemed an implicit waiver of an instructional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>error claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Kitchens, </em>we held that \u201cwhen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given, the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal.\u201d Id., 482-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In the present case, the trial court provided defense counsel with a verbatim copy of the proposed supplemental instruction that the defendant now challenges, and a chance to review that copy overnight. The proposed supplemental instruction consisted of six pages and addressed only the elements of larceny and forgery. Defense counsel, therefore, had a meaningful opportunity to review a written copy of the trial court\u2019s specific proposed supplemental instruction in a deliberate manner without undue time constraints.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, because the jury\u2019s note specifically referred to the \u201cpoints of forgery,\u201d defense counsel had the benefit of reviewing the proposed instructional language with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>knowledge that the elements of forgery in the second degree were a particular concern for the deliberating jury. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the rule of <em>Kitchens </em>applies to compel the conclusion that defense counsel was aware of the alleged instructional error and chose to waive any objection to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In sum, because defense counsel had a meaningful opportunity to review the supplemental instructional language and because the jury\u2019s specific request was sufficient to focus defense counsel's attention on the elements of forgery \u2014 the specific portion of the instruction that the defendant now challenges \u2014 we construe defense counsel's acceptance of the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction as an implied waiver of the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT and ZARELLA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-139 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of forgery in the second degree when, with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument or issues or possesses any written instrument which he knows to be forged, which is or purports to be, or which is calculated to become or represent if completed: (1) A deed, will, codicil, contract, assignment, commercial instrument or other instrument which does or may evidence, create, transfer, terminate or otherwise affect a legal right, interest, obligation or status; or (2) a public record or an instrument filed or required or authorized by law to be filed in or with a public office or public servant . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cLarceny includes . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">\u201c(2) Obtaining property by false pretenses. A person obtains property by false pretenses when, by any false token, pretense or device, he obtains from another any property, with intent to defraud him or any other person. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\"> General Statutes (Sup. 2010) \u00a7 53a-125b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the sixth degree when he commits larceny . . . and the value of the property or service is five hundred dollars or less.\u201d In 2004, when the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct occurred, the statute specified the amount of $250 or less. Number 09-138, \u00a7 6, of the 2009 Public Acts increased that amount to $500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\"> <em>Golding </em>permits a defendant to \u201cprevail on [an unpreserved] claim of constitutional error . . . only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> The defendant also reasserts his claim that the trial court improperly omitted an instruction concerning the essential elements of the crime of forgery in the second degree by failing to define the words \u201cissuing,\u201d \u201cpossessing\u201d and \u201cknowledge.\u201d In support of his claim, the defendant notes that the model instruction for forgery by means of \u201cissuing or possessing\u201d a forged instrument includes definitions of those terms. See J. Pellegrino, Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions: Criminal (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 10.5, p. 538. The state counters that there was no instructional error and points out that the defendant is not claiming that the trial court\u2019s instruction contained any incorrect statement of law. Because we find that defense counsel\u2019s actions at trial support a finding of waiver, we will not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">We emphasize, however, that the defendant\u2019s trial did not turn on the nuances of issuing, possessing or knowledge. The state\u2019s theory of the case was that the defendant created the insurance card and sold it to Estremera. The defendant never argued that his conduct failed to satisfy the dictates of the \u201cissues or possesses\u201d prong of the forgery statute. Rather, his defense was that Estremera was lying. Therefore, the omitted instructions pertain to an issue that was not a particular focus of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> The transcript of the trial court\u2019s initial jury instruction provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of forgery in the second degree when with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another he falsely makes, completes or alters a written instrument or issues or possesses any written instrument which he knows to be forged which is or purports to be or which is calculated to become or represent if completed a deed, will, codicil, assignment, commercial instrument, or other instrument which does or may evidence, create, transfer, terminate or otherwise affect a legal right, interest, obligation or status; or two, a public record or an instrument filed, required or authorized by law to be filed in or with a public office or public servant.</p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">\u201cNow, the information charges the defendant with two counts of forgery. The law states that a person is guilty of forgery when with intent to defraud, deceive or injure another, he falsely makes, completes or alters the written instrument. A \u2018written instrument\u2019 is any instrument or article containing written or printed matter or the equivalent thereof used for the purpose of reciting, embodying, conveying or recording information. A written instrument may be complete or incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"AZW\">\u201cA \u2018complete written instrument\u2019 is one fully drawn with respect to every essential feature thereof whereas an \u2018incomplete written instrument\u2019 is one that requires additional matter or content to render it complete.</p>\n<p id=\"A0h\">\u201cForgery may be consummated in any one of the following ways: Falsely making a completed written instrument, falsely making an incomplete written instrument, falsely completing an incomplete written instrument, falsely altering a complete written instrument, falsely altering an incomplete written instrument <em>or issuing or possessing any written instrument that he knows to be forged. </em>The law in reference to this crime uses the term \u2018falsely makes,\u2019 \u2018falsely completes,\u2019 \u2018falsely alters\u2019 a written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"aum-dedup-0\">\u201cThus, the crime of forgery may be committed by falsely making or preparing a written instrument, placing liability on a particular person or entity, or the maker or drawer did not authorize the making or drawing of the instrument; or, two, by falsely inserting or changing matter in an incomplete written instrument so as to make it appear as a genuine, fully authorized, complete written instrument; or, three, by falsely altering any complete or incomplete written instrument by erasure, obliteration, deletion or insertion so as to make it appear genuine and fully authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"AhQ\">\u201cNow, if you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the crime of forgery in the second degree, then you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>will find the defendant guilty. On the other hand, if you find that the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the elements, then you shall find the defendant not guilty. Remember, that goes to both counts of forgery.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> Given the lack of evidence relating to defense counsel\u2019s opportunity to review the trial court\u2019s <em>initial </em>instruction, if the jury had not requested a supplemental instruction, this court could not construe defense counsel\u2019s acquiescence to the trial court\u2019s instruction as an implied waiver of the defendant\u2019s claim. Our waiver analysis focuses instead on defense counsel\u2019s opportunity to review and take exception to the <em>supplemental </em>instruction that the trial court provided in response to the jury\u2019s request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> The defendant concedes that the trial court\u2019s written supplemental instruction on the elements of forgery in the second degree was virtually identical to the initial instruction that the trial court delivered from the bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> Specifically, in <em>Kitchens, we held </em>that \u201cto the <em>extent we </em>concluded in <em>Ebron </em>that the claim of an improper jury instruction is reviewable under <em>Golding </em>only if the instructional error is not induced or invited, even if counsel fails to object or demonstrates by other conduct that he or she is satisfied with the charge as given ... we now overrule our holding in that case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 472-73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\"> Justice Katz, in her dissent, contends that we should not imply waiver in this case because the supplemental instruction was requested by the jury rather than defense counsel and that such requests \u201carise from unforeseen circumstances and often require prompt response to avoid undue interruption in jury deliberations.\u201d In fact, in this case, the trial court released the jury for the day and allowed both parties to review the copy of its written supplemental instruction overnight. We have no reason to believe that all of our trial court judges, particularly where the jury has expressed concern or confusion regarding jury instructions, will not allow adequate time for counsel to provide meaningful input.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b582-9\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Az73\">dissenting. By applying the newly established rule in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 10 A.3d 942 (2011), to determine that the defendant, Jason Shola Akande, waived review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of a purported constitutional impropriety in a supplemental instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tion requested by the jury<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in his criminal trial, the majority has wrenched the holding in <em>Kitchens </em>away from its purported legal moorings and set it loose upon yet another area of our <em>Golding </em>jurisprudence. From this unwarranted extension of <em>Kitchens, </em>it appears that the battle to preserve <em>Golding </em>review of any instructional errors likely is lost, and although I recognize that \u201c[w]hat\u2019s gone and what\u2019s past help [s]hould be past grief,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1 feel obliged to acknowledge how the majority\u2019s opinion in the present case undermines a foundational part of this court\u2019s role in protecting defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In concluding that a defendant may waive his right to a constitutional challenge to an improper jury instruction, the majority in <em>Kitchens </em>had relied on principles unique to the context of initial jury instructions: (1) a recognition that our rules of practice provide for substantial participation by counsel in formulating and reviewing jury instructions; (2) public policy that favors encouraging trial courts to hold charging conferences pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-19;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) public policy that favors encouraging defense counsel to \u201ctake advantage of the opportunities provided by the rules of practice, that is, to submit a request to charge, to seek an on-the-record charge conference and to raise objections whenever necessary . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>supra, 299 Conn. 496. None of these principles support a finding of waiver in the wholly different context of supplemental instructions requested by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Specifically, in crafting its novel approach to waiver of <em>Golding </em>review, the majority in <em>Kitchens </em>had focused on the particular context in which the purported waiver arose, namely, following a charging conference regarding the initial jury charge conducted pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-19. Id., 493-94. The majority in <em>Kitchens </em>had presumed that this procedure necessarily provided ample opportunity for the defendant\u2019s participation in and reflection upon the proposed charge. In contrast to the process of crafting and approving initial jury instructions, however, the rules of practice do not set forth a process by which defense counsel may participate in proposing and crafting supplemental instructions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This difference likely reflects the fact that supplemental instructions requested or prompted by the jury, by their very nature, arise from unforeseen circumstances and often require prompt response to avoid undue interruption in jury deliberations. Defense counsel is aware throughout an entire trial that the trial court will provide the jury with initial instructions; he or she is afforded no similar warning concerning supplemental instructions. Accordingly, the public policy concerns on which the <em>Kitchens </em>majority had relied simply are not implicated in cases, like the present one, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ceming supplemental jury instructions, especially when such instructions are the result of questions by the jury. Considering these differences, I would not conclude that the analysis set forth in <em>Kitchens </em>applies to supplemental instructions requested by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Instead, I would continue to apply our well developed framework governing the waiver of <em>Golding </em>review of supplemental instructions, as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>293 Conn. 327, 340-41, 977 A.2d 199 (2009), <em>and State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 631-32, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002). These cases, read together, stand for the proposition that a defendant waives <em>Golding </em>review of a claimed impropriety in a supplemental instruction only when he or she has <em>requested </em>a supplemental instruction and affirmatively acquiesces to the language of the instruction as given. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 340-41 <em>(&lt;Golding </em>review was deemed waived when defense counsel \u201crequested that the trial court remind the jury of its obligation to determine that the defendant was at the crime scene before it could find the defendant guilty. The court proposed, and defense counsel offered no objection to, a supplemental instruction that essentially repeated a portion of its initial alibi instruction.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>supra, 631-32 <em>(Golding </em>review waived when defense counsel raised concern about initial instruction, trial court proposed supplemental instruction and defense counsel agreed that proposed instruction would be adequate); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Holness, </em>289 Conn. 535, 541, 958 A.2d 754 (2008) <em>(Golding </em>review waived when defense counsel requested limiting instruction and affirmatively agreed to instruction given).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In the present case, the defendant did not request the supplemental instruction; it was given in response to a question from the jury. This distinction is significant. A defendant\u2019s request for an instruction indicates that the defendant is aware of a potential problem and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>fore, any acquiescence to a proposed solution to that problem may give rise to an inference that the defendant knowingly and intentionally has waived any constitutional challenge thereto. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>252 Conn. 274, 295, 746 A.2d 150 (\u201c[a] waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege . . . [which] must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 (2000). Moreover, in the present case, the trial court failed to provide a copy of the initial jury instructions or to conduct a charging conference concerning those instructions, and there is no indication in the record that the defendant ever assented to those instructions. Cf. <em>State </em>v. Foster, supra, 293 Conn. 342 (noting that \u201c[i]n fact, defense counsel in the present case not only failed to object to the court\u2019s supplemental instruction but also expressed his satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s initial instructions\u201d). Indeed, in the present case, there is nothing in the record to indicate that defense counsel was aware of the alleged instructional improprieties. Therefore, consistent with this court\u2019s well established precedents, I would conclude that the defendant did not waive <em>Golding </em>review of his claim that the jury instructions were constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\"> Until this court\u2019s recent evisceration of this doctrine in <em>Kitchens </em>and its progeny, pursuant to <em>Golding, </em>a defendant could prevail on an unpreserved claim if: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomas D., </em>296 Conn. 476, 503, 995 A.2d 583 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> It is clear from the majority opinion that waiver is being determined solely on the basis of the circumstances surrounding the supplemental instruction, not the allegedly deficient initial jury charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\"> W.
