The plaintiff, C. R. Klewin Northeast, LLC, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>state of Connecticut, following the court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint. In dismissing the complaint, the trial court reasoned that, because the plaintiff had failed to comply properly with the notice requirement of \u00a7 4-61 (a), its claim against the state was barred by sovereign immunity and, therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court improperly concluded that the notice given by the plaintiff was inadequate and, accordingly, reverse the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The following facts, which were found by the trial court following an evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On October 6, 1998, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the state department of public works (department) to construct or alter certain buildings at Manchester Community College. While performing the contract, the plaintiff encountered various delays and change orders that caused it to incur additional expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On August 31,2001, approximately nine months after the completion of the project,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff sent Richard Piotrowski, the department\u2019s bureau chief of facilities, design and construction, a detailed communication requesting that it be paid an additional $2,678,256 for contract overruns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On April 15, 2004, after attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>obtain compensation for the overruns failed, Michael D\u2019Amato, the plaintiffs president, hand delivered a letter to James T. Fleming, the department\u2019s commissioner. The April 15, 2004 letter began by \u201crequesting] [Fleming\u2019s] assistance in resolving an issue that has been pending since August 31, 2001,\u201d and proceeded to identify the contract, project and amount and cause of the overruns.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After referring to the August 31, 2001 submission to the department and detailing the plaintiffs futile efforts to receive payment despite repeated assurances that the submission was being processed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiff concluded its letter by emphasizing that it \u201chas been extremely patient waiting for payment. We have not submitted a claim requesting interest, home office overhead or other items. We have worked within the system and have followed all the rules. We have been out of pocket more than $2,000,000 since Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ber, 2000. This has caused a significant impact on our business. All we ask is to be treated fairly and honestly and that payment due us be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Following receipt of the plaintiffs April 15, 2004 letter, Fleming directed David O\u2019Heam, the department\u2019s deputy commissioner, to request additional documentation from the plaintiff and, thereafter, to meet with the plaintiff to discuss its request for additional payment. In an April 28, 2004 letter to D\u2019Amato, O\u2019Heam stated: \u201cWe have located your original submission of August 31,2001, and I have asked the project manager to review the notebook and comment.\u201d The plaintiff replied on May 4, 2004, by providing a copy of a change order proposal dated March 14, 2002, and Joel Baranowski, a state project manager, responded on June 7, 2004, with a list of questions. D\u2019Amato, O\u2019Heam and Baranow-ski then met in September, 2004, to discuss the plaintiffs request. The minutes of that meeting reflected that the plaintiff had hired a claims consultant who valued the claim at more than $5 million, but that the plaintiff was willing to accept $1.2 million in compromise. On September 20, 2004, Fleming contacted Marc Ryan, the secretary of the office of policy and management, to recommend discussion of the plaintiffs claim, and both Fleming and the attorney general recommended to Governor M. Jodi Rell (governor) that the plaintiff be paid. On March 8, 2005, the governor authorized the department to settle the plaintiffs claim for $1.2 million.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the plaintiff was never paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On November 27, 2007, the plaintiff filed the present action pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On January 28, 2008, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>state filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the state claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff had failed to comply with the notice provision of \u00a7 4-61 (a). The plaintiff objected to the motion to dismiss, claiming that it had given the requisite notice, and requested a hearing to resolve the factual dispute. The trial court heard oral argument and received evidence on October 30, 2008, and held a hearing on November 25, 2008, at which witnesses testified and further evidence was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the state had not received sufficient statutory notice of the plaintiffs claim. As to the plaintiffs August 31,2001 communication, the court noted that it had not been delivered to Fleming, who was the head of the department, as required by \u00a7 4-61 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As to the April 15, 2004 letter, the court reasoned that \u201c[n]o reference to any intent to pursue a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 4-61, or by suit or arbitration, is contained in this letter.\u201d The trial court analogized to jurisprudence concerning notice provisions in other statutes unrelated to state contracts and held that, \u201cunder \u00a7 4-61, providing the head of the agency with details about a request for an adjustment to a contract or about a contract dispute is insufficient. A purported notice is insufficient under \u00a7 4-61 if it lacks an essential element: notice of intent to pursue a claim for damages, either by an action in court or through an arbitration claim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The trial court acknowledged testimony from both Fleming and O\u2019Heam confirming \u201cthat, in 2004, [the plaintiff] was claiming that the state owed [the plaintiff] money on the [Manchester Community College] project, and provided information in support of its claim to [the department]; and that [the department] conducted an investigation which led to the recommended settlement,\u201d but concluded that the officials\u2019 testimony did \u201cnot amount to evidence that [the plaintiff] provided a notice of claim that met the statutory requirements.\u201d The trial court concluded further that the April 15, 2004 letter did not provide the factual basis for the plaintiffs claim as required by \u00a7 4-61 (a). The trial court then dismissed the plaintiffs complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 4-61 (a) required it to notify Fleming explicitly that it intended to pursue its claim either in court or in arbitration. It argues that the statute provides only that a contractor give the head of a department advance written notice of the claim itself and of its factual basis. The plaintiff argues additionally that its April 15, 2004 letter to Fleming conveyed the factual basis of its claim as required by \u00a7 4-61 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We begin with standards governing the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint and our review of that decision. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bacon Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>294 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>695, 706, 987 A.2d 348 (2010). \u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of the common law that a state cannot be sued without its consent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, \u201ca plaintiff seeking to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that . . . the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Moreover, \u201cwhen the state waives sovereign immunity by statute a party attempting to sue under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions, because [statutes in derogation of sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state, so that its sovereignty may be upheld and not narrowed or destroyed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>287 Conn. 1, 8, 946 A.2d 1219 (2008). \u201cThus, aparty [seeking] to litigate or arbitrate a disputed claim arising under a public works contract bears the burden of proving that the claim fits precisely within the narrowly drawn reach of \u00a7 4-61.\u201d Id., 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The plaintiff does not contest the findings of fact made by the trial court in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, but rather, the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4-61 (a) and its application of the statute to the facts found. The plaintiffs claims, therefore, present issues of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. Id., 7. When we construe a statute, \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretative guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 8. \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the [statutory term], when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>State, </em>297 Conn. 798, 801, 1 A.3d 39 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The plaintiff argues first that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 4-61 (a), contrary to its plain language, to require a party providing notice under that provision to inform a commissioner explicitly of its intention to bring an action. We agree. The relevant portion of \u00a7 4-61 (a) provides that any \u201ccorporation which has entered into a contract with the state, acting through any of its departments ... for the . . . construction ... or alteration of any . . . building or other public works of the state . . . may, <em>in the event of any disputed claims under such contract </em>. . . <em>bring an action against the state </em>. . . <em>for the purpose of having such claims determined, provided notice of each such claim under such contract and the factual bases for each such claim shall have been given in writing to the agency head of the department </em>administering the contract within [a certain prescribed time period].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In concluding that the April 15, 2004 letter to Fleming was insufficient to invoke the waiver of immunity afforded by \u00a7 4-61, the trial court reasoned, in part, that the phrase \u201cnotice of each such claim\u201d in \u00a7 4-61 (a) meant notice of the plaintiffs intent to bring an action. Although it is true that in typical usage; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); the term \u201cclaim\u201d can mean either \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>cause of action\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); or merely an asserted \u201c[r]ight to payment,\u201d in whatever form; id.; we think it is clear that the legislature, as to the notice requirement, intended notice of the right to payment only. Specifically, although \u00a7 4-61 (a) confers, in the same sentence containing the notice provision, the right to commence an \u201caction,\u201d the legislature, when describing the content of the prerequisite notice, chose to use a different term, \u201cclaim.\u201d We often have observed that \u201c[t]he use of the different terms . . . within the same statute suggests that the legislature acted with complete awareness of their different meanings . . . and that it intended the terms to have different meanings . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Felician Sisters of St. Francis of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Historic District </em>Commission, 284 Conn. 838, 850, 937 A.2d 39 (2008); see also <em>Bruttomesso </em>v. <em>Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., </em>242 Conn. 1, 13, 698 A.2d 795 (1997); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 613, 440 A.2d 810 (1981) (use of different terms within same sentence of statute \u201cplainly\u201d implies different meanings intended).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additionally, if the legislature had intended to require that a contractor provide notification of its intent to bring an action, it could have said so explicitly, as it has in other statutes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 7-465 (a) (disallowing action against municipality or its employee unless, inter alia, \u201cwritten notice <em>of the intention to commence such action . . . </em>has been filed with the clerk of such municipality\u201d [emphasis added]). Finally, we have reviewed the case law on which the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>relied, and we are not persuaded that it imposes upon plaintiffs who commence an action pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 a notice requirement that is not present in, and in fact is contradicted by, the plain language of \u00a7 4-61.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the notice contemplated by \u00a7 4-61 does not require an explicit statement of intent to bring an action against the state. Rather, it is sufficient if a contractor provides factually adequate written notice to a department head that it is asserting a right to payment of money that it believes it is owed. Here, the plaintiffs April 15, 2004 letter clearly asserts such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The plaintiffs second argument concerns the amount of factual information that must accompany a notice of claim under \u00a7 4-61 (a). Again, we begin with the statutory language. Section 4-61 (a) requires written notice of \u201ceach such claim under such contract and the factual bases for each such claim,\u201d but does not elaborate further on the level of detail required. Because it is unclear from the statutory language whether the plaintiffs April 15,2004 letter provided adequate factual detail, we look to the legislative history of \u00a7 4-61 and the circumstances surrounding its enactment to determine the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u201cPrior to the enactment of \u00a7 4-61, suits against the state by contractors were not countenanced because of sovereign immunity. Individualized legislative authorization to sue was required to be sought by petition before an action could be brought against the state. . . . In 1957, the legislature enacted \u00a7 4-61 to reduce the number of petitions for permission to sue the state that it received involving suits over state construction contracts. . . . Another reason for allowing parties who had contracted with the state to sue the state directly without seeking legislative authorization was the hope that affording contractors the right to sue would reduce the costs of construction projects to the state by eliminating the cost of the lengthy legislative authorization process that was often built into state construction contracts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 11. \u201cBy permitting a contractor to seek recourse against the state for claims arising under a public works contract, the legislature clearly intended to provide the contractor with significant protection against a breach of that contract by the state. The fact that contractors have been granted such protection under \u00a7 4-61 would suggest that they are more likely to bid on state projects, which, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>would make it more likely that the cost to the state of such projects will be reduced.\u201d <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>250 Conn. 553, 560, 737 A.2d 398 (1999). In short, \u00a7 4-61 was designed to \u201cincreas[e] the quality of construction in the state while, at the same time, reducing its cost by permitting contractors to sue the state directly to resolve disputed claims arising under public works contracts quickly and efficiently.\u201d Dep<em>t. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">When it was originally enacted, \u00a7 4-61 contained no notice provision or limitations period within which actions were required to be commenced. See Public Acts 1957, No. 229. Accordingly, actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 were governed by the general statute of limitations for contract actions, which affords a plaintiff six years in which to bring suit. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Roads and Bridges, Pt. 2, 1961 Sess., p. 955, testimony of Adam Knurek on behalf of the state highway department; see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-576 (a). In response to the state\u2019s concern that unexpected actions were being brought long after projects were completed, hampering the state\u2019s ability to investigate due to the geographic dispersal of witnesses and records, the legislature adopted No. 555 of the 1961 Public Acts, which amended \u00a7 4-61 to require that actions be brought sooner and that contractors provide prior notice of the nature of their claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, pp. 954-55, testimony of Knurek; id., pp. 956-57, 972, testimony of Attorney General Albert L. Coles; id., pp. 965-66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>testimony of James Haran on behalf of the department of public works; id., pp. 969-70, testimony of Edwin Burdick on behalf of the Connecticut Road Builders Association. Although a proposed version of the original notice provision called for some level of detail as to the subject matter of the claim,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the legislature ultimately adopted language that was less stringent, requiring simply \u201cnotice of the general nature of such [disputed] claim . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1961, No. 555. The legislature apparently was concerned that requiring too much detail could impede contractors\u2019 rights to bring actions,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> thereby interfering with the policy objectives of \u00a7 4-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In 1991, in response to the state\u2019s concern that the lack of provisions governing arbitration proceedings brought pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 (b)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> had created an uneven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>playing field, the legislature added subsections (c) through (g) to \u00a7 4-61. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-284, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 91-284). Relevant to the present matter, state officials testified at committee hearings that under the existing scheme, some contractors would provide vague notices of claims, invoke freedom of information statutes to demand records from the state, then file demands for immediate arbitration. Due to the short timetable and an inability to access these contractors\u2019 records, the state was unable to respond effectively.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In response, the legislature added subsection (c), which requires generally that contractors and the state allow each other equal access to any relevant documents once notice of a claim has been filed, and subsection (d), which provides generally that in the event of an arbitration hearing, the parties be afforded adequate time to prepare. P.A. 91-284. Additionally, the notice requirements as to both litigation and arbitration were changed to their present versions, requiring written \u201cnotice of each such claim under such contract <em>and the factual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>bases for each such claim </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) P.A. 91-284.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In each chamber of the General Assembly, when the 1991 amendment was introduced, its sponsor stated that the \u201cnotice requirement should be liberally construed so as not to defeat any claim in [close] cases.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1991 Sess., p. 8531, remarks of Representative Robert D. Godfrey; see also 34 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1991 Sess., p. 2162, remarks of Senator Marie A. Herbst. Representative Godfrey explained that notice would be \u201csufficient if it communicates to the [s]tate the nature of the claim based on what is known at the time so that the [sjtate may attempt to resolve the problem short of arbitration.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 8531. Senator Herbst explained similarly: \u201c[T]he amendment requires a contractor to provide more information to the [s]tate in their notice of claim so that the [s]tate may attempt to resolve the problem short of arbitration.\u201d 34 S. Proc., supra, p. 2162.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Taking into consideration the evolution of the statute, we conclude that the plaintiffs April 15, 2004 letter to Fleming constitutes sufficient notice of a claim pursuant to \u00a7 4-61. The histoxy of the notice provision indicates a persistent concern that it not be applied so restrictively as to prevent contractors from pursuing meritorious claims and, accordingly, to defeat the purpose of \u00a7 4-61. Although \u00a7 4-61 was reworded in 1991 to require somewhat greater detail as to claims, that rewording was designed to prevent ambushes, not to provide a vehicle to defeat valid claims, and it was accompanied by other changes to \u00a7 4-61 that gave the state greater power to seek documentation from contractors and more time in which to evaluate the documentation, lessening the need for a highly specific notice of claim. Furthermore, pursuant to the 1961 amendments, contractors are allowed limited time in which to give notice and to bring actions, ensuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that claims remain fresh. Finally, the legislature clearly intended that, in close cases, the scale tip in favor of affording the contractor the right to pursue its claim. This in turn promotes the policy objectives underlying \u00a7 4-61 by encouraging competitive bidding, resulting in greater quality construction and lower costs to the state. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 11, 14; <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Here, the plaintiffs April 15, 2004 letter identified the contract date and amount, the location and subject matter of the project, the planned and actual dates of completion, and the cause and amount of overruns. See footnotes 6 and 7 of this opinion. The letter also explicitly included a detailed timeline of previous efforts to resolve the matter informally; see footnote 7 of this opinion; which enabled Fleming readily to locate voluminous, comprehensive documentation already in the department\u2019s possession. Taking into consideration a commissioner\u2019s ability to demand from a contractor any additional information necessary to investigate a claim to either avoid or prepare for litigation or arbitration,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we conclude that the notice of claim provided by the plaintiff to Fleming was adequate. Accordingly, the trial court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim and, therefore, improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a) provides: \u201cAny person, firm or corporation which has entered into a contract with the state, acting through any of its departments, commissions or other agencies, for the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state or any political subdivision of the state may, in the event of any disputed claims under such contract or claims arising out of the awarding of a contract by the Commissioner of Public Works, bring an action against the state to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for the purpose of having such claims determined, <em>provided notice of each such claim under such contract and the factual bases for each such claim shall have been given in writing to the agency head of the department administering the contract within the period which commences with the execution of the contract or the authorized commencement of work on the contract project, whichever is earlier, and which ends two years after the acceptance of the work by the agency head evidenced by a certificate of acceptance issued to the contractor or two years after the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier. </em>No action on a claim under such contract shall be brought except within the period which commences with the execution of the contract or the authorized commencement of work on the contract project, whichever is earlier, and which ends three years after the acceptance of the work by the agency head of the department administering the contract evidenced by a certificate of acceptance issued to the contractor or three years after the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier.

It affords a party the right to \u201csubmit a demand for arbitration of [a] claim or claims\u201d if timely \u201cnotice of each such claim and the factual bases of each claim has been given in writing to the agency head of the department administering the contract . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (b).

App. 562, 564, 942 A.2d 546 (2008), which concerned the notice requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144, a provision that waives the state\u2019s immunity to allow actions for personal injury or property damage caused by defective highways, bridges or sidewalks, and <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Electric Boat Corp., </em>283 Conn. 840, 842, 930 A.2d 653 (2007), which involved the notice requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c, a provision that imposes time limitations for filing workers\u2019 compensation claims. Both statutes contain notice requirements. In each case, the court held that the plaintiff had failed to provide the statutorily required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Even if we assume that state public works contract disputes are sufficiently analogous to defective highway and workers\u2019 compensation disputes, so as to make the reasoning in the foregoing cases applicable, the holdings in those decisions are narrower than the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision suggests. Particularly, in none of the decisions did the injured party or his representative provide timely notice that was deemed insufficient due to its failure to pronounce explicitly an intent to sue. Rather, in the defective highway cases, the plaintiffs had failed to provide any timely notice at all and, instead, had relied on information provided either by, or to, third parties. See <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 17 and n.5 (decedent\u2019s representative claimed notice was provided by police report and letters to defendant from state legislators and citizen requesting prioritized attention to highway where accident occurred); <em>Salgado </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>supra, 106 Conn. App. 569-70 (although truck driver provided notice as to his personal injuries only, truck owner claimed notice of claim for property damage was provided by truck driver\u2019s notice and police report). In the workers\u2019 compensation case, the purported notice to the defendant employer was a claim seeking federal benefits, which in no way indicated the claimant\u2019s intent to pursue compensation under the state Workers\u2019 CompensationAct. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Electric Boat Corp., </em>supra, 283 Conn. 856-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\"> Specifically, the amendment required notice to be given no later than two years from the date of acceptance of the contract, and actions to be brought no later than three years from the date of acceptance of the contract.

In describing the operation of the provision, Coles explained: \u201c[A]ll you do is give them a letter and say, we have a claim. . . .
