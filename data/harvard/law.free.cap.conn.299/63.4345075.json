J.</author>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">The central issue in this case is whether an increase in the workload of certain teachers during the course of a school year constituted a unilateral change of a condition of employment under this state\u2019s collective bargaining law. The plaintiff, the board of education of Region 16, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its appeal from the decision of the named defendant, the state board of labor relations (board), in which the board concluded that the plaintiff had violated General Statutes \u00a7 10-153e (b) when it unilaterally changed a condition of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the board concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>plaintiff acted unlawfully when it unilaterally and substantially increased the workload of certain employees who were members of the defendant Region 16 Education Association (union). In addition, the board concluded that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing with the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) upheld the board\u2019s conclusion that the union was not required to prove that there was a unit wide employment practice in order to establish a prima facie case of a unilateral change; (2) concluded that the board\u2019s determination that the union had established a prima facie case of a unilateral change of a definite and fixed employment practice was supported by substantial evidence; and (3) concluded that the board\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing with the employees was supported by substantial evidence. We conclude that the board\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had unilaterally and substantially changed a definite and fixed employment practice was not supported by substantial evidence and, therefore, we reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment relating to that issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court, however, that the board\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment to the extent that it upheld the board\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>in direct dealing and ordered the plaintiff to cease and desist from such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The board found the following relevant facts. The plaintiff operates a high school known as Woodland High School (high school). The plaintiff also operates one middle school and three elementary schools. All of the schools provide both regular and special education programs. The length of the work year and work day of all teachers in the schools operated by the plaintiff is specified in the collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between the plaintiff and the union. The agreement also provides that \u201c[t]eachers are expected to be available for student help, parent conferences, faculty meetings, general staff department or group meetings, committee work, and other activities of a professional nature before and after regular school hours.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">At the beginning of the 2004-2005 school year, the high school had five special education teachers, including four \u201cskills lab\u201d teachers, each of whom was responsible for teaching a specific number of special education students, known as the teacher\u2019s \u201ccaseload,\u201d and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>transition coordinator, who was responsible for placing students in jobs in the community. The skills lab teachers were Arthur Richardson, Deborah Flaherty, Tracy Brunelle and Melissa Dean, and the transition coordinator was Jessica Veneziano. Richardson\u2019s caseload was approximately seventeen students; Flaherty\u2019s caseload was ten students; Brunelle\u2019s caseload was sixteen students; and Dean\u2019s caseload was fifteen students. No students were specifically assigned to Veneziano.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In October, 2004, Richardson resigned from his teaching position at the high school. The plaintiff attempted to find a replacement for him, but, because of a shortage of special education teachers in the state, was unable to do so. Mama Murtha, the plaintiffs director of pupil personnel and the person in charge of the plaintiffs department of special education, met several times with the skills lab teachers and Veneziano to discuss the best way to service Richardson\u2019s former students. Ultimately, they decided to divide Richardson\u2019s caseload among the skills lab teachers. In addition, Veneziano took on several of Richardson\u2019s students. As a result, Flaherty\u2019s caseload increased from ten to fourteen students and her work horns increased by approximately fourteen hours per week; Brunelle\u2019s caseload increased from sixteen to twenty-one students and her work hours increased by approximately ten hours per week; and Dean\u2019s caseload increased from fifteen to twenty-one students and her work hours increased by approximately ten hours per week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From the 2001-2002 school year through the 2005-2006 school year, special education teachers at the high school, middle school and elementary schools operated by the plaintiff had caseloads ranging from four to twenty-two students.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In January, 2005, the plaintiff hired a permanent, full-time substitute teacher to replace Richardson for the remainder of the school year. The substitute was not certified as a special education teacher, but had a \u201cdura-tional shortage area permit\u201d authorizing him to teach special education students on a temporary basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the substitute was hired, Murtha met with the skills lab teachers and Veneziano (special education teachers), and they decided that the substitute teacher would teach the self-contained history class, which had been one of Richardson\u2019s duties. Because they were \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with allowing the substitute to take on Richardson\u2019s other duties, however, the four special education teachers retained his caseload. At either the initial meeting or at another meeting, Murtha suggested that the special education teachers use the looping method employed by the middle school, in which teachers are assigned to students in a single grade level and move with the students when they progress to the next grade level. The union was not informed of the meetings at which these decisions were made. It was Murtha\u2019s standard practice when school employees left employment unexpectedly to attempt to hire replacements and to collaborate with the remaining staff, but not the union, to allocate the former employee\u2019s workload among the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">At some point after Richardson\u2019s departure, the special education teachers approached Murtha and complained that their workloads were too heavy. They did not ask Murtha directly for an increase in their compensation, but they asked the union to request an increase on their behalf. Thereafter, in late March, 2005, Murtha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>approached Brunelle and stated that the special education teachers should not proceed with \u201ctheir complaint\u201d because there was no point in pursuing it. Murtha also left a voicemail message for Brunelle in which she asked Brunelle to meet with the other special education teachers and to send a letter to Marguerite Shook, the plaintiffs superintendent of schools, stating that the union president, Catherine Mirabilio, had approached them regarding the complaint, not the reverse, and that they were not seeking a stipend for their increased workload. Brunelle responded by leaving a voicemail message for Murtha in which she stated that Mirabilio had not approached the special education teachers, but they had approached Mirabilio, and that they would not be sending a letter to Shook. Brunelle also forwarded Mur-tha\u2019s voicemail message to Mirabilio.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Thereafter, the union filed a complaint with the board alleging that the plaintiff had \u201cunilaterally and substantially increased the case management workload of [the] special education teachers without notification and without negotiating with the [union].\u201d After an eviden-tiary hearing, the board rendered a decision in which it concluded that the union had \u201cdemonstrated a fixed and definite practice among [the] special education teachers and a significant departure from that practice [and] . . . has established a prima facie case of unlawful unilateral change substantial enough to require bargaining.\u201d The board rejected the plaintiffs arguments that, because the caseload of special education teachers both at the high school and throughout the school district historically had fluctuated over the course of the school year as students were placed in or removed from the special education program, the union had failed to establish that the increased workload after Richardson\u2019s departure constituted an unlawful unilateral change. The board concluded that the former \u201csort of variation is anticipated by . . . teachers and thus per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>mits them to plan for the natural ebb and flow of students in their caseload. Richardson\u2019s absence, however, created an unexpected, sudden and fixed swelling in each [special education] teacher\u2019s caseload that lasted from the time of Richardson\u2019s departure in or about October of 2004 through the end of the school year in June 2005.\u201d The board also concluded that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing with the special education teachers. Accordingly, the board ordered the plaintiff to cease and desist from \u201c[i]ncreasing the workload of the special education teachers without negotiating with the [u]nion\u201d and from \u201c[d]ealing directly with employees concerning mandatory subjects of bargaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the trial court. After a hearing, the trial court determined that the board properly had concluded that the plaintiff had unilaterally and substantially changed a fixed and definite employment practice and had engaged in unlawful direct dealing with the special education teachers. Accordingly, it dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the board\u2019s decision that the plaintiff unilaterally and substantially changed a fixed and definite employment practice when it reassigned Richardson\u2019s caseload to the other special education teachers was supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that, because the union failed to present evidence either that the caseloads handled by the special education teachers or the hours that they worked per week were substantially greater after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Richardson\u2019s departure than in the preceding school years, the union failed to establish a fixed and definite prior practice. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">At the outset, we set forth the standard of review. \u201c[R]eview of an adininistrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldstar Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>288 Conn. 790, 833, 955 A.2d 15 (2008). \u201cAn administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The substantial evidence rule imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 833-34. \u201cIt is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the [agency], on the facts before [it], acted contrary to law and in abuse of [its] discretion .... The law is also well established that if the decision of the commissioner is reasonably supported by the evidence it must be sustained.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">We next review the law governing unilateral changes to employment conditions. Under \u00a7 10-153e (b) (4), regional boards of education are prohibited from \u201crefusing to negotiate in good faith with the employees\u2019 bargaining agent or representative which has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an. appropriate unit in accordance with the provisions of said sections . . . .\u201d This court previously has recognized that a unilateral change to an employment condition constitutes an unlawful refusal to negotiate under the statute. <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>162 Conn. 566, 596, 295 A.2d 526 (1972) (employer who unilaterally changes working conditions \u201cis refusing to bargain in fact with the employee organization\u201d); see also <em>In re Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 3806 (January 29, 2001) p. 4 (\u201c[a]n employer\u2019s unilateral change in a major term or condition of employment which involves a mandatory subject of bargaining will constitute a refusal to bargain and a prohibited practice under [\u00a7 10-153e (b) (4)] unless the employer proves an adequate defense\u201d); <em>In re Portland Board of Education, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 1670 (August 15, 1978) p. 3 (unilateral change in major condition of employment is subject to mandatory bargaining).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To establish a unilateral change of a condition of employment, the union must establish that the employment practice was \u201cclearly enunciated and consistent, [that it] <em>endure[d\\ over a reasonable length of time, </em>and [that it was] an accepted practice by both parties.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>293 Conn. 698, 719 n.33, 980 A.2d 880 (2009); see also <em>In re Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 3806, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>6 (\u201c[t]here is no question that [in order to constitute a condition of employment] the practice must be definite and fixed, rather than isolated and sporadic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u201cHowever, not all unilateral changes made by an employer constitute a refusal to bargain, such as when the change does not amount to a substantial change in a major term or condition ... or when the change solely concerns a matter fundamental to the operation of the public agency and falls within the realm of sole managerial discretion ... or where the collective bargaining agreement gives express or implied consent to the type of unilateral action involved.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Naugatuck, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2874 (December 27, 1990) p. 4; see also <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 580 (number of hours per day that teachers are required to be in attendance at school and number of days in school year during which teachers may be assigned to duties are matters of educational policy that are reserved to board of education and are not subject to mandatory negotiation);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>In re Bloomfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Board of Education, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2821 (July 3, 1990) p. 6 (\u201c[i]f a change is de minimis or insubstantial in its impact upon a major term or condition of employment, [the board] will decline to find [that] a prohibited practice has occurred\u201d). \u201c[T]he burden is on the union as complainant to prove that there has in fact been a practice and that it has in fact been changed.\u201d <em>In re Enfield Board of Education, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2580 (September 1, 1987) p. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">With these principles in mind, we address the plaintiffs claim that, because the union presented no evidence of a preexisting, fixed and definite practice concerning the special education teachers\u2019 workload, there was no basis for the board\u2019s finding that the increase in the number of hours that the special education teachers worked per week after Richardson\u2019s departure constituted a unilateral change. We agree. Although the union presented evidence that the weekly work hours of three of the special education teachers had increased by ten to fourteen hours after Richardson\u2019s departure, there was no evidence that the increased number of hours was substantially greater than the number of hours per week that they had worked <em>in previous school years. </em>Indeed, the only evidence regarding the workload of the special education teachers in prior years established that, from the 2001-2002 school year through the 2003-2004 school year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the caseload of three of the special education teachers had ranged from five special education students per teacher to twenty-one students.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This caseload was not substantially lower than the caseload of the special education teachers after Richardson\u2019s departure, which ranged from \u201cseveral\u201d students for Veneziano to twenty-one students for Brunelle and Dean. Moreover, even if we were to assume that the average caseload per special education teacher was somewhat greater after Richardson\u2019s departure than in previous years,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that would not necessarily mean that the average workload was greater. The students could have had fewer needs or, as the plaintiff pointed out to the trial court, the teachers could simply have spent less time servicing each student, within the parameters set by state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>special education law and the school board\u2019s educational policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">It is clear, therefore, that the baseline that the board used to determine whether there had been a unilateral change to an employment condition was the number of hours that the special education teachers had worked per week in the weeks immediately preceding Richardson\u2019s departure in October, 2004.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The union has provided no authority, however, for the proposition that, when an employment practice has been in place for years, the board can ignore the historic practice and consider a practice that has been in place for only a matter of weeks in determining whether there has been a substantial change from the practice. Indeed, the board\u2019s decisions support a contrary conclusion. See <em>In re East Hartford, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2212 (May 27, 1983) p. 3 (when employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>provided uniform benefit for approximately one year, benefit constituted condition of employment for purposes of unilateral change doctrine); <em>In re Portland Board of Education, </em>supra, Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 1670, pp. 3-4 (when employer had instituted requirement that teachers assume corridor duty five years prior to complaint, practice constituted condition of employment for purposes of unilateral change doctrine); <em>In re Dept. of Corrections, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2729 (April 28, 1989) p. 4 (although some employees occasionally reported to work in civilian clothes during seven years prior to complaint, practice did not constitute condition of employment for purposes of unilateral change doctrine); <em>In re Dept. of Public Safety State Police, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 2761 (September 12, 1989) p. 5 (employer\u2019s occasional denial of leave requests during four years preceding complaint contradicted union\u2019s claim that granting of all leave requests was condition of employment for purposes of unilateral change doctrine). Accordingly, we conclude that, in the absence of any evidence establishing the hours that the special education teachers worked per week in the school years preceding Richardson\u2019s departure, the board\u2019s finding that three of them had been required to work ten to fourteen more hours per week after Richardson\u2019s departure than immediately before it was not sufficient to support its conclusion that the plaintiff had unilaterally changed a fixed and definite employment practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">To the extent that the board claims that the evidence established that the plaintiff unilaterally changed a fixed and definite practice of not substantially increasing the work hours of the special education teachers suddenly during the school year, we are not persuaded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>have indicated, to establish a unilateral change of workload, the union must present evidence both that the employees\u2019 workload after the change was substantially greater than before it and that the preceding workload had \u201cendure[d] over a reasonable length of time, and [that it was] an accepted practice by both parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Honulik </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 719 n.33. Although we recognize that a sudden, unanticipated and substantial increase in workload may cause significant difficulties for an employee in the short term,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the defendants have provided no authority for the proposition that, if an increased workload was not a substantial departure from a fixed and definite prior practice, the increase nevertheless can constitute an unlawful unilateral change because of its timing, or the fact that it was unanticipated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We conclude in the present case that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the workload of the special education teachers immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>before Richardson\u2019s departure was a fixed and definite employment practice. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly determined that the board\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had unilaterally changed an employment condition in violation of \u00a7 10-153e (b) was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the board\u2019s decision that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing was supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">This court previously has recognized that, because \u201cConnecticut statutes dealing with labor relations have been closely patterned after the National Labor Relations Act [codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.]\u201d; <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. v. DeCourcy, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 578; the federal statute \u201cis of great assistance and persuasive force in the interpretation of our own acts.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id., 579. \u201cThe National Labor Relations Act [act] makes it an employer\u2019s duty to bargain collectively with the chosen representatives of [its] employees, and since this obligation is exclusive, it exacts the negative duty to treat with no other. . . . After a duly authorized collective bargaining representative has been selected, the employer cannot negotiate wages or other terms of employment with individual workers. . . . Thus, an employer interferes with his employees\u2019 right to bargain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>collectively . . . when he treats directly with employees and grants them a wage increase in return for their promise to repudiate the union which they have designated as their representative. . . . The statutory obligation thus imposed is to deal with the employees through the union rather than dealing with the union through the employees. Attempts to bypass the representative may be considered evidence of bad faith in the duty to bargain. . . . The act does not prohibit an employer from communicating in noncoercive terms with [its] employees while collective negotiations are in progress. . . . The element of negotiation is critical. Another crucial factor in these cases is whether or not the communication is designed to undermine and denigrate the union.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 592-93. Although \u201c [a]n employer may speak freely to its employees about a wide range of issues including the status of negotiations, outstanding offers, its position, the reasons for its position, and objectively supportable, reasonable beliefs concerning future events . . . [it] cannot act in a coercive manner by making separate promises of benefits or threatening employees. Thus the employer may freely communicate with employees in noncoercive terms, as long as those communications do not contain some sort of express or implied quid pro quo offer that is not before the union.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Americare Pine Lodge Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>164 F.3d 867, 875 (4th Cir. 1999); see also <em>Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, Local 509 </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commission, </em>431 Mass. 710, 717, 729 N.E.2d 1100 (2000) (\u201c[a]n employer\u2019s communication with its employees is direct dealing if its purpose or effect is the erosion of the [u]nion\u2019s status as exclusive bargaining representative\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Crete Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Saline County School District No. 76-0002, 265 </em>Neb. 8, 22, 654 N.W.2d 166 (2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(elements of direct dealing are \u201c[1] [t]he employer was communicating directly with union-represented employees; [2] the discussion was for the purpose of establishing wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment or undercutting the collective bargaining unit\u2019s role in bargaining; and [3] such communication was made to the exclusion of the collective bargaining unit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In the present case, the board concluded that, when Murtha met with the special education teachers to discuss the best way to handle Richardson\u2019s caseload after his departure and ultimately decided, in collaboration with the special education teachers, that the caseload would be divided among them, her conduct constituted unlawful direct dealing. The trial court concluded that the board\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence and, in addition, found that, when Murtha urged the special education teachers not to pursue their complaint to the union, that conduct also constituted unlawful direct dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We have concluded that the evidence did not support the board\u2019s conclusion that the increase in the special education teachers\u2019 workload constituted a substantial change to a fixed and definite employment practice. It necessarily follows that the evidence was insufficient to support the board\u2019s conclusion that Murtha\u2019s initial meetings with the special education teachers and her collaboration with them on the question of how best to reallocate Richardson\u2019s caseload constituted unlawful direct dealing with the teachers on a subject of mandatory negotiation. We conclude, however, that, after she became aware that the union intended to file a complaint to the board on the teachers\u2019 behalf, Murtha\u2019s suggestion to Brunelle that the special education teachers withdraw the complaint and her request that they write a letter to Shook stating that they had not approached the union and that they were not seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>a stipend for the additional workload constituted direct dealing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although Murtha did not expressly offer a quid pro quo, she implied that the special education teachers would be better off if they did not pursue their formal complaint with the union. At the very least, her dealings with Brunelle clearly were intended to influence the special education teachers on a matter in which the union was representing them and, thus, to undermine the union\u2019s role as the teachers\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 592-93; see also <em>Mattina </em>v. <em>Ardsley Bus Corp., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 10 Civ. 2474 (LTS) (S.D.N.Y.

Even though the union ultimately could not prevail on its claim that the increased workload was subject to mandatory negotiation because it failed to establish that the plaintiff had substantially changed a fixed and definite employment practice, once the teachers had invoked their right under the collective bargaining agreement to have the union represent them in connection with the claim, the plaintiff could no longer deal with the teachers directly on the matter. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly concluded that the board\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The judgment is reversed with respect to the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs claim challenging the board\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff had unilaterally changed a condition of employment in violation of \u00a7 10-153e (b), and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal on that issue; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-153e (b) provides: \u201cThe local or regional board of education or its representatives or agents are prohibited from: (1) Interfering, restraining or coercing certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in sections 10-153a to 10-153n; (2) dominating or interfering with the formation, existence or administration of any employees\u2019 bargaining agent or representative; (3) discharging or otherwise discriminating against or for any certified professional employee because such employee has signed or filed any affidavit, petition or complaint under said sections; (4) refusing to negotiate in good faith with the employees\u2019 bargaining agent or representative which has been designated or elected as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit in accordance with the provisions of said sections; or (5) refusing to participate in good faith in mediation or arbitration.

Likewise, we need not reach the plaintiffs subordinate claims that, if this court concludes that the trial court properly concluded that the board properly determined that the union had established a prima facie case of unilateral change, the trial court improperly determined that: (1) the board properly had rejected the plaintiffs defenses; (2) the board properly had excluded certain evidence from the hearing; and (3) the board\u2019s decision did not violate state and federal special education law and federal law governing the privacy of student educational records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\"> Article 9 of the agreement provides in relevant part: \u201cA.

The parties disagree as to how the standards that the board has adopted apply to the facts of this case, but neither the plaintiff nor the union contends that the standards themselves are unreasonable. Accordingly, we defer to the board\u2019s interpretation of the law. <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>285 Conn. 778, 784 n.8, 941 A.2d 932 (2008) (when agency\u2019s interpretation of statute is both reasonable and time-tested, it is entitled to deference by this court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\"> Because we conclude that the board\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had unilaterally changed a condition of employment was not supported by substantial evidence, we need not address the thorny questions of whether the reallocation of Richardson\u2019s caseload to the special education teachers was in the plaintiffs sole discretion and, if so, whether a substantial increase in their workload as the result of the reallocation would, nevertheless, be subject to mandatory negotiation. See <em>West Hartford Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>DeCourcy, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 586-87 (although \u201cboard of education alone is empowered to determine whether there shall be extracurricular activities and what such activities shall be . . . assignment of teachers to such activities and the question of compensation for such extracurricular activities [are] mandatory subjects of negotiation\u201d); <em>In re Bloomfield Board of Education, </em>Conn.

It is clear, therefore, that the board accepted the accuracy of that spreadsheet. Accordingly, although the board in its findings of fact did not specifically address the range of caseloads <em>before </em>Richardson\u2019s departure in October, 2004, which is the relevant time period for purposes of determining whether the union established a fixed and uniform employment practice, and did not focus exclusively on the range of caseloads managed by high school special education teachers, even though it ultimately determined that the practices of special education teachers in other schools were not relevant to its analysis, this court may rely on the spreadsheet to make that determination. As we have indicated, we assume, without deciding, that, in determining whether the union had established a fixed and definite employment practice, the board properly limited its consideration to high school special education teachers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> The plaintiff contends that the evidence established that, in the 2002-2003 school year, the four special education teachers were responsible for sixty-four students. It further contends that, after Richardson\u2019s departure, those four teachers were responsible for only fifty-eight students. Accordingly, the plaintiff contends that the average caseload of the special education teachers after Richardson\u2019s departure was less than in previous years. Although the defendants do not expressly dispute this contention, because the evidence on this question is not entirely clear, we decline to resolve this factual dispute. See <em>Wellswood Columbia, LLC </em>v. <em>Hebron, </em>295 Conn. 802, 808 n.7, 992 A.2d 1120 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> We emphasize that the evidence amply supported the board\u2019s finding that the special education teachers had worked an additional ten to fourteen hours per week after Richardson\u2019s departure than they had in the immediately preceding weeks. In addition, the evidence shows that these teachers willingly and professionally performed the additional work so as to ensure that the needs of the special education students were met. What the evidence does not show is that the special education teachers performed substantially more hours of work per week after Richardson\u2019s departure than they had in previous school years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> The union suggested at oral argument before this court that it was implicit, in the special education teachers\u2019 testimony that their weekly workload had increased by ten to fourteen hours after Richardson\u2019s departure, that the immediately preceding workload had existed over an extended period of time. In its brief to this court, however, the board states that it considered \u201cthe length of time [that] the working conditions of . . . [the] special education teachers had existed, which the [p]laintiff argued was not long enough to have created a past practice. The . . . [b]oard rejected this argument; although the length of time a condition has existed is a factor in the analysis, a relatively short existence is not fatal to a claim of unlawful unilateral change in a past practice.\u201d Thus, the board appears to concede that it compared the number of hours that the special education teachers worked per week after Richardson\u2019s departure to the number of hours the teachers had worked per week immediately before Richardson\u2019s departure, rather than to the number of hours that they had worked in previous school years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\"> The board concluded that the increase in the weekly work hours after Richardson\u2019s departure was different from \u201cthe typical variation in caseload in any given year caused by students entering and exiting the special educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tion program\u201d because Richardson\u2019s departure \u201ccreated an <em>unexpected, sudden </em>and fixed swelling in each [special education] teacher\u2019s caseload that lasted from the time of [his] departure . . . through the end of the school year . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The board also concluded that \u201cthe <em>surprise </em>increase in each [special education] teacher\u2019s caseload [constituted] a substantial impact on their workload.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\"> For example, if the workload of school employees in a particular school year were substantially lower than in preceding years, and the employees had reason to believe that the workload would remain constant over the course of the year, they might order their personal affairs, such as child care, carpooling, recreational activities and other such matters, accordingly. A sudden increase in workload to the historic level could disrupt these plans and cause significant inconvenience or expense to the employees. A sudden increase could also cause a temporary surge in workload above historic levels as the teachers attempted to get up to speed. These impacts would not, however, constitute a unilateral change to a fixed and definite employment practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\"> Moreover, in the present case, the board found as a factual matter that, when an employee of the plaintiff leaves unexpectedly during the school year and a substitute either cannot be found or cannot taire on all of the former employee\u2019s duties, the plaintiffs ordinary practice is to allocate the former employee\u2019s duties among the remaining employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> None of the parties has identified the specific provision of state law that prohibits employers from negotiating directly with employees who have chosen a bargaining representative. We presume, however, that the board found that direct dealing with school employees violates \u00a7 10-153e (b) (1), which prohibits regional boards of education from \u201c[interfering, restraining or coercing certified professional employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in sections 10-153a to 10-153n . . . .\u201d See <em>In re New London, </em>Conn. Board of Labor Relations Decision No. 4187 (October 3, 2006) pp. 1, 4 (direct dealing violates General Statutes \u00a7 7-470, which governs municipal employers and is substantially similar to \u00a7 10-153e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b103-5\"> We would reach this conclusion even if we were to assume Murtha actually believed that the union had approached the teachers, and not the reverse, and that the teachers were not seeking a stipend for the additional workload. Once the union became involved in the dispute, the plaintiff was required to deal exclusively with it and not with the teachers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> Although the board did not expressly conclude that this conduct by Murtha constituted unlawful direct dealing with the teachers, it expressly found that she had engaged in the conduct. It would elevate form over substance to conclude that the board\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had engaged in unlawful direct dealing was not supported by substantial evidence merely because, in its analysis of the claim, the board did not expressly refer to this particular conduct, which was a clearer case of direct dealing than the conduct to which it did expressly refer. Cf. <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands </em>Agency, 226 Conn. 579, 588, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993) (this court has held in certain contexts that it is improper for reviewing court to reverse agency decision simply because agency failed to state reason for decision on record).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
