On June 5, 2008, following a request by the board and Kevin D. Case, the superintendent of public schools of the town of Canton, officers of the Canton police department conducted a sweep of unattended cars and lockers at Canton High School and Canton Middle School using drug-sniffing dogs. The purpose of the warrantless, sus-picionless sweep, which was expressly authorized by the board\u2019s policies, was to detect the presence of illegal substances on school property. The students were informed at the beginning of their first period class that the sweep would occur and that they were to remain in their classrooms during the sweep unless there was an emergency. The sweep began near the end of the first period and lasted approximately one hour. As a result of certain contraband found during the sweep, one student was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Thereafter, on April 3, 2009, Harold Burbank and Marianne Burbank commenced the present action against the board on their own behalf and as parents and next friends of their child, A.B., who, at the time of the drug sweep, was a student at Canton High School. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the board from implementing its policy of conducting warrantless, suspi-cionless sweeps on school property with drug-sniffing dogs or, alternatively, to require school officials to provide at least forty-eight hours notice to parents prior to such a sweep. According to the complaint, the board\u2019s policy of conducting unannounced sweeps on school property violated (1) the Burbanks\u2019 rights as parents to manage the safety and education of their child under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution, and (2) A.B.\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">On September 14, 2009, following a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an injunction, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision denying the application. The court declined to review the plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional claims because they had been inadequately briefed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court, however, considered the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the federal constitution, treating the plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state constitutional rights as coextensive for purposes of the present case. The trial court concluded that the board\u2019s policy of having law enforcement personnel use drug-sniffing dogs to conduct warrantless, suspicionless sweeps on school property without advance notice to parents did not violate the plaintiffs\u2019 federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>trial court determined that the plaintiffs could not prevail on the merits of their claims, it denied their application for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly failed to review their state constitutional claims and, further, that the board\u2019s policy of allowing law enforcement personnel to conduct the sweeps violates the state constitution, at least in the absence of advance notice of the sweeps.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During oral argument before this court, however, the plaintiffs acknowledged that A.B. had graduated from Canton High School in June, 2010. As a consequence, although the plaintiffs contend that this appeal raises significant issues concerning the scope of parental rights and the rights of students to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the state constitution, we must dismiss it as moot because A.B. no longer is subject to the policies of the board and because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>do not fall within the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">\u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pen-dency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot. . . . [Under such circumstances, the case can not be reviewed] unless the defendant\u2019s claim falls under an exception to the mootness doctrine ....</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">\u201cThe mootness doctrine does not preclude a court from addressing an issue that is capable of repetition, yet evading review. . . . [F] or an otherwise moot question to qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dutkiewicz </em>v. <em>Dutkiewicz, </em>289 Conn. 362, 366-67, 957 A.2d 821 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">\u201cThe first element in the analysis pertains to the length of the challenged action . . . [and whether there are] functionally insurmountable time constraints [to full appellate review]. . . . The basis for this element derives from the nature of the exception. If an action or its effects [are] not of inherently limited duration, the action can be reviewed the next time it arises, when it will present an ongoing live controversy. Moreover, if the question presented is not strongly likely to become moot in the substantial majority of cases in which it arises, the urgency of deciding the pending case is significantly reduced.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 383-84, 660 A.2d 323 (1995). This requirement is satisfied when there is a strong likelihood that the inherently limited duration of the action will cause a substantial majority of cases raising the same issue to become moot prior to final appellate resolution. See <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>271 Conn. 193, 201-202, 856 A.2d 997 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">As we noted previously, A.B., a student when this action was commenced, graduated from Canton High School in June, 2010. Consequently, A.B. no longer is subject to the board\u2019s policies. Thus, neither A.B. nor A.B.\u2019s parents can be affected personally by any decision of this court granting them the injunctive relief that they have sought, namely, prohibiting the board from implementing its policy of allowing law enforcement personnel to conduct warrantless sweeps on school property with drug-sniffing dogs or, alternatively, requiring that the board provide at least forty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>eight hours notice of any such sweep.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn determining mootness, the dispositive question is whether a successful appeal would benefit the plaintiff ... in any way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jorden R., </em>293 Conn. 539, 556, 979 A.2d 469 (2009). Because our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in their favor would not benefit them in any way, their claims are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the claims that the plaintiffs raise in this appeal qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine. It is true, of course, that the opportunity of a parent or a student to litigate a claim challenging the board\u2019s policy is inherently limited in duration due to the fact that the effect of the policy on any particular student necessarily terminates upon that student\u2019s graduation. This limitation, however, is not so substantial, when compared to the time necessary to conclude appellate litigation, that it is very likely to cause a significant majority of cases raising a challenge to the policy to become moot in advance of final appellate resolution. See <em>Sweeney </em>v. Sweeney, supra, 271 Conn. 201-202. This is so because the board\u2019s policy concerning the sweeps applies to all students at Canton High School and Canton Middle School. Thus, an action challenging the policy could present a live controversy for as long as six years before becoming moot if that action were to be brought by a first year middle school student and the student\u2019s parents. Indeed, it appears that the present action itself would not have been rendered moot if one of the original plaintiffs, whose child was a student at Canton Middle School when the action was filed, had remained a party to the action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, for purposes of our analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>sis, it is significant to note that, in the present case, only approximately one and one-half years had elapsed from the time that the plaintiffs commenced this action, on April 3, 2009, until the date that this court heard oral argument in this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because so many Canton middle and high school students and their parents with standing to bring an action seeking to enjoin the board from implementing its policy likely would be able to obtain a final resolution of their appeal prior to the students\u2019 graduation, we cannot conclude that most actions challenging the policy would become moot before the appeals process has been completed. On the contrary, it is reasonable to expect that most such appeals would be resolved before the case becomes moot. Accordingly, the plaintiffs are not entitled to consideration of their appeal under the exception applicable to cases that, although moot, are capable of repetition, yet evading review. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal therefore must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\"> Harold Burbank and Marianne Burbank are spouses, and A.B. is their child.

[5] the historical approach, including the historical constitutional setting and the debates of the framers . . . and [6] economic/sociological considerations\u201d [citations omitted]); but the plaintiffs failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\"> Specifically, the trial court concluded, in rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, that a warrantless sweep using drug-sniffing dogs is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u201csearch\u201d for purposes of the fourth amendment to the federal constitution because students do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the odor or \u201caroma\u201d emanating from their unattended lockers and motor vehicles on school property. The trial court further concluded that the order that students remain in their classrooms did not constitute a \u201cseizure\u201d of the students within the meaning of the fourth amendment because school officials are authorized to schedule student activities during the school day, the students were allowed to leave their classrooms in the case of an emergency, and much of the time that the students were kept in their classrooms occurred during what normally would have been their first period classes. Finally, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the board\u2019s policy violated their right to family integrity, concluding that the policy of allowing law enforcement personnel to conduct the sweeps for contraband on school property does not implicate a fundamental interest in family integrity or strike at the heart of the parent-child relationship. We note, in addition, that the trial court also found that the evidence did not support the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the sweep conducted at the instance of the board had caused harm to students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\"> The plaintiffs also claim on appeal that the trial court improperly excluded, on hearsay grounds, certain evidence that, in the view of the plaintiffs, demonstrates the harm to students that was caused by the sweep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\"> Neither party has raised the issue of mootness on appeal.
