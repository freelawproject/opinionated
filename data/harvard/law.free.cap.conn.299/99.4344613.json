On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the substitute information; (2) granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the jury instructions; and (3) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal based on insufficient evidence of sexual assault in the first degree. The defendant also claims that the prosecutor engaged in impropriety during closing argument, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history. In August, 2006, the fifteen year old victim<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> lived with her mother, her mother\u2019s boyfriend, her brother and the defendant. One day in October, 2006, after the defendant had moved out of the victim\u2019s residence, he visited the victim at her residence and forced her to engage in oral and vaginal intercourse. Approximately one month later, the victim reported the incident to her school psychologist, which led to a police investigation. During the investigation, the police discovered at the defendant\u2019s residence a stolen motorcycle that had its vehicle identification number removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The defendant was arrested and charged with ten counts in three separate informations that were later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>consolidated for trial in a single substitute information. A jury trial began on July 9, 2007. The following day, the state rested its case, and the defendant moved for acquittal on the ground that the state had failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, which the trial court denied. Although the trial court, in addressing the sexual assault charges during argument on the motion, characterized the evidence of \u201cfear of physical injury\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1); as \u201cthin,\u201d the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence on the issue of \u201ccompulsion\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d to submit the case to the jury. On July 11, 2007, with the trial court\u2019s permission, the state filed an amended substitute information. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all ten counts, and the trial court rendered judgments in accordance with the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This direct appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the substitute information. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state failed to show good cause for its amendment of the substitute information, which prejudiced him. We disagree. The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. In the original substitute information, counts one and two, which alleged sexual assault in the first degree, each charged that the defendant had compelled \u201canother person, to wit: [the victim] to engage in sexual intercourse ... by the use of force against such other person, or by the threat of the use of force against such other person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person.\u201d On July 11, 2007, over the defendant\u2019s objections, the trial court allowed the state to file an amended substitute information that included the same ten counts against the defendant, except that it removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>from counts one and two the language referring to \u201cthe threat or use of force against such other person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person.\u201d The effect of this amendment was to limit the state to proving the charges of sexual assault in the first degree by establishing the use of force only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 36-18, the state \u201cfor good cause shown . . . may . . . amend the information at any time before a verdict or finding if no additional or different offense is charged and no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced.\u201d Section 36-18 \u201cis primarily a notice provision\u201d and \u201cthe decisive question is whether the defendant was informed of the charges with sufficient precision to be able to prepare an adequate defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>226 Conn. 601, 608, 628 A.2d 973 (1993). \u201c[0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s decision to permit an amendment to the information is one of abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>116 Conn. App. 801, 806, 977 A.2d 694, cert. denied, 294 Conn. 904, 982 A.2d 647 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In the present case, by amending the information, the state <em>eliminated </em>one possible method by which the jury could have found the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree. Because we are unable to perceive how the defendant could have been prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>by an amendment that deprived the state of a means of proving the offense, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the state to amend the substitute information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the jury instructions to remove: (1) any reference to the commission of sexual assault by the \u201cthreat of use of force\u201d; and (2) the consideration of the reasonableness of a victim\u2019s fear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201cthe reasonableness of a victim\u2019s fear . . . directly was relevant to the key element of force,\u201d and that \u201cthe [amended] jury charge . . . was so harmful as to either affect the result of the trial, or to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing the challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>292 Conn. 558, 566, 973 A.2d 1254 (2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 911, 130 S. Ct. 1296, 175 L. Ed. 2d 1086 (2010). Because, under the amended substitute information, the state could prove that the defendant had committed sexual assault in the first degree only by establishing the actual use of force, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the state\u2019s motion to amend the jury instructions to remove references to the threat of the use of force and the reasonableness of the victim\u2019s fear, which was relevant only to the issue of threat. The defendant has provided no authority for the proposition that the state must establish that the victim was afraid or that her fear was reasonable in order to prove the actual use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charges of sexual assault in the first degree because the state failed to present sufficient evidence \u201cupon which the jury could reasonably have concluded that the defendant used force to compel [the victim] to submit to sexual intercourse . . . .\u201d We disagree. The following additional facts, which the jury reasonably could have found by crediting the victim\u2019s testimony, are relevant to the resolution of this claim. On the day in question, the defendant entered the fifteen year old victim\u2019s bedroom, where she was on her bed talking on the telephone to her friend. The defendant began rubbing the victim\u2019s leg and, after she ended her telephone call, asked her to engage in sex. The victim declined. The defendant then removed the victim\u2019s pajama pants and said \u201che wanted to see how [she] felt, and if [she] was good at it.\u201d The victim responded by saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d The defendant then spread the victim\u2019s legs apart and engaged in oral sex with her. The victim \u201ctried to close [her] legs,\u201d but the defendant \u201cwas just pulling [them] open.\u201d After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>engaging in oral sex, the defendant then lay on top of the victim and engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. After he was done, the defendant told the victim that what had just happened would be their \u201clittle secret.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cOn appeal . . . [w]e ask . . . whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sargeant, </em>288 Conn. 673, 679, 954 A.2d 839 (2008). Construing the foregoing facts in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that the jury \u201creasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d with respect to the charges of sexual assault in the first degree. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial impropriety, depriving him of a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant argues that the \u201cprosecutor improperly misstated facts, introduced facts not in evidence, expressed personal opinion, and bolstered the credibility of a state\u2019s witness during closing argument.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">We have reviewed all of the challenged statements and, after analyzing whether impropriety \u201coccurred in the first instance,\u201d and whether that impropriety \u201cdeprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel T., </em>292 Conn. 262, 275, 973 A.2d 1207 (2009); we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims lack merit, with the exception of the prosecutor\u2019s comment to the jury during closing argument that the victim was \u201ctelling [them] the truth.\u201d Although we acknowledge that this comment was improper, we conclude that the impropriety did not violate the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 467-69, 478, 832 A.2d 626 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\"> The defendant appeals directly to this court from the judgments of the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\"> The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of nineteen years imprisonment, followed by twenty years of special parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> To the extent that the defendant claims that his motion for acquittal \u201calerted the state to a defect in its case,\u201d and that the state, \u201c[b]y amending the information to preclude the defendant\u2019s ability to argue the reasonableness of [the victim\u2019s] fear,\u201d prejudiced the defendant \u201cin that he was precluded from putting on a defense,\u201d we conclude that his argument is without merit. As we discuss later in this opinion, the alleged unreasonableness of the victim\u2019s fear was not a defense to the state\u2019s claim that the defendant had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse by the actual use of physical force, which was the only charge that ultimately was submitted to the jury. Accordingly, the defendant, contrary to his claim, was not \u201cprecluded . . . from being able to prove reasonable doubt that the state met its burden of proof as to a key element of the crime . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> We decline in this case the state\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>State </em>v. <em>Tanzella, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 614, in which we held that the state \u201cshoulders the burden of establishing that \u2018no substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced\u2019 \u201d when it seeks to amend the information after trial has commenced, and must therefore show: \u201c(1) good cause for the amendment; (2) that no additional or different offense is charged; and (3) that no substantive right of the defendant will be prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> The defendant objected to the state\u2019s motion to amend the jury instructions before and after the instructions were read to the jury, and his claim is therefore preserved for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
