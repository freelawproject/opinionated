The state appeals, upon our grant of its petition for certification,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>reversing the judgment of conviction of the defendant, Ricardo Collins, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2). <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>111 Conn. App. 730, 961 A.2d 986 (2008). The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the earlier nonfata! shooting of Stephen Rose, his cousin\u2019s husband (Rose shooting). The defendant contends otherwise, and also posits, as alternative grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury that the adequacy of the police investigation was not at issue in the case; and (2) determined that he had waived his right to counsel knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history, much of which are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe [murder] victim, Calvin Hopkins,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and his former girlfriend, Quiana Staton, jointly operated a \u2018business\u2019 in which Staton sold marijuana and Hopkins sold crack cocaine. At approximately 10:30 on the night of December 2, 2002, Hopkins went to Staton\u2019s Bridgeport apartment in a public hous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ing project known as the Greens. He came to the apartment carrying a large \u2018wad of cash\u2019 and retrieved an additional $500 to $600 from Staton\u2019s safe. Staton testified that Hopkins intended to use the money to purchase additional crack cocaine. Hopkins left Staton\u2019s apartment with the money at approximately 12 a.m. on the morning of December 3, 2002. He spoke to Staton on his cellular telephone approximately one hour later from his car in the parking lot of the apartment complex. During that conversation, Staton looked from her window to see Hopkins in his car talking to two unknown individuals. Staton later attempted to call Hopkins\u2019 cellular telephone at approximately 2 a.m. and again at 3 a.m. but received no answer to either of those calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">\u201cLater that morning, at approximately 7:15, Bridgeport police were dispatched to a scene a short distance from Staton\u2019s apartment complex where a green sedan was parked in the road preventing a school bus from passing. Upon opening the door to the vehicle, the police discovered Hopkins \u2018reclined in the front seat with his head leaning back and what appeared to be a large amount of blood in the interior of the vehicle.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201cAt the scene, a physician from the medical examiner\u2019s office recovered a bullet shell casing from Hopkins\u2019 collar, and the currency that Hopkins had been carrying in the earlier hours of the morning was not found on his body. Two anomalous fingerprints were found on the vehicle: the defendant\u2019s fingerprint was found on the exterior of the rear driver\u2019s side door and that of another individual, Anthony Berrios, was found on the exterior of the front passenger door. An autopsy later revealed that Hopkins died from a gunshot wound to the head, and bullet fragments were recovered from his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201cThe defendant became a suspect in this case because of his involvement in the [Rose shooting] in August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>2002. A firearms examiner testified at trial that the shell casing recovered from Hopkins\u2019 collar at the scene of the homicide was fired from the same weapon that had been used in the [Rose shooting].\u201d Id., 732-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201cThe defendant turned himself in to the Bridgeport police in January, 2003, for the Rose shooting. During the course of the police questioning, the defendant admitted to shooting Rose [with a chrome and black nine millimeter handgun] but also indicated that he had since sold the gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> . . . While in police custody for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the Rose shooting, the defendant was also questioned with regard to the Hopkins homicide. In his statement to police, the defendant admitted meeting with Hopkins in his car to purchase drugs during the night of December 2, 2002, but denied killing him.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following additional facts demonstrating, however, that the defendant did not actually dispose of the chrome and black nine millimeter handgun that he had used in the Rose shooting and, indeed, used it to kill Hopkins in the course of robbing him. Specifically, Ryshon Penix, the defendant\u2019s cousin, also lived in the Greens housing project. When the defendant visited him there on November 28,2002, several days before Hopkins\u2019 death, both Penix and Ivan Ramos, his roommate, noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>that the defendant had with him a chrome and black handgun. Further, Kimberly Finney, who had been incarcerated with the defendant at the Bridgeport correctional center, testified that the defendant had confessed to him in a conversation in the dayroom there that he had murdered Hopkins while robbing him. Fin-ney testified specifically that the defendant, while evading the police investigation of the Rose shooting, had unsuccessfully attempted to support himself by selling drugs in the Greens housing project, turned to robbery instead, and elected to rob Hopkins because the defendant, who had purchased drugs from Hopkins before, had seen him with a lot of money. After arranging to meet with Hopkins, ostensibly to purchase drugs, the defendant then attempted to rob Hopkins in his car, and shot him when Hopkins resisted. The defendant told Finney that he had turned himself in for the Rose shooting in an attempt to avoid being considered a suspect in the Hopkins case, figuring that \u201che [would] never become a suspect in the [Hopkins] case because he had been in jail already.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s initial trial for Hopkins\u2019 murder was declared a mistrial after the jury returned deadlocked. At the subsequent trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which resulted in the conviction, from which the defendant appeals, the state sought to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s role in the Rose [shooting], to which the defendant objected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant, who was representing himself at the time, argued that any testimony regarding the Rose shooting would be \u2018highly prejudicial\u2019 and of little probative value. He further argued that \u2018[t]he state . . . has me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>testifying that I had a gun and it got other evidence, and I was convicted of it, and I really don\u2019t see a need for this testimony here because ... it would inflame the jury .... I\u2019m on trial right now for this murder case, and it\u2019s a shooting case. It\u2019s two shooting cases. And if they was to bring [Rose], I think ... no matter what your instruction would be to the jury . . . that it still would be lingering in them that somebody got shot. And I would ask that you not allow it in.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u201cThe court determined that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and overruled the defendant\u2019s objection. It did, however, instruct the jury that the evidence could not be used to infer bad character of the defendant or his tendency to commit criminal acts. The defendant later objected to similar testimony, which was also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201cDuring deliberations, the jury twice communicated to the court that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to one of the counts charged. After each communication from the jury, the court instructed it to continue its deliberations, the second time giving a formal Chip Smith instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury eventually returned a verdict of guilty of murder, felony murder and robbery in the first degree on March 21, 2006. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, and the defendant was sentenced to forty-five years in prison on the merged counts of murder and felony murder and ten years on the count of robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>in the first degree.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 735-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the introduction of evidence concerning his involvement in the Rose shooting deprived him of a fair trial because its prejudice to the defense exceeded its probative value. Id., 737. The Appellate Court agreed, concluding that the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting the uncharged misconduct evidence. Id., 743-44. The Appellate Court further concluded that the defendant had proven that the improper admission of this evidence was harmful, given the lack of direct evidence linking him to Hopkins\u2019 death and multiple reports of jury deadlock in this case. Id., 744. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial. Id. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">On appeal, the state contends that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the Rose shooting, because: (1) such evidence was relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter in this case, as well as his motive for robbing Hopkins; and (2) the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, and the limited nature of the specific evidence that was admitted, rendered it not unduly prejudicial. In response, the defendant contends otherwise, and also posits, as alternative grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11, that the trial court: (1) improperly instructed the jury that the adequacy of the police investigation was not an issue in the case; and (2) inadequately canvassed the defendant to determine whether his waiver of his right to counsel was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. We address each claim in turn, and set forth additional relevant facts and procedural history in the context of each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Relying on, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 491 A.2d 345 (1985), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281 (4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 999, 125 S. Ct. 627, 160 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2004), the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the Rose shooting, the probative value of such evidence exceeding any unduly prejudicial effect because, when viewed in the context of testimony by Penix and Ramos showing that the defendant was in possession of a black and chrome nine millimeter handgun shortly before the murder, it linked a gun owned and used by the defendant to the shooting of Hopkins in this case. The state also argues that this testimony was corroborative of Finney\u2019s jailhouse informant testimony. The state emphasizes that the evidence could not have unduly aroused the jury\u2019s emotions because Rose did not testify, and the evidence did not involve the extent of his injuries or whether the defendant had been convicted of a crime in connection therewith; indeed, the state contends, any details came only from the defendant\u2019s statement to the police that he had shot Rose in self-defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In response, the defendant argues that the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>abused its discretion because, although evidence that he had possessed the gun used in this case was relevant, the trial court failed to limit the evidence by excluding the highly prejudicial fact that the defendant had shot someone with the gun. The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Mortoro, </em>160 Conn. 378, 279 A.2d 546 (1971), <em>State </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>51 Conn. App. 313, 721 A.2d 1229 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 962, 724 A.2d 1126 (1999), and <em>Thompsons. State, </em>690 N.E.2d 224 (Ind. 1997), in further support of his argument that the evidence of the shooting was irrelevant and served solely to portray him in a bad light. The defendant also argues that the shooting evidence was not necessary to prove that the murder in this case was motivated by robbery, and that there was in fact evidence \u2014 namely, the testimony of Robert Winkler, a Bridgeport police detective, and Finney \u2014 to the effect that the defendant had in fact been convicted of a crime in connection with the Rose shooting. We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting limited evidence about the Rose shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. After the testimony of Jessica Tillson, a Bridgeport police officer who was the state\u2019s first witness, the defendant, who at the time was representing himself with the aid of standby counsel; see part III of this opinion; argued against the admissibility of Rose\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that Rose\u2019s testimony would be \u201chighly prejudicial to the jury and clearly outweighs the probative value. The state . . . has me testifying that I had a gun and it [has] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>other evidence, and I was convicted of it, and I really don\u2019t see a need for this testimony here because . . . it would inflame the jury because I\u2019m already convicted ... of this case . . . and I\u2019m on trial right now for this murder case, and it\u2019s a shooting case. It\u2019s two shooting cases. And if they [were] to bring [Rose to testify], I think ... no matter what your instruction would be to the jury, that it . . . still would be lingering in them that somebody got shot. And I would ask that you not allow it in.\u201d The prosecutor, noting that Joseph Gallagher, a Bridgeport detective, would testify about his activities in processing the crime scene of the Rose shooting at Pembroke and Jane Streets in Bridgeport, observed that Rose had testified at the probable cause hearing and stated that Marshall Robinson, the state\u2019s firearms expert, would testify \u201cthat based upon his training and experience . . . the firearm that was used in the shooting of [Rose] was, in fact, the same firearm that was used in causing the death of [Hopkins].\u201d The prosecutor argued that the defendant\u2019s act of shooting Rose was \u201cprior misconduct\u201d that was admissible because Rose would testify that \u201cthe person who was in possession of this common firearm at the time of his shooting was . . . the defendant . . . .\u201d Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 651, the prosecutor noted the availability of the \u201ccommon limiting instruction\u201d that \u201cthe evidence which [the jury is] about to hear is not being offered for the purpose of showing that the defendant is of bad character or anything regarding his propensity to commit crime,\u201d and argued that the defendant\u2019s actions in shooting Rose would be admissible under \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, to prove identity, identity as an element of the crime charged, and under the catchall provision \u201cto corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.\u201d The prosecutor stated that proof of the defendant\u2019s access \u201cto the instrumentality of the crime\u201d would permit \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>jury, through circumstantial evidence ... to develop a chain of evidence that would tend to indicate that the defendant was responsible for this crime.\u201d The state then argued that the probative value of the evidence would outweigh its prejudicial effect, particularly given the limiting instruction, which the prosecutor noted was used successfully in the defendant\u2019s first trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The trial court concluded that the evidence of the Rose shooting could be admitted to prove the defendant\u2019s specific intent to commit murder, the identity of the person who shot Hopkins, and to corroborate the crucial testimony exception because \u201cone person who . . . allegedly can tie in the defendant to . . . that gun on that date [is] Rose.\u201d The court then concluded that the prejudicial effect of the evidence did not outweigh its probative value with respect to the state\u2019s case, and noted that limiting instructions would be given prior to Gallagher and Rose\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>After Gallagher testified regarding his actions at the crime scene in this case, the prosecutor shifted his focus on direct examination to the scene of the Rose shooting. After the defendant noted his continuing objection, Gallagher identified five nine millimeter shell casings that he had collected from the scene of the Rose shooting.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On the second day of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Gallagher, prior to the start of questioning, the trial court delivered a limiting instruction to the jury advising it that, with respect to the events of August 28,2002, the date of the Rose shooting, it could consider that testimony or evidence only for the \u201climited purposes ... on the issues of intent, element of a crime or opportunity,\u201d and that the jury was \u201cexpressly prohibited from using that evidence as evidence of any bad character of the defendant, or as any evidence [of] a tendency on his part to commit criminal acts.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court reminded the jury of this limiting instruction several times, including after the testimony of Finney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and Robinson, and during the final charge. We note that Rose never testified at this trial, and that the only evidence admitted that described the Rose shooting in any detail was the defendant\u2019s statement, which was admitted with his agreement. See footnotes 5 and 20 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Before examining the decision of the Appellate Court, we note that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. ... On the other hand, evidence of crimes so connected with the principal crime by circumstance, motive, design, or innate peculiarity, that the commission of the collateral crime tends directly to prove the commission of the principal crime, is admissible. The rules of policy have no application whatever to evidence of any crime which directly tends to prove that the accused is guilty of the specific offense for which he is on trial. . . . We have developed a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence. First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions [set forth in \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence]. . . . Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. . . . Because of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only whe[n] abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>284 Conn. 328, 340, 933 A.2d 1158 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u201cThe well established exceptions to the general prohibition against the admission of uncharged misconduct are set forth in \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that \u2018[e]vi-dence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is admissible ... to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, common plan or scheme, absence of mistake or accident, knowledge, a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime, or to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>290 Conn. 386, 400, 963 A.2d 956 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s decision did not address the first prong of the uncharged misconduct inquiry, appearing to assume, but without specifically indicating, that the trial court properly had determined that evidence that the defendant had shot Rose with the same handgun that was used to murder Hopkins was relevant under either of the corroboration<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tity<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> exceptions set forth in \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rather, the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis focused on the second prong of the test, and the defendant\u2019s claim \u201cthat the probative value of evidence of the Rose shooting did not overcome the risk of prejudice, even with the limiting instruction given by the court. He further asserts that although it may have been probative that he once owned a gun that produced shell casings that match the shell casing found on Hopkins\u2019 collar, the fact that he shot Rose with that gun was not necessary to prove any element of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State v. Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 742. The Appellate Court relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App. 313, <em>and State v. Mortoro, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 387-91, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence exceeded its prejudicial effect, concluding that \u201c[t]he testimony relating to the Rose [shooting] clearly fits into the category of evidence that would have unduly aroused the jury\u2019s emotions and hostility. It painted the defendant as a gun toting criminal with a proclivity for shooting people. The evidence was not admissible for that purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 743. The Appellate Court also noted that \u201c[t]he testimony of several individuals was introduced at trial regarding the Rose shooting. The portion of the testimony relevant to the crimes for which the defendant was on trial was simply that which would prove that he had at some time owned a gun that produces shell casings that match the one found on Hopkins\u2019 collar. It would have been sufficient for the state simply to introduce evidence to that effect without going into the details of the defendant\u2019s involvement with the [Rose shooting].\u201d Id. The Appellate Court then concluded that the improper admission of this evidence was harmful and required it to order a new trial for the defendant. Id., 744; see id. (noting report of jury deadlock and fact that \u201c[t]here was no eyewitness to the crime, and the only tangible evidence linking the defendant to the crime was the shell casing and a fingerprint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Having reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in determining that the prejudicial effect of the evidence that the defendant had shot Rose with the same gun used in Hopkins\u2019 murder did not unduly exceed its probative value.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>determining whether the prejudicial effect of otherwise relevant evidence outweighs its probative value, we consider whether: \u201c(1) . . . the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) . . . the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) . . . the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) . . . the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">First, the only evidence that described the Rose shooting in any detail was the defendant\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>to the police, which was admitted with his consent<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and portrayed it as an act of self-defense. See footnote 5 of this opinion. This is significant because \u201c[u]ncharged misconduct evidence has been held not unduly prejudicial when the evidentiary substantiation of the vicious conduct, with which the defendant was charged, far outweighed, in severity, the character of his prior misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v.

App. 379, 393, 395-96, 921 A.2d 667 (2007) (uncharged misconduct evidence of defendant\u2019s past physically and verbally abusive behavior toward his wife admissible to prove intent in murder case), appeal dismissed, 289 Conn. 55, 956 A.2d 578 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1216, 129 S. Ct. 1533, 173 L. Ed. 2d 663 (2009). Thus, it is significant that there was no direct evidence of any conviction arising from the Rose shooting, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s statements to Finney acknowledging his exposure to imprisonment because of that shooting. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>41 Conn. App. 169, 179, 674 A.2d 862 (1996) (noting that trial court properly admitted testimony of prior misconduct with respect to sexual assault, but limited testimony to fact of threat and sexual assault \u201cwithout any additional details . . . [and] ruled that the jury would not be informed that the defendant had been convicted of and incarcerated for other crimes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Second, we find significant the trial court\u2019s efforts to have the prosecution admonish its witnesses that any testimony about the Rose shooting was to be limited only to the fact that there was a shooting, with no other details regarding the events of that day. We also note that, at the request of the defendant, the trial court directed the redaction of references to assault charges on the evidence labels on the bags that held the five Rose shooting shell casings. These actions are significant because \u201cthe care with which the [trial] court weighed the evidence and devised measures for reducing its prejudicial effect militates against a finding of abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>supra, 290 Conn. 406; see id.

It tended also to corroborate the other direct testimony that shell casings found at the scene of the shooting probably came from a gun of the type purchased by the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Thus, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s balancing analysis in determining whether to admit evidence of the Rose shooting into evidence, as well as the trial court\u2019s efforts to minimize any undue prejudice that resulted from the admission of that uncharged misconduct evidence. It, therefore, ran afoul of our well established recognition of \u201cthe difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . [which permits disturbance of] the trial court\u2019s decision . . . only whe[n] abuse of discretion is manifest or whe[n] an injustice appears to have been done. ...

App. 313, because those cases are inapposite since they did not involve evidence of prior misconduct in which the same weapon was utilized to commit the offenses charged.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion and that the defendant should receive a new trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s first alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, namely, that the trial court violated his constitutional rights to due process and to present a defense by instructing the jury that \u201cthe ultimate issue before you is not the thoroughness of the investigation or the competence of the police\u201d but, rather, whether the state \u201chas proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty on one or more of the counts for which he is charged.\u201d Before we consider the merits of this claim, which the defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve by filing a written request to charge or taking an exception to the instruction as given, we first must determine, however, whether, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, it is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We conclude that the defendant is entitled to <em>Golding </em>review of his claim, but also that the trial court\u2019s instruction did not violate his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. Prior to closing arguments, the trial court held a charge conference in chambers with all counsel. The defendant did not file a request to charge prior to the conference; the state filed a request to charge, but did not address therein the topic of the adequacy of the police investigation. The record and the parties\u2019 briefs do not indicate whether or when the trial court provided the parties with a copy of its draft charge in advance of the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The following day, the trial court summarized on the record the proceedings at the charge conference, noting specifically, inter alia, that \u201cthe court will allow in final argument by the defendant concerning police competency in not following up on the fingerprint for . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Berrios; that it\u2019s limited to competency and not to be used in any way, shape or form for third party culpability. To make that more concrete, the court in reviewing the information with the jurors will indicate that there was no evidence of another participant in this crime.\u201d Neither the prosecutor nor the defendant had any further comment or objected to the trial court\u2019s summary of the charge conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In his closing argument, the defendant, inter alia, challenged the adequacy of the police investigation. In response, the state argued that, although the defendant had claimed that \u201cthe cops botched\u201d this investigation, there was no evidence that it was inadequate. Thereafter, the trial court charged the jury: \u201cNow, you have heard in the course of arguments by counsel discussion as to whether the police conducted a thorough investigation. You have also heard some discussion about the competency of the police in this arrest. Ladies and gentlemen, this question might be a matter of opinion, but the state has put its evidence before you and the defendant was entitled to make an investigation and put his evidence before you also. And, of course, not only the state but also the defense has put on evidence on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\u201cI <em>say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the ultimate issue before you is not the thoroughness of the investigation or the competence of the police. The ultimate issue you have to .. . determine is whether the state in the light of all the evidence before you has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty on one or more of the counts for which he is </em>charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant did not take any exceptions to this instruction at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">It is undisputed that this claim is unpreserved for appellate review and, therefore, unreviewable \u201cunless the defendant is entitled to review under the plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>doctrine or the rule set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239-40]. ... A party is obligated . . . affirmatively to request review under these doctrines.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 324. Under <em>Golding, </em>however, \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We begin with the state\u2019s argument that the defendant waived his right to <em>Golding </em>review of his unpreserved jury instruction claim when his trial counsel consented to and expressed satisfaction with the instruction. The state\u2019s waiver claim requires us to apply the implicit waiver standard articulated recently in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>299 Conn. 447, 10 A.3d 942 (2011), wherein we concluded that, \u201cwhen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given, the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the instructions on direct appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Id., 482-83. Noting that this waiver analysis is not a bright line rule, we emphasized that \u201ca defendant will not be deemed to have waived [an instructional] claim unless the court has provided counsel with a copy of the proposed instructions and a <em>meaningful opportunity </em>for review and comment, which can be determined in any given case only by a close examination of the record. The significance of a meaningful opportunity for review and comment cannot be underestimated.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 495 n.28; see also id. (\u201c[h]olding an on-the-record charge conference, and even providing counsel with an advance copy of the instructions, will not necessarily be sufficient in all cases to constitute waiver of <em>Golding </em>review if defense counsel has not been afforded adequate time, under the circumstances, to examine the instructions and to identify potential flaws\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In the present case, although the trial court conducted a charge conference during which counsel had an opportunity to participate in the formulation of the jury instructions, there is no indication on the record that the trial court provided the defendant with an advance copy of the proposed jury charge. Thus, although the trial court\u2019s summary of the conference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>indicates that one of the topics discussed \u2014 namely, closing arguments about the quality of the police investigation \u2014 related to the topic of the instructions now challenged on appeal, we cannot say with certainty whether the defendant had a meaningful opportunity to review the written instruction itself and to challenge any objectionable language therein. Thus, we decline to find this claim implicitly waived under <em>Kitchens, </em>and will review its merits pursuant to <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The defendant, relying primarily on <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>218 Conn. 458, 590 A.2d 112 (1991), and a New York case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>141 App. Div. 2d 382, 529 N.Y.S.2d 318, appeal denied, 72 N.Y.2d 1049, 531 N.E.2d 668, 534 N.Y.S.2d 948 (1988), claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction with respect to the adequacy of the police investigation \u201cdestroyed [his] defense by precluding consideration of it and also by conveying the judge\u2019s impression that his defense was not worthy of consideration.\u201d In response, the state contends that this instruction previously has been upheld in, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 363 A.2d 72 (1975), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>106 Conn. App. 40, 941 A.2d 358, cert. denied, 286 Conn. 922, 949 A.2d 482 (2008), and argues that it was a legally correct measure to keep the jury from being sidetracked with speculation, and did not foreclose the jury from considering the adequacy of the police investigation as it related to any weaknesses in the state\u2019s case against the defendant. We agree with the state and conclude that the challenged instructions did not deprive the defendant of his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">\u201c[A] fundamental element of due process of law is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. . . . Where, as here, the challenged jury instructions involve a constitutional right, the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ble standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the juiy was misled in reaching its verdict. ... In evaluating the particular charges at issue, we must adhere to the well settled rale that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rales of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nathan J., </em>294 Conn. 243, 261, 982 A.2d 1067 (2009); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 493-94, 651 A.2d 247 (1994) (\u201c[a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cA challenge to the validity of jury instructions presents a question of law over which [we have] plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>292 Conn. 734, 746, 974 A.2d 679 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\u201cIn the abstract, whether the government conducted a thorough, professional investigation is not relevant to what the jury must decide: Did the defendant commit the alleged offense? Juries are not instructed to acquit the defendant if the government\u2019s investigation was superficial. Conducting a thorough, professional investigation is not an element of the government\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>319 F.3d 1254, 1272 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 909, 124 S.

Ed. 2d 198 (2003); see also id., 1273 (defendant must show that expert testimony about deficiencies in police investigation and interview of sexual abuse complainant relates to validity of charge against him). A defendant may, however, rely upon relevant deficiencies or lapses in the police investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to raise the specter of reasonable doubt, and the trial court violates his right to a fair trial by precluding the jury from considering evidence to that effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-86, 399 N.E.2d 482 (1980) (trial court improperly instructed jury not to consider evidence of investigators\u2019 failure to perform certain scientific tests when defendant\u2019s presentation at trial focused on raising inference that \u201cpolice had contrived much of the case against him\u201d and he emphasized that failure \u201cin order to call into question the integrity of the police investigation\u201d); see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 767, 912 N.E.2d 1014 (2009) (\u201ca judge may not remove the issue of a biased or faulty police investigation from the <em>jury\u201d);</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 141 App. Div. 2d 385 (trial court denied defendant fair trial by \u201celiminat[ing] from the jury\u2019s consideration an essential element of the defense,\u201d namely, police testing that did not yield fingerprints on gun at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Again, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury \u201cthat the ultimate issue before you is not the thoroughness of the investigation or the competence of the police. The ultimate issue you have to . . . determine is whether the state in the light of all the evidence before you has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty on one or more of the counts for which he is charged.\u201d We conclude that this instruction did not mislead the jury or violate the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense because it did not direct the jury not to consider the adequacy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the investigation as it related to the strength of the state\u2019s case, or not to consider specific aspects of the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Rather, the instruction highlighted the portions of the parties\u2019 arguments that addressed the adequacy of the police investigation, and properly reminded the jury that its core task was to determine whether the defendant was guilty of the charged offenses in light of all the evidence admitted at trial, rather than to evaluate the adequacy of the police investigation in the abstract. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 335-36 and n.3 (nearly identical instruction properly \u201cleft the jury free to decide the questions of fact\u201d);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seng, </em>456 Mass. 490, 502-503, 924 N.E.2d 285 (2010) (rejecting claim that trial court\u2019s instruction to jury not to speculate about nonexistent evidence because \u201c \u2018this is real life and not [the television program \u201cCrime Scene Investigation\u201d]\u2019 \u201d violated defendant\u2019s right to fair trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>because it did not \u201casperse the defendant\u2019s argument\u201d about adequacy of forensic investigation). Moreover, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the trial court\u2019s instruction was phrased in neutral language and did not improperly disparage the defendant\u2019s claims, or improperly highlight or endorse the state\u2019s arguments and evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 463 (\u201ca court must take care to avoid making improper remarks which are indicative of favor or condemnation . . . and must not indulge in an argumentative rehearsal of the claims of one side only\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because the instruction did not violate his right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Finally, we turn to the defendant\u2019s second alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, namely, that the trial court failed to conduct a canvass that complied with the sixth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> as well as Practice Book \u00a7 44-3,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> prior to permitting the defendant to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>himself during portions of the trial. This claim is unpre-served and the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Relying on, inter alia, <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>286 Conn. 191, 942 A.2d 1000 (2008), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005), the defendant claims that his waiver of the right to counsel was not voluntary, knowing and intelligent because the canvass failed to: (1) \u201cconvey a realistic picture of what [he] faced if convicted because it did not give any range of punishment for the felony murder charge, it did not define \u2018life imprisonment\u2019 and it used a misleading example when explaining the concept of consecutive sentences,\u201d including the fact that his sentence in this case could be consecutive to his twenty-five year sentence from the Rose shooting; (2) \u201cthere is no evidence [the] defendant comprehended the nature of the charges or the proceedings, or that he knew of enough facts necessary for abroad understanding of the case, especially with regard to the new charges of felony murder and robbery\u201d; and (3) the trial court did not advise the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. In response, the state contends that the trial court\u2019s canvass was proper and thorough, and the defendant\u2019s knowledge further was informed by his familiarity with the criminal justice system through two prior trials wherein he was represented by counsel, as well as his work with counsel in the present case. The state also emphasizes that any omission with respect to the definition of a life sentence only served in common parlance to <em>overstate </em>the length of the possible sentence, and that <em>Diaz </em>and <em>T.R.D. </em>are distinguishable because the canvass as a whole left the defendant with a meaningful understanding of the magnitude of his sentencing exposure. We agree with the state and conclude that the trial court\u2019s canvass of the defendant was constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. On the first day of jury selection, the defendant\u2019s attorney advised the trial court that the defendant desired to represent himself. At that time, the trial court strongly advised the defendant against that decision, and to \u201ctake the benefit\u201d of his appointed attorney.

You have the right to make it and you have the right for self-representation as long as you\u2019re not disruptive in court [because] then you can lose that right. I can have you removed from the court and continue the trial without you. But I . . . fear that, you know, you\u2019ll . . . look back if things don\u2019t go well and say, boy, you know, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that. But . . . it\u2019s your choice and if you feel strongly enough about it, you certainly have the right to do it. There are just such significant advantages to you because, you know, we have rules. Rules of evidence, rules of procedure and . . . I\u2019ll be enforcing them upon you to the same extent that I\u2019ll be enforcing them on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>[the prosecutor]. So if this is what you want to do, we\u2019ll ... let you do it, but ... I feel very strongly that it\u2019s not in your best interests. But that\u2019s . . . your call, sir. We\u2019ll have a short recess so that we can bring down the jury panel and then we\u2019ll start jury selection.\u201d The defendant then represented himself for the remainder of jury selection<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> until the first day of evidence, after the testimony of the first responding Bridgeport police officer, and the direct examination testimony of Gallagher, a detective. Standby counsel then represented the defendant for the remainder of the trial, commencing with the cross-examination of Gallagher.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We begin by noting that we agree with the defendant that this unpreserved claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, because, under the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional dimension. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because the trial court\u2019s thorough canvass of the defendant protected his sixth amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\u201cWe begin with the applicable standard of review. We review the trial court\u2019s determination with respect to whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily elected to proceed pro se for abuse of discretion. . . . Recognizing the constitutional implications attendant to <em>Golding </em>review, we do not review the proceedings for strict compliance with the prophylactic rule of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, but rather for evidence that the waiver of counsel was made knowledgeably and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u201cThe right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 [44-3] was adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney .... Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with \u00a7 [44-3], in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. . . . Because the \u00a7 [44-3] inquiry simultaneously triggers the constitutional right of a defendant to represent himself and enables the waiver of the constitutional right of a defendant to counsel, the provisions of \u00a7 [44-3] cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\u201c[A] defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation .... Rather, a record that affirmatively shows that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver. . . . The nature of the inquiry that must be conducted to substantiate an effective waiver has been explicitly articulated in decisions by various federal courts of appeals. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\u201cNone of these authorities, however, stands for the proposition that a defendant must be specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>informed of the particular elements of the crimes charged before being permitted to waive counsel and proceed pro se. . . . [P]erfect comprehension of each element of a criminal charge does not appear to be necessary to a finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver. ... A discussion of the elements of the charged crimes would be helpful, and may be one of the factors involved in the ultimate determination of whether the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him. A description of the elements of the crime is not, however, a sine qua non of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in this context. Indeed, in our cases we have approved of a defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to proceed pro se in a case in which the record did not affirmatively disclose that the trial court explained the specific elements of the crimes charged to the defendant as long as the defendant understood the nature of the crimes charged. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">\u201cThe multifactor analysis of [Practice Book \u00a7 44-3], therefore, is designed to assist the court in answering two fundamental questions: first, whether a criminal defendant is minimally competent to make the decision to waive counsel, and second, whether the defendant actually made that decision in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent fashion. ... As the United States Supreme Court recently recognized, these two questions are separate, with the former logically antecedent to the latter. . . . Inasmuch as the defendant\u2019s competence is uncontested, we proceed to whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the defendant made the waiver decision in a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent fashion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antonio, </em>274 Conn. 658, 709-12, 877 A.2d 696 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s extensive canvass of the defendant prior to his election to proceed pro se was a model canvass that afforded him the constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>tional protections to which he was entitled. The trial court clearly advised the defendant multiple times of his right to assigned counsel, and urged him to exercise that right in light of the dangers of self-representation, including cautions that he would be held responsible for complying with all applicable procedural and evidentiary rules,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and that his actions during the trial could adversely affect subsequent appellate or postconviction remedies. The trial court then reminded the defendant that a trained attorney would have the requisite skill and training to better protect his rights while trying his case. Thus, in canvassing the defendant, the trial court satisfied its critical responsibility of cautioning the defendant about the potentially disastrous consequences of electing to proceed pro se. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 430, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>224 Conn. 253, 261, 617 A.2d 1382 (1992) (\u201cthe trial court must fulfill its duty to explain the problems of self-representation to a person not trained in the law\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fore, </em>169 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir.) (District Court properly advised defendant that \u201ca choice to proceed pro se was devastating and entailed near-certain conviction\u201d), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1028, 119 S. Ct. 2380, 144 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Moreover, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the canvass did not inform him adequately of his sentencing exposure, since he mistakenly could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>have concluded that \u201c \u2018life imprisonment\u2019 was in the range of forty to forty-five years, and not sixty years.\u201d It is well settled that, in canvassing a defendant seeking to exercise his right of self-representation, a trial court must apprise him of the possible range of criminal penalties or punishments to which he is exposed. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. D\u2019Antonio, supra, 274 Conn. 711. Put differently, a constitutionally valid canvass is one that leaves the defendant with a \u201cmeaningful appreciation of the period of incarceration he face[s] if convicted of the charges he face[s].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>T.R.D., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 206. That explanation need not be made with mathematical exactitude, so long as it leaves the defendant with a \u201crealistic picture\u201d of his sentencing exposure. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fore, </em>supra, 169 F.3d 108; see id. (declining to require trial judge to \u201cinform defendant about a hypothetical 125-year prison sentence\u201d when ten year sentence that court explained was consistent with sentencing guidelines and his actual sentence was only twenty-seven months); see also id. (\u201cdetailed discussion of eveiy allowable component of a potential punishment could detract from the trial court\u2019s duty to inform defendant of the effect that self-representation could have upon his imminent trial, his rights and defenses\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaston, </em>86 Conn. App. 218, 233-34, 860 A.2d 1253 (2004) (trial court\u2019s warning that consecutive sentencing could cause defendant to spend rest of fife in prison was adequate explanation of range of potential penalties), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 901, 867 A.2d 840 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>76 Conn. App. 477, 501-502, 819 A.2d 909 (noting that \u201c[t]he rules of practice do not . . . require the court to satisfy itself that the defendant has a <em>precise </em>understanding of the maximum sentence\u201d and concluding that failure to explain additional exposure period of twenty-one months did not render canvass improper when trial court had made defendant aware of twenty-three year exposure period [emphasis in original]), cert. denied, 264 Conn. 910, 826 A.2d 181 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>In our view, there is no doubt that the trial court\u2019s canvass adequately conveyed to the defendant the gravity of the significant sentencing exposure that he faced, including that, if he were to be convicted of either murder or felony murder, the trial court could impose a minimum twenty-five year sentence, and then add on a consecutive sentence of twenty years for the robbery count. Put differently, it is clear from the context of the entire canvass that the trial court\u2019s mention of possible twenty-five or forty year sentences on the murder counts, in addition to a twenty year exposure on the robbery count, were illustrative of the gravity of possible sentences faced by the defendant, and plainly were not a cap on his exposure. Although the canvass did not specifically define the meaning of the legal term \u201clife imprisonment,\u201d that omission is rendered inconsequential by virtue of the fact that the common understanding of the term \u201clife\u201d in the context of imprisonment, namely, \u201ca sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of a convict\u2019s life\u201d; Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993); is even more grave than the statutory definition of life imprisonment, which provides for a \u201cdefinite sentence of sixty years . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35b.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Moreover, we also disagree with the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain the sentencing options for felony murder by itself rendered the canvass inadequate. Because felony murder is simply an alternative method of committing murder; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cator, </em>256 Conn. 785, 803-804, 781 A.2d 285 (2001); and is subject to the same sentencing provision; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s canvass did not leave the defendant ill-informed or in any way fail to convey to the defendant the risk that he faced the rest of his natural life behind bars in the event of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We further reject the defendant\u2019s characterization of the canvass, particularly with respect to its explanation of the robbery and felony murder charges, and the dangers inherent in self-representation, as in any way perfunctory. The trial court engaged in a detailed explanation of the information and the allegations therein that related to the elements of the charges. The defendant did not express any confusion or request any further explanation of the charges at any point, and at all times indicated his understanding of the trial court\u2019s repeated statements that representing himself in this criminal trial was indeed a poor idea. Thus, he cannot rely on Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 to \u201cprotect [himself] from his poor judgment in failing to heed the court\u2019s warning that representing oneself is something most people consider a bad idea\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Caracoglia, </em>95 Conn. App. 95, 114, 895 A.2d 810, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 922, 901 A.2d 1222 (2006); especially in light of his ample prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>experience with the criminal justice system, including two trials at which he was represented by counsel\u2014 namely, the Rose shooting trial, and his first trial and all pretrial proceedings in this case \u2014 given that there is no indication that he lacked the opportunity to communicate with his counsel. Thus, the trial court could \u201cappropriately presume that defense counsel . . . explained the nature of the offense in sufficient detail.\u201d <em>State v. Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 537, 480 A.2d 435 (1984); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 832 n.14 (concluding that \u201cthe record does not support a presumption that the defendant had been apprised by counsel of the range of possible penalties that he faced if convicted\u201d because \u201cthe defendant was represented by counsel only briefly and never, insofar as the record reflects, in connection with the narcotics charges except for bond purposes only\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 262 (noting defendant\u2019s expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney\u2019s level of preparation and fact that they had talked \u201c \u2018no more than [twenty] minutes at the most\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.

See footnote 11 of the dissenting opinion. We disagree. Particularly given the absence of any attack by the defendant on the substance of the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction, the dissent\u2019s criticisms notwithstanding, our assumption is based on the trial court\u2019s contemporaneous explanation for its evidentiary ruling, in which the court stated that the Rose shooting evidence \u201cfall[s] within one or more . . . exceptions to the rule\u201d generally precluding the admission of prior misconduct,\u201d naming specifically intent, identity, corroboration of crucial testimony, opportunity and element of the crime as the applicable exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> Although our focus in this certified appeal is on the decision of the Appellate Court; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 221, 926 A.2d 633 (2007); which focused on the second prong of the uncharged misconduct inquiry, we also address the defendant\u2019s claim under the first prong of that inquiry, namely, that evidence of the Rose shooting was not relevant in this case. Along with the dissent, the defendant argues that evidence of the Rose shooting itself is irrelevant to prove the defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>but concedes the relevance of evidence that the defendant, several months before Hopkins\u2019 murder, possessed and fired the weapon used in this case. We disagree, and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the Rose shooting, using the same gun as was used in this case, was relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter in this case, as well as to corroborate Finney\u2019s testimony to that effect. \u201cWithin the law of evidence, relevance is a very broad concept. Evidence is relevant if it has <em>any </em>tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. . . . Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact <em>even to a slight degree, </em>[as] long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>290 Conn. 468, 496-97, 964 A.2d 73 (2009), discussing Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1. Given this broad definition, we view the distinction drawn by the defendant and the dissent \u2014 namely, that between simple prior possession of the murder weapon, and its actual use in the Rose shooting \u2014 as one of degree rather than kind. Thus, as is reflected in the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in this case, the analytical key to this particular evidentiary decision lies under the second prong of the uncharged misconduct test, namely, the degree to which the prejudicial effect of the otherwise relevant evidence outweighs its probative value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\"> We do not intimate in any way that the defendant\u2019s ultimate agreement to the admission of his statement waived this evidentiary claim. The defendant made clear his continuing objection to the admission of any evidence pertaining to the Eose shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> The dissent echoes the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence of the Eose shooting offered in this case \u201cclearly fits into the category of evidence that would have unduly aroused the jury\u2019s emotions and hostility [because it] painted the defendant as a gun toting criminal with a proclivity for shooting people.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 743. Acknowledging that \u201cthe state did not adduce details of the Eose shooting, and the shooting did not result in Eose\u2019s death,\u201d the dissent nevertheless argues that \u201cit is unreasonable to suggest that evidence of the [Eose] shooting, which occurred just three months prior to the [shooting in this case], did not give rise to a significant degree of prejudice.\u201d Although we agree that the evidence of the Eose shooting adduced in this case certainly had some prejudicial effect, we do not view that prejudicial effect to be undue or unreasonable in light of the alternatives proffered by the defendant\u2019s standby counsel at trial, namely, a suggestion that evidence be limited to placing the defendant at a particular location in the city of Bridgeport discharging an identifiable firearm. See footnote 13 of this opinion. Even if the jury were somehow to view the defendant as simply having fired his gun into the air on that prior occasion, the trial court reasonably could have exercised its discretion to find that alternative no less prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s image as a responsible gun owner, than his statement that he shot Eose in self-defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s extensive reliance on an Indiana decision, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 690 N.E.2d 224. First, <em>Thompson </em>is inapposite because it was not a case wherein the defendant had used the same gun to commit a previous crime, but rather, utilized evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in a prior shooting, during which he stole the murder weapon used in the crime charged. See id., 229 (noting that evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement in prior shooting was relevant \u201cto prove an important element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of the [sjtate\u2019s case \u2014 that [the defendant] had access to the murder weapon before the killings\u201d). Moreover, <em>Thompson </em>is distinguishable from the present case because the Indiana Supreme Court emphasized the sheer volume of unduly prejudicial evidence presented therein about the prior shooting, including the defendant\u2019s murder conviction for that shooting, and lengthy testimony recounting gruesome details of the \u201cexecution-style\u201d nature of the prior shooting. Id., 234^-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> The dissent contends that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>supra, 353 F.3d 312, <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 992 So. 2d 334, <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 13 App. Div. 3d 146, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>supra, 381 S.C. 406, are \u201cinapposite\u201d and provide \u201cno support\u201d for our conclusion herein because, in those cases, \u201cthe defendant had not acknowledged responsibility for the prior shooting . . . .\u201d The dissent\u2019s reliance on this distinguishing factor is, however, overstated because none of the cited cases state that the defendant\u2019s failure to acknowledge responsibility for the prior shooting was even a factor in the court\u2019s analysis, let alone a controlling one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> The dissent, like the Appellate Court, similarly fails to afford the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling proper deference, given the well established discretionary nature of the relevancy and prejudice determinations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>supra, 284 Conn. 340. Giving the dissent the respect it is due, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the applicable standard of review nevertheless dictates affirmance of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling precisely because of the reasonable nature of our disagreement. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>69 Conn. App. 576, 594, 795 A.2d 597 (2002) (\u201cIf our standard of review were broader, we may very well conclude that the graphic nature of the second [autopsy] photograph [of the victim] was more prejudicial than its limited probative value supporting instantaneous death. Our standard of review is not broad, but rather is limited to whether the court clearly abused its discretion. The fact that we may be able to conclude that a photograph was not relevant does not mean that other reasonable persons might . . . conclude otherwise.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Indeed, \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard reflects the context specific nature of evidentiary rulings, which are made in the heat of battle by the trial judge, who is in a \u2018unique position\u2019 to \u2018[observe] the context in which particular evidentiary issues arise and who is therefore in the best position to weigh the potential benefits and harms accompanying the admission of particular evidence.

Specifically, I believe that the Appellate Court properly determined that the trial court committed harmful error when it permitted the state to introduce testimony establishing that the defendant had shot Stephen Rose in an incident that occurred three months prior to the shooting of the victim in the present case, namely, Calvin Hopkins.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although it is undisputed that the state was entitled to prove the defendant\u2019s possession of the gun that had been used in the Rose shooting, under the circumstances presented, the state had no legitimate reason to adduce evidence that the defendant actually had used that gun to shoot Rose. Furthermore, evidence of the Rose shooting was not relevant for any other purpose. Because I also agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s improper admission of the evidence concerning the Rose shooting deprived the defendant of a fair trial, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">I begin with a brief summary of the relevant facts and procedural history. Following a verbal dispute with Rose on August 28, 2002, the defendant removed a nine millimeter handgun from his waistband and fired four shots into the pavement near where Rose was standing. The altercation became physical and, during the ensuing scuffle, the defendant fired a fifth shot that struck Rose and lodged in his upper arm. Five shell casings from the defendant\u2019s gun were recovered at the scene. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Thereafter, on December 2, 2002, in the city of Bridgeport, Hopkins was fatally shot in the head by a person wielding a nine millimeter handgun. The police retrieved a shell casing from that shooting that had lodged on Hopkins\u2019 collar, but the police were unable to solve that murder in the weeks immediately following the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In January, 2003, the defendant contacted the Bridgeport police and confessed to the shooting involving Rose but claimed that he had acted in self-defense. The defendant also told the police that he had sold the gun shortly after that shooting to an unknown person for $300. During the course of his interview with the police, the defendant also was questioned about the Hopkins murder. The defendant admitted that he had been with Hopkins in Hopkins\u2019 car on the night of December 2, 2002, for the purpose of purchasing drugs but denied any involvement in the Hopkins murder. Thereafter, ballistics testing on the shell casing recovered from Hopkins\u2019 collar and similar testing on shell casings recovered from the scene of the Rose shooting established that the bullets used in each of those incidents had been fired from the same nine millimeter handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The defendant ultimately was convicted of offenses arising out of the Rose shooting and also was arrested and tried for the murder of Hopkins. At the defendant\u2019s first trial in the Hopkins case, the state introduced evidence establishing that the defendant had shot Rose for the purpose of demonstrating that the defendant had used the same gun in connection with the Hopkins murder. In that initial trial, however, the jury ultimately reported that it was hopelessly deadlocked, and the trial court declared a mistrial. Thereafter, the defendant was tried a second time for the Hopkins murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that trial, the state again sought to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the Rose shooting. The defendant, who at the time was representing himself, objected to that evidence, claiming that any testimony concerning the fact that he had shot Rose would be \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d and that such prejudice \u201cclearly outweigh[ed]\u201d any possible probative value. The defendant further maintained that the state had no need to present that evidence for the purpose of linking him to the gun that had been used in the Rose shooting because the defendant already had acknowledged possessing that gun when he confessed to shooting Rose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection, concluding that the evidence was relevant under \u00a7 4-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to prove intent, an element of a crime, and opportunity. The court also concluded that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice under \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>however, gave the jury a limiting instruction with respect to the proper use of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Rose did not testify, the state adduced evidence concerning the Rose shooting through several other witnesses, including an expert firearms examiner who testified that the same gun was used to fire the bullets in both the Rose shooting and the Hopkins murder. After the state adduced evidence that the defendant had shot Rose, the defendant consented to the state\u2019s introduction of the statement that he had given to the police in which he acknowledged that he had shot Rose but claimed that he did so in self-defense. In that statement, the defendant also claimed that he had sold the gun used in the Rose shooting shortly after that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Following the court\u2019s instructions, the jury commenced its deliberations, during which the jury twice communicated to the court that it could not reach a unanimous verdict as to one of the counts of the information. On both such occasions, the court instructed the jury to continue deliberating, and, on the second occasion, the court gave the jury a Chip Smith instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury subsequently found the defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly had allowed the state to introduce evidence establishing that he had shot Rose and that the state\u2019s use of that evidence had deprived him of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. Collins, 111 Conn. App. 730, 737, 961 A.2d 986 (2008). He asserted, specifically, \u201cthat the probative value of evidence that he had shot and injured Rose did not overcome the risk of prejudice to his defense, even with the hmiting instruction given by the court. He further assertfed] that although it may have been probative that he once owned a gun that produced shell casings that match the one found on Hopkins\u2019 collar, the fact that he shot Rose with that gun was irrelevant to proving anything for which such evidence would be admissible. \u201d Id. The state maintained that the entirety of the Rose evidence, including the fact that the defendant had shot Rose, was relevant to prove identity and motive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">After setting forth the principles of \u00a7\u00a7 4-3 and 4-5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, the Appellate Court expressed its agreement with the defendant, explaining: \u201cThe testimony relating to the Rose [shooting] clearly fits into the category of evidence that would have unduly aroused the [jurors\u2019] emotions and hostilities]. It painted the defendant as a gun toting criminal with a proclivity for shooting people. The evidence was not admissible for that purpose. See [Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-5]----</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201cThe testimony of several individuals was introduced at trial regarding the Rose shooting. The portion of the testimony relevant to the crimes for which the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>dant was on trial was simply that which would prove that he had at some time owned a gun that produces shell casings that match the one found on Hopkins\u2019 collar. It would have been sufficient for the state simply to introduce evidence to that effect without going into the details of the defendant\u2019s involvement with the [shooting of] Rose.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 743. After concluding that \u201cthe danger of unfair prejudice resulting from the admission of that evidence far outweighed its probative value\u201d; id., 732; the Appellate Court also concluded that the defendant had satisfied his burden of demonstrating that the impropriety was harmful and that he therefore was entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On appeal to this court following our granting of certification, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the evidence that proved that the defendant had shot Rose was inadmissible. In particular, the state contends that the evidence was relevant to establish identity and motive and, in addition, to corroborate the testimony of Kimberly Finney, an inmate whom the defendant allegedly had confided in about his involvement in the Rose shooting and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Hopkins murder while the two men were incarcerated together at the Bridgeport correctional center. The state further maintains that, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, the trial court reasonably determined that the probative value of the evidence establishing that the defendant had shot Rose outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. The defendant contends that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighed its minimal probative value. Alternatively, the defendant asserts that evidence of the Rose shooting was irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. In either case, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence was harmful and that a new trial therefore is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In resolving the issue presented by this appeal, the majority states as follows: \u201cThe Appellate Court\u2019s decision did not address the first prong of the uncharged misconduct inquiry [under \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence], appearing to assume, but without specifically indicating, that the trial court properly had determined that evidence that the defendant had shot Rose with the same [gun] that was used to murder Hopkins was relevant under either of the corroboration or identity exceptions set forth in \u00a7 4-5 (b) . . . .<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Rather, the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis focused on the second prong of the test [under \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence], and the defendant\u2019s claim \u2018that the probative value of evidence of the Rose shooting did not overcome the risk of prejudice, even with the limiting instruction given by the court. He further asserts that although it may have been probative that he once owned a gun that produced shell casings that match the shell casing found on Hopkins\u2019 collar, the fact that he shot Rose with that gun was not necessary to prove any element of the state\u2019s case.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 742.\u201d The majority then proceeds to explain why, in its view, \u201cthe Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in determining that the prejudicial effect of the evidence that the defendant had shot Rose with the same gun used in Hopkins\u2019 murder did not unduly exceed its probative value.\u201d In doing so, the majority rejects the defendant\u2019s threshold contention that the evidence was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, concluding that the evidence \u201cwas relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter in this case, as well as to corroborate Finney\u2019s testimony to that effect.\u201d Footnote 19 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">As I explain more fully hereinafter, the trial court improperly permitted the state to present evidence of the Rose shooting because that evidence was not relevant to prove any fact at issue in the case. Even if that evidence may be deemed relevant, however, it was inadmissible because, as the Appellate Court explained, any minimal probative value that it may have had was far outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. Furthermore, whether the evidence is viewed as irrelevant or minimally relevant, the state\u2019s use of that evidence entitles the defendant to a new trial because it was so prejudicial as to violate the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Before addressing the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly permitted the state to present evidence of the Rose shooting, I first note the firmly established principles of relevance and materiality that govern a review of that conclusion. Except as provided by the state and federal constitutions, state statute or the Connecticut Code of Evidence, \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible .... Evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-2. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>297 Conn. 621, 635, 1 A.3d 1051 (2010). Thus, \u201c[e]vidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, [as] long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>290 Conn. 468, 497, 964 A.2d 73 (2009). As this court previously has noted, \u201c[e]vidence is admissible only to prove material facts, that is to say, those facts directly in issue or those probative of matters in issue; evidence offered to prove other facts is immaterial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiLieto </em>v. <em>County Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group, P.C., </em>265 Conn. 79, 106, 828 A.2d 31 (2003). With respect to the issue of materiality, \u201c[e]vidence is immaterial if the objector is tempted to respond \u2018so what,\u2019 \u2018who cares,\u2019 or \u2018that is not in issue.\u2019 \u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (4th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 4.1.3, p. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[e]vidence of a defendant\u2019s -uncharged misconduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant committed the charged crime or to show the predisposition of the defendant to commit the charged crime. . . . Exceptions to this rule have been recognized, however, to render misconduct evidence admissible if, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>example, the evidence is offered to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime. ... To determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis. . . . First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence. . . . Since the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence is a decision within the discretion of the trial court, we will draw every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . We will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision only when it has abused its discretion or an injustice has occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>293 Conn. 303, 311-12, 977 A.2d 209 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">As I have indicated, the defendant does not dispute the fact that his possession of the gun used in the Rose shooting is relevant to the issue of whether he shot and murdered Hopkins. Indeed, in light of the state\u2019s evidence indicating that the same gun was used in both shootings, it is inarguable that the state had a legitimate interest in linking the defendant to the gun used in the Rose shooting because proof of that connection also implicates the defendant in the Hopkins murder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue presented by this appeal, however, is not whether the trial court properly permitted the state to adduce evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the gun at the time of the Rose shooting but, rather, whether the court properly overruled the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>objection to evidence establishing that the defendant actually shot Rose. Ordinarily, when, as in the present case, the state\u2019s case against the defendant includes evidence that the defendant used a weapon in the commission of the crime, and the state can place that weapon in the hands of the defendant during his commission of a prior crime, the defendant will not acknowledge having committed the prior crime. In such circumstances, the only way for the state to prove that the defendant possessed the gun on the earlier occasion is to present evidence establishing the defendant\u2019s commission of that prior crime. Because that prior crime evidence generally is a vital element of the state\u2019s proof that the accused, as distinguished from anyone else, is guilty of the crime charged, the court is likely to conclude that the risk of any unfair prejudice arising from the state\u2019s use of that evidence is outweighed by its probative value. Indeed, the cases on which the majority relies in support of its conclusion that the probative value of the evidence concerning the Rose shooting outweighs its prejudicial effect fall squarely into this category, that is, in each such case, evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the weapon was critical to the state\u2019s case, and, because the defendant had not acknowledged possessing the weapon in the commission of a prior crime, the state was entitled to adduce evidence of the commission of that prior crime to prove the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the weapon. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>353 F.3d 281, 290-93, 311-12 (4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 999, 125 S. Ct. 627, 160 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>992 So. 2d 330, 332-34 (Fla. App. 2008); <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>13 App. Div. 3d 145, 146, 786 N.Y.S.2d 55 (2004), appeal denied, 4 N.Y.3d 828, 829 N.E.2d 676, 796 N.Y.S.2d 583 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>381 S.C. 390, 404-406, 673 S.E.2d 434 (2009); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemons, </em>348 N.C. 335, 351-53, 501 S.E.2d 309 (1998) (although defendant admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>prior possession of weapon, evidence of prior crime admissible to prove identity), vacated on other grounds, 527 U.S. 1018, 119 S. Ct. 2363, 144 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Thus, contrary to the assertion of the majority, those cases provide no support for the majority\u2019s conclusion because, in the present case, the defendant confessed to the police that he had shot Rose, and he has never challenged the validity or accuracy of that confession. In other words, he never has disputed the fact that he shot Rose. Because the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that he shot Rose necessarily also constitutes an acknowledgment that he possessed the gun that was used in that shooting, there simply was no basis for the court to permit the state to present evidence of the shooting itself. For that reason, evidence of that shooting was irrelevant to any disputed issue in the case. Because irrelevant evidence is inadmissible; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-2; there is no reason to subject such evidence to the balancing standard prescribed by \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence for determining whether <em>probative </em>evidence should be excluded due to its overriding prejudicial effect. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d 934, 939 (2d Cir. 1980) (to be admissible, evidence of prior misconduct \u201cmust be relevant to some disputed issue in the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Alternatively, it may be argued that, although evidence that the defendant shot Rose was relevant to prove the defendant\u2019s possession of the gun used in that shooting, the probative value of that evidence was minimal because other uncontested evidence, namely, the defendant\u2019s confession to the Rose shooting, established that fact definitively. Indeed, as the majority notes, the Appellate Court appears to assume the relevance of the Rose shooting, concluding, however, that its minimal probative value was far outweighed by its potential for undue prejudice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 732, 743. When the issue is viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>from the perspective that the evidence was relevant but, under the circumstances presented, only marginally so, the Appellate Court correctly concluded, contrary to the determination of the trial court, that the risk of unfair prejudice that the evidence posed substantially outweighed its slight probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The majority nevertheless concludes that the trial court properly determined that the evidence was relevant and that its probative value outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. The majority\u2019s conclusion is unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">With respect to the issue of relevance, the majority reasons that, \u201c[wjithin the law of evidence, relevance is a very broad concept. ... All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact <em>even to a slight degree, </em>[as] long as it not prejudicial or merely cumulative. . . . Given this broad definition, we view the distinction drawn by the defendant and the dissent \u2014 namely, that between simple prior possession of the murder weapon, and its actual use in the Rose shooting \u2014 as one of degree rather than kind. Thus . . . the analytical key to this particular evidentiary decision lies under the second prong of the uncharged misconduct test, namely, the degree to which the prejudicial effect of the otherwise relevant evidence outweighs its probative value.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Footnote 19 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In asserting that the evidence of the Rose shooting was relevant, albeit only to a \u201cslight degree\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) footnote 19 of the majority opinion; the majority does not address the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was merely cumulative \u2014 and therefore inadmissible \u2014 in light of the fact that the state\u2019s proof, which was <em>uncontested by the defendant, </em>established that the defendant confessed to having pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>sessed the gun at the time of the Rose shooting. Specifically, the majority never explains why, in light of the undisputed evidence linking the defendant to the gun used in the Rose shooting, the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the state had no legitimate reason to present evidence of the Rose shooting itself. Instead of explaining why the Appellate Court improperly relied on that reasoning in concluding that the trial court had abused its discretion in permitting the state to prove that the defendant shot Rose, the majority ignores the critical distinction between the state\u2019s use of evidence proving <em>that </em>fact, on the one hand, and the state\u2019s use of evidence establishing that the defendant possessed the gun used in that shooting, on the other. Indeed, the majority states that, \u201c[hjaving reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court had abused its discretion in determining that the prejudicial effect of the evidence that the defendant <em>had shot Rose with the same gun used in [the Hopkins] murder </em>did not unduly exceed its probative value.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority simply cannot justify reversing the judgment of the Appellate Court without considering and resolving that issue, which provides the primary basis for the Appellate Court\u2019s decision and for the defendant\u2019s opposition to the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Despite its failure to explain why evidence of the Rose shooting was not needlessly cumulative, the majority nevertheless concludes that the trial court properly determined that the probative value of the evidence, however slight, exceeded its potential for unfair prejudice. Although conceding that \u201cthe evidence of the Rose shooting . . . certainly had some prejudicial effect\u201d; footnote 21 of the majority opinion; the majority gives four reasons for its conclusion that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial. None of these reasons is persua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>sive in light of the fact that the evidence was both inflammatory and served no legitimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The majority\u2019s first reason in support of its determination is the fact that the state did not present detailed evidence of the Rose shooting and that that incident was less serious than the Hopkins murder. Although it is true that the state could have presented more extensive evidence about the Rose shooting, which, of course, would have been even more prejudicial if Rose had not survived the shooting, as the Appellate Court observed, \u201c[t]he testimony relating to the Rose [shooting] clearly fits into the category of evidence that would have unduly aroused the [jurors\u2019] emotions and hostilities] [because] . . . [i]t painted the defendant as a gun toting criminal with a proclivity for shooting people. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 743. Even though the state did not adduce details of the Rose shooting, and the shooting did not result in Rose\u2019s death, it is unreasonable to suggest that evidence of the shooting, which occurred just three months prior to the Hopkins murder, did not give rise to a significant risk of prejudice. The mere fact that the evidence could have been <em>more </em>prejudicial does not support the contention that it was only <em>minimally </em>prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The majority next \u201cfindfs] significant the trial court\u2019s efforts to have the prosecution admonish its witnesses that any testimony about the Rose shooting was to be limited only to the fact that there was a shooting, with no other details regarding the events of that day.\u201d For purposes of performing the balancing required under \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, this contention has no significance independent of the first reason that the majority advances in support of its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The third basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion is the limiting instruction that the trial court gave to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>concerning the restricted purpose for which the Rose shooting evidence had been admitted. The court\u2019s instruction is a factor that supports the majority\u2019s conclusion because such instructions generally serve to minimize the prejudicial effect of prior misconduct evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 397-98, 844 A.2d 810 (2004). As this court has acknowledged, however, the prejudice that invariably flows from the admission of such evidence is high; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>288 Conn. 418, 473, 953 A.2d 45 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 Conn. 324, 345, 662 A.2d 1199 (1995); and, although the court must give a limiting instruction when requested to do so; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-4; there are circumstances in which a limiting instruction is insufficient to protect the rights of the defendant. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>198 Conn. 273, 278-79, 502 A.2d 911 (1986) (limiting instructions given by trial court could not have eliminated likelihood that jurors would infer that defendant was guilty of crime charged because he previously had engaged in similar misconduct); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-4, commentary (contemplating possibility that limiting instruction \u201cwill not adequately protect the rights of the parties\u201d). This court also has recognized that \u201cthe probability of a jury inferring a predisposition to commit the crime with which the defendant stands charged is logically increased when the evidence [of prior misconduct] pertains to misconduct similar to that involved in the case on trial because such evidence creates inevitable pressure on lay jurors to believe that if [the defendant] did it before he probably did so this time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 345. Thus, \u201cwhen prior crimes are quite similar to the offense being tried, a high degree of prejudice is created and a strong showing of probative value would be necessary to warrant admissibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>288 Conn. 116, 141, 951 A.2d 531 (2008). In the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>alleged prior misconduct, a shooting involving a gun, was very similar to the conduct for which the defendant was on trial. These considerations, along with the violent nature of the defendant\u2019s alleged prior misconduct, undermine whatever effectiveness the court\u2019s limiting instruction otherwise might have had.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Finally, the majority relies on \u201cdecisions from numerous other federal and state courts that have rejected challenges, founded on undue prejudice, to the use of uncharged misconduct evidence in cases [in which] the charged offenses were committed using the same gun that the defendant had utilized in prior shootings.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In fact, as I have explained previously, those decisions provide no support for the majority\u2019s conclusion. In each of those cases, as in the present case, the prosecuting authority had sought to prove that the defendant had committed another crime with the same gun that was used in the offense for which the defendant was on trial. Moreover, in each of those cases, as in the present case, the state had a strong and legitimate interest in demonstrating that the same person who had committed the other crime also committed the crime for which the defendant was on trial. In contrast to the present case, however, in all but one of those cases, the defendant had not acknowledged responsibility for the prior shooting, and, in the only case in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>defendant did admit involvement in the other crime, evidence of that crime was admitted under an altogether different theory. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemons, </em>supra, 348 N.C. 351-53 (evidence of prior misconduct properly admitted as signature crime evidence). Thus, in those cases, in contrast to the present case, the prosecution\u2019s use of the prior misconduct evidence was necessary to link the defendant to the gun that had been used in the other crime, proof of which was necessary to link the defendant to the gun used in the case being tried.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Those cases, therefore, are completely inapposite to the present case, in which evidence of the prior shooting is wholly unnecessary to link the defendant to the gun that he used on that prior occasion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>In sum, because the state had absolutely no need to adduce evidence of the Rose shooting for the purpose of linking the defendant to the gun used in that shooting, the evidence is properly characterized as either irrelevant or needlessly cumulative. The majority, however, <em>fails completely to address that fact </em>in concluding that the trial court properly determined that the probative value of the challenged evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Indeed, the majority simply ignores that aspect of the balancing test despite having acknowledged the slight probative value of the evidence in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was irrelevant and, therefore, inadmissible. Moreover, as the Appellate Court explained, evidence that the defendant had shot Rose just three months prior to the Hopkins murder was highly prejudicial to the defendant because of the likelihood that the jury would view the defendant as a person with violent propensities, including a propensity for shooting people. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 743. In such circumstances, that is, when evidence is devoid of probative value and its potential for unfair prejudice is great, the evidence nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>essarily is inadmissible in accordance with \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Indeed, even if the evidence may be deemed to have some slight relevance, as the majority maintains, its minimal probative value clearly is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Moreover, contrary to the state\u2019s contention on appeal, evidence of the Rose shooting was not admissible either to prove motive or to corroborate Finney\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With respect to motive, the state argues that, because of his involvement in the Rose shooting, the defendant was trying to evade the police, and he could not do so successfully while maintaining a steady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>job; consequently, the defendant was unemployed, and, to support himself, he resorted to robbing people, among them, Hopkins. Although it may be possible to trace the defendant\u2019s unemployment to the Rose shooting, the fact that the defendant was not employed was undisputed, and it was his unemployed status that allegedly caused him to turn to robberies as a means of support. Thus, the state would have had no difficulty in establishing the defendant\u2019s need for money, and thus his motive for robbing and shooting Hopkins, without evidence of the Rose shooting. Indeed, even if it is assumed that proof of motive required evidence that the defendant was on the run from the police when Hopkins was murdered, there is no reason why the state could not have established that fact without use of the highly prejudicial evidence relating to the Rose shooting. Thus, evidence of the Rose shooting was not necessary to prove motive and, therefore, not admissible for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The state\u2019s claim and the majority\u2019s unsupported assertion that the evidence was admissible to corroborate the prosecution testimony of Finney in accordance with \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence also lacks merit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cOther crimes evidence ... is only admissible for corroborative purposes ... if the corroboration is direct and the matter corroborated is significant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>218 Conn. 85, 129, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohel, </em>604 F.2d 748, 754 (2d Cir. 1979) (applying identical standard). Thus, otherwise inadmissible prior misconduct evidence that directly corroborates only those portions of a witness\u2019 testimony that are themselves irrelevant and inadmissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ble is neither direct nor significant for purposes of the corroboration exception. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Llera, </em>114 Conn. App. 337, 343-44, 969 A.2d 225 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In the present case, evidence that the defendant shot Rose, including Finney\u2019s testimony to that effect, was itself inadmissible. Thus, evidence that the defendant shot Rose \u201cis not rendered admissible merely because it corroborates another equally inadmissible statement on the same subject.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohel, </em>supra, 604 F.2d 754. Furthermore, the corroboration was not direct because the evidence corroborated only that aspect of Finney\u2019s testimony relating to the Rose shooting, which was irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendant murdered Hopkins. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Llera, </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 344 (rule that \u201c[o]ther crimes evidence . . . is . . . admissible for corroborative purposes . . . [only] if the corroboration is direct and the matter corroborated is significant . . . would be meaningless if it was satisfied merely because evidence of another crime had a general tendency to corroborate the testimony of a witness who coincidentally testified about [that unrelated crime]\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). Finally, proof that Finney might have been truthful on the witness stand concerning a matter wholly unrelated to the crimes at issue \u201cis hardly \u2018significant\u2019 within the meaning of [our jurisprudence].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mohel, </em>supra, 755. Thus, evidence that the defendant shot Rose could not have been used by the state to corroborate Finney\u2019s inadmissible testimony to that same effect.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Finally, I agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s improper admission of the highly prejudicial evidence concerning the Rose shooting was not harmless. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 744. \u201c[T]he proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury\u2019s verdict was substantially swayed by the error. . . . Accordingly, a nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beavers, </em>290 Conn. 386, 419, 963 A.2d 956 (2009). As the Appellate Court succinctly explained, \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s first trial resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial. Similarly, in the trial that resulted in [his conviction] . . . the jury twice indicated that it was deadlocked .... There was no eyewitness to the crime, and the only tangible evidence linking the defendant to the crime was the shell casing and a fingerprint. Given the overall strength of the state\u2019s case, we cannot say that we have a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 744.

These statements by the Appellate Court concerning the minimal probative value of the evidence concerning the Rose shooting, coupled with the court\u2019s reliance on the balancing standard of \u00a7 4-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, reflect the court\u2019s view that the evidence, although minimally probative, was inadmissible because of the danger of unfair prejudice that it posed to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> I note that, although the trial court expressly instructed the jury that evidence of the Rose shooting was relevant only for the purpose of proving intent, an element of a crime, or opportunity, the majority asserts that the Appellate Court \u201cappear[s] to [have] assume[d]\u201d that the evidence \u201cwas relevant under either of the corroboration or identity exceptions\u201d of \u00a7 4-5 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. It is true that, in a colloquy with counsel concerning the admissibility of the evidence, the trial court did state that the evidence was relevant to prove identity and to corroborate testimony, as well as for other purposes. Thereafter, however, in its instructions to the jury, the court expressly limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence \u201cto the issues of intent, element of a crime or opportunity.\u201d In view of the fact that the trial court informed the jury that the evidence was relevant as to those issues and those issues only, I see no reason to presume, as the majority does, that the Appellate Court assumed that the evidence was relevant for other purposes, such as corroboration or to prove identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> In essence, evidence demonstrating the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the murder weapon is relevant to establish identity insofar as that evidence tends to identify the defendant as the perpetrator. In other words, evidence that, on a prior occasion, the defendant possessed the gun that was used in the Hopkins murder implicates <em>him </em>in that murder because it demonstrates his access to the murder weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> I also note that the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions were hardly a model of clarity, and, in fact, the instruction likely was more confusing than helpful to the jury. In particular, the court told the jury, without further elaboration, that it could consider the evidence of the Rose shooting for purposes of determining \u201cintent\u201d or \u201copportunity\u201d or as proof of an \u201celement of a crime . . . .\u201d At least in the absence of some additional explanatory comments by the court, I do not see how the court\u2019s limiting instruction would have provided guidance to the jury with respect to its proper use of the evidence demonstrating that the defendant had shot Rose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The cases that the majority cites are: <em>United States </em>v. <em>Higgs, </em>supra, 353 F.3d 312, <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 992 So. 2d 330, <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 13 App. Div. 3d 145, <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemons, </em>supra, 348 N.C. 335, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>supra, 381 S.C. 390.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b655-5\"> In fact, the one case that bears the most similarity to the present case, namely, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>State, </em>690 N.E.2d 224 (Ind. 1997), supports the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the trial court improperly permitted the state to present evidence of the Rose shooting. In <em>Thompson, </em>the defendant, Jerry K. Thompson, was charged with two counts of murder. See id., 227-28. To prove its case against Thompson, the state sought to introduce evidence that he had stolen the murder weapon, a handgun, in the course of committing a different murder approximately one month earlier. Id. The trial court allowed the state to adduce evidence of the circumstances surrounding Thompson\u2019s theft of the handgun, including evidence of his involvement in and conviction of the earlier murder. See id., 231-32. Following Thompson\u2019s conviction, he appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the evidence of the prior murder was both unnecessary and unduly prejudicial. See id., 233-37. In reversing Thompson\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court of Indiana concluded that, although the state was entitled to establish generally how and when Thompson had obtained the murder weapon, it was unnecessary, and therefore improper, for the state to have elicited the highly prejudicial testimony about the prior murder. Id., 236-37. As in <em>Thompson, </em>the state in the present case had every right to prove that the defendant had possessed the gun that was used in the Rose shooting, but, because proof of the Rose shooting was completely unnecessary to establish the defendant\u2019s prior possession of the gun, the state\u2019s use of that prejudicial evidence was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> The majority also asserts that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not \u201cundue or unreasonable\u201d in light of the alternative suggested at trial by the defendant\u2019s standby counsel, namely, that the state\u2019s proof be limited to a showing that the defendant had discharged the gun on a prior occasion. Footnote 21 of the majority opinion. The majority reaches this conclusion on the basis of its contention that there is no appreciable difference in the prejudicial effect of evidence demonstrating that the defendant once had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>discharged the gun as opposed to evidence demonstrating that the defendant actually had shot another person, namely, Rose. In my view, the majority blinks at reality in equating the nature and extent of the prejudice attendant to the innocent discharge of a gun and the intentional shooting of another. Indeed, the significance of this distinction is self-evident: many, if not most, gun owners have discharged a gun, whereas exceedingly few gun owners ever have shot another person for any reason, let alone intentionally. Moreover, any possible prejudice arising out of the evidence establishing that the defendant merely had discharged the gun would have been minimal because the court would have instructed the jury that it could not consider that evidence for any purpose other than to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s possession of the gun. In essence, the jury would have been required to presume that the discharge of the gun was entirely innocent or innocuous, an instruction that the jury would have had no difficulty following in view of the fact that there would have been no evidence adduced at trial even to suggest a contrary conclusion. No such instruction could have ameliorated the prejudice associated with evidence demonstrating that the defendant had fired at and struck Rose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> The majority maintains that I have not afforded proper deference to the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling concerning the admissibility of the Rose shooting. Of course, rulings pertaining to the admissibility of evidence are entitled to substantial deference. Because evidence of the Rose shooting was so lacking in probative value, however, and because its potential for unfair prejudice was so great, the trial court reasonably could not have permitted the state to adduce evidence of that shooting. In such circumstances, proper deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling cannot save it because such deference does not relieve this court of its obligation to reject evidentiary rulings that are unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> Although evidence of the Rose shooting ordinarily would be relevant to establish the identity of the defendant in the sense that such evidence tends to identify him as the perpetrator; see footnote 12 of this opinion; I disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that the evidence was admissible as a signature crime to prove identity. See footnote 17 of the majorify opinion and accompanying text. \u201cTo be admissible for that purpose, the factual characteristics shared by the charged and uncharged crimes must be sufficiently distinctive and unique as to be like a signature [so that] it logically could be inferred that if the defendant is guilty of one [crime] he must be guilty of the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Snelgrove, </em>288 Conn. 742, 765, 954 A.2d 165 (2008). Thus, \u201c[m]uch more is required than the fact that the offenses fall into the same class. The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 354, 446 A.2d 382 (1982). Aside from the fact that Rose and Hopkins were shot with the same gun, there is nothing unusual or unique about those two shootings. In fact, certain important dissimilarities are apparent; for example, according to the state\u2019s proof, the reason for the Rose shooting and the motive for the Hopkins murder were completely different. Consequently, it is absolutely clear that evidence of the Rose shooting was not admissible as a signature crime for the purpose of proving identify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> The majority merely asserts, in conclusory fashion, that evidence of the Rose shooting was admissible to corroborate Finney\u2019s testimony. The majority, however, provides no explanation to support its assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b659-5\"> The state also contends that evidence of the Rose shooting \u201cwas highly probative because it helped the jury understand how the defendant became a suspect in [the Hopkins] murder.\u201d Although the state frequently will be permitted to demonstrate how an accused came to the attention of the police, there is nothing in our law that affords the state a right to do so. Indeed, such evidence generally is unimportant to the state\u2019s case. In the present case, there was absolutely no need for the state to get into that aspect of the investigation, and, to whatever limited extent such evidence might have appealed to one or more jurors\u2019 curiosity, any interest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the state may have had in using the evidence for that purpose was vastly outweighed by its high potential for unfair prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
