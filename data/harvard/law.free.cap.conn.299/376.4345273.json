The fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>appeals, upon our grant of its petition for certification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the board\u2019s decision dismissing, as untimely, its appeal from the supplemental order of the commissioner, ordering it to pay benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-306<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the plaintiff, Lovie Dechio, the surviving spouse of Peter Dechio (decedent), a longtime manufacturing employee of the named defendant, Raymark Industries, Inc. (Raymark).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Dechio </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>114 Conn. App. 58, 59-61, 968 A.2d 450 (2009). Guided primarily by our decision in <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>256 Conn. 456, 774 A.2d 113 (2001), we conclude that the fund\u2019s right to appeal, or otherwise preserve its appellate rights under Practice Book \u00a7 61-5,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> accrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>when the commissioner issued a finding and award that established the compensability of the plaintiffs claim and determined that there was no other insurance coverage available, thereby rendering the fund\u2019s liability for those benefits probable, rather than when the commissioner later rendered a supplemental order pursuant to \u00a7 31-355 directing the fund to pay those benefits in Raymark\u2019s stead. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion aptly sets forth the following facts and procedural history. \u201cOn December 12,1981, [the decedent], a retired, longtime blue collar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>worker for [Raymark],<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> died from complications resulting from lung cancer. [The decedent] was the plaintiff\u2019s husband of nearly forty years at the time of his death. On June 24, 1988, the commission rendered a finding and award that found, inter alia, that [the decedent] died as a result of his exposure to asbestos arising out of and during the course of his employment with Raymark and that [the plaintiff] was entitled to benefits from [the decedent\u2019s] date of death until [the plaintiffs] death or remarriage pursuant to ... \u00a7 31-306.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commissioner ordered Raymark to pay those benefits and stated that a hearing would be held to determine [the decedent\u2019s] average weekly wage. In 1988, Raymark entered involuntary bankruptcy, from which it briefly emerged in 1996. As a result, hearings on the compensation rate were not held until August and September, 1997. A decision was not reached, however, because Raymark entered voluntary bankruptcy in March, 1998, again putting a halt to the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff then sought relief from the automatic stay provisions of federal bankruptcy law<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> so as to allow her to pursue payment from the fund under \u00a7 31-355. On June 29,2000, the plaintiff received an order from the Bankruptcy Court granting her relief from the automatic stay, which, in turn, allowed her to pursue her workers\u2019 compensation claim. In 2002, the fund was cited into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the proceedings because of its potential liability under \u00a7 31-355. Also cited into the proceedings as defendants were [Zurich], [The Hartford], General Reinsurance Group (General Reinsurance) and the Connecticut Insurance Guarantee Association (association).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Multiple formal hearings over the subsequent months formed the basis of the September 30, 2005 finding and award issued by [Amado J. Vargas, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district]. In this finding and award, the commissioner found, among other things, that the June 24, 1988 finding and award was proper in all respects and [that] the commissioner had the jurisdiction and authority to hear and rule on the claim. He also found that there was no credible evidence that Zurich or The Hartford had insured Raymark\u2019s blue collar, manufacturing employees and dismissed the fund\u2019s claims against each of them. He also found, in regard to the association, that pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (6), the claim was not a covered claim, nor did the commission have jurisdiction to determine the association\u2019s liability. The commissioner also dismissed the fund\u2019s claims against General Reinsurance, finding that the commission lacked the authority and jurisdiction to interpret the contract between General Reinsurance and Raymark.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201cThe commissioner also found that, at that time, he was precluded from issuing a supplemental order against the fund because, he reasoned, an order must first be issued against Raymark, as the employer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>record. Such an order, however, could not be issued, the commissioner found, because of Raymark\u2019s bankruptcy status. The commissioner, however, left open the option of issuing a subsequent order against Raymark if it emerged from bankruptcy or if another relief from [the] automatic stay was issued directly against Raymark by the Bankruptcy Court. Following either of those events, the commissioner could issue a supplemental order against the fund. The commissioner also found [the decedent\u2019s] average weekly wage adjusted for cost of living increases to be $337.22 and the resultant statutory compensation rate due the plaintiff to be $224.93. [See General Statutes \u00a7 31-310.]</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u201cOn December 23, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court granted the plaintiffs motion for relief from the automatic stay and ordered Raymark\u2019s automatic stay lifted so as to allow the plaintiff to seek an order directly against Raymark pursuant to the commissioner\u2019s September 30, 2005 finding and award.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In his September 29, 2006 finding and award, the commissioner directed Raymark to pay all the benefits due the plaintiff under the September 30, 2005 finding and award. He also ratified and made applicable to the fund the June 24, 1988 and September 30, 2005 findings and awards. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>order issued against Raymark went unpaid. On October 25,2006, the commissioner issued a supplemental order directing the fund to pay the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-355. On November 14, 2006, the fund filed a petition for review with the board. On November 20, 2006, the plaintiff [and the carriers] filed a motion to dismiss the fund\u2019s petition for review. In its November 28, 2007 opinion, the board granted the plaintiffs motion to dismiss . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dechio </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 62-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The fund appealed from the board\u2019s dismissal order to the Appellate Court, which, in a split decision, affirmed the decision of the board. Id., 75. The Appellate Court majority rejected the fund\u2019s argument that, \u201cbecause no order was specifically issued against it until October 25, 2006, it can challenge the order itself and, in so doing, assail each of the preceding findings and awards through its appeal from that order.\u201d Id., 68. Relying on our explication of final judgment principles in the workers\u2019 compensation context set forth in <em>Lev-arge </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>282 Conn. 386, 920 A.2d 996 (2007), the Appellate Court concluded that the supplemental order, from which the fund had appealed, was the result of a ministerial determination following the true appealable final judgment in this case, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the September 29, 2006 order directing Raymark to pay all benefits due to the plaintiff. See <em>Dechio </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 71-74. The Appellate Court concluded, therefore, that, given the undisputed facts surrounding the issuance of the commissioner\u2019s decisions, as well as the fact that the fund had failed to preserve its right to appeal from the earlier rulings \u2014 and particularly the September 29, 2006 finding and award \u2014 by filing a notice of intent to appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-5; see id., 68; \u201cit is clear that the petition for review was not filed within the statutory mandate of \u00a7 31-301.\u201d Id., 74. Given that the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the appeal was timely filed, the Appellate Court concluded that the board properly had dismissed the fund\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 75. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">On appeal, the fund claims that, for purposes of the twenty day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 31-301 (a), its appellate rights did not mature until the commissioner issued the supplemental order on October 25, 2006. The fund claims that we must read the appeals provision of \u00a7 31-301 (a) in conjunction with the scheme set forth in \u00a7 31-355 (b) regarding the provision of notice to the state treasurer, as custodian of the fund, followed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>a hearing to be held prior to the issuance of an order directing the fund to pay benefits in cases wherein the employer or carrier has failed to pay benefits. Alternatively, the fund relies on Judge Lavine\u2019s opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Appellate Court, as well as <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>208 Conn. 515, 544 A.2d 634 (1988), and contends that the supplemental order constituted a substitute judgment that triggered a new appeal period, particularly as, under \u00a7 31-355 (b), the initial findings and awards, including those against Raymark, did not create liability on the part of the fund.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Along this line, the fund then contends that <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 456, is not controlling because it did not involve the timeliness of an appeal, but, rather, the fund\u2019s request for a trial de novo, and emphasizes that the fund\u2019s failure to appeal or file a notice of its intent to appeal thus did not deprive the board of subject matter jurisdiction over its appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In response, the plaintiff, joined by the carriers, contends that, given its participation throughout the lengthy proceedings and \u201caggressive\u201d litigation of this case, the fund had standing to challenge the commissioner\u2019s initial award when it was rendered and did not need to wait until the issuance of the supplemental order in order to appeal, or alternatively, it should have taken steps to preserve its appellate rights by filing a notice of intent to appeal pursuant to Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00a7 61-5. The plaintiff, relying on <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 456, argues that separate proceedings were not required under \u00a7 31-355 (b) because the fund had the opportunity actively to litigate this case and contest its liability for the plaintiffs benefits throughout the proceedings before the commissioner; the plaintiff maintains that \u201cthe fund knew that the previous findings were inexorably building towards an ultimate award against it.\u201d To this end, the carriers emphasize that the September 30, 2005 and September 29, 2006 findings and awards establishing compensability and self-insurance were appealable decisions, and that any actions taken thereafter with respect to obtaining relief from Raymark\u2019s bankruptcy stay for purposes of the liability finding under \u00a7 31-355 (b) were \u201cmerely ministerial,\u201d given the fact that \u201c[i]t was well known during the pendency of the underlying action that [Raymark] was in bankruptcy and would not be able to pay any award.\u201d We agree with the plaintiff and the carriers, and conclude that: (1) given the fund\u2019s participation in these proceedings, the notice and hearing provisions of \u00a7 31-355 (b) are inapplicable; and (2) therefore, the twenty day appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a) began to run with the issuance of the September 30, 2005 order, which established a lack of other coverage and made clear the fund\u2019s probable liability for payment of the plaintiffs benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tion given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. . . . [W]e do not afford deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute when . . . the construction of a statute previously has not been subjected to judicial scrutiny or to a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jones </em>v. Redding, 296 Conn. 352, 362-63, 995 A.2d 51 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The issue presented is a question of first impression for this court, and neither the parties nor the board assert that a time-tested interpretation exists as to the point at which the fund must appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision under \u00a7 31-301 (a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cAccordingly, we do not defer to the board\u2019s construction and exercise plenary review in accordance with our well established rules of statutory construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Developmental Services, </em>297 Conn. 391, 399, 999 A.2d 682 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. ... In seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute], General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter .... The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We begin, then, with the text of \u00a7 31-301 (a), which governs appeals to the board, and provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time <em>within twenty days after entry of an award by the commissioner, after a decision of the commissioner upon a motion </em>or after an order by the commissioner according to the provisions of section 31-299b, either party may appeal therefrom to the Compensation Review Board by filing in the office of the commissioner from which the award or the decision on a motion originated an appeal petition and five copies thereof. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cIf no appeal from the decision is taken by either party within twenty days thereafter, such award shall be final and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-300. The plaintiff and the carriers argue that the appeal period under \u00a7 31-301 (a) began to run with the commissioner\u2019s issuance of the award on September 30, 2005, or, alternatively, on September 29, 2006, the date of the finding and award directing Raymark to pay the plaintiff all benefits due.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The fund contends, however, that the relevant award or decision for purposes of starting the appeal period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>set forth in \u00a7 31-301 (a) is, in all cases in which the fund is a party, the commissioner\u2019s order pursuant to \u00a7 31-355 (b) requiring the fund to pay benefits, following a finding that the employer cannot or has not paid benefits. Section 31-355 (b) provides: \u201cWhen an award of compensation has been made under the provisions of this chapter against an employer who failed, neglected, refused or is unable to pay any type of benefit coming due as a consequence of such award or any adjustment in compensation required by this chapter, and whose insurer failed, neglected, refused or is unable to pay the compensation, such compensation shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund. <em>The commissioner, on a finding of failure or inability to pay compensation, shall give notice to the Treasurer of the award, directing the Treasurer to make payment from the fund. Whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the Treasurer, the Treasurer shall file with the commissioner, on or before the twenty-eighth day after the Treasurer has received an order of payment from the commissioner, a notice </em>in accordance with a form prescribed by the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the employee. The commissioner shall hold a hearing on such contested liability at the request of the Treasurer or the employee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If the Treasurer fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed in this section, the Treasurer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death from the Second Injury Fund and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or contest the extent of the employee\u2019s disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>At the outset, we observe that the parties\u2019 proffered interpretations of \u00a7\u00a7 31-301 (a) and 31-355 (b) are reasonable, particularly given the lack of a specific reference in \u00a7 31-355 (b) to appeals. The statutes are, therefore, ambiguous with respect to when the appeal period begins to run in cases wherein the fund has participated throughout the proceedings before the commission, rather than first entering the proceedings within twenty-eight days of the treasurer receiving an order to pay benefits. Accordingly, we may consult extratextual evidence in interpreting these statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">As the parties and the board acknowledge, this appeal is not our first opportunity to construe \u00a7 31-355 (b), as we previously examined this statute in <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate ofDember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 456. In our view, our analysis in <em>Matey </em>belies the fund\u2019s arguments that, under \u00a7 31-355 (b): (1) \u201cits appeal period does not begin to run until twenty days following the issuance of an order directing it to pay an award that the employer or its insurer has not paid\u201d; (2) \u201c[i]f jurisdiction exists for the fund to contest liability, a fortiori, the fund could appeal the finding and award instead of requesting a de novo hearing\u201d; and (3) it \u201cis entitled to procedural due process which includes an appeal period that commences only when an order is specifically directed to it.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Matey, we rejected the fund\u2019s claim that, under \u00a7 31-355 (b), \u201cregardless of whether it has participated in the prior litigation of the claim, the commissioner is required to hold a hearing upon notice of the fund\u2019s intent to contest liability and a request for a hearing.\u201d <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 490. In agreeing with the plaintiffs counterargument \u201cthat the statute is intended to provide the fund with an opportunity to contest liability for a claim when it has not had a prior opportunity to do so\u201d; id., 490-91; we found the legislative history of \u00a7 31-355 (b), enacted as Public Acts 1991, No. 91-207 (P.A. 91-207), \u201cto be particularly instructive.\u201d Id., 491. We noted a debate on the bill on the Senate floor \u201cbetween Senator Thomas F. Upson and Senator James H. Maloney: \u2018Senator Upson: . . . My next problem or question would be does this [bill] mean that the claimant who has initially be[en] challenged by an insurance company, whether or not the accident was work related, could that be challenged again once the determination has been made that this is [s]econd [i]njury? That is challenged again by the [fund]? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201c \u2018Senator Maloney: The answer to the question is no. The bill comes into play when the [commissioner orders the payment of benefits from the fund because an employer or insurer failed or was unable to do so, it allows the [treasurer to contest the eligibility regardless of whether the employer has already done so. <em>So it has to do with the issue of contesting eligibility and the intention is if the eligibility has already been contested below, I don\u2019t see ... it is not the intention of the bill to allow it to be relitigated in effect. It is where it has not been contested, the [treasurer, under this legislation, would have the right to then make that contest.\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 491, quoting 34 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Proc., Pt. 6, 1991 Sess., pp. 2003-2004; see also 34 S. Proc., supra, p. 2009, remarks of Senator Maloney (\u201c[a]ll we are saying is if the matter has not been contested in a forum wherein the ultimate defendant didn\u2019t have an opportunity to argue the case we should give the defendant the opportunity and that opportunity in this instance amounts to the [s]tate of Connecticut to protect the [s]tate from charges it should not have to pay\u201d); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Appropriations, Pt. 1, 1991 Sess., p. 66, remarks of Paul Vitarelli, special investigator for the fund (testifying in support of bill enacted as P.A. 91-207 because, \u201cwhen the issue of compensability is not clear cut and must be decided as the statute is now written, the fund is precluded from any defense in these cases, resulting in the fund being ordered to pay claims without having the opportunity to defend the claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Considering this legislative history, we determined that \u00a7 31-355 (b) was not \u201cintended to require the commissioner to provide the fund with an opportunity to contest liability in every case where an order to make payment is entered against the fund, regardless of whether the fund participated in prior proceedings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 493. Thus, we concluded that \u201cthe fund was not entitled to an opportunity to contest liability after the entry of the award in this case. The fund fully participated in the proceedings before the commissioner and the board for more than fourteen years. The fund was permitted to present evidence and arguments to both the commissioner and the board on all of its claims. We cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, \u00a7 31-355 (b) was intended to give the fund yet another opportunity to relitigate its claims after entry of the order to make payments. Accordingly, we reject the fund\u2019s claim that the commissioner improperly denied it an opportunity to contest liability.\u201d Id., 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Relying on <em>Matey, </em>we conclude that \u00a7 31-355 (b) is inapplicable in this case, because the fund has participated in these proceedings since 2002 and, thus, cannot contend that it lacked the opportunity to contest its liability for the plaintiffs claim, including the availability of alternate insurance coverage, an issue that it did litigate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree with the fund\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Matey </em>on the ground that the issue therein was whether \u00a7 31-355 (b) \u201cprovides the fund with the right to retry a case after issuance of an order for the fund to pay benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-355 where it was afforded a full opportunity to do so at the first trial.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Our discussion therein made clear that \u00a7 31-355 (b) simply is inapplicable to cases wherein the fund already has participated, as opposed to those cases wherein it receives an order to pay benefits without first having had the opportunity to contest its liability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Indeed, our conclusion that \u00a7 31-355 (b) is inapplicable for purposes of determining when the appeal period begins to run under \u00a7 31-301 (a) in cases wherein the fund already has been participating in the proceedings before the commission is consistent with an earlier decision of the board, <em>Delucia </em>v. Modena, 12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 212 (1994), which we consider instructive authority in this case. See, e.g., <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>supra, 296 Conn. 363; see also footnote 16 of this opinion. In <em>Delucia </em>v. <em>Modena, </em>supra, 216-17, the board concluded, inter alia, that both the fund and a beauty salon were precluded from challenging the commissioner\u2019s determination that the salon was the claimant\u2019s last employer for purposes of administering the claim and making initial payments pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b. The board concluded that \u201cneither . . . filed a timely appeal concerning the commissioner\u2019s determination that [the salon] was the claimant\u2019s last employer prior to the filing of her claim and therefore the initially liable respondent under [\u00a7] 31-299b. That determination was explicitly made in the July 21, 1992 [f]inding and [a]ward. [The salon] and the . . . [f]und did not file their appeals until after the commissioner rendered his November 23,1992 [f]inding and [a]ward [determining the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability and awarding benefits]. While the appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>were timely in relation to that later [finding and [a]ward, the issue of the initially liable respondent under [\u00a7] 31-299b had already been determined and orders to that effect were entered months before. Because no timely appeal had been taken on the [\u00a7] 31-299b issue, the commissioner\u2019s determination had become final, no longer subject to review.\u201d Id. In our view, <em>Deluda </em>supports our conclusion that, in the absence of the filing of an appeal to the board or other attempt to preserve appellate rights taken within twenty days of an adverse decision, the commissioner\u2019s various determinations became final under \u00a7 31-300, even as the proceedings before the commission continued until the issuance of the supplemental order.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Relying on <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 515, the fund contends, however, that the supplemental order constituted a substitute judgment that triggered a new appeal period with respect either to that order <em>or </em>the underlying findings and awards upon which it was predicated. We disagree. In <em>Paranteau, </em>an action to recover damages for an alleged violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.; the defendant had filed his appeal \u201cwithin twenty days after the order determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded the plaintiffs, but more than twenty days after the trial court\u2019s judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>supra, 519. After adopting a \u201cbright line rule\u201d that a \u201cjudgment on the merits is final for purposes of appeal even though the recoverability or amount of attorney\u2019s fees for the litigation remains to be determined\u201d; id., 522-23; this court concluded that only the portion of the appeal challenging the fee award was timely. Id., 524. In our view, <em>Paranteau </em>does not support the fund\u2019s position in this appeal because, to the extent that it is applicable in the workers\u2019 compensation context, the commissioner\u2019s supplemental order in this case, like the attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>fee award in <em>Paranteau, </em>did not disturb the commissioner\u2019s earlier findings on the merits of compensability and lack of other insurance coverage, rendering a challenge to the earlier decisions similarly untimely.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finally, we disagree with the fund\u2019s reliance <em>on Hum-mel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>282 Conn. 477, 923 A.2d 657 (2007), for the proposition that, because further proceedings were still required before the commissioner, the fund lacked an appealable final judgment until the issuance of the supplemental order and, therefore, need not have preserved its rights by filing notices of intent to appeal from the earlier adverse decisions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-5. See footnote 6 of this opinion. <em>Hummel, </em>which temporarily reaffirmed our jurisprudence imposing a final judgment requirement with respect to appeals from the board to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-30 lb, notwithstanding the lack of a final judgment requirement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the text of that statute; see <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 501-502; does not stand for the proposition that appeals from the decisions of a commissioner to the board are subject to the same final judgment requirement imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-263<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with respect to appeals from the Superior Court. Moreover, the plain language of \u00a7 31-301 (a) lacks any language imposing a final judgment requirement, and we do not read in such a restriction on the right to appeal, particularly given the fact that the legislature has seen fit to address the final judgment concept in subsection (g) of \u00a7 31-301, pertaining to a claimant\u2019s potential repayment of benefits received during a pending appeal,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> without importing that language into subsection (a). See, e.g., <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 527, 978 A.2d 487 (2009) (\u201cwhen a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed\u201d [internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ted]); cf. Public Acts 2009, No. 09-178, \u00a7 1 (superseding final judgment requirement set forth in <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, Ltd., </em>supra, 477, and amending \u00a7 31-30lb to permit appeals from decisions of board to Appellate Court \u201cwhether or not the decision is a final decision within the meaning of [General Statutes \u00a7] 4-183 or a final judgment within the meaning of [\u00a7] 52-263\u201d). Indeed, the board\u2019s own procedural case law belies the existence of any such final judgment requirement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>State, </em>No. 5014, CRB-8-5-11 (November 8, 2006) (\u201cwe have held in the past that the denial of a [mjotion to [preclude may be appealed to this board under \u00a7 31-301 [a], even though it is not a final judgment for purposes of appeal to a higher court\u201d); <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>State, </em>No. 3506, CRB-07-96-12 (April 28,1998) (denying motion to dismiss appeal for lack of \u201cappealable final judgment\u201d because \u00a7 31-301 [a] permits \u201cappeal to be filed to the [board] after an award, a \u2018decision by the commissioner upon a motion,\u2019 or after a \u00a7 31-299b order\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, that the commissioner\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>sions prior to the supplemental order of October 25, 2006, were not \u201cfinal judgment[s]\u201d as that term has been developed under \u00a7 52-263 does not rescue the fund\u2019s otherwise untimely subsequent appeal to the board.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Having determined in the present case that \u00a7 31-355 (b), and the supplemental order rendered pursuant thereto, are inapplicable for purposes of calculating the appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a), we next must determine which award or decision started that period and required the fund either to appeal or preserve its appellate rights by filing a notice of intent to appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-5.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See footnote 6 of this opinion. Given our determination that there is no final judgment rule with respect to appeals from the commissioner to the board, we look, then, to determine which decision or award rendered the fund an aggrieved party by establishing the \u201cpossibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eder Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>275 Conn. 363, 370, 880 A.2d 138 (2005); see also <em>Delucia </em>v. <em>Modena, </em>supra, 12 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 216-17 (appeal from determination of initially liable respondent under \u00a7 31-299b was untimely when delayed until issuance of award determining extent of claimant\u2019s disability and awarding benefits). Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the fund was required to appeal, or preserve its appellate rights, following the commissioner\u2019s issuance of the September 30, 2005 finding and award, because that decision rendered the likelihood of its responsibility for the payment of the plaintiffs benefits far more than a speculative possibility, and the issue that the fund sought to challenge on appeal, namely, whether the other carriers were hable, had been determined therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Specifically, the September 30, 2005 award rendered the fund an aggrieved party for appellate purposes because the commissioner: (1) upheld the propriety of the initial finding of compensability rendered on June 24,1988; (2) rejected the fund\u2019s claims that the carriers had insured Raymark\u2019s manufacturing or blue collar employees and were responsible to pay those benefits pursuant to the June 24,1988 award; (3) concluded that the commission lacked jurisdiction to determine any liability on the part of the association or General Reinsurance, Raymark\u2019s excess insurance carrier; and (4) determined a weekly compensation rate of $224.93 pursuant to \u00a7 31-310. Although the commissioner noted that he could not issue an award against the fund at that time because an order first had to issue against Raymark, which was then under bankruptcy protection, the commissioner made clear that he would \u201centertain any motions or requests for orders against [Raymark] prior to any order\u201d against the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-355 once the plaintiff obtained relief from the stay or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Raymark exited bankruptcy.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Significantly, the reasons for appeal accompanying the fund\u2019s petition to the board, after issuance of the supplemental order, related only to decisions made in connection with the September 30, 2005 order.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the fund should not have waited until after the issuance of the supplemental order to file its appeal to the board, or otherwise preserve its right to challenge, the decision issued more than one year earlier, which became final by virtue of that failure. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, the rule of practice applicable to the deferral of appeals, namely, Practice Book \u00a7 61-5; see footnotes 6 and 28 of this opinion; supports our conclusion that the fund was required to preserve its right to appeal from the commissioner\u2019s September 30, 2005 decision. Section 61-5 specifically contemplates decisions like that rendered on September 30, 2005, which had concluded that none of the carriers were liable for the benefits herein, as that rule requires the filing of a notice of intent to appeal when the \u201cdeferred appeal is to be taken from a judgment that not only disposes of an entire complaint, counterclaim or cross complaint but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>also disposes of all the causes of action brought by or against a party or parties so that that party or parties are not parties to any remaining complaint, counterclaim or cross complaint . . . Practice Book \u00a7 61-5 (a) (1). Indeed, if the fund were to file a notice of intent to appeal, the carriers would have the opportunity to object to any such deferral, and, therefore, accelerate receipt of a final determination with respect to their role in the case. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">As a consequence of the fund\u2019s failure to timely file an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 31-301 (a), or otherwise preserve its appellate rights under Practice Book \u00a7 61-5, the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the fund\u2019s appeal. See <em>Stec </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>299 Conn. 346, 10 A.3d 1 (2010). The Appellate Court, therefore, properly affirmed the board\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (a) provides: \u201cAt any time within twenty days after entry of an award by the commissioner, after a decision of the commissioner upon a motion or after an order by the commissioner according to the provisions of section 31-299b, either party may appeal therefrom to the Compensation Review Board by filing in the office of the commissioner from which the award or the decision on a motion originated an appeal petition and five copies thereof.

For the reasons discussed in our opinion in the companion case, <em>Stec </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>299 Conn. 346, 356-71, 10 A.3d 1 (2010), we disagree, and conclude that the appeal period of \u00a7 31-301 (a) is subject matter jurisdictional in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> We note that the parties have cited an on-point 1994 decision of the board, <em>Delucia </em>v. <em>Modena, </em>12 Conn.

Inasmuch as the parties have not asserted, and independent research has not revealed, that the board, prior to this case and <em>Stec </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>No. 5156, CRB-4-06-11 (November 21, 2007), the companion appeal to this case; see footnote 15 of this opinion; has relied on <em>Deluda </em>for this point of law, we do not consider it time-tested for purposes of determining the scope of our review in this appeal. See, e.g., <em>Board of Selectmen </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>294 Conn. 438, 448-49, 984 A.2d 748 (2010) (agency interpretation is time-tested if applied consistently on multiple occasions over extended duration).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\"> We disagree with the fund\u2019s claim that the analysis of the legislative history of \u00a7 31-355 (b) <em>in Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 491-93, is diminished in persuasive value by the subsequent enactment of \u00a7 l-2z because \u201clegislative history is no longer relevant in construing an unambiguous statute.\u201d Given our conclusion that the statutory scheme is ambiguous, the legislative history analysis set forth in <em>Matey </em>remains relevant to this inquiry. Moreover, even if we were to agree that \u00a7 31-355 (b) is unambiguous, the enactment of \u00a7 l-2z did not diminish <em>Matey\u2019s </em>precedential value.

Second, this portion of <em>Matey </em>is nonbinding dicta, or \u201cmerely passing commentary\u201d that was \u201cunnecessary to the holding in the case\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>294 Conn. 357, 376-77, 984 A.2d 705 (2009); because we already had concluded therein that the fund had properly preserved its claims in the proceedings before the trial commissioner and the board, and there is no indication that the plaintiff had renewed on appeal to this court the timeliness claims that she had raised before the board. But see <em>Stec </em>v. <em>Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>299 Conn. 346, 10 A.3d 1 (2010) (concluding that appeal period set by \u00a7 31-301 [a] is subject matter jurisdictional and nonwaivable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> Thus, we also disagree with the fund\u2019s reliance on the general proposition that, \u201c[w]hen general and specific statutes conflict they should be harmoniously construed so the more specific statute controls\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Longley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>284 Conn. 149, 177, 931 A.2d 890 (2007); in support of its argument that, as a governmental entity, its appeal rights are governed solely by \u00a7 31-355 (b), rather than the more general provisions of \u00a7 31-301 (a). First, there is nothing in the language of \u00a7 31-355 (b) providing explicitly that an appeal to the board is the procedure for the fund to utilize in contesting its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"AWp\">Second, our interpretation is not swayed by the existence of an \u201cinformal agreement,\u201d mentioned in the fund\u2019s reply brief, between the commission, the office of the attorney general, and the fund \u201cto streamline the hearing process after the legislature amended \u00a7 31-355 (b) in 1991, to provide the fund with a hearing in those cases in which it contested liability to pay compensation pursuant to \u00a7 31-355.\u201d Specifically, the fund posits that \u201c[t]he essence of this agreement was that the fund would not seek a separate de novo formal hearing to contest liability in cases in which it [had] participated in the formal hearing process prior to the issuance of a \u00a7 31-355 order to pay compensation. The [c]hairman [of the commission] sought the fund\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>cooperation in this regard to save the time, money and personnel resources that would have been necessary to provide the fund with a separate hearing process as contemplated by the legislature when it passed the amendment to \u00a7 31-355 (b).\u201d The fund argues that this arrangement \u201cwas never meant to curtail or impede the fund\u2019s appeal rights in cases wherein the employer or carrier has failed to pay benefits. When the provision for a separate hearing to contest fund liability is set aside, the remaining provisions in \u00a7 31-355 (b) still provide for an appeals process for the fund that is distinctly different from that of other parties in the workers\u2019 compensation forum.\u201d Even assuming the propriety of the fund\u2019s reliance on an agreement not contained in the record, we nevertheless disagree with its statutory argument because, again, there is nothing in the language of \u00a7 31-355 (b) referring specifically to an appeal to the board as the fund\u2019s primary procedural vehicle for contesting its liability to pay benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> The fund\u2019s reliance on <em>RAL Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Valley View Associates, </em>278 Conn. 672, 899 A.2d 586 (2006), similarly is misplaced. In <em>RAL Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Valley View Associates, </em>supra, 689, we concluded that \u201cthe opening and modification of a judgment triggers a new limitations period under which the modified judgment may be opened,\u201d and rejected the view that \u201cany modification to a judgment renders the original judgment void such that it extinguishes all rights that flowed from that judgment.\u201d We emphasized that a modified judgment is \u201c \u2018new\u2019 \u201d only \u201cto the extent that the supplanted terms no longer exist,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a substantive distinction between opening a judgment to modify or to alter incidental terms of the judgment, leaving the essence of the original judgment intact, and opening a judgment to set it aside. Under the latter circumstances, the original judgment necessarily has been rendered void and any appeal therefrom would be rendered moot.\u201d Id., 690; see also id., 691 (overruling <em>Milford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>137 Conn. 277, 77 A.2d 80 [1950], which required filing of new appeal in foreclosure cases where \u201cthe only change to the original judgment was an extension of the law days; all other substantive terms of the original judgment were unchanged\u201d). Given our focus in <em>RAL Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Valley View Associates, </em>supra, 691-92, on the nature of any modifications to a judgment, that case does not help the fund herein, because the supplemental order did not modify the commissioner\u2019s earlier adverse decisions against the fitful \u2014 indeed, it reaffirmed them and, therefore, did not give rise to a new appeal period under \u00a7 31-301 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b420-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides: \u201cUpon the trial of all matters of fact in any cause or action in the Superior Court, whether to the court or jury, or before any judge thereof when the jurisdiction of any action or proceeding is vested in him, if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising in the trial, including the denial of a motion to set aside a verdict, he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court or of such judge, or from the decision of the court granting a motion to set aside a verdict, except in small claims cases, which shall not be appealable, and appeals as provided in sections 8-8 and 8-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b420-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (g) provides: \u201cIf the final adjudication results in the denial of compensation to the claimant, and he has previously received compensation on the claim pursuant to subsection (f) and this subsection, the claimant shall reimburse the employer or its insurer for all sums previously expended, plus interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum. Upon any such denial of compensation, the commissioner who originally heard the case or his successor shall conduct a hearing to determine the repayment schedule for the claimant.\u201d The board has construed the term \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-301 (g) as \u201csynonymous with the term \u2018final judgment\u2019 as it frequently appears in case law.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>No. 4744, CRB-1-03-10 (December 3, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b421-5\"> Thus, the fund\u2019s reliance on <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

With no contrary administrative rule on point, notices of intent to appeal may, therefore, be utilized in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. Thus, we disagree with the fund\u2019s contention that a conclusion that \u201cthe fund was required to appeal an earlier decision directed to a party other than the fund creates an environment of uncertainty which would compel the fund to take potentially numerous interlocutory appeals during the formal hearing process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> Thus, we disagree with the fund\u2019s contention that an appeal from the September 30, 2005 order would have been premature because it was not aggrieved, and \u201cit lacked proper standing to initiate an appeal\u201d inasmuch as there was a \u201cstrong probability,\u201d but not a \u201clegal certainty\u201d that an order pursuant to \u00a7 31-355 would issue.
