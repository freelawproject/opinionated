The fact that pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 1623 of^title 18 of the United States Code corroboration is not required in order to establish guilt while corroboration is necessary under the Penal Law (\u00a7 210.50) is immaterial. Corroboration is a procedural device required in order to prove the crime of perjury and does not change the underlying material elements of the crime. The elements required to establish guilt under section 1623, and section 210.15 of the Penal Law are the same in both instances, i.e., the giving of false and material testimony under oath. <em>(Matter of Kopolsky, </em>37 A D 2d 403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The provisions of subdivision 4 of section 90 of the Judiciary Law are mandatory. Accordingly, upon respondent\u2019s conviction he ceased to be an attorney and counselor at law, and therefore, his name must be stricken from the roll of attorneys. (See <em>Matter of Sheinman, </em>277 App. Div. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Nunez, J. P., McNally, Tilzer, Eager and Capozzoli, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Respondent\u2019s name struck from the roll of attorneys and counselors at law in the State of New York.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
