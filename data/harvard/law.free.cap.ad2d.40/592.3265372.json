The motion for a stay of enforcement of the order of Justice Eino, entered in the Supreme Court, New York County, on or about June 3, 1972, granting interim base rent orders and the motion by Robert Abrams, President of the Borough of Bronx, requesting leave to intervene or alternatively to file a brief <em>amicus </em>curiae, are denied as moot and academic. The stay, dated August 29, 1972, affixed to the notice of motion, is vacated. Concur \u2014 Stevens, P. J., Markewich, McNally, Steuer, and Capozzoli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
