Hernandez argued that the cross-reference in \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) to \u00a7 1227(a)(2) did not apply to her because \u00a7 1227(a)(2) makes deportable only persons \u201cin and admitted to the United States,\u201d and Hernandez had never been lawfully admitted. Rather, she maintained that only the cross-reference to \u00a7 1182(a)(2) applied and that that section rendered her prior crime irrelevant because it contained a \u201cpetit-offense exception.\u201d The BIA rejected this argument, relying on its precedential decision in <em>Matter of Cortez Canales, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 301, 306-08 (2010), which read \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) to cross-reference only the <em>offenses </em>listed in the three cross-referenced sections, not the substantive operation of those offenses. Thus, even though the substantive operation of \u00a7 1227(a)(2) did not apply to Hernandez, the <em>offense </em>listed in \u00a7 1227(a)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>did apply, and that provision contains no petit-offense exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We conclude that the BIA\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) is the most logical reading and therefore is, at least, a permissible interpretation of the statute, entitling the BIA\u2019s decision to <em>Chevron </em>deference. Thus, we affirm the BIA and deny Hernandez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Hernandez entered the United States sometime in 1997 without lawful admission or parole after inspection and has, since then, lived continuously in Virginia with her four children, who are U.S. citizens. In 2001, Hernandez was granted \u201ctemporary protected status,\u201d which affords eligible aliens protection from removal to certain countries upon the Attorney General\u2019s determination that conditions in those countries would prevent their safe return. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In January 2007, Hernandez was convicted of petit larceny under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-96 and was sentenced to 30 days\u2019 confinement in jail. After she failed to respond to a request for documentation regarding her criminal record, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services terminated her application to renew her temporary protected status.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">In March 2009, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against Hernandez, charging her with being \u201cpresent in the United States without being admitted or paroled,\u201d in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). When she appeared before an immigration judge in March 2013, she conceded removability but filed an application for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), alleging that her children would suffer hardship if she were not permitted to remain in the United States. The immigration judge pretermitted \u25a0 her application, holding that her petit-larceny conviction rendered her ineligible for the relief she requested, and ordered that she be removed to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">The BIA dismissed Hernandez\u2019s appeal. Noting that Hernandez had conceded that petit larceny \u2014 a Class 1 misdemeanor under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-96, punishable by confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 18.2-11\u2014is a crime involving moral turpitude, the BIA held that Hernandez was ineligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) because she had been convicted of \u201can offense under section ... 1227(a)(2)\u201d \u2014 specifically, \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude ... for which a sentence of one year or' longer may be imposed,\u201d \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). The BIA rejected her argument that the petitoffense exception to \u00a7 1182(a)(2), a section that is also cross-referenced in \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), preserved her eligibility for cancellation of removal, holding that the exception had no applicability to offenses described <em>in \u00a7 1227(a)(2). </em>The BIA also rejected Hernandez\u2019s argument that the offenses in \u00a7 1227(a)(2) and \u00a7 1227(a)(3) applied only to aliens who, unlike Hernandez, had been admitted to the United States, while the offenses in \u00a7 1182(a)(2) applied only to aliens who had not been admitted. To do so, it relied on its prior decision in <em>Cortez Canales, </em>which rejected the distinction that Hernandez was trying to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">From the BIA\u2019s decision, Hernandez filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">In her petition, Hernandez contends that even though she committed a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year could have been imposed, she nonetheless remains eligible for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>because her offense was excepted by the petit-offense exception contained in \u00a7 1182(a)(2). In response to the government\u2019s position that \u00a7 1227(a)(2), which contains no petit-offense exception, also applies, Hernandez contends that \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C)\u2019s cross-reference to \u00a7 1227(a)(2) pertains only to aliens who, unlike her, were admitted and are now deportable. She argues further that even if \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) generally cross-references the offenses in \u00a7 1227(a)(2) regardless of an alien\u2019s admission status, \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) does not apply to unadmitted aliens because that section only makes an alien deportable upon conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude that was committed \u201cwithin five years ... <em>after the date of admission.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, Hernandez argues that only offenses under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) apply to her and that \u00a7 1182(a)(2)\u2019s petit-offense exception preserves her eligibility for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The government contends that because \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), by its plain terms, applies <em>both </em>to aliens previously admitted and now deportable <em>and </em>to aliens never admitted and now subject to removal, the provision disqualifies from eligibility for cancellation of removal the entire class of aliens who have committed <em>any offense </em>listed in any of the three sections cross-referenced in \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C). It argues that \u00a7- 1229b(b)(1)(C) does not cross-reference the substantive operation of those sections, but only <em>the offenses </em>described within them, pointing to the specific language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) that allows the cancellation of removal for admitted and unadmitted aliens only if the alien \u201chas not been convicted of <em>an offense under\u201d </em>the three sections. To support its conclusion, the government relies on the BIA\u2019s precedential decision in <em>Cortez Canales, </em>which so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Because the BIA\u2019s decision and the decision in <em>Cortez Canales </em>involve statutory interpretation, we review the issue de novo. But in doing so, we give the BIA <em>Chevron </em>deference so long as its decision is a precedential decision issued by a three-judge panel. <em>See Martinez v. Holder, </em>740 F.3d 902, 909 (4th Cir.2014). While the BIA\u2019s decision in this case was, issued by a single BIA member, the BIA relied on <em>Cortez Canales, </em>which was decided by a three-judge panel, thus entitling it to Chevron deference. <em>See, e.g., Escobar v. Holder, </em>657 F.3d 537, 542 (7th Cir.2011); <em>Efagene v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 918, 920 (10th Cir.2011); <em>Marmolejo-Campos v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 903, 911 (9th Cir.2009). Thus, <em>Cortez Canales </em>controls to the extent that \u201cCongress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue\u201d and \u201cthe [BIA]\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">To begin with, we recognize that the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1537, often makes the distinction between an alien who has never been admitted to the United States and an alien who has been admitted but who has subsequently become deportable. Both inadmissible and deportable aliens, however, are removable, albeit sometimes for different grounds. <em>See Judulang v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 476, 479, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011). <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 1182(a) (cataloging the grounds that render an alien \u201cineligible <em>to be admitted </em>to the United States\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>with </em>\u00a7 1227(a) (listing the grounds <em>for deportation </em>of an alien \u201cin arid admitted to the United States\u201d). Moreover, both inadmissible and deportable aliens can apply for discretionary cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). And when they do, the specific criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that they must satisfy are the same regardless of whether they are inadmissible or deportable. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(1) (providing that the Attorney General may cancel removal of \u201can alien who is <em>inadmissible or deportable,\u201d </em>so long as the alien satisfies the specified criteria). Thus, regardless of whether Hernandez is inadmissible or deportable, she is eligible for cancellation of removal if she \u201chas not been convicted of an offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Section 1182(a)(2) </em>provides that an alien is \u201cineligible to be admitted to the United States\u201d if he has been convicted of certain listed crimes, including a crime involving moral turpitude. But the crime involving moral turpitude listed under this section is subject to a petit-offense exception, which provides that a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude does not render an alien inadmissible if (1) the alien has been convicted of a single crime; (2) the maximum penalty for the crime committed \u201c[does] not exceed imprisonment for one year\u201d; and (3) the alien \u201c[is] not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of 6 months.\u201d \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II). <em>Section 1227(a)(2) </em>provides that an alien \u201cin and admitted to the United States\u201d is deportable if he has been convicted of certain listed crimes, including a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed, but only if the crime is committed within five years after the date of admission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). And <em>\u00a7 1227(a)(3) </em>provides that an alien is deportable if he has been convicted of a failure to register or a falsification of certain entry documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">It is important to note that the cross-referenced sections \u2014 \u00a7 1182(a)(2), \u00a7 1227(a)(2), and \u00a7 1227(a)(3) \u2014 do not themselves criminalize any behavior. Rather, each lists offenses that produce various immigration consequences. For example, \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 provides that any alien who has been convicted of a qualifying crime involving moral turpitude during the specified five-year period faces the immigration consequence of <em>deportation. </em>Section 1229b(b)(1)(C), however, does not appear to import the time constraint or the immigration consequence of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) because \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) itself deals with its own consequence \u2014 the ineligibility for <em>cancellation of removal. </em>Thus, the provision appears to direct consideration of only <em>the offense </em>in the cross-referenced section. Moreover, because \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) addresses <em>both </em>admitted and unadmitted aliens alike, the fact that \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) renders deportable only an alien who has been admitted and only then if the alien committed the offense within a specified time period is irrelevant for purposes of describing crimes relevant to the availability of cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C). In short, \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) cross-references only <em>the offenses </em>that preclude cancellation of removal, not the <em>immigration consequences </em>that stem from those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">This construction is further indicated by the language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C)\u2019s surrounding provisions. Section 1229b(b)(2)(A)(iv) permits the Attorney General to cancel the removal of an inadmissible or deportable alien who has been battered by a spouse or parent of a U.S. citizen if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe alien <em>is not inadmissible </em>under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 1182(a) ... [and] <em>is not deportable </em>under paragraphs (1)(G) or (2) through (4) of section 1227(a).\u201d' (Emphasis added). Similarly, under the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B), any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the United States is deemed to end for purposes of \u00a7 1229b \u201cwhen the alien has committed an offense referred to in section 1182(a)(2) ... that <em>renders the alien mad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>missible </em>to the United States under section 1182(a)(2) <em>... or removable </em>from the United States under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4).\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, whereas \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A)(iv) and \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B) explicitly specify that the crimes listed in the cross-referenced statutes must render the specific alien in question inadmissible or deportable, \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) lacks such explicitness, cross-referencing only the crimes. Had-Congress wanted \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) to be interpreted in the same manner as \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A)(iv) and \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B), it would likely have used similar language. <em>See Cortez Canales, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 308 (concluding that the stop-time rule \u201cclearly evidences Congress\u2019 understanding of how to draft statutory language requiring an alien to be inadmissible or removable under a specific charge in section [1182] or [1227]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Hernandez maintains that if Congress had intended to cross-reference only the offenses listed in the cross-referenced sections and not their immigration consequences, it would have used the phrase \u201can offense referred to in,\u201d as it did in the stop-time rule, rather than the phrase \u201can offense under.\u201d Congress, however, \u201cis permitted to use synonyms in a statute.\u201d <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 664, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001); <em>see also; e.g., Moore v. Harris, </em>623 F.2d 908, 914 (4th Cir.1980) (\u201cInadvertent statutory usage of synonyms in parallel sections does not require us to conjure up a distinction which would violate the statute\u2019s raison d\u2019etre\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Accordingly, the most natural reading of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) is that a conviction for any offense listed in \u00a7 1182(a)(2), \u00a7 1227(a)(2), or \u00a7 1227(a)(3) renders an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal, regardless of the alien\u2019s status as an admitted or unadmitted alien. <em>Accord Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 649, 650 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that an unadmitted alien who was convicted of a crime of domestic violence \u2014 a conviction that renders an admitted alien deportable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2) but that does not render an unadmitted alien inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)\u2014was ineligible for cancellation of removal because \u201c[t]he plain language of \u00a7 1229b indicates that it should be read to cross-reference a list of offenses in three statutes, rather than the statutes as a whole\u201d); <em>see also Nino v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 691, 697-98 (5th Cir.2012) (rejecting an admitted alien\u2019s argument that a crime-involving-moral-turpitude offense is only \u201cunder\u201d \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) for purposes of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) if the conviction takes place within five years after the date of admission, and holding, that \u201cSection 1229b(b)(1)(C), without ambiguity, references Section 1227(a)(2) in order to identify the kinds of offenses that will make an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal\u201d). <em>But see Coyomani-Cielo v. Holder, </em>758 F.3d 908, 910-11 (7th Cir.2014) (holding that \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) is ambiguous because it \u201ceffectively says that the Attorney General may cancel removal for an <em>inadmissible </em>or <em>deportable </em>alien who has not been convicted of an offense under another provision of the statute that speaks explicitly, and only, in terms of <em>deportable </em>aliens\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">While our conclusion might not necessarily exclude some other possible interpretation, we need not resolve whether our reading of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) is the only possible reading of the statute because our reading is consistent with the construction adopted by the BIA in <em>Cortez Canales. See </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 307 (\u201c[I]n determining which offenses are \u2018described under\u2019 sections [1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), and 1227(a)(3) ] for purposes of section [1229b(b)(1)(C) ], only language specifically pertaining to the criminal offense, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the offense itself and the sentence imposed or potentially imposed, should be considered. That is, ... the statutory language of sections [1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), and 1227(a)(3) ] pertaining only to aspects of immigration law, such as the requirement that the alien\u2019s crime be committed \u201cwithin five years ... after the date of admission,\u2019 is not considered.\u201d (second alteration in original)). Thus, for the same reasons we have given for our reading of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), we conclude that the BIA\u2019s reading is patently reasonable and therefore entitled to deference. <em>Accord Coyomani-Cielo, </em>758 F.3d at 915 (holding that <em>Cortez Canales </em>is a reasonable construction of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) because \u201c[i]t is a sensible way (and perhaps the only way) to give effect to each word of [\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We find Hernandez\u2019s various arguments against affording <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s construction unpersuasive. First, she notes that \u201c[c]anons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings unless the context dictates otherwise,\u201d <em>United States v. Urban, </em>140 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. 6109 Grubb Road, </em>886 F.2d 618, 626 (3d Cir.1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted), and therefore she maintains that \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)\u2019s statutory language permitting cancellation of removal of \u201can alien who is inadmissible <em>or </em>deportable from the United States\u201d must be read disjunctively, such that \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d are given separate meanings. She argues that this is especially so because \u201c[t]he distinction between exclusion and deportation has long been recognized in immigration law.\u201d But the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) does not obliterate the distinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens. Rather, it provides that any alien who meets the criteria for <em>either </em>inadmissibility <em>or </em>deportability, as those terms are used throughout the Immigration and Nationality Act, is ineligible for cancellation of removal if he has \u201cbeen convicted of an offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3).\u201d Thus, the use of the disjunctive defines the class of aliens to which \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) is applicable, referring to both inadmissible and deportable aliens and treating them alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Second, relying on <em>Reyes v. Holder, </em>714 F.3d 731 (2d Cir.2013), Hernandez contends that by using the terms \u201cinadmissible\u201d and \u201cdeportable\u201d in \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), Congress \u201cdemonstrate[d] that an applicant\u2019s admission status is critical when determining an alien\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal.\u201d In <em>Reyes, </em>an unadmitted alien sought \u201cspecial rule cancellation of removal,\u201d 714 F.3d at 732, which permits the Attorney General to cancel the removal of qualified aliens from specific countries as long as they are not \u201cinadmissible under section [1182(a)(2)-(3) ] or deportable under section [1227(a)(2)-(4) ],\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.66(b)(1). The Second Circuit held that the alien\u2019s conviction of \u201cmenacing in the second degree\u201d did not render him ineligible for discretionary relief; even though it was listed among the offenses that would render an admitted alien deportable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2), because the offense was not listed in \u00a7 1182(a). <em>Reyes, </em>714 F.3d at 737. Hernandez\u2019s reliance, on <em>Reyes, </em>however, is misplaced because the language of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) differs substantially from the language of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.66(b)(1), which mirrors the structure of \u00a7 1229b(b)(2)(A)(iv) and \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(B). <em>Accord Coyomani-Cielo, </em>758 F.3d at 913-14. And the <em>Reyes </em>court recognized as much, specifically distinguishing <em>Cortez Canales </em>on that ground. <em>Reyes, </em>714 F.3d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Third, Hernandez argues that the BIA\u2019s construction requires rewriting the statute to read that an alien is ineligible for cancellation of removal if he has \u201cbeen convicted of an offense <em>[described </em>] under \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3).\u201d But an offense can only be \u201cunder\u201d one of the cross-referenced statutes if it is described or listed therein, as those statutes are not themselves criminal statutes. Indeed, it is Hernandez who would rewrite the statute so as to read, \u201cThe Attorney General may cancel removal of ... an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien ... has not been convicted of an offense <em>[rendering the alien inadmissible </em>] under section 1182(a)(2) <em>[or deportable </em>under sections] 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Fourth, Hernandez argues that the BIA\u2019s construction \u201cleads to the bizarre result that those who may have a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude in another country prior to being admitted to the United States may be barred from ever applying for cancellation of removal before they have even stepped foot in the United States.\u201d But this result is not bizarre, especially because \u00a7 1182(a)(2) itself provides that any alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, as qualified therein, is ineligible to be admitted to the United States. And even if this result were bizarre, it is not for this court to criticize Congress\u2019 policy choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Fifth, Hernandez argues that <em>Cortez Canales </em>is inconsistent with the BIA\u2019s earlier rulings in <em>Matter of Garcia-Hemandez, </em>23 I &amp; N. Dec. 590, 592-93 (2003), and <em>Matter of Gonzalez-Silva, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 218, 220 (2007), in which the BIA held, respectively, that an offense is not under \u00a7 1182(a)(2) if it is covered by the petit-offense exception and that an offense is not under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) if it preceded that section\u2019s effective date. But this argument is no more than a disagreement with the way that the BIA distinguished those cases in <em>Cortez Canales </em>itself. As to <em>Garciar-Hernandez, </em>the BIA explained that the petitoffense exception contains language pertaining to \u201cthe sentence imposed or potentially imposed\u201d and that such language must be considered because it \u201cspecifically pertain[s] to the criminal offense.\u201d <em>Cortez Canales, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 307. And with respect to <em>Gonzalez-Silva, </em>the BIA explained that \u201cCongress expressly stated that section [1227(a)(2)(E)(i) ] applies only to those convictions occurring after ... September 30, 1996,\u201d and that the BIA was bound to defer to \u201cthis express statement of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. We conclude that the BIA\u2019s reasons. are not unprincipled.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Sixth and finally, Hernandez argues that the court must not give \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) \u201ca more expansive interpretation that restricts eligibility for relief to aliens facing deportation\u201d because \u201cthe rule of lenity stands for the proposition that ambiguities in deportation statutes should be construed in favor of the noncitizen,\u201d <em>Hosh v. Lucero, </em>680 F.3d 375, 383 (4th Cir.2012). But because \u201c[t]he rule of lenity is a last resort, not a primary tool of construction,\u201d <em>id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Ehsan, </em>163 F.3d 855, 858 (4th Cir.1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted), it applies only where \u201cthere is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 138-39, </em>118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998)) (internal quotation \u25a0 marks omitted). Where, as here, the ambiguity is not grievous, courts must defer to the BIA\u2019s construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In sum, we hold that Hernandez is ineligible for cancellation of removal by virtue of having \u201cbeen convicted of an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>under ... \u00a7 1227(a)(2),\u201d a crime involving moral turpitude, punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for one year or longer. We thus affirm the decision of the BIA and deny Hernandez\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
