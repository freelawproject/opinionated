He now challenges his sentence, specifically the 16-level enhancement that was applied pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) for prior conviction of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We hold that under North Carolina law a conviction for second-degree kidnapping does constitute a crime of violence, and thus affirm FloresGranados\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Marlon Flores-Granados is a native, and citizen of Honduras. On August 13, 2006 he was arrested and charged with second-degree kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious bodily injury, and other state charges. He was convicted in February, 2007 of two counts of second-degree kidnapping in violation of North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 14-39 and sentenced to 25-39 months of confinement and probation. In March of 2007, he was removed from the United States to Honduras by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Flores-Granados reentered the United States illegally at some point prior to August 5, 2013, when he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance and assault and battery in Virginia Beach, VA. He was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with Reentry of a Deported Alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Flores-Granados\u2019 presentence investigation report initially recommended an 8-level enhancement for a previous conviction for an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Following an objection by the government, the probation office agreed that Flores-Granados\u2019 prior conviction for second-degree kidnapping in North Carolina qualified as a prior conviction for a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) and thus a 16-level enhancement should be applied instead. With the additional enhancement, Flores-Granados had an Offense Level Total of 21 and a Criminal History Category of IV generating a recommended Guidelines Range of 57-71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the presentence investigation report, noting that the defendant objected to the 16-level enhancement, and wanted only the 8-level enhancement instead. After argument from both parties, the district judge agreed with the government that the 16-level enhancement was proper, finding that defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 14-39 for second-degree kidnapping was in fact a crime of violence under the Guidelines. The court stated that: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">[T]he Court should not simply accept the 16-point enhancement based upon the title of the prior conviction. However, in this case the record reflects that he threatened the victim with having a gun, broke into her apartment in the middle of the night while she was asleep, told her he had a gun, and then stabbed her with a screwdriver, and I think that qualifies as the type of violent conduct which justifies the 16-point enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ment. The Court is not relying simply on the fact that he was convicted of second-degree kidnapping, but those facts suggest the violence of his conduct in the course of the kidnapping. He also has a number of other convictions for violent conduct, mostly against the same person. But, again, he became involved in violent conduct very recently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">J.A. 68-69. After considering the Guidelines calculations and the sentencing factors laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court sentenced Flores-Granados to 57 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant who \u201cpreviously was deported\u201d after a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d- and unlawfully returned to the United States is subject to an enhancement of either 12 or 16 levels depending on whether the conviction receives criminal history \u2018 points. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The application notes define a crime of violence as any of a list of enumerated offenses, including \u201ckidnapping,\u201d or \u201cany other offense ... that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 Application Notes 1(B)(iii). Flores-Granados contends on appeal that the district court erred in finding his prior conviction in North Carolina qualified as a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines. Whether a prior conviction should be considered a crime of violence is a question of law and we review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jenkins, </em>631 F.3d 680; 682 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Even though the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), focused on whether a conviction qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) we \u201capply its analysis to the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 definition [under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) ] as well.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>687 F.3d 188, 190 n. 3 (4th Cir.2012); <em>see also United States v. King, </em>673 F.3d 274, 279 n. 3 (4th Cir.2012). We \u201crely on precedents evaluating whether an offense constitutes a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Guidelines interchangeably with precedents evaluating whether an offense constitutes a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA because the two terms have been defined in a manner that is \u2018substantively identical.\u2019 \u201d <em>King, </em>673 F.3d at 279 n. 3 (quoting <em>United States v. Jarmon, </em>596 F.3d 228, 231 n. * (4th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">When considering whether a predicate state crime constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we examine the elements of the offense using the categorical approach laid out in <em>Taylor. See </em>495 U.S. at 598-602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). In <em>Taylor, </em>the Supreme Court found that with regard to prior crimes enumerated in a sentencing enhancement statute, Congress intended to refer to \u201cthe generic, contemporary meaning\u201d of the crime. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Such meaning, the Court explained, can be divined from \u201cthe generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">We begin with the fact that kidnapping is an enumerated offense included by the Sentencing Commission in the definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Thus, if we find that the North Carolina statute falls within the generic definition of kidnapping, we need not look to the residual clause as to whether \u201cuse of force\u201d is an element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>crime. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) Application Notes 1(B)(iii). The label of kidnapping used by North Carolina with regard to Flores-Granados\u2019 prior conviction is only the start of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Under the categorical approach, the court must identify the generic contemporary meaning of the enumerated crime. <em>See United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>737 F.3d 950, 952 (4th Cir.2013). We then compare that definition to the state statute under which defendant was previously convicted. <em>Id. </em>If the defendant was previously convicted \u201cin a State where the generic definition has been adopted\u201d or where the \u201cstate statute is narrower than the generic view\u201d then \u201cthere is no problem\u201d because in both cases \u201cthe conviction necessarily implies that the defendant has been found guilty of all the elements of [the] generic [crime].\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. However, if the state statute \u201ccriminalize^ a broader scope of conduct than the Guideline crime [then it] is not categorically a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Perez-Perez, </em>737 F.3d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Under the categorical approach, \u201cthe sentencing court ... must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses\u201d and may not look \u201cto the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>see also Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). A modified categorical approach may be used in cases where the state statute under which the defendant was previously convicted \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative,\u201d but not where the statute is \u201cindivisible.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281. Moreover, even under the modified categorical approach, the later court is \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The judge may not consider \u201cpolice reports or complaint applications.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The district court thus erred in referencing the facts of Flores-Granados\u2019 pri- or kidnapping conviction. <em>See </em>J.A. 68-69 (\u201c[H]e ... broke into her apartment in the middle of the night while she was asleep, told her he had a gun, and then stabbed her with a screwdriver, and I think that qualifies as the type of violent conduct which justifies the 16-point enhancement.\u201d). Although the statute\u2019s elements are divisible, there are no Shepard-approved documents present in the record. A police report, untested and unproven, is not a legitimate source of factual information for courts to rely on even under the modified categorical approach of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Shepard. See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Here the court was limited to the categorical approach: whether the elements of the statute render it categorically a crime of violence. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">The trial court\u2019s error does not, however, resolve the appeal. We are \u201centitled to affirm on any ground appearing in the record, including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court.\u201d <em>Scott v. United States, </em>328 F.3d 132, 137 (4th Cir.2003). The government contends that although the district court did commit error in relying on facts from the police report, the 16-level enhancement was proper nonetheless. We agree that under the categorical approach, Flores-Grana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>dos\u2019 kidnapping conviction qualifies as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">As noted, the categorical approach requires us to compare the North Carolina statute under which Flores-Granados was convicted with the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the enumerated crime, here kidnapping. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The North Carolina statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">(a) Any person who shall unlawfully conf\u00edne, restrain, or remove from one place to another, any other person 16 years of age or over without consent of such person, or any other person under the age of 16 years without the consent of a parent or legal custodian of such person, shall be guilty of kidnapping if such confinement, restraint or removal is for the purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(1) Holding such other person for a ransom or as a hostage or using such other person as a shield; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">(2) Facilitating the commission of any felony or facilitating flight of any person following the commission of a felony; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">(3) Doing serious bodily harm to or terrorizing the person so confined, restrained or removed or any other person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">(4) Holding such other person in involuntary servitude in violation of [N.C. Gen.Stat.] 14-43.12 ... <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">(b) There shall be two degrees of kidnapping as defined by subsection (a). If the person kidnapped either was not released by the defendant in a safe place or had been seriously injured or sexually assaulted, the offense is kidnapping in the first degree ... If the person kidnapped was released in a safe place by the defendant and had not been seriously injured or sexually assaulted, the offense is kidnapping in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-39(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">Because the government offers no <em>Shepard-approved </em>documents, the court must assume that the prior conviction was based on the least serious of the acts covered by the state statute. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 137, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). As explained by the Supreme Court of North Carolina, under N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-39, \u201ckidnapping can be just as effectively accomplished by fraudulent means as by the use of force, threats, or intimidation.\u201d <em>State v. Sturdivant, </em>304 N.C. 293, 283 S.E.2d 719, 729 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">Where \u201cthe statutory definition of the prior offense has been interpreted by the state\u2019s highest court, that interpretation constrains our analysis of the elements of state law.\u201d <em>United States v. Aparicio-Soria, </em>740 F.3d 152, 154 (4th Cir.2014) (en banc) (citing <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265). The North Carolina Supreme Court has found that the \u201cessence of any kidnapping offense is the unlawful confinement, restraint or removal of a human being for a certain proscribed purpose.\u201d <em>Sturdivant, </em>283 S.E.2d at 728. Under state law, the \u201cdifference between kidnapping and the lesser includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ed offense of false imprisonment is the purpose of the confinement, restraint, or removal of another person.\u201d <em>State v. Pigott, </em>331 N.C. 199, 415 S.E.2d 555, 562 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The North Carolina Supreme Court has \u201cspecifically rejected the notion that \u2018confinement\u2019 or \u2018restraint\u2019, as used in [\u00a7 1439], means confinement or restraint \u2018for a substantial period\u2019 and that \u2018removal,\u2019 as used in [\u00a7 14-39], requires a movement \u2018for a substantial distance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Surrett, </em>109 N.C.App. 344, 427 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Fulcher, </em>294 N.C. 503, 243 S.E.2d 338, 351 (1978)). In \u201cdetermining whether the crime of kidnapping has been committed,\u201d the Supreme Court explained, \u201cit was clearly the intent of the Legislature to make resort to a tape measure or a stop watch unnecessary.\u201d <em>Fulcher, </em>243 S.E.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Given these constraints, Flores-Granados argues that North Carolina\u2019s statute sweeps more broadly than the generic definition of kidnapping because it can be accomplished by fraud or trickery alone and it does not include as an element \u201csubstantial interference with the victim\u2019s liberty\u201d or \u201ccircumstances exposing the victim to substantial risk of bodily injury or confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 5-6 (quoting <em>United States v. Najera-Mendoza, </em>683 F.3d 627, 630 (5th Cir.2012)). We agree that there is a danger in defining crimes of violence so broadly that they improperly sweep in convictions for prior nonviolent conduct. Here, however, the North Carolina statute is well within, the generic definition of kidnapping and is thus a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The elements necessary to the generic definition of kidnapping present a question of first impression for this circuit. There is \u201cno uniformly accepted meaning of any of the listed crimes [as] a consequence of the federalism principles that have shaped criminal law in the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d 870, 874 (D.C.Cir.2009). Nearly every state kidnapping statute and the Model Penal Code (MPC) includes a requirement of restraint or confinement of the victim and the employment of unlawful means, often defined as \u201cby force, threat or deception, or in the case of [a minor or incompetent individual] without the consent of a parent [or] guardian.\u201d MODEL PENAL CODE \u00a7 212.1; <em>see also De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d at 876 (noting that pursuant to 50-state survey the generic definition of kidnapping must include \u201c(1) an act of restraining, removing, or confining another; and (2) an unlawful means of accomplishing that act\u201d). Any generic definition must include these two elements. The parties here dispute, however, which additional aggravating factors, if any, are required beyond this baseline definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">To determine which aggravating elements must be included for a statute to fall within \u201cthe generic sense in which the term [kidnapping] is now used in the criminal codes of most States,\u201d we draw upon commonalities amongst the MPC, the laws of the states, as well as the examples of our sister circuits. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">For the following reasons, we think it is plain that some additional element of severity is necessary to distinguish kidnapping from its lesser-included offenses., In considering the statutes of the fifty states and the District of Columbia as well as the Model Penal Code, we conclude that the best characterization of generic kidnapping is (1) unlawful restraint or confinement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the victim, (2) by force, threat or deception, or in the case of a minor or incompetent individual without the consent of a parent or guardian, (3) either for a specific nefarious purpose or with a similar element of heightened intent, <em>or </em>(4) in a manner that constitutes a substantial interference with the victim\u2019s liberty. Here, because the North Carolina statute requires a specific nefarious purpose for conviction, even for second-degree kidnapping, it is well within this definition and as such, it is categorically a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We start with the MPC\u2019s definition of kidnapping, which requires unlawful removal of an individual \u201cfrom his place of residence or business, or a substantial distance from the vicinity where he is found,\u201d or unlawful confinement \u201cfor a substantial period in a place of isolation\u201d for one of four specific purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">(a) to hold for ransom or reward, or as a shield or hostage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">(b) to facilitate commission of any felony or flight thereafter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">(c) to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim or another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">(d) to interfere with the performance of any governmental or political function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Model Penal Code \u00a7 212.1. Removal or confinement is unlawful where \u201cit is accomplished by force, threat or deception, or in the case of a person who is [younger than] 14 or incompetent, if it is accomplished without consent\u201d of a parent or guardian. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the MPC has as aggravating elements both confinement for a specific nefarious purpose and an element of substantiality, in addition to unlawful restraint or removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">However, while it provides a useful guide, the Model Penal Code \u201cis not the exclusive standard by which we define the terms used in the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d 310, 317 (5th Cir.2007). We also review other states\u2019 kidnapping statutes for common elements. Many states separate the elements for first and second degree, or simple and aggravated kidnapping. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 135.00, 135.20, 135.25; Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 20.01, 20.03, 20.04. Our inquiry is not limited by degree, however, and \u201cwe look to all offenses termed kidnapping by the various criminal codes.\u201d <em>De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d at 876. The task before us is merely to \u201cemploy a common-sense approach\u201d in order to \u201cascertain the contemporary meaning.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Ramirez, 477 </em>F.3d at 316. We are \u201cnot required to apply the most nuanced, restrictive, or cutting-edge interpretation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">We agree with the District of Columbia circuit that the most common approach \u201crequires some kind of heightened intent beyond the mere intent to restrain the victim\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d at 877; <em>see also, United States v. Gonzalez-Perez, </em>472 F.3d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir.2007) (Because the \u201cFlorida false imprisonment statute contains no nefarious purpose element whatsoever ... [it] does not conform to the generic, contemporary definition of kidnapping.\u201d). Much like the MPC, twenty-one state statutes, including North Carolina\u2019s, define kidnapping as unlawful removal or confinement for a specific nefarious purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Six additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>states include some element of heightened intent but do not specifically use the nefarious purposes construct of the MPC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Fifteen states include a nefarious purpose requirement but only as a .disjunctive element in conjunction with other alternative elements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, many states use the nefarious purposes to distinguish between degrees of kidnapping. <em>Compare </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-43 (first degree kidnapping requires nefarious purpose), <em>with </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-6-44 (second degree kidnapping does not). Only eight states and the District of Columbia do not include a heightened intent element at all: four of those states require some additional element of added severity,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> such as requiring the perpetrator to move the victim for the crime' to be considered kidnapping, and four states and the District of Columbia require nothing more than the intentional and unlawful restraint of the victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The enumerated nefarious purposes required by North Carolina are well within the heartland of generic kidnapping. The statute requires the perpetrator to specifically intend a heinous criminal act \u2014 the worst of the worst \u2014 abduction or restraint of victims for ransom or to further the commission of a felony, to terrorize victims or cause them bodily injury, or to hold them in involuntary servitude. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-39(a). It would be astonishing if restraint or removal of a victim for one of these nefarious purposes failed to constitute \u25a0 generic kidnapping. The North Carolina statute is not loosely or nebulously written nor does it broadly sweep in conduct not related to the above nefarious aims. We find it hard to conceive that a statute that requires the perpetrator to intend to engage in such specific egregious behavior might be too wide-ranging to be within the generic definition of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Flores-Granados takes issue with the fact that North Carolina\u2019s specific purposes do not track exactly the specific nefarious purposes of the MPC. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 910. However, the categorical approach does not require us to match up the language word for word between the statute and the generic definition. <em>Taylor </em>requires only that the statutory definition \u201csubstantially corresponds\u201d with the generic enumerated crime to be considered a crime of violence. 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Further, we consider whether there is \u201ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>683 (2007). Although it may not be a perfect match, the North Carolina statute is narrowly drawn and enumerates specific and serious crimes. We do not think it a realistic probability that convictions under the statute would sweep too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Flores-Granados argues, however, that the generic definition must also, as the MPC does, encompass elements that embody a substantiality requirement in addition to any heightened intent requirement. We disagree. While a substantiality element may be sufficient to render a statute within the generic definition of kidnapping where it is the only additional aggravating factor, it is not necessary where the law includes specific nefarious purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Twenty states do include a substantiality requirement, most commonly that the perpetrator must \u201crestrict [the victim\u2019s] movement in such a manner as to interfere substantially with the person\u2019s liberty,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but a majority of states do not. <em>See, e.g., </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 707-700 (definitions of terms in kidnapping and other criminal statutes), -720. Furthermore, of the minority of states that do have a substantiality requirement, significantly, only eleven are states in which both a specific nefarious purpose and a requirement of substantiality are mandatory for the offense to qualify as kidnapping.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we think, that where nefarious purposes are required \u2014 as they are here' \u2014 additional aggravating elements, such as substantiality, are not necessary for the statute to be within the generic definition of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The defendant relies on Fifth Circuit precedents that rejected the assertion that \u201ca specified purpose or intent is required for a state kidnapping conviction to constitute a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d at 318. Those cases, defendant argues, demonstrate that where proof of \u201csubstantial interference with the victim\u2019s liberty\u201d or \u201ccircumstances exposing the victim to substantial risk of bodily injury, or confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude\u201d is not required, a kidnapping statute is too broad to be considered within 'the generic definition. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 452-56 (5th Cir.2008). However, none of the statutes at issue in these cases included as an element the nefarious purposes required here by North Carolina. Thus, the court had to rely on whether each statute included a substantiality requirement to determine if it was too broad to be within the generic definition of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s view, the Fifth Circuit cases fit nicely with our holding today. In <em>United States v. Cervantes-Bianco, </em>the Colorado statute, unlike North Carolina\u2019s, required no additional aggrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ting factors beyond unlawful restraint by force, threat or fraud. <em>See </em>504 F.3d 576, 586 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe question therefore becomes whether a statute that contains only [the elements of removal or confinement by force, threat, or fraud] and lacks any additional aggravating elements, such as the specified purpose requirements of the MPC definition, qualifies [as a crime of violence].\u201d); <em>see also Najera-Mendoza, </em>683 F.3d at 630. Similarly in <em>MorenoFlorean, </em>that court found that \u201c[a] two-element definition of kidnapping would sweep more broadly than the generic, contemporary meaning of [kidnapping.]\u201d 542 F.3d at 454. Again, North Carolina\u2019s is not a bare, two-element statute. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s generic definition of kidnapping coincides with this explanation as well. <em>See United States v. Soto-Sanchez, </em>623 F.3d 317, 322-24 (6th Cir.2010) (finding the statute overly broad where only \u201cforcible confinement of the victim [is] sufficient for a charge of kidnapping\u201d without additional aggravating elements).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In addition, in <em>Gonzalez-Ramirez </em>and <em>Iniguez-Barba, </em>the court held only that a substantiality requirement was sufficient for a statute to be narrower than the generic definition of kidnapping, not that it was necessary. <em>See Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d at 319 (\u201cTennessee\u2019s kidnapping statute is ... at least as restrictive, if not more restrictive, than a majority of state kidnapping statutes.\u201d); <em>United States v. Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d 790, 792-93 (5th Cir.2007) (finding that while specific purposes are not necessary, \u201cthe additional aggravating elements of substantial risk of injury or confinement as a condition of servitude\u201d are sufficient for the New York kidnapping statute to be within the generic definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Our holding is thus consistent with those of other circuits. At least one aggravator is required. But where an element of substantiality is present, the nefarious purposes may not be necessary. <em>See Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d at 319; <em>Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d at 792. And this conclusion holds equally true in the inverse. Where a nefarious purpose or similar heightened intent requirement is present as an element, substantiality need not be required. <em>See De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d at 877; <em>Gonzalez-Perez, </em>472 F.3d at 1161. To be within generic kidnapping, in addition to unlawful restraint by force, threat or fraud, a statute must contain as an element an additional aggravating factor such as nefarious purposes or substantial interference with the victim\u2019s liberty, but need not require both.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The laws of the states support this conclusion. Thirty state statutes include either a substantiality component or specific nefarious purposes as elements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Eleven and the MPC include both.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>six states include as a requirement an element of heightened intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Only four states and the District of Columbia include no additional aggravating factors<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 and at least two of those state statutes have been found to sweep broadly enough to be outside the generic definition. <em>See Najerar-Mendoza, </em>683 F.3d at 630 (finding conviction under Oklahoma statute not within generic definition); <em>De Jesus Ventura, </em>565 F.3d at 877 (finding Virginia statute outlaws conduct bro\u00e1der than generic definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We do not suggest the approach we have taken here is the only way to characterize the nature of a predicate offense. Because this is a sentencing procedure, no mechanical exercise can ever fully supplant the common sense and good judgment of the sentencing judge. A \u201csimple strategy of \u2018counting noses\u2019 will [not] control the outcome of the categorical approach in all cases for all crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Rangel-Castaneda, </em>709 F.3d 373, 379 (4th Cir.2013). The greater the variations in state statutes, moreover, the more difficult a single paradigmatic act may be to find. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cOur federal system allows the various states to define offenses as they see fit, unencumbered by overly stringent federal sentencing standards. That is precisely why \u2018minor variations in terminology\u2019 must be respected.\u201d (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143)). In this case, our review of state laws has served to identify the North Carolina act as a mainstream statute, not an outlier. Because it is limited to conduct for a specific nefarious purpose, it proscribes criminal activity that is well within the generic definition of kidnapping and thus constitutes a crime of violence. Put simply, the statute is what we mean when we say \u201ckidnapping.\u201d As such, the addition , of a 16-level enhancement to Flores-Granados\u2019 sentence for reentry after a prior conviction for a crime of violence was proper and the judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">. We consider the statute as it was enacted at the time of Flores-Granados\u2019 conviction. Subsequent to his conviction, North Carolina amended the statute to include two additional purposes regarding holding persons in sexual servitude and trafficking of persons with the intent to hold such persons in involuntary or sexual servitude. In any event, because they merely add possible specific purposes in the alternative, the analysis before this court is unaltered. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14\u201439(a)(5)\u2014(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\">. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat.
