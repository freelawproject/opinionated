(collectively, \u201cESPN\u201d), asserting state-law tort claims related to ESPN\u2019s re-telecast of his wrestling performances. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that the Copyright Act preempts Ray\u2019s claims and therefore dismissed Ray\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-15\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-16\">Ray wrestled professionally in the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) from 1990 to 1994. He alleges that he wrestled in the UWF for pecuniary gain and that \u201c[e]ach [of his] match[es] was filmed for future use to generate revenue.\u201d Ray specifically agreed with a representative of the UWF that the films would be \u201csold and used.\u201d Since his retirement from the UWF in 1994, Ray has, among other things, promoted healthcare products and weightlifting supplements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-17\">According to Ray, ESPN has obtained certain films of his wrestling matches and re-telecast them throughout North America and Europe without first obtaining his \u201cconsent to use [his] identity, likeness, name, nick name, or personality to depict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>him in any way.\u201d Ray does not allege, however, that ESPN obtained the films unlawfully. Because of ESPN\u2019s alleged actions, Ray filed suit against ESPN in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, asserting four claims under Missouri state law: (1) invasion of privacy, (2) misappropriation of name, (3) infringement of the right of publicity, and (4) interference with prospective economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">ESPN removed the case to federal court. ESPN then moved to dismiss the entire case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds that the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq., </em>preempts Ray\u2019s claims. In analyzing ESPN\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court correctly noted at the outset of its opinion that Ray\u2019s first two claims \u2014 invasion of privacy and misappropriation of name \u2014 allege the same tort under Missouri law. <em>See Nemani v. St. Louis Univ., </em>33 S.W.3d 184, 185 (Mo.2000) (en banc) (citation omitted). The court also noted that Ray did not challenge ESPN\u2019s contention that the Copyright Act preempts Ray\u2019s claims for invasion of privacy and interference with prospective advantage; therefore, the court assumed these claims were waived. <em>See Crossett Paper Mills Emps. Fed. Credit Union v. Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y, Inc., </em>476 F.3d 578, 580 n. 2 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The court ultimately held that the Copyright Act preempts Ray\u2019s claims. In so holding, the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-6\">[Ray\u2019s] wrestling performances were part of the copyrighted material, and his likenesses could not be detached from the copyrighted performances that were contained in the films.... [Ray] has not alleged that his name and likeness were used to promote or endorse any type of commercial product. Rather, [Ray] complains about ESPN airing wrestling performances that have been captured on video. Thus, [Ray\u2019s] complaints are based solely on ESPN airing video recordings depicting him in a \u201cwork of authorship,\u201d which is plainly encompassed by copyright law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-9\">On appeal, Ray argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims as preempted under the Copyright Act. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Rochling v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>725 F.3d 927, 930 (8th Cir.2013) (citation omitted). In so doing, we assume \u201call facts in the complaint to be true and construe[ ] all reasonable inferences from those facts most favorably to the complainant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">The Copyright Act will preempt Ray\u2019s state-law claims if the following two conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-11\">(1) the work at issue is within the subject matter of copyright as defined in \u00a7 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act, and (2) the state law created right is equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified in \u00a7 106 [of the Copyright Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-13\"><em>Nat\u2019l Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Computer Assocs. Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>991 F.2d 426, 428 (8th Cir.1993) (citation and footnote omitted); <em>see also </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). We analyze each of these two conditions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-14\">A. <em>Subject Matter of Copyright</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-15\">The Copyright Act defines the subject matter of copyright generally as \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression ... from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). \u201cWorks of authorship\u201d include \u201cmotion pictures and other audiovisual works.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 102(a)(6). \u201cA work is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>\u2018fixed\u2019 in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord ... is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">The filming of Ray\u2019s wrestling performances clearly generated an \u201coriginal work[ ] of authorship,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 102(a), that was \u201c \u2018fixed\u2019 in a tangible medium of expression\u201d and could be \u201cperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 101. The films, therefore, are within the subject matter of copyright law. <em>Id.; see also Nat\u2019l Basketball Ass\u2019n v. Motorola, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 841, 848 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cWe hold that where the challenged ... misappropriation relates in part to the copyrighted broadcasts of [basketball] games, the subject matter requirement is met as to both the broadcasts and the [basketball] games.\u201d); <em>Balt. Orioles, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass\u2019n, </em>805 F.2d 663, 674 (7th Cir.1986) (\u201c[T]elecasts [of baseball games] are ... within the subject matter of copyright.\u201d); <em>Somerson v. McMahon, </em>956 F.Supp.2d 1345, 1353-54 (N.D.Ga.2012) (holding that \u201cthe video recordings of plaintiffs wrestling activities fall within the subject matter of copyright\u201d and that \u201cthe broadcast or recording of the wrestling match is the subject of copyright protection\u201d); <em>Blood v. Titan Sports, Inc., </em>No. 3:94-CV-307-P, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24485, at *33-*34 (W.D.N.C. May 13, 1997) (holding that the Copyright Act preempted wrestler\u2019s state-law claims for damages arising from the reproduction and distribution of films of his wrestling performances).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Ray nevertheless argues that his claims are not within the subject matter or ambit of the Copyright Act because ESPN\u2019s alleged use of his \u201clikeness\u201d is the true \u201cfocal point of this case.\u201d In support of his argument, he cites factually distinguishable or inapposite authority, including <em>Downing v. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>265 F.3d 994 (9th Cir.2001), and <em>Brown v. Ames, </em>201 F.3d 654 (5th Cir.2000), in which courts found that the Copyright Act did not preempt certain state-law misappropriation or right-of-publicity claims. In <em>Downing, </em>the defendant-retailer published a photograph of the surfer-plaintiffs without their permission in the defendant\u2019s catalog to promote the defendant\u2019s products as part of its surf-themed advertising campaign. 265 F.3d at 1000. The defendant also created and sold t-shirts exactly like those the plaintiffs wore in the photograph. <em>Id. </em>As the court noted, \u201cit [was], not the publication of the photograph itself ... that [was] the basis for [the plaintiffs\u2019] claims, but rather, it [was] the use of the [the plaintiffs\u2019] likenesses and their names pictured in ' the published photograph.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003. Indeed, as the court later added, the defendant \u201cwent well beyond mere republication of the photograph\u201d and, among other things, \u201csuggested that the surfers had endorsed\u201d the defendant\u2019s products. <em>Laws v. Sony Music Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>448 F.3d 1134, 1141 (9th Cir.2006) (referring to <em>Downing). </em>Similarly, the defendants in <em>Brown </em>used the musician-plaintiffs\u2019 names and likenesses to sell \u201ccassettes and CD\u2019s,\u201d \u201cmusic catalogs,\u201d \u201cposters,\u201d and \u201cvideotapes,\u201d 201 F.3d at 656-57, even though the defendants \u201clacked copyrights\u201d and had received no authorization from the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 656. Notably, the court in <em>Brown </em>specifically distinguished <em>Baltimore Orioles </em>\u2014 and in so doing, distinguished this case as well \u2014 on the grounds that \u201cthe right of publicity claimed\u201d by the plaintiffs in <em>Baltimore Orioles </em>\u201cwas essentially a right to prevent rebroadcast of games whose broadcast rights were already owned by\u201d other parties. <em>Id. </em>at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>Neither <em>Downing </em>nor <em>Brown </em>involved an attempt to merely \u201cprevent rebroadcast\u201d of a copyrighted film' \u2014 unlike this case. ESPN did not use Ray\u2019s likeness or name in an advertisement without his permission to promote its commercial products, and, as the district court correctly noted, Ray\u2019s \u201clikenesses could not be detached from the copyrighted performances that were contained in. the films.\u201d Consequently, Ray\u2019s attempts on appeal to recast his claims to evade copyright preemption are unavailing. <em>See also No Doubt v. Activision Publ\u2019g, Inc., </em>702 F.Supp.2d 1139, 1144 (C.D.Cal.2010) (\u201cA claim asserted to prevent nothing more than the reproduction, performance, distribution, or display of a dramatic performance captured on film is subsumed by copyright law and preempted.\u201d (quotation and citation omitted)); <em>Fleet v. CBS, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1911, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 645, 651 (1996) (\u201c[I]t was not merely appellants\u2019 likenesses which were captured on film \u2014 it was their dramatic performances which are ... copyrightable. An actor who wishes to protect the use of the image contained in a single, fixed dramatic performance need simply retain the copyright.\u201d); 1 Melville B. Nimmer <em>&amp; </em>David Nimmer, <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 1.01[B][3][b][iv][II] (2014) (noting that when a performer collaborates in creating a copyrighted work, the performer is barred from \u201cusing the right of publicity to squelch exploitation of that copyrighted work for its intended purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">B. <em>Equivalence of State Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKq-\">The Copyright Act gives copyright owners \u201cexclusive rights to do and to authorize,\u201d among other things, the reproduction of \u201cthe copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords\u201d; the preparation of \u201cderivative works based upon the copyrighted work\u201d; the distribution of \u201ccopies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending\u201d; and the display of certain \u201ccopyrighted work publicly.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">As discussed above, the crux of Ray\u2019s case is that ESPN re-telecast Ray\u2019s filmed performances. Thus, because Ray\u2019s state-law rights have been \u201c \u2018infringed by the mere act of reproduction, performance, distribution or display\u2019 \u201d of his performances, his state-law rights are equivalent to the exclusive rights \u201c \u2018within the general scope of copyright.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Car Rental Sys., </em>991 F.2d at 431 (quoting 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 1.01[B][1]); <em>see also Laws, </em>448 F.3d at 1143 (holding that the Copyright Act preempted a plaintiffs right-of-publicity claim based on the reproduction of a voice recording); <em>Balt. Orioles, </em>805 F.2d at 677 (\u201c[A] right in a work that is conferred by state law is equivalent to the right to perform a telecast of that work if the state-law right is infringed merely by broadcasting the work.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">After having thoroughly reviewed all of Ray\u2019s arguments on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ray\u2019s state-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>claims as preempted under the Copyright Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1159-18\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">. In light of this analysis, we reject Ray's contention that his claim for interference with prospective economic advantage is uniquely beyond the preemptive scope of the Copyright Act or otherwise requires an analysis separate from that of his other state-law claims. <em>See, e.g., Stromback v. New Line Cinema, </em>384 F.3d 283, 306 (6th Cir.2004) (\"Generally, tortious interference claims ... are held to be preempted because the rights asserted in such claims are not qualitatively different from the rights protected by copyright.\u201d); <em>Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., </em>723 F.2d 195, 201 (2d Cir.1983) (holding that the Copyright Act preempted a tortious interference claim), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
