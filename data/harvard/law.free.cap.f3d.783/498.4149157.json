Epling, Jr. (\u201cEpling\u201d). The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Epling was entitled to the benefit of the so-called \u201cfifteen-year presumption,\u201d a statutory provision that presumes eligibility for benefits when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>claimant suffers from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment and has fifteen years of qualifying coal mine employment. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4). Because Hobet had failed to rebut that presumption, the ALJ concluded, Epling was entitled to benefits.

To prove entitlement to black lung benefits in the absence of the fifteen-year presumption, an individual must show that he has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that this disease is a substantially contributing cause of his totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment. <em>See Mingo Logan Coal Co. v.

Among them is the fifteen-year presumption at issue in this case, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4), which was enacted in 1972, eliminated in 1981, and then restored in 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fifteen-year presumption is expressly intended to \u201c[rjelax\u201d the \u201coften insurmountable burden\u201d of proving a black lung claim for the special class of \u201cminers with 15 years experience who are disabled by a respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d S. Rep. 92-743 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972. U.S.C.C.A.N. 2305, 2306. Through the presumption, Congress has \u201csingled out\u201d this group of miners for \u201cspecial treatment,\u201d making it easier for them to show their entitlement to benefits. Regulations Implementing the Byrd Amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act: Determining Coal Miners\u2019 and Survivors\u2019 Entitlement to Benefits, 78 Fed. Reg. 59102, 59105-07 (Sept. 25, 2013); <em>see also West Virginia CWP Fund v. </em>Bender, 782 F.3d 129, 141, No. 12-2034, 2015 WL 1475069 (4th Cir. Apr. 2, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">To that end, \u00a7 921(c)(4) provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">if a miner was employed for fifteen \u2022years or more in one or more underground coal mines, ... and if other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>dence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Under the presumption, if a claimant has at least fifteen years of underground coal mine employment and a qualifying respiratory or pulmonary disability, a rebuttable presumption arises that he is entitled to benefits. In other words, we presume both prongs of the showing required for benefits eligibility: that the claimant has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment, and that this disease is a substantially contributing cause of his disability. <em>See Mingo Logan, </em>724 F.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A coal mine operator may defeat the miner\u2019s claim by rebutting either of these presumptions. First, an operator may establish that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(d)(1)(i). Second, the operator may establish that \u201cno part\u201d of the miner\u2019s disability was caused by such a disease, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 718.305(d)(1)(ii), a standard under which it must \u201crule out\u201d the mining-related dis ease as a cause of the miner\u2019s disability, <em>Bender, </em>782 F.3d at 141; <em>Rose v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>614 F.2d 936, 939 (4th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">After working for over twenty-one years in underground coal mines \u2014 most recently for petitioner Hobet in 1999 \u2014 respondent Epling is unable to exert himself at all without experiencing shortness of breath. Because this impairment prevents Epling from performing his previous coal mine employment, which required heavy manual labor, it constitutes a totally disabling respiratory impairment for purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Epling filed this claim for benefits under the Act in 2007. Due to Epling\u2019s long history of coal mine employment and totally disabling respiratory impairment, the ALJ reviewing his claim applied the fifteen-year presumption, reinstated in 2010 while Epling\u2019s case was pending. As required by that provision, the ALJ presumed both (1) that Epling has pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment, and (2) that Epling\u2019s pneumoconiosis , is a cause of his disabling respiratory impairment. Together, those presumptions qualify Epling for benefits, absent rebuttal by Hobet.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On the first presumption \u2014 the existence of pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment \u2014 the ALJ found that Epling does indeed have pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment. Hobet does not contest that finding on appeal. Accordingly, only the second presumption \u2014 that Epling\u2019s pneumoconiosis is a cause of his disability \u2014 is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">To rebut that disability-causation presumption, Hobet presented the ALJ with testimony from two doctors, Dr. Robert J. Crisalli (\u201cCrisalli\u201d) and Dr. Kirk Hippensteel (\u201cHippensteel\u201d). The ALJ discredited Crisalli\u2019s testimony in a finding that Hobet does not challenge on appeal, and Hobet now relies entirely on Hippensteel\u2019s opinion, set forth in a number of submissions over the course of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Critically, in submissions made between 2008 and 2011, Hippensteel was unpersuaded that Epling suffered from pneumoconiosis at all, though he conceded that the evidence was not unequivocal. As the ALJ explained, after reviewing chest CT scans, Hippensteel believed \u201cthat the evidence did not indicate pneumoconiosis.\u201d J.A. 80. In this key respect, Hippensteel\u2019s opinion was directly contrary to the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>finding that Epling <em>did </em>have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Hippensteel attributed Epling\u2019s respiratory impairments not to pneumoconiosis but instead entirely to obesity and sleep apnea. Hippensteel acknowledged abnormalities in Epling\u2019s x-rays. He believed, however, that it would be \u201cunusual\u201d for Epling to have developed pneumoconiosis over ten years after he left work in the coal mines. <em>See </em>J.A. 89. And in light of the evidence against pneumoconiosis, he reasoned, it followed that the abnormalities were the result of the obesity and sleep apnea.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">At the same time, Hippensteel asserted that even if, hypothetically, Epling did have pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment, that disease would not be the cause of his impairment. By way of explanation, Hippensteel offered only his agreement with the views of Crisalli, the now-discredited expert, reciting Crisalli\u2019s opinion as to the cause of Epling\u2019s gas exchange impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In February of 2012, upon review of additional CT scans, Hippensteel\u2019s diagnostic opinion changed, and he concluded that Epling did indeed suffer from pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment. But Hippensteel did not revisit his causation analysis in light of this new finding. Instead, he simply recited again his prior conclusion that Epling\u2019s respiratory problems were not caused by pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Reviewing this evidence, the ALJ made the determination \u2014 central to this appeal \u2014 that Hippensteel\u2019s opinion that pneumoconiosis did not cause Epling\u2019s disability was entitled to \u201clittle weight\u201d because (1) the doctor had failed to diagnose pneumoconiosis, in direct contradiction to the ALJ\u2019s own finding; and (2) Hippensteel\u2019s position \u201cthat it would be unusual for [Epling] to have pneumoconiosis ten years after he ended his coal mine employment\u201d was \u201cnot in accord with the accepted view that [coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis] is both latent and progressive.\u201d J.A. 89; <em>see also </em>J.A. 98. Having discounted that key testimony, the ALJ went on to find that Hobet could not rebut the presumption that Epling\u2019s pneumoconiosis is a cause of his disability, and awarded benefits to Epling.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. On the weight to be given Hippensteel\u2019s opinion, the Board, citing <em>Scott v. Mason Coal Co., </em>289 F.3d 263 (4th Cir.2002), invoked the well-established rule discrediting causation testimony by a doctor who fails to diagnose pneumoconiosis when, as here, an ALJ has made a contrary finding. In such cases, a doctor\u2019s opinion as to causation may not be credited at all unless there are \u201c \u2018specific and persuasive reasons\u2019 \u201d for concluding that the doctor\u2019s view on causation is independent of his or her mistaken belief that the claimant does not have pneumoconiosis, in which case it may be assigned, at most, \u201clittle weight.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269-70 (quoting <em>Toler v. E. Associated Coal Co., </em>43 F.3d 109, 116 (4th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Applying that standard, the Board held that the ALJ had \u201crationally discounted\u201d Hippensteel\u2019s opinion. J.A. 98. Hippensteel\u2019s failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis could not be salvaged, the Board explained, by his hypothetical \u201cassumption of the existence\u201d of pneumoconiosis in deposition testimony. J.A. 99. And though Hippensteel ultimately accepted the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis in 2012, the Board reasoned, all of his discussion of his causation opinion predated that change of mind, and was coupled with his former unwillingness to diagnose pneumoconiosis. The Board therefore affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>causation and the award of benefits to Epling.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Hobet timely filed this petition for review, arguing that the ALJ and the Board improperly discredited Hippensteel\u2019s opinion regarding the cause of Epling\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Our review of a decision awarding black lung benefits is \u201climited.\u201d <em>Harman Mining Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>678 F.3d 305, 310 (4th Cir.2012). We ask only \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the ALJ and whether the legal conclusions of the [Board] and ALJ ar\u00e9 rational and consistent with applicable law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">To determine whether this standard has been met, we consider \u201cwhether all of the relevant evidence has been analyzed and whether the ALJ has sufficiently explained his rationale in crediting certain evidence.\u201d <em>Mingo Logan, </em>724 F.3d at 557. But it is for the ALJ, .as the trier of fact, to make factual and credibility determinations, <em>see id., </em>and we therefore \u201cdefer to the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions,\u201d <em>Harman, </em>678 F.3d at 310. So long as an ALJ\u2019s findings in this regard are supported by substantial evidence, they must be sustained. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The question in this appeal is whether Hippensteel\u2019s opinion regarding the cause of Epling\u2019s disability was properly discredited. In particular, we consider whether the ALJ and the Board erred by discrediting Hippensteel\u2019s causation analysis on the basis of his failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">As the Board recognized, we are not writing on a clean slate. Long-standing precedent establishes that a medical opinion premised on an erroneous finding that a claimant does not suffer from pneumoconiosis is \u201cnot worthy of much, if any, weight,\u201d particularly with respect to whether a claimant\u2019s disability was caused by that disease. <em>Grigg v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>28 F.3d 416, 419 (4th Cir.1994). This is a commonsense rule, for the credibility of a doctor\u2019s judgment as to whether pneumoconiosis is a cause of a miner\u2019s disability is necessarily influenced by the accuracy of his underlying diagnosis, which lies at the heart of any claim for black lung benefits. <em>See Toler, </em>43 F.3d at 116. \u201cIt is usually exceedingly difficult for a doctor to properly assess the contribution, if any, of pneumoconiosis to a miner\u2019s death [or disability] if [the doctor] does not believe [pneumoconiosis] was present.\u201d <em>Soubik v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>366 F.3d 226, 234 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Thus, opinions that erroneously fail to diagnose pneumoconiosis may not be credited at all, unless an ALJ is able to \u201cidentify specific and persuasive reasons for concluding that the doctor\u2019s judgment on the question of disability causation does not rest upon\u201d the \u201cpredicate[ ]\u201d misdiagnosis. <em>Toler, </em>43 F.3d at 116 (vacating ALJ finding on disability causation where ALJ relied upon the opinions of doctors who erroneously failed to diagnose pneumoconiosis); <em>see also Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269-70 (same). And even when those opinions are credited, they may carry only \u201clittle weight\u201d in the decision-maker\u2019s causation analysis. <em>Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269 (even if there were specific and persuasive reasons to credit opinions failing to diagnose pneumoconiosis, ALJ impermissibly \u201caccorded those opinions far more than the little weight they are allowed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In this case, we agree with the Board that Hippensteel\u2019s opinion was entitled to no more than the \u201clittle weight\u201d assigned it by the ALJ. First and most critically, Hippensteel failed to diagnose Epling\u2019s pneumoconiosis, directly contrary to the finding of the ALJ. Under cases like <em>Scott </em>and <em>Toler, </em>that failure, by itself, would bar the ALJ from giving Hippensteel\u2019s opinion as to disability causation anything more than the \u201clittle weight\u201d he accorded it. <em>See Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269-70; <em>Toler, </em>43 F.3d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Moreover, this is not a case in which there are \u201cspecific and persuasive reasons\u201d for thinking that a doctor\u2019s view of disability causation is independent from any misdiagnosis. <em>See Toler, </em>43 F.3d at 116. On the contrary, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Hippensteel\u2019s disability-causation opinion was closely tied to his belief that Epling did not suffer from pneumoconiosis arising from coal mine employment. Indeed, Hippensteel himself explained that it was because the evidence in the record did not substantiate a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis that he attributed the irregularities in Epling\u2019s x-rays to obesity and sleep apnea instead. That reasoning is irreconcilable with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Epling does in fact have pneumoconiosis. <em>See id. </em>at 115 (finding it difficult \u201cto understand how the ALJ could credit\u201d the causation analysis of doctors who failed to diagnose pneumoconiosis \u201cwhile simultaneously finding that [the claimant] did suffer from pneumoconiosis\u201d). And it leaves no space between Hippensteel\u2019s failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis and his assessment that pneumoconiosis was not a cause of Epling\u2019s disability. Under those circumstances, the ALJ properly discredited Hippensteel\u2019s opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 116 (ALJ \u201cmay not credit\u201d doctor\u2019s opinion on causation absent \u201cspecific and persuasive\u201d showing that it is not linked to an erroneous failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Hobet argues that Hippensteel salvaged the credibility of his causation opinion when he asserted that he would have reached the same conclusion even assuming that Epling did have pneumoconiosis. We disagree. A medical expert of course may opine credibly as to disability causation under an alternative set of circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 214 (4th Cir.2000). But as we have held, it is not enough for the expert simply to recite, without more, that his causation opinion would not change if the claimant had pneumoconiosis. <em>See Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 268-69. Rather, such an alternative causation analysis, like any causation opinion, must be accompanied by some reasoned explanation \u2014 in this context, an explanation of <em>why </em>the expert would continue to believe that pneumoconiosis was not the cause of a miner\u2019s disability, even if pneumoconiosis were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>That is what is missing in this case: Hippensteel does not provide any independent analysis of the factors that would lead him to attribute Epling\u2019s impairment to obesity and sleep apnea even if the factual premise for his opinion \u2014 that Epling does not have pneumoconiosis \u2014 were overridden. Instead, he simply endorses and paraphrases Crisalli\u2019s view of the gas exchange evidence \u2014 a view that was itself discredited by the ALJ. Repetition of another expert\u2019s discredited analysis does nothing to enhance the credibility of Hippensteel\u2019s own views, and it does not constitute the reasoned explanation necessary to support an alternative causation analysis. And without such an explanation, Hippensteel\u2019s alternative opinion is just a \u201csuperficial hypothetical\u201d that cannot be reconciled with the existence of the mining-related pneumoconiosis found by the ALJ. <em>Soubik, </em>366 F.3d at 234 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Nor is Hippensteel\u2019s opinion as to causation rendered sound by his late-breaking determination, in 2012, that Epling does in fact have pneumoconiosis. As the Board explained, the entirety of Hippensteel\u2019s causation reasoning predates his ultimate diagnosis of pneumoconiosis and, as discussed, rests primarily on the absence of that disease. At no point after diagnosing pneumoconiosis did Hippensteel revisit his earlier opinion to take into account the elimination of what had been the factual predicate for his view. So again, the ALJ was left without any explanation, in reports or testimony, of how Hippensteel might be able to reach the same conclusion regarding the cause of Epling\u2019s disability in light of his changed opinion regarding Epling\u2019s diagnosis. Absent that explanation, Hippensteel\u2019s 2012 restatement of his causation opinion was no more credible than its earlier iterations, and the ALJ permissibly discounted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In short, Hippensteel\u2019s initial failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis was cured neither by his hypothetical assumption of pneumoconiosis nor by his subsequent embrace of that diagnosis. Even standing alone, this defect would have justified the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 269-70. But in this case, Hippensteel\u2019s failure to diagnose pneumoconiosis did not stand alone. Instead, it came with the doctor\u2019s testimony that it would be unusual for Epling to have developed pneumoconiosis over ten years after he left work in the coal mines \u2014 a judgment, the ALJ explained, that is \u201cnot in accord with the accepted view that [coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis] is both latent and progressive.\u201d J.A. 89. The ALJ was entitled to. take this disagreement, too, into account in \u201cevaluating] ... the proper weight to accord [the] conflicting medical opinions\u201d at issue in this case, <em>Harman, </em>678 F.3d at 311 (quoting <em>Stiltner v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>86 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir.1996)), further bolstering his decision to discount Hippensteel\u2019s opinion. When these grounds for discrediting Hippensteel\u2019s causation opinion are taken together, they undoubtedly provide the substantial evidence necessary to affirm on appeal the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hobet had failed to rebut the fifteen-year presumption. <em>See id. </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">.
