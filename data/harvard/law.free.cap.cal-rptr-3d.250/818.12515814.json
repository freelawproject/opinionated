J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. (CEQA), applies to \"projects,\" a term defined by statute. In general, a project is an activity that (1) is undertaken or funded by, or subject to the approval of a public agency and (2) may cause \"either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.\" ( Pub. Res. Code, \u00a7 21065.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although section 21065 supplies the definition of a project, another provision of CEQA, section 21080, subdivision (a), can be interpreted to declare specified public agency activities, including the amendment of a zoning ordinance, to be a project as a matter of law, without regard to their potential for causing a physical change in the environment. In this matter, we must decide whether to adopt this interpretation of section 21080, which would prevail over section 21065 with respect to the specific public agency activities listed in section 21080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, the City of San Diego (City) adopted an ordinance authorizing the establishment of medical marijuana dispensaries and regulating their location and operation. The central provisions of this ordinance amended various City zoning regulations to specify where the newly established dispensaries may be located. Because the City found that adoption of the ordinance did not constitute a project for purposes of CEQA, it did not conduct any environmental review. Petitioner Union of Medical Marijuana Patients (UMMP) challenged the City's failure to conduct CEQA review in a petition for writ of mandate, which was denied by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, UMMP argued (1) the amendment of a zoning ordinance, one of the public agency activities listed in section 21080, is conclusively declared a project by that statute and (2) the City's ordinance, in any event, satisfied the definition of a project under section 21065. The former argument was premised in part on\n   <em>\n    Rominger v. County of Colusa\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341847\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/229/690/\">\n    229 Cal.App.4th 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=177%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20677\">\n    177 Cal.Rptr.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Rominger\n   </em>\n   ), which relied on section 21080 in concluding that a county's approval of a tentative subdivision map, another activity listed in section 21080, was a project as a matter of law. Here, the Court of Appeal disagreed with\n   <em>\n    Rominger\n   </em>\n   , concluding that the amendment of a zoning ordinance is subject to the same statutory test as public agency activities not listed in section 21080. The court proceeded to find no error in the City's conclusion that the ordinance was not a project because it did not have the potential to cause a physical change in the environment. We granted review to resolve the conflict between the two Courts of Appeal regarding the interpretation of section 21080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeal below that section 21080 does not override the definition of project found in section 21065. Accordingly, the various activities listed in section 21080 must satisfy the requirements of section 21065 before they are found to be a project for purposes of CEQA. On the other hand, we conclude that the Court of Appeal misapplied the test for determining whether a proposed activity has the potential to cause environmental change under section 21065, which was established in\n   <em>\n    Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Commission\n   </em>\n   (2007)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3819492\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/41/372/\">\n    41 Cal.4th 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20247\">\n    60 Cal.Rptr.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%20116\">\n    160 P.3d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Muzzy Ranch\n   </em>\n   ), and erred in affirming the City's finding that adoption of the ordinance did not constitute a project.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The City's Medical Marijuana Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Health and Safety Code section 11362.83, a provision of the Medical Marijuana Program ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.7 et seq. ), recognizes the authority of local governments to adopt ordinances regulating the \"location, operation, or establishment of a medicinal cannabis cooperative or collective.\" ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.83, subd. (a) ; see\n   <em>\n    Kirby v. County of Fresno\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053421\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/242/940/#p956\">\n    242 Cal.App.4th 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20815\">\n    195 Cal.Rptr.3d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In 2014, the City enacted such a regulation, San Diego Ordinance No. O-20356 (Ordinance). The Ordinance amended a variety of City Municipal Code sections to authorize the establishment, and regulate the siting and operation of, \"medical marijuana consumer cooperatives\" (dispensaries), which were defined as \"a facility where marijuana is transferred to qualified patients or primary caregivers in accordance with the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 and the Medical Marijuana Program Act.\" (Ord., \u00a7 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The primary provisions of the Ordinance amended several of the City's zoning regulations to cap the number of dispensaries and specify where in the City they could be located. Dispensaries were added to the list of permitted uses in two of the City's six categories of commercial zones and two of the four categories of industrial zones (Ord., \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 13, 15), and they were expressly excluded from open space, agricultural, and residential zones. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5.) Dispensaries were also added to the list of permitted uses in certain planned districts of the City. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, 13.) The Ordinance placed an upper limit of four dispensaries in any single city council district and required a dispensary to be located more than 1,000 feet from certain sensitive uses, such as parks and schools, and more than 100 feet from a residential zone. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 8.) Regardless of location, the Ordinance required the grant of a conditional use permit for a dispensary's operation. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, 7, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to defining the location of dispensaries, the Ordinance imposed basic conditions on their operation, such as prohibiting the provision of medical consultation services, requiring particular lighting and security, defining permissible signage, and limiting hours of operation. (Ord., \u00a7 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because the City contains nine city council districts, the Ordinance's limit of four dispensaries per district permitted, in theory, the establishment of 36 dispensaries. A study commissioned by the City, however, found that the other restrictions placed on the location of dispensaries by the Ordinance, such as the limitation to particular zoning districts and the minimum distance from sensitive uses, precluded the establishment of a dispensary entirely in one city council district and limited two other districts to three dispensaries each. This left a practical maximum of 30 dispensaries. City planning staff concluded that the actual number of dispensaries to be created \"is very likely to be significantly less,\" since \"factors such as available units for rent, rental rates, overall demand for dispensaries, and proximity of potential sites to target markets would rule out some sites.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the City found CEQA inapplicable to the Ordinance's enactment, it conducted no environmental review prior to\n   its adoption. The City's finding explained its reasoning: \"The ... Ordinance is not subject to [CEQA] ..., in that it is not a Project .... Adoption of the ordinance does not have the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or reasonably for[e]seeable indirect physical change in the environment. Future projects subject to the ordinance will require a discretionary permit and CEQA review, and will be analyzed at the appropriate time in accordance with CEQA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to its President, UMMP is \"a civil rights organization that is devoted to defending and asserting the rights of medical\n   cannabis patients as well as promoting safe access to medical marijuana.\" Prior to adoption of the Ordinance, UMMP submitted two letters to the City Council objecting to the failure to conduct environmental review under CEQA. The letters argued that the Ordinance should have been found to be a project for purposes of CEQA because it had the potential to cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change. ( \u00a7 21065.) According to UMMP, adoption of the Ordinance could affect the environment because (1) restrictions on the siting of dispensaries would require \"thousands of patients to drive across the City\" to obtain medical marijuana; (2) the City might prosecute and close existing, unpermitted marijuana dispensaries, causing medical marijuana users to engage in the \"inherently agricultural practice\" of growing their own marijuana; and (3) \"the unique development\n   impacts associated with [dispensaries] [would be] shifted to certain areas of the City and intensified due to the limit on the total number of [dispensaries].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the City disregarded UMMP's arguments and adopted the Ordinance without further environmental review, UMMP filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the adoption of the Ordinance under CEQA. The trial court, in an extensive written minute order, rejected UMMP's claims of the Ordinance's potential for causing environmental change, concluding there was insufficient evidence in the record to support those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, UMMP repeated its argument that the Ordinance should have been considered a project as a result of its potential for physical change in the environment, but it raised the additional argument that the Ordinance should be deemed a project as a matter of law under section 21080, which states that CEQA \"shall apply to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies, including, but not limited to, the enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances ....\" (\u00a7 21080, subd. (a).) In effect, UMMP argued, section 21080 classifies every zoning amendment as a project under CEQA, regardless of its potential for effecting environmental change. In a published opinion that will be discussed in more detail\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeal rejected both arguments.

The court began its analysis by concluding that section 21080's listing of various local agency activities is ambiguous.

To harmonize the \"more specific provision\" of section 21065 with the \"more general provision\" of section 21080, the court held that the \"most reasonable interpretation\" of section 21080, subdivision (a), is that the various listed public agency activities are examples of \" '[a]n activity directly undertaken by any public agency' as set forth in section 21065, but that the enactment or amendment of a zoning ordinance will not constitute a CEQA project unless it\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    meets the second requirement in\n    section 21065, namely that it 'may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Marijuana Patients\n    </em>\n    , at p. 116,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20507\">\n     208 Cal.Rptr.3d 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)\n    The court found support for its interpretation in Guidelines section 15378.

In the case of CEQA, this judicial presumption is legislatively mandated. Section 21060 expressly states that CEQA's definitions \"govern the construction of this division.\"\n    Applying this principle of interpretation, we must assume that in using the defined term \"project\" in section 21080, the Legislature intended it to bear the definition assigned in section 21065. Accordingly, the first portion of section 21080, subdivision (a) - \"Except as otherwise provided in this division, this division shall apply to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies\" - must be understood to mean that CEQA applies to activities proposed to be carried out or approved by a public agency that both (1) are discretionary and (2) satisfy the requirements for a project under section 21065. Although all of the exemplary activities listed in section 21080 necessarily satisfy section 21065 's requirement of public agency involvement, there is no reason to conclude that they invariably satisfy its requirement of the potential to cause a physical change in the environment. For that reason, we must interpret the listing of public agency activities in section 21080, subdivision (a), merely to offer generic examples of the type of \"discretionary [activities] proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies\" to which CEQA\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    apply. CEQA\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    apply only to activities that qualify as projects - in other words, to specific examples of the listed activities that have the potential to cause, directly or indirectly, a physical change in the environment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    UMMP has not suggested any reason why the ordinary presumption requiring a defined term to carry that meaning should not apply in these circumstances, and we aware of none. As noted, the definition in section 21065 is legislatively mandated to apply to section 21080, as well as to the remainder of CEQA. (\u00a7 21060.) Nothing in section 21080 suggests that the Legislature intended to exempt the listed activities from satisfying the requirements for a project. On the contrary, its use of the defined term \"project,\" rather than a generic term such as \"activity,\" suggests that the Legislature intended to incorporate the defined concept. Finally, using the defined meaning does not result in an absurdity or otherwise impair the enforcement of CEQA. It simply confirms that the public agency activities listed in section 21080 must satisfy the same requirement applicable to\n    nonlisted activities before they are subject to CEQA, the requirement of potential for physical change in the environment. (See \u00a7 21065.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Because the plain language of section 21080 is unambiguous when evaluated in context, it is unnecessary for us to consider\n    other indicia of meaning. Yet it is worth noting that other available indicia support our interpretation. First and most important, as the Court of Appeal recognized, our interpretation is consistent with that of the Secretary for Natural Resources in the Guidelines, to which we must \"afford great weight.\" (\n    <em>\n     Building Industry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 62 Cal.4th at p. 381,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2094\">\n     196 Cal.Rptr.3d 94\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20P.3d%20792\">\n     362 P.3d 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) In defining \"project,\" the Guidelines impose the requirement of a potential for causing a physical change in the environment on all public agency activities. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15378, subd. (a).) Although Guidelines section 15378 mentions enactment and amendment of a zoning ordinance, activities also mentioned in section 21080, it cites those activities merely as examples of activities \"directly undertaken by any public agency\" (\u00a7 15378, subd. (a)(1)), a usage equivalent to our understanding of the significance of the list of activities in section 21080. Guidelines section 15378 does not suggest that the enactment or amendment of a zoning ordinance constitutes a project without regard to its potential for causing environmental change.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Policy considerations favor this interpretation as well. Finding a proposed activity subject to CEQA can lead to additional costs, in time and money, for both a public agency and a private applicant. (\n    <em>\n     Sky Ranch Pilots\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899614\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/902/#p907\">\n     47 Cal.4th 902\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 909,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20894\">\n     102 Cal.Rptr.3d 894\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=220%20P.3d%20905\">\n     220 P.3d 905\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) As section 21065 recognizes, there is no reason to impose those costs by subjecting a proposed activity to CEQA if the activity does not have the potential to affect the environment. Declaring all of the activities listed in section 21080 to be a project would necessarily subject them to these incremental costs without regard to their potential for causing an environmental impact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The legislative history of sections 21065 and 21080 also supports our conclusion. As\n    originally enacted, section 21065 defined \"project\" merely as an activity undertaken, financed or subject to approval by a government agency, using the text now contained in subdivisions (a) through (c) of the statute. (Stats. 1972, ch. 1154, \u00a7 1, pp. 2271-2272.) The statute did not contain the further requirement that a proposed activity have the potential to cause environmental change. At that time, section 21080, subdivision (a) was materially identical to its present text. (Stats. 1972, ch. 1154, \u00a7 1, p. 2272.) Accordingly, the local government activities listed in section 21080 necessarily constituted examples of \"projects,\" since all land use regulations and approvals constituted projects under the version of section 21065 in effect at\n    the time.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    In 1994, section 21065 was amended to its present form, limiting \"projects\" to governmental activities that posed the possibility of an environmental effect. (Stats. 1994, ch. 1230, \u00a7 4, p. 7682.) The purpose of the amendment was to \"prohibit CEQA from being used to delay or kill [activities] that have no direct or indirect effect on the environment\" by narrowing the definition of project. (Assem. Natural Resources Com., Republican Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 749 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 22, 1994, p. 1.) To continue to treat all of the activities listed in section 21080 as \"projects\" following this amendment of section 21065, regardless of their potential for producing an environmental change, would entirely defeat the narrowing purpose of the amendment, at least as far as the listed activities are concerned.\n    The\n    <em>\n     Rominger\n    </em>\n    court, in holding that section 21080 declared all tentative subdivision map approvals to be projects, explained its reasoning in part by noting, \"Presumably no one goes to the trouble of subdividing property just for the sake of the process; the goal of subdividing property is to make that property more useable. And with the potential for greater or different use comes the potential for environmental impacts from that use.\" (\n    <em>\n     Rominger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 229 Cal.App.4th at p. 702,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=177%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20677\">\n     177 Cal.Rptr.3d 677\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) Even assuming this to be true with respect to tentative subdivision maps, the rationale supports\n    <em>\n     Rominger\n    </em>\n    's statutory interpretation only if the same logic also holds for the other public agency activities listed in section 21080. It does not. As amici curiae League of California Cities and California State Association of Counties point out, many types of local government regulations are labeled \"zoning ordinances,\" covering a wide range of regulatory subjects. Whether the enactment or amendment of a regulation denominated a \"zoning ordinance\" carries the potential for environmental change depends entirely on the nature of the particular regulation. A potential environmental effect cannot be presumed solely from the label applied to it. The same point applies with equal force to the two other activities listed in section 21080, zoning variances and conditional use permits.

As we reasoned, \"When approving a project that is consistent with a community plan, general plan,\n    or zoning ordinance for which an environmental impact report already has been certified, a public agency need examine only those environmental effects that are peculiar to the project and were not analyzed or were insufficiently analyzed in the prior environmental impact report.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at pp. 388-389,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20247\">\n     60 Cal.Rptr.3d 247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%20116\">\n     160 P.3d 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)

Applying this test, our discussion of the TALUP's status as a project was brief and straightforward. We made no reference to any evidence in the record bearing on the\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n    impact of the TALUP on development in Solano County. Instead, the decision restricted itself to an examination of the potential effects that could reasonably be anticipated from adopting a land use policy of the type contained in the TALUP. Reasoning that population growth and resulting development can be anticipated in California counties, and that a policy capping development in one area might be expected to divert this growth to other areas of a county, we found the TALUP to be the sort of activity that could result in a physical change in the environment.

Consistent with this standard, a \"reasonably foreseeable\" indirect physical change is one that the activity is capable, at least in theory, of causing. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15064, subd. (d)(3).)

Determination of\n    an activity's status as a project occurs at the inception of agency action, presumably before any formal inquiry has been made into the\n    actual environmental impact of the activity. The question posed at that point in the CEQA analysis is not whether the activity will affect the environment, or what those effects might be, but whether the activity's potential for causing environmental change is sufficient to justify the further inquiry into its actual effects that will follow from the application of CEQA. If the proposed activity is the sort that is capable of causing direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect effects on the environment, some type of environmental review is justified, and the activity must be deemed a project. CEQA analysis is then undertaken to evaluate the likelihood and nature of the project's environmental impacts, in order to determine the extent of environmental review required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Only as so understood is the nature of the project decision consistent with the scope of appellate review.

Given the often disputed nature of the real-world environmental impacts of a typical project and the discretion invested in an agency to make related factual findings, the environmental effects of a proposed activity can be reviewed as a matter of law only if the analysis is restricted to the effects that the activity is capable of causing, rather than those it actually will cause if implemented.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Our understanding of\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    is therefore somewhat different from\n    <em>\n     Rominger\n    </em>\n    's understanding, which UMMP urges here. UMMP argues that\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    's reference to \"a categorical question respecting whether the activity is of a general kind with which CEQA is concerned\" (\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 41 Cal.4th at p. 381,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20247\">\n     60 Cal.Rptr.3d 247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%20116\">\n     160 P.3d 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) makes it unnecessary to consider the substance of a proposed activity. Instead, UMMP argues, it is sufficient to know the nature of the agency action involved - for example, approval of a zoning amendment or of a permit for private land development. On the contrary, as our discussion demonstrates,\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    clearly requires a public agency to consider the substance of a proposed activity in determining its status as a project. What need not be considered is the activity's actual impact in the specific circumstances presented. As\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    noted, the analysis is conducted \"without regard to whether the activity will\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    have environmental impact.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    ., italics added.) Similarly irrelevant is the specific type of governmental action required, so long as the proposed\n    activity satisfies one of the criteria for governmental involvement established in section 21065, subdivisions (a) through (c).\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Applying the foregoing test, we conclude the City erred in determining that the adoption of the Ordinance was not a project. Prior to the Ordinance, no medical marijuana dispensaries were legally\n    permitted to operate in the City. The Ordinance therefore amended the City's zoning regulations to permit the establishment of a sizable number of retail businesses of an entirely new type. Although inconsistency with prior permissible land uses is not necessary for an activity to constitute a project (see\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    41 Cal.4th at p. 388,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20247\">\n     60 Cal.Rptr.3d 247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%20116\">\n     160 P.3d 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), establishment of these new businesses is capable of causing indirect physical changes in the environment. At a minimum, such a policy change could foreseeably result in new retail construction to accommodate the businesses. In addition, as UMMP suggests, the establishment of new stores could cause a citywide change in patterns of vehicle traffic from the businesses' customers, employees, and suppliers. The necessary causal connection between the Ordinance and these effects is present because adoption of the Ordinance was \"an essential step culminating in action [the establishment of new businesses] which may affect the environment.\" (\n    <em>\n     Fullerton Joint Union High School Dist. v. State Board of Education\n    </em>\n    (1982)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1950672\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/32/779/#p797\">\n     32 Cal.3d 779\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 797,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20398\">\n     187 Cal.Rptr. 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=654%20P.2d%20168\">\n     654 P.2d 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Fullerton\n    </em>\n    ).) The theoretical effects mentioned above are sufficiently plausible to raise the possibility that the Ordinance \"may cause ... a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment\" ( \u00a7 21065 ), warranting its consideration as a project.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Although UMMP raised these potential effects in the Court of Appeal, as well as other, less plausible effects, it framed them in the context of the specific circumstances it claimed to prevail in the City, hypothesizing various City-specific reasons why the Ordinance might indirectly produce physical changes. The Court of Appeal understandably rejected these specific impacts as speculative, given the absence of any evidence to support their occurrence. For the reasons discussed above, however, both UMMP's framing of the arguments in this manner and the court's rejection of them put the cart\n    before the horse. The likely\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n    impact of an activity is not at issue in determining its status as a project.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Further, at this stage of the CEQA\n    process virtually any postulated indirect environmental effect will be \"speculative\" in a legal sense - that is, unsupported by evidence in the record (e.g.,\n    <em>\n     People v. Murtishaw\n    </em>\n    (2011)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915572\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/51/574/#p591\">\n     51 Cal.4th 574\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 591,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20586\">\n     121 Cal.Rptr.3d 586\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=247%20P.3d%20941\">\n     247 P.3d 941\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"defendant's claim ... is entirely speculative, for he points to nothing in the record that supports his claim\"] ) - because little or no factual record will have been developed. A lack of support in the record, however, does not prevent an agency from considering a possible environmental effect at this\n    initial stage of CEQA analysis. Instead, such an effect may be rejected as speculative only if, as noted above, the postulated causal mechanism underlying its occurrence is tenuous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Finally, the City argues, in passing, that environmental review would be more appropriate at the time each dispensary applies for a conditional use permit, which is required by the Ordinance for operation of a dispensary. We withhold comment on the significance of this argument for tiers two and three of the CEQA decision tree, but we note that the requirement of individual use permits does not prevent the Ordinance from being considered a project if section 21065 is otherwise satisfied. As we observed in\n    <em>\n     Fullerton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 32 Cal.3d at page 795,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20398\">\n     187 Cal.Rptr. 398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=654%20P.2d%20168\">\n     654 P.2d 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , a local agency \"cannot argue\" that approval of a regulation is not a project \"merely because further decisions must be made\" before the activities directly causing environmental change will occur. The City argues that too little is known about the environmental impact of the Ordinance to permit effective environmental review at this stage, but that argument conflates the various tiers of CEQA review. (\n    <em>\n     Muzzy Ranch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 41 Cal.4th at p. 383,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20247\">\n     60 Cal.Rptr.3d 247\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%20116\">\n     160 P.3d 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [\"That further governmental decisions need to be made before a land use measure's actual environmental impacts can be determined with precision does not necessarily prevent the measure from qualifying as a project\"].) At this initial tier in the CEQA process, the potential of the Ordinance to cause an environmental change requires the City to treat it as a project and proceed to the next steps of the CEQA analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    It ultimately might prove true that, in the context of the City, the actual environmental effects of the Ordinance will be minimal. It is possible, as the\n    Court of Appeal assumed, that the City's commercial vacancy rate is sufficient to provide retail space for the new businesses without the need for expansion. (\n    <em>\n     Marijuana Patients\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , 4 Cal.App.5th at p. 123,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20507\">\n     208 Cal.Rptr.3d 507\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [dispensaries \"could simply cho[o]se to locate in available commercial space in an existing building\"].) It is also possible, as UMMP suggests, that a significant number of unlicensed businesses selling medical marijuana already exist in the City and that the newly licensed businesses will simply displace them. Rather than causing increased traffic and other activity, the net effect of this substitution might be little or no additional environmental burden on the City. All of these factors can be explored in the second and, if warranted, third tiers of the CEQA process. As to those tiers, we are in no position to offer, and do not express, an opinion on the applicability of the various\n    exemptions or, alternatively, the appropriate level of environmental review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     III.
