The state of Michigan owns the Trail, and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) maintains it. Plaintiff sued both entities, and throughout this litigation has set forth various theories to avoid the grant of governmental immunity provided to defendants in the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq. </em>In the lower courts, she argued that defendants had a duty to maintain the Trail in reasonable repair pursuant to what is generally referred to as the \u2018highway exception\u2019 to governmental immunity because the Trail is a \u201ctrail-way\u201d that falls within the statutory definition of \u201chighway.\u201d See MCL 691.1401(e); MCL 691.1402(1). In this Court, plaintiff now contends that we should conclude that the Trail is either a \u201cforest road\u201d or a \u201croad\u201d for purposes of the GTLA and that defendants therefore have a duty to maintain this \u201croad\u201d pursuant to the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Therefore, this case requires us to determine whether the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d for the purposes of governmental immunity because the state only has a duty to maintain the Trail in reasonable repair pursuant to the highway exception if it is, in fact, a \u201chighway\u201d under MCL 691.1401(e). We note that this is a question of first impression in the particular context of this case. For although Michigan courts are familiar with the highway exception to governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>immunity; we are unaware of any case in which a person who has been injured while riding an off-road vehicle on a state trail has claimed that the trail constitutes a \u201chighway\u201d for purposes of the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We conclude that the Trail is not a \u201chighway\u201d under MCL 691.1401(e). The Trail is properly classified as a \u201ctrailway\u201d within the distinct meaning of that word in Michigan\u2019s statutory law, and this \u201ctrailway\u201d \u2014 which is miles away from any highway \u2014 is not within the scope of the highway exception because it is not a \u201ctrail-way ... on the highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, because the Legislature determined that only trailways on the highway are deemed highways, and because this Trail therefore is clearly not a highway, we refuse plaintiffs invitation to avoid the statute and make the Trail into a highway by calling it a road. In summary, all roads, forest roads, trails, trailways, and highways in this case lead to the conclusion that plaintiffs claim is barred by governmental immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I. PACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Plaintiff, together with her husband and friends, were riding off-road vehicles (ORVs) on the Little Manistee Trail, located in Lake County. Just as plaintiff was about to negotiate a left turn, she ran over some exposed wooden boards that had been partially buried. This caused her ORV to bounce into the air, throwing plaintiff against nearby tree trunks and resulting in serious spinal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Trail serves mixed uses, and the DNR has designated it variously as an \u201cORV route,\u201d an \u201cORV trail,\u201d and a \u201csnowmobile trail.\u201d Plaintiff was injured on the portion of the Trail designated as an \u201cORV route,\u201d which signifies that any licensed motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>can operate on that part of the Trail. The Trail is part of a comprehensive system of recreational trailways, which by statute the DNR is obligated to maintain and manage for off-road vehicles. See MCL 324.81123. The state funds the ORV Trail Improvement Fund through the state treasury, and the DNR is authorized to provide grants to local units of government, nonprofit agencies, and individuals to maintain this system of trails, routes, and forest roads. The Little Manistee Trail is maintained by the Irons Area Tourist Association, a nonprofit corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"AlH\">Plaintiff sued defendants on the basis of the highway exception to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that the Trail is not a \u201chighway\u201d and, as a result, that they had no duty to maintain it in reasonable repair pursuant to the highway exception. The trial court denied this motion, ruling that the Trail fits within the definition of a \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e), which specifically includes \u201ctrailways.\u201d According to the trial court, \u201cthere is no dispute that the Little Manistee is a trailway,\u201d and it proceeded to hold that defendants were not exempt from the duty to maintain the Trail. The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Duffy v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 9, 2010 (Docket No. 289644). The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the Trail is properly classified as a \u201ctrailway\u201d and falls within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e). According to the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]here can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>real dispute that this is a <em>trailway...Id. </em>at 3. However, the panel concluded that the limited liability granted to the state in MCL 691.1402(1) applies to <em>all </em>trailways. As a result, it ruled that the highway exception did not apply to plaintiffs suit. Plaintiff then filed an application for leave to appeal, which this Court granted. <em>Duffy v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>488 Mich 861 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This Court reviews de novo a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition. <em>Ostroth v Warren Regency, GP, LLC, </em>474 Mich 36, 40; 709 NW2d 589 (2006). Matters of statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">III. HIGHWAY EXCEPTION TO GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The GTLA shields a governmental agency from tort liability \u201cif the governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCL 691.1407(1). The existence and scope of governmental immunity was solely a creation of the courts until the Legislature enacted the GTLA in 1964, which codified several exceptions to governmental immunity that permit a plaintiff to pursue a claim against a governmental agency. This case concerns the highway exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1402(1), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">[E]aeh governmental agency having jurisdiction over a highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. A person who sustains bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of a governmental agency to keep a highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency. The liability, procedure, and remedy as to county roads under the jurisdiction of a county road commission shall be as provided in [MCL 224.21]. The duty of the state and the county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability for that duty, extends only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and does not include sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The reference to \u201ctrailways\u201d in the fourth and final sentence was added by 1999 PA 205. The GTLA further provides in MCL 691.1401(e) its own definition of \u201chighway,\u201d which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[as] used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">(e) \u201cHighway\u201d means a public highway, road, or street that is open for public travel and includes bridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway. The term highway does not include alleys, trees, and utility poles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The inclusion of \u201ctrailways\u201d in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d was also done in 1999 PA 205. The GTLA does not define other terms in MCL 691.1401(e), including in particular \u201croad\u201d or \u201ctrailways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Although this Court has never before considered the exact issues presented in this case, it has on many occasions interpreted the highway exception. See, e.g., <em>Robinson v City of Lansing, </em>486 Mich 1; 782 NW2d 171 (2010); <em>Grimes v Dep\u2019t of Transp, </em>475 Mich 72; 715 NW2d 275 (2006); <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>463 Mich 143; 615 NW2d 702 (2000); <em>Sutiles v Dep\u2019t of Transp, </em>457 Mich 635; 578 NW2d 295 (1998). These decisions are instructive and offer some general principles to guide us.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">First, this Court has recognized that the language of the highway exception is not altogether clear. Indeed, we have described the highway exception as \u201cproblematic,\u201d <em>Nawrocki, </em>463 Mich at 167 n 24, and have noted that its language is \u201cconfusing for several reasons,\u201d <em>Suttles, </em>457 Mich at 643 n 5 (citation and quotation marks omitted). In <em>Grimes, </em>475 Mich at 78, we identified a particular problem in the act, which we encounter again today \u2014 that is, \u201c[b]eyond defining the term \u2018highway,\u2019 the GTLA does not define [the] additional terms [in MCL 691.1401(e)].\u201d The absence of statutory definitions for these terms is particularly troublesome in this case because not only are \u201croad\u201d and \u201ctrailway\u201d undefined by the GTLA, but \u201ctrailway\u201d is undefined in many general dictionaries as well. In determining whether defendants have a duty to maintain the Trail in reasonable repair because the Trail constitutes a \u201chighway,\u201d we remain cognizant of the challenges presented by the drafting of the highway exception and mindful that we are \u201c[c]onstrained to apply the statutory language as best as possible as written ....\u201d <em>Nawrocki, </em>463 Mich at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Second, as we recently explained in <em>Robinson, </em>486 Mich at 8 n 4, we know that MCL 691.1402 and MCL 691.1401 must be read together as a single law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cIt is elementary that statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be taken together in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, and that courts will regard all statutes upon the same general subject matter as part of 1 system.\u201d <em>Dearborn Twp Clerk v Jones, </em>335 Mich 658, 662; 57 NW2d 40 (1953). In this case, both MCL 691.1401 and MCL 691.1402 are in the GTLA, MCL 691.1401 immediately precedes MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>691.1402, and MCL 691.1401 expressly [defines several terms] \u201c[a]s used in this act....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">See also <em>Remus v Grand Rapids, </em>274 Mich 577, 581; 265 NW 755 (1936) (\u201cIn the construction of a particular statute, or in the interpretation of any of its provisions, all acts relating to the same subject, or having the same general purpose, should be read in connection with it, as together constituting one law.\u201d) (citations and quotation marks omitted). But cf. <em>Grimes, </em>475 Mich at 85 (in which we \u201cdecline[d] to consult the definitions contained in the [Michigan Vehicle Code] to inform our construction regarding the scope of the highway exception [in the GTLA],\u201d warning that relying on \u201can unrelated statute to construe another is a perilous endeavor to be avoided by our courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">When MCL 691.1402(1) and MCL 691.1401(e) are read <em>in pari materia, </em>it is clear that all governmental agencies have a duty to maintain highways within their jurisdiction in reasonable repair, but that this duty only extends to \u201chighways\u201d that fall within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e). In addition, if the governmental agency is the state or a county road commission, as is the case here, the Legislature has further constricted the scope of the highway exception by limiting the <em>portion </em>of the highway covered by the exception. That is, these agencies have no duty under the highway exception to maintain \u201csidewalks, trail-ways, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d MCL 691.1402(1), even though sidewalks, trailways, and crosswalks are included within the definition of \u201chighway.\u201d The duty of municipalities and townships is not similarly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Accordingly, determining whether the highway exception to governmental immunity applies to the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of this case is a two-pronged inquiry. First, in order for defendants to have a duty to maintain the Little Manistee Trail in reasonable repair, the Trail must fall within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d set forth in MCL 691.1401(e), which again is \u201ca road . . . that is open for public travel\u201d and \u201cincludes . . . trailways ... on the highway.\u201d Second, if the Trail is a \u201chighway,\u201d defendants only have a duty to maintain it in reasonable repair if the Trail is part of the highway included within the limited duty of the state and county road commission. MCL 691.1402(1). Concerning the first prong, plaintiff argues that the Trail falls within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e) because it is a \u201croad\u201d; alternatively, she argues in support of the lower courts\u2019 determinations that the Trail is a \u201ctrailway.\u201d Concerning the second prong, plaintiff argues that, as a \u201croad,\u201d the Trail is not excluded from defendants\u2019 duty by MCL 691.1402(1) and, alternatively, that the limitation on the state\u2019s duty in MCL 691.1402(1) applies only to \u201ctrailways . . . outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d not to <em>all </em>trail-ways, as the Court of Appeals concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">IV TRAIL NOT A \u201cHIGHWAY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We now address the threshold question whether the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d under MCL 691.1401(e). Neither party contends that the Trail could fall within the highway exception as anything other than a \u201croad\u201d or a \u201ctrailway.\u201d Although plaintiff originally argued that the Trail was indisputably a \u201ctrailway,\u201d and although both lower courts treated this issue as equally undisputed, in her appeal in this Court, she belatedly challenges this classification, arguing instead that the Trail is a \u201croad\u201d for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>GTLA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We consider and reject both of plaintiffs arguments. First, we conclude that the Trail is a \u201ctrailway\u201d within the distinct meaning of that word in Michigan\u2019s statutory law. Second, we conclude that the Trail is not a \u201ctrailway\u201d covered under MCL 691.1401(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The following information about the Trail is relevant in determining its classification under the GTLA. As stated previously, the Trail is on land owned by the state, and it is maintained by and under the jurisdiction of the DNR. The Little Manistee Trail is one of four trail systems within Lake County, which bills itself as \u201cMichigan\u2019s Outdoor Recreational Paradise\u201d and actively promotes its more than 300 miles of trailways. A DNR witness, who specialized in the development and maintenance of forest roads and trails, provided an affidavit that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The Little Manistee Trail &amp; Route (also Snowmobile Trail #344E and #35) are located in part of Newkirk and Cherry Valley Townships in Lake County in the State of Michigan. The Little Manistee Trail and Route is open for ORV and motorcycle use when passable throughout the year. In the winter, from December 1 to March 31, it is also used as designated snowmobile trail, No. 344 and No. 35. The Trail and Route are primarily used year around for recreational vehicle riding purposes. Other wheeled vehicular use of the Route (Forest road) would be an allowed but secondary use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkQK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Thus, according to the DNR, the Trail is both a \u201ctrail\u201d and a \u201croute.\u201d Plaintiffs accident occurred on the portion of the Trail that is considered a \u201croute.\u201d Furthermore, according to the DNR, the Trail permits mixed uses. The Trail is \u201cprimarily\u201d used for recreational vehicle riding purposes, and to that end, ORVs are permitted on all portions of the Trail year-round when passable (the Trail is not plowed in the winter), and snowmobiles are permitted in the winter. As a \u201csecondary use,\u201d licensed four-wheel conventional vehicles are permitted on the \u201croute\u201d portion. Pictures included in plaintiffs index show signage reflecting these various uses, including a sign for \u201cMixed Traffic\u201d and a weight-limit sign that permits trucks with more than one axle. These pictures show the Trail as an unpaved dirt path that has no shoulder, directly abuts dense forest, and appears wide enough to allow one lane of conventional traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">A. TRAIL AS A \u201cTRAILWAY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">MCL 8.3a instructs that when a nontechnical word is not statutorily defined, it \u201cshall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language....\u201d However, construing the elusive word \u201ctrailway\u201d according to its \u201ccommon and approved usage of the language\u201d proves to be a difficult, if not impossible, task. As mentioned, not only is \u201ctrailway\u201d not defined by the GTLA, but it is not defined in most general dictionaries either.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case, therefore, presents the unusual situation in which there is apparently <em>no </em>\u201ccommonly approved\u201d meaning of a word that the Legislature chose to employ in a statute, and yet the Legislature did not define the word in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>It is thus necessary to look outside the GTLA in order to discern the meaning of \u201ctrailway\u201d likely intended in MCL 691.1401(e). When we do, we find one statute to be of particular relevance: the Michigan trailways act, MCL 324.72101 <em>et seq., </em>the only Michigan statute that explicitly creates \u201ctrailways\u201d and that provides the law governing \u201ctrailways.\u201d The act was added as part of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA) in 1995 to provide for a statewide system of trailways on lands \u201cowned by the state or a governmental agency,\u201d MCL 324.72103(l)(a), \u201cfor public enjoyment, health, and fitness; [to] encourage constructive leisure-time activities; . . . [and to] enhance the local and state economies,\u201d MCL 324.72102. The act defines \u201ctrailway\u201d in part as a \u201cland corridor that features a broad trail capable of accommodating a variety of public recreation uses.\u201d MCL 324.72101(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We are persuaded that when the Legislature added \u201ctrailway\u201d to the highway exception in 1999 without defining the word, it likely intended \u201ctrailway\u201d to be construed according to the already-existing definition in the statute specifically devoted to trailways. While relying on \u201can unrelated statute to construe another is a perilous endeavor to be avoided by our courts,\u201d <em>Grimes, </em>475 Mich at 85, this case simply does not allow us to avoid the Michigan trailways act. We believe therefore that it is both necessary and proper to look to the act\u2019s definition of \u201ctrailway\u201d because there is no alternative definition. Furthermore, the chronology of relevant enactments, as well as the trailways act\u2019s exclusive focus on <em>trailways, </em>leads us to believe that the Legislature must have intended that the definition of \u201ctrailways\u201d in MCL 324.72101(k) would apply to other invocations of trailways in Michigan law, and specifically to that term as used in the highway exception. In short, although this Court will not invariably borrow language or meaning from one statute in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>provide meaning to another when those statutes are not <em>in pari materia, </em>this case presents us with such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Accordingly, we apply the definition of \u201ctrailways\u201d provided in the trailways act to MCL 691.1401(e), and conclude that the Little Manistee Trail falls squarely within this definition; it is a \u201cland corridor that features a broad trail capable of accommodating a variety of public recreation uses.\u201d MCL 324.72101(k). It is a \u201cbroad trail,\u201d an unpaved dirt trail that has no shoulder, directly abuts dense forest, and appears wide enough to allow one lane of conventional traffic. And a defining characteristic of the Trail is its capacity to \u201caccommodate] a variety of public recreation uses.\u201d All types of ORVs are permitted year-round on the Trail, and snowmobiles are permitted in the winter. Moreover, the Little Manistee Trail falls within the broader ambit of the trailways act. It is located on state-owned land and is part of a statewide system of trailways designed \u201cto provide for public enjoyment, health, and fitness; encourage constructive leisure-time activities; . . . [and] enhance the local and state economies,\u201d as is evident by the active promotion of the Trail for recreation and tourism. MCL 324.72102.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It is unclear whether plaintiff and the dissent would disagree with the conclusion that the Little Manistee Trail falls within the definition of \u201ctrailway\u201d in part 721 of NREPA, for both appear to have overlooked this definition. Indeed, the dissent never even attempts to give meaning to \u201ctrailway\u201d as used in the highway exception and, in this way, is entirely unresponsive to this opinion. This lack of response is remarkable for several reasons, not the least of which is that in the lower courts it was <em>undisputed </em>that the Trail was a \u201ctrailway,\u201d and plaintiff herself still maintains that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>is so. This lack of response also highlights the critical flaw in the dissent\u2019s approach to the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">To understand our differing approaches \u2014 and why we believe that ours is the better one \u2014 we begin with one point of agreement between our opinions. We both agree that \u201cthe resolution of this case hinges on the meaning of \u2018highway\u2019....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 232.

This response reveals the illogic of the dissent\u2019s approach. As this case illustrates, a \u201ctrailway\u201d \u2014 i.e., a \u201cland corridor that features a broad trail capable of accommodating a variety of public recreation uses\u201d\u2014 will often fall within the broad definition of \u201croad\u201d\u2014 i.e., \u201ca leveled or paved surface, made for traveling by motor vehicle.\u201d But the converse does not hold true. That is, while a \u201ctrailway\u201d will often be a \u201croad,\u201d a \u201croad\u201d will only infrequently be a \u201ctrailway.\u201d Thus, one consequence of the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the Trail is a \u201croad\u201d is that \u201croad\u201d would essentially consume \u201ctrailway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e), and genuinely render \u201ctrailway\u201d \u201csurplusage.\u201d There is no equivalent risk in concluding that the Trail is a \u201ctrailway\u201d that \u201croad\u201d could be rendered a nullity. Indeed, our opinion accords full meaning to both \u201croad\u201d and \u201ctrailway.\u201d It defines both terms, and it ultimately characterizes the Trail as a \u201ctrailway\u201d because the latter is the more specific term. To first define the broader term, as the dissent does, in no way dispenses with the need also to define the narrower term; by contrast, defining the narrower term <em>does </em>dispense with the need also to define the broader term.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In sum, our interpretation does not render any part of MCL 691.1401(e) surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Finally, the dissent justifies its avoidance of \u201ctrail-way\u201d by reasoning that \u201ceven if the Trail is not a \u2018covered trailway,\u2019 as the majority concludes, it certainly is a road.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 233. That is, the Trail can still be a \u201croad,\u201d and thus a \u201chighway,\u201d even if it is a \u201ctrailway,\u201d but not a \u201ctrailway on the highway.\u201d However, this directly contradicts what the Legislature stated in MCL 691.1401(e). Under that provision, there are two sets of terms that fall within \u201chighway.\u201d First, there are public highways, roads, and streets that are open for public travel. These are always \u201chighways.\u201d Second, there are structures that are \u201cincluded\u201d as highways \u2014 \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway.\u201d In order to be \u201cincluded\u201d as a highway, a trailway in particular must be <em>on the highway </em>and, if it is not, that trailway is <em>not </em>a highway. The language and organization of MCL 691.1401(e) make this plain, yet the dissent would contravene the statute and transform a trailway that is not on a highway \u2014 and thus is <em>not </em>a highway \u2014 into a highway by calling it a road, all without first considering whether the Trail at issue is best, and most precisely, characterized as a trailway. In sum, the Legislature determined that roads and trailways are not the same for purposes of the highway exception, in the sense that only <em>certain </em>trailways would be deemed highways. Thus, once this Trail has been most precisely and accurately classified as a trailway, it cannot be a road.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Plaintiff posits one more argument to challenge our conclusion that the Trail is a trailway. She urges us to supplement \u2014 or perhaps more accurately, to supplant\u2014 the common understanding of \u201croad\u201d with a definition of \u201cforest road\u201d in NREPA, arguing that the Trail is a \u201cforest road\u201d or a \u201croad\u201d under this definition. NREPA defines \u201cforest road\u201d as \u201ca hard surfaced road, gravel or dirt road, or other route capable of travel by a 2-wheel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>drive, 4-wheel conventional vehicle designed for highway use, except an interstate, state, or county highway.\u201d MCL 324.81101(f).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs reliance on this definition is unavailing for several reasons. To begin with, it is unnecessary to turn to this definition because \u201croad\u201d is a common and familiar word. It is difficult to think of a word that is more easily \u201cunderstood according to the common and approved usage of the language ....\u201d MCL 8.3a. Plaintiffs invocation of NREPA\u2019s definition of \u201cforest road\u201d runs contrary to first principles of interpretation because (1) there is nothing \u201ccommon\u201d about NREPA\u2019s technical and specific definition of \u201cforest road\u201d and (2) relying on this unrelated definition is altogether avoidable in light of more commonplace definitions. <em>Grimes, </em>475 Mich at 85.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Further, even looking past this threshold problem, we are not persuaded that the definition of \u201cforest road\u201d is applicable to the highway exception. MCL 324.81101(f) defines a <em>\u201cforest </em>road,\u201d while the GTLA defines \u201chighway\u201d to encompass only \u201croads,\u201d and \u201croads\u201d have been included within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1402(1) since the GTLA was first enacted in 1964. Together, these facts suggest that the Legislature that enacted the GTLA and included \u201croad\u201d within the highway exception could not have intended that the definition of \u201cforest road\u201d would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>used to give meaning to \u201croad,\u201d because that definition did not even exist when \u201croad\u201d was incorporated into the GTLA. Conversely, it would seem odd that the Legislature that enacted the specific definition of \u201cforest road\u201d would have intended it to apply generally to all \u201croads\u201d in Michigan, including all \u201croads\u201d referenced in the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">However, we need not engage in speculation about this, because the Legislature affirmatively foreclosed the possibility that the definition of \u201cforest road\u201d could be imported into the highway exception by crafting that definition to <em>distinguish </em>between \u201cforest roads\u201d and those \u201chighways\u201d that come within the scope of the highway exception. Again, MCL 324.81101(f) defines \u201cforest road\u201d as \u201ca hard surfaced road, gravel or dirt road, or other route capable of travel by a 2-wheel drive, 4-wheel conventional vehicle designed for highway use, <em>except an interstate, state, or county </em>highway.\u201d (Emphasis added.) State and county highways \u2014 those structures of transportation that are most indisputably <em>within </em>the highway exception \u2014 are expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cforest roads.\u201d Thus, the Legislature reasonably and clearly indicated that a \u201cforest road\u201d is not a typical \u201croad,\u201d a conclusion that merely underscores the obvious fact that NREPA defines a <em>\u201cforest </em>road,\u201d while the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in the GTLA speaks only of \u201croads.\u201d In summary, we have little difficulty in concluding that the Little Manistee Trail is properly characterized as a \u201ctrailway,\u201d not a \u201croad,\u201d under the highway exception.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>B. TRAIL NOT A COVERED \u201cTRAILWAY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">After concluding that the Trail is properly classified as a \u201ctrailway,\u201d we next address whether this \u201ctrail-way\u201d falls within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e) \u2014 that is, whether it is a \u201ca public highway, road, or street that is open for public travel and includes bridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway.\u201d We conclude that it is not. This definition does not include within its scope <em>all </em>trail-ways, but includes only those \u201ctrailways\u201d that are \u201con the highway.\u201d The Little Manistee Trail is not \u201con\u201d the highway, and it is not \u201cadjacent to\u201d the highway; in fact, it is miles away from any highway. Therefore, it is not a \u201ctrailway\u201d covered by MCL 691.1401(e) and thus not a \u201chighway\u201d for purposes of the highway exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">This interpretation is compelled by the final clause of MCL 691.1401(e), \u201con the highway,\u201d which, when properly applied, makes clear that the definition of \u201chighway\u201d includes \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts,\u201d but only those \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts\u201d that are \u201con the highway.\u201d In applying this limiting clause to the entire preceding list of installations within the definition of \u201chighway,\u201d we follow the established <em>exception </em>to the general rule of statutory construction known as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u2018last antecedent\u2019 rule. This \u201crule of statutory construction provides that a modifying or restrictive word or clause contained in a statute is confined solely to the immediately preceding clause or last antecedent, <em>unless something in the statute requires a different interpretation.\u201d Stanton v Battle Creek, </em>466 Mich 611, 616; 647 NW2d 508 (2002) (emphasis added). In MCL 691.1401(e), there are two indications that a different interpretation is required, and both direct us to follow the exception rather than the general rule and apply the restrictive clause to each of the preceding terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">First, the structure and context of MCL 691.1401(e) indicate that a different interpretation is required. As previously discussed, there are two sets of terms that fall within its definition of \u201chighway.\u201d There are \u201cpublic highways, roads, or streets that are open for public travel.\u201d And there are those terms that are \u201cinclude[d]\u201d as highways \u2014 \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway.\u201d While there is nothing surprising about including the first class of terms in the definition of \u201chighway,\u201d the average reader might well not expect to find the terms listed in the second class. However, the context of the sentence makes clear why these latter terms are considered within the scope of \u201chighways.\u201d Namely, all the terms listed in this second class bear some relationship to the highway. The modifying clause, \u201con the highway,\u201d establishes this relationship. Accordingly, to give proper meaning to MCL 691.1401(e) as gleaned from its structure and context, the clause \u201con the highway\u201d must be applied to <em>all </em>the terms that are \u201cinclude[d]\u201d within the second class of highways \u2014 \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trail-ways, crosswalks, and culverts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The second reason to follow the exception to the last-antecedent rule in interpreting MCL 691.1401(e) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that the interpretation reached by applying the general rule would be grammatically incorrect. That is, when the restrictive clause \u201con the highway\u201d is applied to only its last antecedent, \u201cculvert,\u201d an awkward and unreasonable reading results because there are no culverts \u201con\u201d the highway. \u201cCulvert\u201d is not defined by statute, but its common definition is \u201ca drain or channel crossing <em>under </em>a road, sidewalk, etc; sewer, conduit.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997) (emphasis added). However, while \u201con\u201d is not the grammatically correct preposition to apply to a \u201cculvert,\u201d other terms listed as \u201cincluded\u201d in the definition of \u201chighway,\u201d such as \u201ccrosswalks\u201d and \u201cbridges,\u201d are normally understood to be \u201con\u201d the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We are \u201c[constrained to apply the statutory language as best as possible as written . . . .\u201d <em>Nawrocki, </em>463 Mich at 171. In this case, the constraints created by the highly imperfect drafting of MCL 691.1401(e) require us to apply the modifying clause \u201con the highway\u201d to <em>all </em>the terms listed as \u201cincluded\u201d as \u201chighways,\u201d and, in doing so, give these words proper grammatical effect. See <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v </em>Ward, 460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (stating that \u201cstatutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context\u201d). Accordingly, because it is grammatically anomalous to say that a \u201cculvert,\u201d \u201csidewalk,\u201d or \u201ctrailway\u201d is \u201con\u201d the highway,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> prepositions that more precisely describes these areas\u2019 relationship to the highway must be used to give this sentence proper grammatical mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ing. Thus, a \u201chighway,\u201d as defined by MCL 691.1401(e), includes a \u201cculvert\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the highway; a \u201csidewalk\u201d \u201cadjacent to\u201d the highway; and importantly, a \u201ctrail-way\u201d \u201cadjacent to\u201d the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">In conclusion, in drafting the statutory definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e), the Legislature created two classes of terms that are considered \u201chighways\u201d\u2014 (1) those terms that are \u201chighways\u201d per se, i.e., a \u201cpublic highway, road, or street that is open for public travel,\u201d and (2) those terms \u201cincluded\u201d as highways, such as \u201cbridges, sidewalks, crosswalks, and culverts,\u201d but only if they are \u201con the highway.\u201d Notably, when the Legislature amended the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in 1999 to add \u201ctrailways,\u201d it added this term to the second category of covered structures, each of which is modified by \u201con the highway.\u201d If the Legislature had intended that <em>all </em>trailways \u2014 no matter where they are located and irrespective of their relationship to the highway \u2014 should be considered highways, it would have added \u201ctrailways\u201d to the first category of covered structures. But it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">By including \u201con the highway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e), the Legislature limited the universe of \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts\u201d that are considered \u201chighways\u201d for purposes of the highway exception. This limitation is perfectly reasonable because it would be odd if a sidewalk in the middle of a meadow or a <em>trailway in the middle of a forest, </em>neither of which is anywhere near a bona fide highway, were considered a \u201chighway\u201d for purposes of governmental immunity. Therefore, it is important to give effect to this essential limiting clause, no matter how inartfully worded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The questions of statutory interpretation presented in this case are of first impression and, as with many cases involving the highway exception to governmental immunity, present some challenges due to the drafting of MCL 691.1401(e) and MCL 691.1402(1). However, by using traditional tools of construction and following the guidance of this Court\u2019s previous governmental immunity jurisprudence, we interpret the statute as best we can and reach what we believe is the most reasonable interpretation. In doing so, we conclude that the Little Manistee Trail is not a \u201chighway\u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>governmental immunity. The Trail is properly classified as a \u201ctrailway\u201d within the distinct meaning of that word in Michigan\u2019s statutory law, and, because it is not a \u201ctrailway ... on the highway,\u201d it is not a covered \u201ctrail-way\u201d under MCL 691.1401(e).

The absence of caselaw underscores the fact that the state has <em>never </em>been held to have a duty under the highway exception to maintain and repair recreational trails that permit ORVs and snowmobiles.

Although we rest our decision on the threshold determination that the Trail is not a \u201chighway,\u201d we take this opportunity to make clear that the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of MCL 691.1402(1) was nonetheless correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Our caselaw has consistently treated the exemptions from liability provided to the state and county road commissions in MCL 691.1402(1) as absolute. In <em>Sutiles, </em>457 Mich at 644, a case in which this Court construed the pre-1999 version of the statute before the reference to \u201ctrailways\u201d was added, we identified three installations that were categorically excluded from the state\u2019s and the counties\u2019 liability: \u201c(1) sidewalks, (2) crosswalks, or (3) any other installation outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d See also <em>Nawrocki, </em>463 Mich at 161 (\u201c[T]he limited duty does <em>not </em>extend to \u2018sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u2019 \u201d), and <em>Robinson, </em>486 Mich at 7 (employing the same approach and treating as absolute the exclusion of sidewalks from the state\u2019s duty). In accordance with the interpretation of the fourth sentence of MCL 691.1402(1) in <em>Suttles, Nawrocki, </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>the Court of Appeals properly determined that the addition of \u201ctrailway\u201d to the statute simply added a fourth specific area that is categorically excluded from the state\u2019s and the county road commissions\u2019 liability. That is, after the 1999 amendments, in which \u201ctrailway\u201d was added between \u201csidewalk\u201d and \u201ccrosswalk,\u201d the state\u2019s limited duty under the highway exception does not extend to four specific areas: (1) <em>all </em>sidewalks, (2) <em>all </em>trailways, (3) <em>all </em>crosswalks, and (4) any other installation outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b501-4\">MARILYN Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At\">(dissenting).

At issue is whether the Little Manistee Trail (the Trail) is a \u201chighway\u201d \u2014 or more pointedly, a road \u2014 for purposes of the governmental tort liability act (GTLA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d as defined by MCL 691.1401(e), then the state is under a duty to maintain it in reasonable repair. If it is not a highway, the state has no such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The majority holds that the Trail is not a highway and that defendants are entitled to summary disposition. It concludes that they have no liability to plaintiff because the highway exception to governmental immunity does not apply. In reaching this conclusion, the majority injects confusion into what should be a simple analysis. I dissent because I believe that all signs, figurative and literal, indicate that the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d under the GTLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Plaintiff was riding an off-road vehicle (ORV) on the Little Manistee Trail in Lake County when she ran over some exposed boards partially buried in the traveled portion of the roadway. She was thrown from her ORV against a tree trunk, resulting in spinal injuries and paralysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The portion of the Trail on which plaintiffs accident occurred is designated as an \u201cORV route,\u201d meaning that any motor vehicle licensed by the Secretary of State can operate on it. The vehicles permitted there include, but are not limited to, conventional cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, ORVs, all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, semi-trucks, and tractor-trailers. Furthermore, the Trail has myriad signs that guide and direct traffic. Among them are stop signs, two-way-traffic signs, mixed-traffic signs, weight-limit signs, and curve/turn designations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">After plaintiff was injured, she filed suit against the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the state of Michigan, alleging that they had failed to adequately maintain the Trail. Plaintiff theorized that, under the highway exception to governmental immunity, defendants had a duty to maintain the Trail in reasonable repair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that the Trail is not a \u201chighway\u201d and that they have no duty to maintain it. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d under the GTLA. It reasoned that the act\u2019s definition of \u201chighway\u201d specifically includes \u201ctrailways.\u201d Because it is undisputed that the Little Manistee Trail is a trailway, defendants were under a duty to maintain it in reasonable repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded that, although the Trail falls within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e), the limited liability afforded by the highway exception to governmental immunity applies to all trailways. Thus, it held that the highway exception does not apply to plaintiffs suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case involves a question of statutory interpretation, which we also review de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The GTLA provides immunity for governmental agencies. Under MCL 691.1407, governmental agencies<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are generally immune from tort liability while engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function unless an exception to this general rule applies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The only exception germane to this appeal is the highway exception, MCL 691.1402, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(1). .. [E]ach governmental agency having jurisdiction over a highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. A person who sustains bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of a governmental agency to keep a highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Thus, it is important to determine if plaintiff was driving her ORV on a \u201chighway\u201d as that term is defined in the GTLA. The act provides at MCL 691.1401(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cHighway\u201d means a public highway, road, or street that is open for public travel and includes bridges, sidewalks, trail-ways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway. The term highway does not include alleys, trees, and utility poles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">However, this provision defines neither \u201croad\u201d nor \u201copen for public travel.\u201d We may therefore consult a dictionary for a further understanding of this language.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\"><em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>defines \u201croad\u201d as \u201ca long, narrow stretch with a leveled or paved surface, made for traveling by motor vehicle, carriage, etc.; street or highway.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With respect to the phrase \u201copen for public travel,\u201d it defines \u201copen\u201d as, among other things, \u201cwithout restrictions as to who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>may participate^] accessible or available[.]\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cPublic\u201d is defined as \u201cof, pertaining to, or affecting a population or a community as a whole[;] open to all persons[.]\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These dictionary definitions comport with the common understanding of a \u201chighway\u201d as used in MCL 691.1401(e), that is, a road, paved or otherwise, that is available for use by everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, focusing on the language in the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The language provides \u201c \u2018the most reliable evidence\u2019 \u201d of the Legislature\u2019s intent,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and when construing a statute, a court must read the language in it as a whole.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Considering these rules, as well as our traditional canons of statutory interpretation, I conclude that the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d within the intent of the GTLA. First, it is a road that is open for public travel. It fits within the common understanding of a \u201croad\u201d because it is a leveled surface designed for travel by motor vehicles and maintained so as to be suitable for vehicular travel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And although the Trail is not paved, a road need not be covered with concrete or asphalt to qualify as a road, given that the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201croad\u201d includes \u201ca leveled <em>or </em>paved surface . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is undisputed that any motor vehicle properly licensed by the Secretary of State is permitted to travel on the Trail, subject to the applicable weight limitations marked on posted signs. Thus, the Trail satisfies the definition of \u201croad\u201d because it is a thoroughfare \u201cmade for traveling by motor vehicle . . . etc.[.]\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I take strong exception to the majority\u2019s claim that the Trail is not \u201cmade for traveling by motor vehicle [s].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> One need only consider the photographs in the Appendix to this opinion to see that the Trail was designed for extensive use by motor vehicles. The signage alerts Trail users to the presence of ORVs, automobiles, and 5-, 9-, and 15-ton trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Second, the Trail is open for public travel. It is beyond question that it is open year-round. During spring, summer, and fall months, it is used by ORVs and motorcycles, as well as by cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, and large semi-trucks. During winter months, it is also used by snowmobiles and motor vehicles to the extent weather conditions permit. No statutory prohibition limits its use to certain seasons or to a particular type of use. Consequently, the Little Manistee Trail is accessible to the general public and is open for public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The majority asserts that the Trail\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose and use is for recreational vehicles, and this purpose eclipses the highly limited use of the Trail by motor vehicles.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It also claims that \u201c[t]he recreational use of the Trail is so totally defining that we can easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>understand why no party .. . considered that the Trail might be a \u2018road\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But defendant\u2019s expert, on whose testimony the majority relies, stated that the Trail \u201cis open to properly registered ORVs and street licensed vehicles.\u201d This testimony answers the question of whether the Trail qualifies as a \u201croad.\u201d More importantly, it is immaterial to determining whether the Trail is a road if it is used more frequently by semi-trucks, ORVs, or pedestrians. Indeed, there is no statutory basis for distinguishing between primary and secondary uses of a road.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the majority has impermissibly overrun the Legislature\u2019s definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e) and replaced it with a judicially created \u201cpurpose of use\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Because the Trail is a \u201croad\u201d that is \u201copen for public travel,\u201d it is necessarily a \u201chighway\u201d as that term is defined in MCL 691.1401(e). The ramifications of this conclusion are clear: governmental agencies, in this case the DNR and the state of Michigan, have an affirmative duty to maintain it in such reasonable repair as to make it safe and convenient for public travel. To the extent the Court of Appeals held otherwise, it erred.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Avjq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>THE MAJORITY\u2019S FLAWED ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The majority\u2019s statutory interpretation is flawed. The first step in interpreting a statute is analyzing its language, a maxim that appears in virtually every statutory-interpretation-centric dispute before the Court.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Yet the majority\u2019s attention to defining \u201chighway\u201d as used in the GTLA strays from the GTLA and travels to the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), MCL 324.101 <em>et seq. </em>And it engages in this expedition not to properly define or apply the term \u201chighway,\u201d but to define and apply the term \u201ctrailway.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It does this notwithstanding the fact that the resolution of this case hinges on the meaning of \u201chighway,\u201d not the meaning of \u201ctrailway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Under the GTLA, a \u201chighway\u201d is a \u201croad . . . that is open for public travel.\u201d As I have explained in detail earlier, that definition applies to the Little Manistee Trail, regardless of whether the Trail qualifies as a \u201ctrailway\u201d in an unrelated act. The majority\u2019s departure from the GTLA and foray into NREPA ignores its duty to first analyze the language of the statute that is at issue. And it is superfluous when the language of the GTLA can be straightforwardly applied, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">A second analytical maxim that guides us is that the Court must avoid a statutory interpretation that would render any part of a statute surplusage or nugatory.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this regard, the first clause of MCL 691.1401(e) provides that a \u201chighway\u201d is \u201ca public highway, road, or street that is open for public travel. . . .\u201d The next clause indicates that \u201chighways\u201d include \u201cbridges, sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway.\u201d Hence, a \u201croad . . . that is open for public travel\u201d is a \u201chighway,\u201d and so too are \u201cbridges, sidewalks, [and] trail-ways ... on the highway.\u201d Therefore, even if the Trail is not a \u201ccovered trailway,\u201d as the majority concludes, it certainly is a road. The majority\u2019s statutory interpretation glosses over the first clause of the statute and, in fact, renders it surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The majority counters this point with the assertion that my analysis renders the term \u201ctrailway\u201d surplus-age. But the flaw in its argument is apparent from the outset when it concedes that a trailway only sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>falls within the definition of a \u201croad.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Trail precisely fits within the majority\u2019s definition of a \u201croad.\u201d It is a \u201ctrailway,\u201d within the majority\u2019s definition, that is open for public travel by motor vehicles. Thus, it at once satisfies the majority\u2019s imported meaning of \u201ctrailway\u201d and the definition we both agree upon of \u201croad.\u201d But because the Trail satisfies the majority\u2019s definition of \u201ctrailway,\u201d the majority renders \u201croad\u201d mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">I agree with the majority that trailways that are not open for public travel by motor vehicles are not roads. Hence, my conclusion that the Trail is a \u201croad\u201d does not consume \u201ctrailways\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e). Nor does it render the inclusion of \u201ctrailways\u201d in that statute surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Similarly, the majority asserts that the GTLA makes clear that only certain trailways will be considered highways,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> presumably those that run alongside a highway. But this reasoning begs the big question: Is the Trail a \u201ctrailway\u201d or a \u201croad\u201d within the intent of the statute? If it qualifies as a \u201croad,\u201d as I have concluded, it is irrelevant that it does not run alongside a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Finally, the majority claims that I \u201cnever even attempt[] to give meaning to \u2018trailway\u2019 \u201d and that my dissent is \u201centirely unresponsive to [its] opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> I have noted that it serves no useful purpose to consider whether the Trail is a \u201ctrailway\u201d as defined by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>unrelated act. I invite the reader to compare the straightforward analysis set forth in this dissent with the trail-to-nowhere approach of the majority opinion. It is the majority that disdains the language of the GTLA indicating that a \u201chighway\u201d is a \u201croad . . . that is open for public travel.\u201d This Court\u2019s function is to give meaning to the words of a statute, but the majority fails to apply that principle to the most obvious meaning and application of \u201chighway.\u201d Instead of clarifying the law, the majority risks making the Court the \u201cobfuscator of last resort.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In sum, this is a vanilla case of statutory interpretation that is easily resolved. MCL 691.1401(e) provides that a \u201chighway\u201d is a \u201croad\u201d that is \u201copen for public travel.\u201d The Little Manistee Trail satisfies this definition because it is a leveled surface designed for vehicular travel that is always accessible to the public. The majority \u201cswerves and dodges\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the actual language of the statute and reaches an unsupportable conclusion to the contrary.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d within the meaning of MCL 691.1401(e).</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">Cavanagh and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Marilyn Kelly, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> See the Appendix to this opinion; see also plaintiffs appendix filed in this appeal, pp 14-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> MCL 691.1402(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> <em>Duffy v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 9, 2010 (Docket No. 289644).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b503-12\"> <em>Shay v Aldrich, </em>487 Mich 648, 656; 790 NW2d 629 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b503-13\"> <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, </em>487 Mich 289, 297; 791 NW2d 897 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b503-14\"> MCL 691.1401(d) defines \u201cgovernmental agency\u201d as including the \u201cstate.\u201d MCL 691.1401(c) defines \u201cstate\u201d as \u201cthe state of Michigan and its agencies, departments, commissions, courts, boards, councils, and statutorily created task forces and includes every public university and college of the state .. ..\u201d Thus, as the majority opinion correctly notes, both defendants are within the scope of the GTLA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b503-15\"> The statutory exceptions to governmental immunity include (1) the \u201chighway\u201d exception, MCL 691.1402, (2) the \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d exception, MCL 691.1405, (3) the \u201cpublic building\u201d exception, MCL 691.1406, (4) the \u201cproprietary function\u201d exception, MCL 691.1413, (5) the \u201cgovernmental hospital\u201d exception, MCL 691.1407(4), and (6) the sewage-disposal-system-event exception, MCL 691.1417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b503-11\"> <em>Duffy v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>488 Mich 861 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b504-11\"> <em>Klooster v City of Charlevoix, </em>488 Mich 289, 304; 795 NW2d 578 (2011).

But it fails to cite the language on which it relies. In fact, there is no statutory language in MCL 691.1401(e); the rest of the GTLA; the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), MCL 324.101 <em>et seq.; </em>or any other act that allows the majority to draw this distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, I need not reach the issue of whether the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201ctrailway\u201d within the definition of \u201chighway\u201d in MCL 691.1401(e). This is because the Trail is so clearly a \u201croad\u201d that is \u201copen for public travel\u201d and, thus, a highway. I do not consider the application of NREPA\u2019s definition of \u201cforest road,\u201d see MCL 324.81101(f), for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"AcJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The majority suggests that, by not defining \u201ctrailway,\u201d I ignore the central issue in this case. Its position in this regard is remarkable, given that I have addressed an argument raised by the parties \u2014 one that the majority entirely ignores. The issue before us is not the definition of \u201ctrailway\u201d in NREPA, but whether the Little Manistee Trail is a \u201chighway\u201d under the GTLA. Even assuming arguendo that the Trail is not a \u201ccovered trailway\u201d as the majority concludes, it is a <em>road </em>and, thus, a \u201chighway\u201d under MCL 691.1401(e).</p>\n<p id=\"AYz\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s preoccupation with the fact that the parties argued that the Trail is a \u201ctrailway\u201d in the lower courts is also misplaced.

Thus, because the definition of \u201chighway\u201d includes \u201croad,\u201d and plaintiff argued in this Court that the Trail is a \u201croad,\u201d the fact that the parties previously argued that it is a \u201ctrailway\u201d is inconsequential.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Briggs Tax Serv, LLC v Detroit Pub Sch, </em>485 Mich 69, 76; 780 NW2d 753 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> See part IV of the majority opinion.
