Respondent\u2019s multitudinous acts of proved misconduct sketch a common theme: respondent failed to follow the law, apparently believing that it simply did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Instances of respondent\u2019s judicial misconduct include \u201cfixing\u201d (personally and surreptitiously dismissing) traffic citations issued to himself, his spouse, and his staff; preventing the transmission of or altering court information that was legally required to have been transmitted to the Secretary of State;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing cases without conducting hearings or involving the prosecutor; failing to follow plea agreements; and making false statements under oath during the JTC hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In this case, respondent\u2019s fixing of traffic tickets issued to himself, his family, and staff <em>alone </em>warrants the most severe of sanctions. However, respondent\u2019s substantiated misconduct is much more extensive. The duration, scope, and sheer number of respondent\u2019s substantiated acts of misconduct are without precedent in Michigan judicial disciplinary cases. Respondent\u2019s long-term pattern of judicial misconduct constitutes a negation of the proper exercise of judicial authority that more than justifies the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>We order respondent\u2019s removal from office. Moreover, we order the JTC to submit a bill of costs, itemizing what portion of the costs may be attributed to the conduct or statements of respondent that give rise to liability for the payment of \u201ccosts, fees, and expenses incurred by the [JTC] in prosecuting the complaint ....\u201d MCR 9.205(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On November 12, 2010, the JTC filed Formal Complaint No. 87 against Judge Justin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that he had committed judicial misconduct in violation of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCR 9.104(A)(1), (2), and (4)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>MCR 9.205;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Canons 1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 2(A) through (C),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>3(A)(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (4), and (5)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct. The complaint alleged eight counts of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">A. THE FINDINGS OF THE MASTER</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On November 29, 2010, this Court appointed the Honorable Pamela J. McCabe as master to hear the case. The master\u2019s report, filed on March 24, 2011, concluded that seven of the eight counts of judicial misconduct alleged in the amended complaint had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The allegations and the relevant findings of fact are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>COUNT 1: INAPPROPRIATE DISMISSAL OF CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The first count of the complaint alleged that respondent had dismissed cases and inappropriately disposed of cases without holding hearings and without notice to or the authorization of the prosecuting attorney. Perhaps most significant, the master found that this count had been proved and included respondent\u2019s admission that he dismissed four citations issued to himself,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> five citations issued to his wife,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and citations issued to his court officer and court reporter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All the tickets had been dismissed \u201cafter explanation,\u201d but without a hearing or advising the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Beyond concluding that respondent had fixed tickets for himself, his wife, and his staff, the master also concluded that respondent had engaged in a pattern of favoritism and \u201cconferred favored status on many who came before him.\u201d The master\u2019s report cited two illustrations of respondent\u2019s pattern of leniency and favoritism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The master also found that at the hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>examiner had proved \u201cmany cases\u201d in which respondent dismissed charges or dismissed cases without the knowledge or approval of the prosecutor. The master noted that this was often done at the arraignment, when the prosecutor was not present. The master cited two examples in support of her conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As one might expect when a judge refuses to allow one party to know about, much less participate in, a judicial proceeding, the master rejected respondent\u2019s claims that he only dismissed cases if a \u201cdismissal was inevitable\u201d and that he only dismissed citations when presented \u201cwith solid evidence justifying such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>COUNT 2: COUET RECORD ABSTRACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The second count of the complaint, which the master concluded had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence, alleged that respondent had improperly altered, deleted, or stopped summaries of court records from being transmitted to the Secretary of State as required by MCL 257.732. The master found that respondent had entered or caused to be entered false information into the court\u2019s judicial information system, causing the cancellation of the abstracts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Additionally, the master found that respondent had engaged in a pattern of dismissing, in violation of the law, tickets that may properly be dismissed under certain circumstances<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and removed court record abstracts for such tickets in violation of the law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>master rejected respondent\u2019s claim that he \u201calways saw proof of insurance\u201d before dismissing those tickets. In addition to the fact that most of the cases presented were dismissed off the record, the master identified two specific instances indicating that proof of insurance had not, in fact, always been provided before tickets were dismissed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The master also found that respondent had prevented court record abstracts from being transmitted to the Secretary of State or caused abstracts to be deleted in violation of the law. In 2007, the chief judge of the 12th District Court became aware that respondent had deleted an abstract and discussed this with respondent. Respondent admitted that he had mistakenly deleted the abstract. The chief judge told respondent to discontinue this practice. However, because respondent continued the practice of stopping or deleting court record abstracts, the chief judge removed respondent\u2019s authority to directly access the relevant portion of the court\u2019s computer system in 2009. The master found that respondent, undeterred, used others to continue this practice: respondent \u201csent \u2018stacks\u2019 of notes to his court clerk\u201d ordering her to \u201cstop abstracts in cases which should be properly abstracted.\u201d In fact, respondent acknowledged that he had caused court record abstracts to be stopped in order to \u201cavoid further suspension\u201d of a defendant\u2019s driving privileges. The master found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>respondent \u201cstopped multiple convictions for the same defendant, deleted abstracts years after conviction, and for cases assigned to other judges.\u201d Moreover, the master concluded that respondent\u2019s act of directly stopping abstracts and ordering his clerk to do the same violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">COUNT 3: EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The master found that the third count of the complaint had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence because respondent had \u201cengaged in ex parte communications with defendants that resulted in dismissal of cases\u201d in violation of Canon 3(A)(4). The master noted several cases in support of her conclusion, including ex parte communications between respondent and his wife before he dismissed her five tickets, as well as ex parte communications between respondent and his staff members before dismissing their tickets. The master also cited respondent\u2019s communications with Roscina Ragland, as described later in the discussion of count seven, and respondent\u2019s ex parte communications with a woman named Jaime Chapman.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The master indicated that respondent admitted having dismissed cases after \u201cdiscussing the matters in the hallway\u201d without the involvement of the prosecuting attorney because doing so provided \u201coptimum, convenient service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>COUNT 4: FAILURE TO FOLLOW PLEA AGREEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The master found that the fourth count of the complaint had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence because respondent had failed to follow plea agreements between the prosecuting attorney and defendants without advising the prosecutor. Respondent admitted that he had dismissed or reduced charges without the prosecutor\u2019s authorization after the defendant and prosecutor had reached a plea agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In other instances, respondent refused to order that a defendant pay the costs of prosecution after the defendant specifically agreed to pay those costs as part of a negotiated plea agreement. The master noted that respondent did not order costs in \u201cmost of the cases\u201d the examiner presented to the master. While respondent claimed that he did not order payment of the costs of prosecution because \u201cit would have been illegal to assess them,\u201d the master rejected this rationalization because respondent\u2019s pattern of cost imposition did not correlate to its legality.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By respondent\u2019s admission, he ordered costs when there was no statutory authority to do so and failed to order them when the law expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>allowed it.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rather than legal authority being the pivotal consideration in deciding whether costs would be imposed, the master found that there was \u201cno philosophical or legal basis\u201d underlying the imposition of costs. \u201cThe standard for respondent seemed to be whether the defendant could pay, whether there would be any money to the court\u201d after costs were paid, and whether the defendant received a favorable plea bargain from the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">COUNT 5: INAPPROPRIATE DELAYS</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The master found that the fifth count of the complaint had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence because respondent had \u201cfailed to promptly dispose of the business of the court,\u201d resulting in \u201cdozens of cases\u201d that were \u201cpending for years.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The master also noted several cases that had been serially adjourned and left open for extended periods until the defendants complied with special bond conditions imposed by respondent, including writing book reports, getting a driver\u2019s license restored, or getting an A in math. Respondent\u2019s continued adjournments and delays resulted in \u201cchaos\u201d for the court staff, difficulty tracking files, and larger caseloads. The master found that after numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>adjournments and delays, some defendants \u201ceventually failed to appear\u201d to court and were arrested and imprisoned without bond as a consequence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The master noted that while these cases were delayed, defendants frequently committed new offenses, which were \u201coftentimes disposed of with no penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The master rejected respondent\u2019s claim that the excessive delays were proper because he had the authority to delay sentencing for one year<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and could place a defendant on probation for up to two years.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Respondent claimed that he had the authority to delay a defendant\u2019s sentencing for as long as four years. The master found that respondent\u2019s claim was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cappear[ed] to be made up after the fact.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The master also rejected respondent\u2019s claim that extended delays were comparable to a specialty court and that cases were delayed for \u201cprolonged periods\u201d for \u201csalutary purposes.\u201d Rather, the master concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201c[i]t was respondent\u2019s practice to hold defendants for unspecified periods of time, unsentenced, for completion of tasks that did not necessarily address the offense for which the defendants were being sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">COUNT 6: PEACE BONDS</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The master found that the sixth count of the complaint, which alleged that respondent did not follow the proper procedures when imposing peace bonds, had <em>not </em>been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. While respondent \u201clacked due diligence in not knowing the law\u201d regarding peace bonds, there was no evidence of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">COUNT 7: INTERFERENCE WITH A CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The master found that the seventh count of the complaint, which alleged that respondent had improperly interfered with a case assigned to another judge, had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. Respondent had a conversation with Roscina Ragland regarding her landlord-tenant case before 12th District Court Judge Michael J. Klaeren. Ragland, described by respondent as a \u201cfrequent flyer,\u201d showed respondent an order of eviction issued by Judge Klaeren. The previous day, Judge Klaeren had declined to stay the order of eviction as Ragland\u2019s counsel requested. Believing that Ragland was being \u201cabused,\u201d respondent approached Judge Klaeren and spent 30 to 45 minutes attempting to persuade him to stay the order of eviction. When that effort was unsuccessful, respondent contacted the court\u2019s process server, Emmanuel Morales. Respondent told Morales that both Morales and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201ccould be sued\u201d if the writ were executed. Judge Klaeren held a hearing and issued a second writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>because Mr. Morales was \u201cafraid to execute the writ.\u201d The master rejected respondent\u2019s claim that his activities were indistinguishable from the actions determined not to constitute judicial misconduct in <em>In re Hultgren,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">COUNT 8: MISREPRESENTATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The master found that the eighth count of the complaint, which alleged that respondent had made misrepresentations to the JTC, had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Specifically, in respondent\u2019s response to the 28-day notice provided by the JTC,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> respondent admitted dismissing tickets without hearings or without authorization from the prosecutor, but stated that the dismissals were \u201cwithout objection in the end.\u201d This statement, according to the master, falsely implied that the dismissals had been done with prosecutorial knowledge and approval. Additionally, respondent\u2019s response to the 28-day letter stated that he only dismissed cases \u201cwhen a dismissal was inevitable\u201d and only when \u201cpresented with solid evidence\u201d justifying dismissal. These statements were found to be false because the prosecutors had no knowledge that cases were being dismissed, they would not have consented to dismissal, and the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>lished that respondent dismissed tickets \u201cwith no evidence shown whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Similarly, respondent was found to have made false statements in his response to the 28-day letter and his answer regarding abstracts required to be sent to the Secretary of State. Respondent stated that he never altered or deleted an abstract and that court staff, rather than respondent, sent the relevant information to the Secretary of State. This was found to be a false statement, as respondent acknowledged having the ability to directly access the relevant portion of the court\u2019s computer system until his access was revoked because of his misuse. Respondent\u2019s response also stated that he merely informed \u201cthe [Secretary of State] of changes in the status of a case\u201d and that the reasons given by respondent for the correction of abstracts \u201chave been accurate.\u201d These assertions were determined to be false. Respondent admitted at the hearing that the code \u201csent in error\u201d had been entered \u201cin order to cancel an abstract\u201d that had otherwise properly been transmitted to the Secretary of State. Moreover, there was \u201cabundant proof\u201d that, after defendants pleaded guilty, respondent \u201cstopped, or had stopped, abstracts which were statutorily required to be sent to the [Secretary of State].\u201d The master also noted that respondent \u201cremoved or deleted abstracts\u201d sometimes \u201cyears after conviction\u201d when, in fact, there had been no change in the status of a case. Indeed, the master found \u201cabundant evidence\u201d showing that respondent \u201croutinely and frequently directly stopped, or had a clerk stop, abstracts for the sole purpose of avoiding negative consequences from the Secretary of State.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Further, at the hearing before the master and in his response to the 28-day letter, respondent stated that he did not order defendants to pay the costs of prosecution because it was illegal and that \u201cmost of the cases which included [costs of prosecution] as part of the plea bargain did not qualify.\u201d This assertion was found to be false because the \u201cfacts admitted at the hearing\u201d showed that respondent ordered costs in cases that did not qualify under the statute and failed to order costs when it was statutorily permissible. Rather, the master held that respondent\u2019s reasons for not ordering costs \u201chad to do with what the defendant could afford and whether the court would get any money\u201d after the costs were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">B. THE DECISION AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE JTC</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">After hearing oral argument, the JTC issued its decision and recommendation for discipline. The JTC adopted the master\u2019s findings of fact \u201cin their entirety,\u201d concluding that counts 1,2,3,4, 5, 7, and 8 of the amended complaint had been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The JTC determined that respondent\u2019s misconduct warranted removal from office and \u201chighlight[ed] five particular factual findings\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> as well as respondent\u2019s misleading statements to the commission as providing the basis for the JTC\u2019s \u201cconclusion regarding the appropriate sanction.\u201d The JTC discussed at length the highlighted findings, but reiterated that it \u201cadopt[ed] and incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>rate[d]\u201d the \u201cbalance of the master\u2019s factual findings\u201d to the extent \u201cnot already set forth\u201d in the JTC\u2019s decision. The JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s misconduct violated Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30; MCR 9.104(A)(1), (2), and (4); MCR 9.205 and 9.208(B); Canons 1, 2(A), 2(B), 2(C), 3(A)(1), 3(A)(4), and 3(A)(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct; MCL 257.32\u00bf(3); MCL 257.907(9); and MCL 257.732. Additionally, the JTC concluded that respondent violated the disqualification rules in MCR 2.003(C) and Canon 3(C) in failing to recuse himself from cases involving himself and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In determining the appropriate sanction, the JTC assessed the factors set forth in <em>In re Brown </em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finding that respondent\u2019s misconduct implicated six of the seven <em>Brown </em>factors, the JTC concluded that a severe sanction was warranted. In addition to the <em>Brown </em>factors, the JTC noted that respondent had a prior history of judicial misconduct. In 1998, respondent received a public censure for misconduct wherein he \u201cintentionally manipulated fines and costs in an effort to punish the City of Jackson for its actions involving the pensions of certain city employees.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The JTC noted that the present case was similar to the prior case of misconduct in that \u201crespondent kept engaging in wrongful behavior after the Chief Judge directed him to stop.\u201d Given respondent\u2019s \u201cdeliberate and repeated decisions to circumvent the judicial process,\u201d the JTC concluded that respondent was \u201cunfit to sit as a judge\u201d and therefore recommended his removal. The JTC also asked that respondent be assessed costs in the amount of $24,934.19 for his intentional misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>ii</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The power to discipline a judge resides exclusively in this Court, but it is exercised on recommendation of the JTC.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This Court reviews de novo the factual findings and the recommendations of the JTC.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The proper standard of proof to be used in judicial tenure cases is a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On review of the entire record, we agree with and adopt in full the factual findings of the master and the JTC. Furthermore, we adopt the disciplinary recommendation of the JTC. It is fair to say that the common themes running throughout respondent\u2019s substantiated acts of misconduct are a calculated disregard for the law and an intentional effort to undermine the judicial process, as deemed warranted or expedient by the respondent. Such misconduct evinces an unacceptable disregard for the role of judge as well as disdain for due process and the right of parties to a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Respondent\u2019s actions are completely antithetical to the privilege of being a judge and more than adequately justify his removal from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">To begin with, respondent\u2019s misconduct in fixing his own tickets and the tickets of his wife and staff, standing alone, is <em>more </em>than sufficient to justify his removal from office. Respondent used the authority of his office to bypass the normal adjudicatory process and permit wrongdoers to evade responsibility for violating the law. Respondent summarily dismissed four tickets issued to himself, five tickets issued to his wife, and two tickets issued to members of his staff. Respondent acknowledged that he dismissed these tickets, but claimed that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>misconduct he committed when doing so was failing to recuse himself from the cases. Respondent\u2019s assertion presumes that, apart from respondent\u2019s failure to recuse himself, the cases were otherwise properly resolved through the judicial process and the dismissals were conducted in accordance with Michigan rules and procedures, as one would ordinarily expect when resolving a legal dispute. This presumption is, quite simply, false.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In 1859, this Court described \u201cjudicial power\u201d as \u201cthe power to hear and determine controversies between adverse parties, and questions in litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The fundamental purpose in resolving such controversies is quite simple: the fair ascertainment of the truth.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> While it is axiomatic that respondent could not sit as a neutral arbiter over his own cases, the simple fact of the matter is that respondent\u2019s actions were deliberately calculated to <em>ensure that no court proceedings would ever be held. </em>When respondent fixed his own tickets, for example, he apparently provided an \u201cexplanation\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> to himself and, having found his own explanation credible, simply dismissed his tickets.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The entire judicial pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>cess was consciously sidestepped. There was no public hearing, no opposing party present, no evidence presented, no cross-examination of witnesses, and none of the other mechanisms that provide a fair ascertainment of the truth.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In short, respondent deliberately abused the judicial power with which he was entrusted to prevent the truth of his own wrongdoing from being discovered. While respondent claimed that dismissing his own tickets \u201cprovided the least expensive way of handling the situation for the court,\u201d it is patently obvious that dismissing his own tickets provided respondent the least expensive resolution <em>for himself</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Respondent\u2019s intentional abuses of judicial power to benefit himself, his spouse, and his staff are inconsistent with his oath of office and deleterious to the integrity and honor of the judiciary.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s belief that he is above the law, and not \u201cas subject to the law as those that appear before\u201d him, renders him unworthy of holding judicial office.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>While respondent\u2019s misconduct in fixing his tickets and the tickets of his wife and staff warrants removal from office, respondent\u2019s misconduct was regrettably not so limited. The record shows that on numerous occasions, respondent dismissed citations and misdemeanor charges for select defendants without a hearing or notice to the prosecutor.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Respondent admits dismissing cases after \u201cdiscussing the matters in the hallway\u201d with a defendant and without advising the prosecuting attorney because he believed this manner of case resolution provided \u201coptimum, convenient service.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Respondent provides no authority for this provision of \u201coptimum, convenient service\u201d because, quite obviously, none exists. As discussed, the core of \u201cjudicial power\u201d involves the power to hear and determine controversies between adverse parties. Respondent\u2019s method of dismissing cases after having a discussion with only one side of a controversy is not a valid exercise of the judicial power; rather, it is a <em>perversion </em>of judicial power. Apparently, respondent believed that providing what he considered \u201coptimum, convenient service\u201d trumped the law and the canons of judicial ethics and gave him license to do away with the truth-finding process entirely.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Additionally, respondent felt compelled to \u201cimprove upon\u201d validly entered plea agreements between the prosecutor and defendants, even going so far as to dismiss cases or counts <em>after </em>a defendant had tendered a guilty plea to the charges. Respondent has identified no authority that would permit him to dismiss criminal charges in this manner. Indeed, such actions implicate the separation of powers principles<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> articulated in Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Also, without informing the prosecutor, respondent failed to follow plea agreements that required the payment of costs. While respondent claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>imposition of such costs was illegal, we agree with the master that the veracity of respondent\u2019s claimed belief is belied by his inconsistent pattern of ordering costs. Respondent\u2019s acts of failing to order costs as part of the plea agreement in some cases in which they were explicitly permitted by law and ordering costs in other cases in the complete absence of statutory authority undercut any claim that respondent <em>legitimately </em>believed that the imposition of costs was illegal.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Respondent\u2019s multitudinous acts of deleting or Elitering the abstracts of court records to be sent to the Secretary of State as MCL 257.732 requires or stopping them from being sent also provides a basis for removing respondent from office. By respondent\u2019s own admission, he ordered that abstracts required by law to be sent not be sent, removed or deleted validly entered abstracts, and entered false information into the system to accomplish the removal.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> However, the law is absolutely clear regarding respondent\u2019s actions: they are utterly and categorically <em>prohibited. </em>The Legislature has indicated that the \u201cfailure, refusal, or neglect of a person to comply\u201d with the reporting requirements of MCL 257.732 \u201cconstitutes misconduct in office and is grounds for removal from office.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Moreover, subject to exceptions not applicable here, \u201ca court shall not order expunction of any violation reportable to the secretary of state ... .\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Respondent argues that because MCL 257.732 imposes the duty to forward court record abstracts on \u201cmunicipal judge[s] and each clerk of a court of record,\u201d the statute is \u201cnot applicable to him\u201d because he is neither a municipal judge nor a court clerk. However, while MCL 257.732(1) does indicate that \u201cthe municipal judge or clerk of the court of record\u201d must forward the court record abstracts to the Secretary of State, the scope of MCL 257.732(14) is not so circumscribed: it applies to \u201ca person,\u201d a category that undeniably includes respondent.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Moreover, the testimony of the chief judge of the 12th District Court indicated that respondent was the only judge in that court to make entries into the court\u2019s computer system.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The evidence also established that respondent had ordered his staff to stop the entry of abstracts in violation of MCL 257.732. It simply provides no defense that respondent elected to access the system instead of court staff or ordered court staff to violate the law on his behalf. Respondent\u2019s unabashed and willful violation of the statutory requirements provides further support for the sanction of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Finally, respondent has been determined to have lied under oath during the JTC proceedings. This is entirely incompatible with judicial office and warrants removal. We summarize three instances of respondent\u2019s lying under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>During respondent\u2019s testimony, he reiterated that the reason he did not order a defendant to pay the costs of prosecution as part of a plea bargain was that such costs were \u201cnot authorized\u201d by MCL 769. If. The evidence adduced at the hearing established that this statement was a falsehood and that statutory authority was not respondent\u2019s motivating consideration in determining whether to order costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The assistant city attorney for the city of Jackson testified that when his office became aware that respondent was not abiding by plea agreements, it began monitoring respondent\u2019s compliance with the city\u2019s plea agreements by tracking approximately 130 cases between 2008 and 2009. The result of the monitoring revealed that of the cases surveyed in which there was no statutory authority to order the payment of costs, respondent ordered costs in 55 percent of them. The act of ordering costs in a <em>majority </em>of the cases for which there was no statutory authority to do so belies any claim that statutory authorization was respondent\u2019s foremost consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Furthermore, in describing why he did not impose the costs as part of a plea agreement, respondent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">And part of my problem is that, you know, I can only assess [a] total amount of so much, and if 50 or ... 100 or $200 goes into costs of prosecution, that means, with what\u2019s going to the state, that there is not a whole lot that is going to go to the county, and, of course, the county is the one that supports the court. And it seems a challenge to me, particularly in this economic climate with a number of people that we deal with and their financial situation that I can \u2014 especially since these costs of prosecution are not related very much to the actual costs to the municipality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">During the hearing, respondent was serially impeached with dozens of cases in which he ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>payment of costs despite the glaring absence of statutory authority. While respondent testified that he did not remember the specific details of the cases, he did acknowledge that he ordered the payment of costs without statutory authority because (1) \u201cthere was substantial negotiation between the township prosecutor and the defense attorney,\u201d (2) he \u201cwent along\u201d with the imposition of costs since \u201cthe defendant was willing to pay money in order to have the matter dismissed,\u201d and (3) ordering the costs of prosecution was \u201cjustified\u201d by the \u201cbenefits\u201d a defendant received by a favorable plea bargain. Respondent testified that there were \u201ctimes\u201d when it was \u201ceasier\u201d to charge both court costs <em>and </em>the costs of prosecution, while in other cases it was \u201cvery hard to do that.\u201d The record reveals the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\"><em>The Master: </em>So if I understand what you\u2019re saying, it didn\u2019t have to do with the philosophical belief or the legal standard, but it had to do with the defendant\u2019s ability to pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\"><em>Respondent: </em>That was \u2014 that was a way \u2014 that was a situation where it was easier for me to go along with my fellow judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\"><em>The Master: </em>Because the defendant couldn\u2019t pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\"><em>Respondent: </em>Because of the fact that the defendant, if the defendant had been convicted of all of the charges and had to pay fines and costs on all of the charges, they probably would have ended up paying more than they would have paid being assessed for one count and also having to pay some costs of prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\"><em>[The </em>Examiner]: ... So if I understand your answer to the judge, despite the fact you say it\u2019s illegal on these cases, economic factors caused you to violate what you say is the law; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Respondent-. </em>Certainly my concern about where fines and costs ultimately ended up affected my \u2014 my determination, and certainly was not authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Additionally, there were many cases in which respondent <em>did not order </em>payment of the costs of prosecution as part of a plea agreement, even though MCL 769.If specifically authorizes it. Respondent testified under oath that he did not order costs in these cases because the amounts were \u201cexcessive\u201d and therefore not \u201cappropriate\u201d for him to authorize. Respondent further testified that the costs of prosecution had to be \u201cjustified and documented.\u201d We conclude that these statements were also false. Respondent both ordered and failed to order costs as part of a plea agreement when the agreed-upon amounts were <em>identical </em>and failed to order the costs of prosecution when the amount contained in the plea agreement was substantially less than the amount in another. Additionally, respondent ordered costs in the complete absence of justification or documentation, contradicting any claim that costs had to be \u201cjustified and documented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Respondent acknowledged that the Jackson city attorney would generally permit a defendant charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated to plead guilty of operating a motor vehicle while visibly impaired. As part of those agreements, defendants often agreed to pay $200 for the costs of prosecution. The assistant city attorney testified that respondent failed to order costs in 78 percent of the drunk driving cases in which costs were part of the plea agreement during the relevant tracking period. Most of those cases involved costs in the amount of $200. However, in addition to failing to order costs in the amount of $200, respondent also failed to order costs when the amount in the plea agreement was much lower, such as $100 or $50. In each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>case in which respondent <em>ordered </em>costs as part of an agreement reducing the charges from operating while intoxicated to operating while visibly impaired, respondent uniformly assessed costs of $200 \u2014 an amount respondent\u2019s testimony indicated was \u201cexcessive.\u201d Moreover, respondent acknowledged at the hearing that he did not require <em>any </em>type of documentation or proof on those occasions when he ordered costs pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Lastly, while under oath, respondent indicated that his practice of \u201ctalking to people\u201d and dismissing their cases depended on defendants\u2019 \u201chaving actual proof that their position was right[.]\u201d However, this was a blatantly false statement, and one need look no further than respondent\u2019s actions dismissing the tickets of his court staff, who received citations for speeding, and his spouse, who received three citations for speeding and a citation for disobeying a stop sign. Respondent\u2019s spouse and staff did not, in fact, provide \u201cactual proof\u201d justifying dismissal of their tickets, and respondent, by dismissing the tickets himself without a hearing, \u201cconveniently\u201d precluded the officers who issued the tickets and the prosecutor from offering proof of the violations. Moreover, respondent dismissed a wide variety of cases that are simply not amenable to a defendant\u2019s providing \u201cactual proof\u201d of innocence, including, for example, speeding or driving with a suspended license. It is unclear what \u201cactual proof\u201d <em>could </em>be provided under these circumstances. Even for those cases in which it <em>was possible </em>to provide \u201cactual proof,\u201d respondent was impeached by court transcripts establishing that he dismissed cases without seeing \u201cactual proof\u201d of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Because the record fully supports the finding that respondent lied under oath, the appropriate sanction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>removal from office. Respondent\u2019s act of lying under oath categorically renders him unfit for office. As this Court has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">[o]ur judicial system has long recognized the sanctity and importance of the oath. An oath is a significant act, establishing that the oath taker promises to be truthful. As the \u201cfocal point of the administration of justice,\u201d a judge is entrusted by the public and has the responsibility to seek truth and justice by evaluating the testimony given under oath. <em>When a judge lies under oath, he or she has failed to internalize one of the central standards of justice and becomes unfit to sit in judgment of others.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">Certainly, Judicial Tenure Commission proceedings are intended to be remedial, not penal. The vast majority of misconduct found by the Judicial Tenure Commission is not fatal; rather, it reflects oversight or poor judgment on the part of a fallible human being who is a judge. <em>However, some misconduct, such as lying under oath, goes to the very core of judicial duty and demonstrates the lack of character of such a person to be entrusted with judicial privilege.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>.. . Lying under oath, as the respondent has been adjudged to have done, makes him unfit for judicial office[</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>57</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Finally, we note that respondent\u2019s other acts of substantiated judicial misconduct, while quite serious, might not warrant removal from office if taken in isolation. However, the inescapable truth is that respondent\u2019s other substantiated acts of misconduct, as well as his previous disciplinary history, <em>are not isolated, </em>but are part and parcel of respondent\u2019s pervasive pattern of misconduct and his calculated disregard for the law. As the master succinctly concluded, \u201c [respondent has repeatedly and intentionally demonstrated a defiant lack of respect for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d Respondent\u2019s clear disregard for the rule of law is incompatible with a judge\u2019s duty to uphold the law and renders him unfit for judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We order that respondent be removed from office.
