We hold that defendants may not be held vicariously hable for quid pro quo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>sexual harassment affecting public services under traditional principles of respondeat superior. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In August 2001, Livingston County deputy sheriffs arrested plaintiff, Tara Katherine Hamed, on a warrant for unpaid child support. Because plaintiff also had outstanding warrants for probation violations in Wayne County, the Livingston County deputies later transferred plaintiff to the custody of Wayne County. Wayne County deputies transported plaintiff to the Wayne County jail. When plaintiff arrived at the jail, Deputy Reginald Johnson was the only officer on duty in the inmate registry area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While alone with plaintiff, Johnson subjected her to sexually charged comments and offers for better treatment in exchange for sexual favors. Plaintiff resisted these advances, but Johnson transferred plaintiff into an area of the jail not subject to surveillance cameras and sexually assaulted her. Shortly thereafter, a female deputy transported plaintiff to another part of the jail. After her release, plaintiff reported the incident to departmental authorities. The Wayne County Sheriffs Department terminated Johnson\u2019s employment, and the state subsequently charged Johnson with criminal sexual conduct, of which he was ultimately convicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In 2003, plaintiff filed a complaint against Johnson, Wayne County, the Wayne County Sheriffs Department, and the Wayne County Sheriff, among others, alleging various claims of gross negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2006, plaintiff moved to amend her complaint, adding civil rights claims of quid pro quo and hostile-environment sexual harassment pursuant to MCL 37.2103(i). Defendants then moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), arguing that, under the CRA, jails are excluded from liability and, because defendants had no notice of Johnson\u2019s sexually harassing conduct, they could not be vicariously liable for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"pAh\">The circuit court granted defendants summary disposition in two separate orders and dismissed all of plaintiffs civil rights claims. It concluded that plaintiffs hostile-environment claim failed because defendants had no prior notice that Johnson was a sexual predator. The circuit court also dismissed plaintiffs quid pro quo sexual harassment claim on the basis that defendants are not vicariously liable for the criminal acts of sheriffs department employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Plaintiff then appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision only with regard to her quid pro quo sexual harassment claim. The Court of Appeals reversed and applied this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Champion v Nation Wide Security, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to hold that \u201c[e]mployers are vicariously liable for acts of quid pro quo sexual harassment committed by their employees when those employees use their super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>visory authority to perpetrate the harassment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals held that plaintiff had established a viable quid pro quo sexual harassment claim because \u201cJohnson used his authority as a sheriffs deputy to exploit plaintiffs vulnerability .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We granted leave to consider whether defendants may be held vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment affecting public services under MCL 37.2103(i).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We review de novo whether the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Whether defendants may be held vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment affecting a public service under the CRA is a question of law that we review de novo. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the extent that defendants\u2019 arguments require us to interpret the meaning of the CRA, our review is also de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When interpreting the meaning of a statute, we discern the Legislature\u2019s intent by examining the language used.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We read the statutory language in context and as a whole, considering the plain and ordinary meaning of every word.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the language is clear and unambiguous, then we apply the statute as written without judicial construction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>III. analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">A. QUID PRO QUO SEXUAL HARASSMENT UNDER THE CRA</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The CRA recognizes that freedom from discrimination because of sex is a civil right.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the act prohibits discrimination because of sex in employment, places of public accommodation, and public services.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> MCL 37.2103(i) broadly defines \u201cdiscrimination because of sex\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">Discrimination because of sex includes sexual harassment. Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(i) Submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition either explicitly or implicitly <em>to obtain </em>employment, public accommodations or <em>public services, </em>education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\"><em>(ii) </em>Submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication by an individual <em>is used as a factor in decisions affecting the individual\u2019s </em>employment, public accommodations <em>or public services, </em>education, or housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\"><em>(Hi) </em>The conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual\u2019s employment, public accommodations or public services, education, or housing, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment, public accommodations, public services, educational, or housing environment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The first two subdivisions of MCL 37.2301(i) describe quid pro quo sexual harassment, while the third subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>refers to hostile-environment sexual harassment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A plaintiff alleging quid pro quo sexual harassment affecting public services must show by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that he or she was subjected to any of the types of unwelcome sexual conduct or communication described in the statute and (2) that the public service provider or the public service provider\u2019s agent made submission to the proscribed conduct a term or condition of obtaining public services or used the plaintiffs submission to or rejection of the proscribed conduct as a factor in a decision affecting his or her receipt of public services.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">When the harassment was committed by an agent and the plaintiff is pursuing a civil rights claim against the principal, as in this case, a court must always \u201cdetermine the extent of the employer\u2019s vicarious liability .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We require this analysis because the CRA specifically incorporates common-law agency principles.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, if a defendant is not vicariously liable for the acts of its agent under traditional principles of respondeat superior, the plaintiffs claim under the CRA fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">B. RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The doctrine of respondeat superior is well established in this state: An employer is generally liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the torts its employees commit within the scope of their employment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It follows that \u201can employer is not liable for the torts . . . committed by an employee when those torts are beyond the scope of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This Court has defined \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018engaged in the service of his master, or while about his master\u2019s business.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Independent action, intended solely to further the employee\u2019s individual interests, cannot be fairly characterized as falling within the scope of employment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although an act may be contrary to an employer\u2019s instructions, liability will nonetheless attach if the employee accomplished the act in furtherance, or the interest, of the employer\u2019s business.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Here, there is no question that Johnson\u2019s sexual assault of plaintiff was beyond the scope of his employment as a deputy sheriff. The sexual assault was an independent action accomplished solely in furtherance of Johnson\u2019s own criminal interests. It cannot be said that any of the institutional defendants benefited in any way from Johnson\u2019s criminal assault or his exercise of unlawful authority over plaintiff. In fact, Johnson\u2019s behavior was expressly prohibited by defendants\u2019 rules regarding treatment of detainees and defendants\u2019 anti-discrimination policies, to say nothing of the criminal law. In short, there is no fair basis on which one could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>conclude that the sheriff or county themselves vicariously took part in the wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The general rule that an employer is not liable for acts of its employee outside the scope of its business, however, does not preclude vicarious liability in every instance. This Court has consistently recognized that an employer can be held liable for its employee\u2019s conduct if \u201cthe employer \u2018knew or should have known of [the] employee\u2019s <em>propensities and criminal record\u2019 \u201d </em>before that employee committed an intentional tort.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This inquiry involves an analysis of whether an employer had (1) actual or constructive knowledge of prior similar conduct and (2) actual or constructive knowledge of the employee\u2019s propensity to act in accordance with that conduct. Under this two-pronged approach, the conduct at issue may be so close in time to prior similar conduct that knowledge under the first prong gives rise to a valid inference that the conduct was foreseeable und\u00e9r the second prong. Conversely, if an employee\u2019s actions were temporally distant and the employee\u2019s recent record suggested a change in character, foreseeability would not be established.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We applied this principle in <em>Brown v Brown, </em>in which we held that the employer was not vicariously liable for a rape committed by its employee because, under the circumstances, the act was unforeseeable.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>defendant\u2019s employee repeatedly made sexually offensive comments to the plaintiff, a female coworker. The plaintiff reported the incidents to the defendant, yet it took no action, and the employee subsequently raped the plaintiff. In concluding that the employer was not vicariously liable, we noted that the employee had no prior criminal record and had never threatened to rape the plaintiff. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">[An employer] cannot reasonably anticipate that an employee\u2019s lewd, tasteless comments are an inevitable prelude to rape if those comments did not clearly and unmistakably threaten particular criminal activity that would have put a reasonable employer on notice of an imminent risk of harm to a specific victim. Comments of a sexual nature do not inexorably lead t,o criminal sexual conduct any more than an exasperated, angry comment inexorably results in a violent criminal assault.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In summary, we have consistently held that an employer\u2019s liability for the criminal acts of its employees is limited to those acts it can reasonably foresee or reasonably should have foreseen. This is because we should not expect employers to assume that their employees will disobey the law. Criminal conduct is inherently arbitrary and highly unpredictable. As we noted in <em>Brown, </em>even law enforcement agencies, which are trained in detecting and preventing crime, cannot pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>diet the occurrence of criminal acts.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Contrary to plaintiffs argument, our caselaw governing the imposition of vicarious liability on an employer requires more than simply the exercise of some form of authority by an employee. Thus, it would be anomalous to adopt a rule requiring employers that provide public services to protect against the criminal actions of their employees absent some indicia of foreseeability. Rather, foreseeability is a necessary element for imposing liability, and, as we recently stated in <em>Brown, </em>we decline to \u201ctransform the test of foreseeability <em>into </em>an \u2018avoidability\u2019 test that would merely judge in hindsight whether the harm <em>could have been </em>avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Michigan\u2019s well-established rules governing respondeat superior are further justified by the societal burden that imposing liability for unforeseen criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>actions would create. Not only would holding employers vicariously liable for such acts be unfair, but doing so would attempt to further an impossible end by requiring employers to prevent harms they cannot anticipate, which are, in essence, unpreventable. The result would be the implementation of burdensome and impractical regulations meant to oversee employee conduct. Yet because such measures are sure to fail given that criminal conduct by its nature cannot be anticipated or foreseen, employers would essentially become insurers responsible for recompensing victims for the criminal acts of their employees. The harm of adopting such a policy would also extend to potential employees with less than impeccable personal backgrounds, who would encounter barriers to employment because employers, out of an abundance of caution, would be less willing to employ these individuals out of fear that <em>any </em>prior indiscretion could be used in a lawsuit to impute knowledge to the employer that it did not have.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Applying the foreseeability analysis in this case dictates the conclusion that defendants are not legally responsible for Johnson\u2019s criminal acts. The majority of complaints against Johnson during his employment with defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>involved his failure to obey work-related policies, such as failure to report a change of home address, or unsatisfactory work performance, for example, temporarily leaving his work station while on duty. Some of the grievances filed against Johnson reflected more serious behavior, such as using a police vehicle without authorization to deliver baby formula to his home, allegedly making threatening calls to his landlord after receiving an eviction notice, and engaging in a physical altercation with a male inmate after an exchange of words.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, this past misconduct put defendants on notice of Johnson\u2019s irresponsible and aggressive tendencies, which, at most, demonstrates that defendants were aware that Johnson had a propensity to disobey work-related protocol and engage in aggressive behavior when provoked. Defendants had no actual or constructive knowledge of prior similar criminal sexual misconduct. Even the incident of aggression did not put defendants on reasonable notice that Johnson would sexually assault an inmate; violent actions do not inevitably lead to acts of criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Because Johnson\u2019s prior misconduct was not similar to the violent sexual assault he perpetrated against plaintiff, we hold that defendants may not be held vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment based on Johnson\u2019s unforeseeable criminal act under traditional principles of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>C. <em>CHAMPION V NATION WIDE SECURITY, INC, </em>AND ITS PROGENY</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Plaintiff urges us to ignore these traditional common-law principles and extend the reasoning of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Champion, </em>which referred to the Second Restatement of Agency\u2019s \u201caided-by-agency\u201d exception to the rule of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We reject this argument because, for reasons we will explain, <em>Champion </em>wrongly applied this respondeat superior exception to the CRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In <em>Champion, </em>this Court addressed, as a matter of first impression, whether an employer could be held vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment under the CRA. In that case, the plaintiff worked as a security guard, and her immediate supervisor scheduled her work, trained her, oversaw her performance, and was responsible for disciplining her. During a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>weekend shift, the supervisor, who had been making sexually suggestive comments to the plaintiff, led her to a remote area of the building, locked her in a room, and demanded sex. When the plaintiff refused, the supervisor forcibly raped her. The plaintiff sued her employer for quid pro quo sexual harassment under the CRA. The defendant argued that the supervisor was not acting as its agent when he raped the plaintiff because it had not authorized the rape.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The <em>Champion </em>Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, reasoning that \u201cunder defendant\u2019s construction, an employer could avoid liability simply by showing that it did not authorize the sexually offensive conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court indicated that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconstruction of agency principles [was] far too narrow\u201d and briefly cited in support the aided-by-agency exception articulated in \u00a7 219(2)(d) of the Second Restatement of Agency.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">[the defendant\u2019s view] fails to recognize that when an employer gives its supervisors certain authority over other employees, it must also accept responsibility to remedy the harm caused by the supervisors\u2019 unlawful exercise of that authority. From his scheduling decisions that allowed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to work alone with [the plaintiff] to his ordering of her into a remote part of the building, [the supervisor] used his supervisory power to put [the plaintiff] in the vulnerable position that led to her rape. In fact, there is little doubt that [the supervisor] would have been unable to rape [the plaintiff] but for his exercise of supervisory authority.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Citing multiple federal cases, the <em>Champion </em>Court held that \u201can employer [is] strictly liable where the supervisor accomplishes the rape through the exercise of his supervisory power over the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Court justified its holding on the basis that \u201cemployers rarely, if ever, authorize such conduct, [and consequently] employees would no longer have a remedy for quid pro quo sexual harassment.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Four years later, this Court again considered a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim in <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, a supervisor subjected the plaintiff to sexually offensive conduct. After enduring this conduct for four days, the plaintiff reported the incidents to another supervisor and ultimately sued her employer for hostile-environment and quid pro quo sexual harassment. A jury returned a verdict in the plaintiffs favor, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court of Appeals in <em>Chambers </em>referred to federal caselaw that applied the federal Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> to hold that employers are vicariously liable when a supervisor victimizes a subordinate by creating a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>This Court granted leave to consider whether principles derived from federal caselaw should apply to claims brought under Michigan\u2019s CRA. We held that courts considering claims under Michigan\u2019s CRA must adhere to Michigan precedent and the language of the CRA.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We clarified the law regarding sexual harassment in employment under the Michigan CRA and recognized that the \u201cstatute expressly addresses an employer\u2019s vicarious liability for sexual harassment committed by its employees by defining \u2018employer\u2019 to include both the employer <em>and </em>the employer\u2019s agents.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Using this definition, we determined that the Michigan CRA specifically incorporates common-law principles of respondeat superior and that \u201cwhether analyzing quid pro quo harassment or hostile environment harassment, the question is always whether it can be fairly said that the employer committed the violation \u2014 either directly or through an agent.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After our decisions in <em>Champion </em>and <em>Chambers, </em>this Court considered the doctrine of respondeat superior generally in <em>Zsigo v Hurley Med Ctr.</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although <em>Zsigo </em>did not involve a civil rights claim, the plaintiff sought to hold the defendant-employer vicariously liable for various intentional tort claims using the reasoning in <em>Champion </em>and the aided-by-agency exception to the doctrine of respondeat superior. The underlying facts involved a sexual assault perpetrated by the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>dant\u2019s employee against the plaintiff, who had been admitted as a patient in the defendant hospital. The plaintiff reported the incident and subsequently sued the hospital on the basis of the employee\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We rejected the plaintiffs theory of vicarious liability and any notion that Michigan common law recognized the aided-by-agency exception or that this Court had adopted it in Champion.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> With regard to <em>Champion\u2019s </em>reference to the aided-by-agency exception, we explained that <em>Champion </em>did not adopt the aided-by-agency exception, but referred to it \u201conly in passing and on the basis of the very distinct facts of that civil rights matter.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We further explained that <em>Champion </em>applied only in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment under MCL 37.2103(i) and, in such instances, \u201cthe sexual assault must be \u2018accomplished through the use of the supervisor\u2019s managerial powers.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We ultimately rejected the plaintiffs theory of liability because it would have subjected employers to strict liability for unforeseen acts occurring outside the scope of an employee\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>Zsigo </em>Court declined to adopt the aided-by-agency exception and limited its applicability to the specific facts of the civil rights claim in <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">D. <em>CHAMPION </em>WAS WRONGLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Because <em>Zsigo </em>involved intentional tort claims, it did not provide an opportunity to address the validity of <em>Champion </em>in the civil rights context.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>Zsigo </em>required us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to consider whether Michigan common law recognized the aided-by-agency exception, given the intentional tort claims at issue. The present matter now places <em>Champion\u2019s </em>continued validity squarely before us, and we conclude that <em>Champion </em>cannot be reconciled with <em>Chambers, Zsigo, </em>or the CRA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">First, we note that <em>Champion\u2019s </em>holding was contrary to the plain language of the CRA. As we explained in <em>Chambers, </em>the CRA specifically incorporates common-law agency principles in its definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Michigan\u2019s common-law agency principles, however, do not include the aided-by-agency exception,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and the Legislature did not modify the common law by including the aided-by-agency exception in the CRA.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The <em>Champion </em>Court failed to recognize this clear intent. Rather, like the dissenting justices here, the <em>Champion </em>Court reasoned that the remedial purpose of the civil rights law justified holding the defendant employer vicariously liable for the acts of its employee, based on an apprehension that adherence to traditional agency principles would completely foreclose employer liability for quid pro quo sexual harassment claims.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Aside from failing to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, this reasoning is flawed for two additional reasons. First, it wrongly elevates the CRA\u2019s general remedial purpose above its plain language. Such reasoning is contrary to the cornerstone of statutory interpretation, which is the rule that the plain language used is the best indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Second, the policy concern at the heart of <em>Champion </em>is fundamentally flawed because it was premised on an unfounded fear. Application of traditional agency principles does <em>not </em>foreclose employers from vicarious liability in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment claims. An employer may still be liable for and act of quid pro quo sexual harassment that was committed within the scope of employment or for a foreseeable act that was committed outside the scope of employment.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Thus, liability may certainly attach if there is sufficient cause to impute the employee\u2019s or agent\u2019s acts to the employer because the employer knew of the employee\u2019s propensity to commit the type of act involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The <em>Champion </em>Court compounded its erroneous holding by relying on federal caselaw.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Unlike the federal civil rights act, the Michigan CRA specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>incorporates Michigan common-law agency principles. Hence, unlike federal courts applying the federal civil rights act, Michigan courts applying the Michigan CRA are bound by this state\u2019s common-law agency principles. Because federal courts are not so bound, their reasoning in this context is often inapposite given that the language of the CRA must guide our decisions. For this reason, the Michigan Legislature\u2019s choice to incorporate agency principles into the CRA forecloses reliance on federal cases when determining whether a defendant will be vicariously liable under the CRA.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Finally, we note that <em>Champion </em>is contrary to both prior and subsequent caselaw. Before <em>Champion, </em>this Court had never held that an employer could be vicariously liable for the unforeseeable criminal acts of its employees. Subsequent caselaw attempted to limit Champion's applicability, but that caselaw merely demonstrated <em>Champion's </em>dubious validity. <em>Chambers </em>recognized that the CRA incorporates common-law agency principles, and <em>Zsigo </em>made it clear that the aided-by-agency exception is not a part of this state\u2019s common law. Thus, contrary to the mandates of <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Zsigo, Champion </em>requires the application of an exception to respondeat superior in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment claims that is not a part of this state\u2019s common law.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Because <em>Champion </em>requires a result contrary to prior and subsequent caselaw and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>contrary to the language of the CRA, it is clear that <em>Champion </em>is not consistent with Michigan law. Rather, when considered in the context of our jurisprudence, <em>Champion </em>stands as an isolated aberration that relies not on the plain language of the act, but purely on policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">E. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Our inquiry does not end simply because we have concluded that <em>Champion </em>was wrongly decided. Rather, we must determine whether overruling <em>Champion </em>is the most appropriate course of action. This is a decision that we do not undertake lightly and will make \u201conly. . . after careful consideration of the effect of stare decisis.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> However, we are also mindful that we are under no obligation to let stand an erroneous decision in the interest of stability and continuity.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We consider a multifactored test when determining whether to overrule precedent. The first question is whether the decision at issue was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Having already addressed this question, we must now consider whether <em>Champion </em>\u201cdefies \u2018practical workability\u2019 \u201d and \u201cwhether reliance interests would work an undue hardship . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> These factors weigh in favor of overruling <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">First, despite our attempt in <em>Zsigo </em>to limit <em>Champion </em>to claims involving quid pro quo sexual harassment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>affecting employment, the present matter demonstrates that it is not possible to limit <em>Champion </em>in this respect. No meaningful distinction can be drawn between the facts in <em>Champion </em>and those in the present matter. Both Johnson and the supervisor in <em>Champion </em>were able to commit the rapes through their positions of authority over their victims. In both cases, the employers\u2019 agents had discretionary control over their victims by virtue of their positions: the supervisor in <em>Champion </em>was able to dictate the victim\u2019s schedule and order her to certain parts of the building, and Johnson had the authority to constrain plaintiffs freedom and to move her to certain parts of the jail. Certainly factual distinctions exist between <em>Champion </em>and the present case. Johnson was not plaintiffs supervisor in an employment context, and he could not have made plaintiff come to the building where he worked, unlike the supervisor in <em>Champion. </em>Yet these dissimilarities do not detract from the fact that Johnson would not have been able to commit the sexual assault but for his position of authority over plaintiff, much like the supervisor in <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Indeed, <em>Champion\u2019s </em>distortive impact, which is manifested when a plaintiff attempts to circumvent traditional rules of respondeat superior or otherwise attempts to avoid governmental immunity by framing a claim under the CRA, is apparent in lower court decisions of this state and further demonstrates <em>Champion\u2019s </em>unworkability.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> This is because there is no way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>effectively limit the rule announced in <em>Champion, </em>despite our prior attempt to do so. The reasoning on which <em>Champion </em>justified its holding is applicable not only to every quid pro quo sexual harassment case in which a plaintiff pursues a theory of vicarious liability \u2014 regardless of whether the discriminatory conduct affected employment, public services, or accommodations \u2014 but also to intentional tort claims in which a plaintiff seeks to hold an employer vicariously liable. Under <em>Champion, </em>it will always be \u201cforeseeable\u201d that employees who possess some authority by virtue of the employment relationship will abuse the power with which they have been vested when they commit, as here, a criminal act against another in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Second, with regard to reliance interests, we cannot conclude that <em>Champion </em>\u201chas become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations\u201d that overruling it would upset any real-world reliance interests.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> For there to be reliance, knowledge of a decision \u201cmust be of the sort that causes a person or entity to attempt to conform his conduct to a certain norm before the triggering event.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> There is no indication that plaintiff or defendants relied on <em>Champion </em>by conforming their conduct before the underlying event\u2014 and, given the nature of the rule in <em>Champion, </em>it is unclear what form such reliance could have taken. It would be illogical to conclude that defendants condoned the sexual assault because of <em>Champion, </em>given that <em>Champion </em>would have imposed vicarious liability for the unforeseeable criminal acts of defendants\u2019 agent. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>would it be reasonable to suggest that plaintiff altered her conduct in rebanee on <em>Champion. </em>We simply fail to see any possible way defendants and plaintiff could assert rebanee on <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Further, when the decision at issue involves statutory law, the best indicator of society\u2019s knowledge of the law, and what society reasonably relies on, is the language of the statute itself.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> As we have explained, nothing in the language of the CRA eviscerates common-law rules of respondeat superior or otherwise engrafts the aided-by-agency exception into the statute. Accordingly, a decision to overrule <em>Champion </em>would not create any real-world dislocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Finally, further justification for overruling <em>Champion </em>can be found in the adverse practical consequences that would result from extending the case to the present matter. As we explained in <em>Zsigo, </em>\u201cit is difficult to conceive of an instance when the [aided-by-agency] exception would not apply because an employee, by virtue of his or her employment relationship with the employer[,] is always \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 the tort.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Such an all-encompassing exception would apply equally to public-service cases.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Consequently, adoption of the aided-by-agency exception would effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tively abolish the doctrine of respondeat superior in quid pro quo civil rights cases affecting public services and would result in the imposition of strict liability on governmental entities. In short, the exception would swallow the rule. Contrary to the current requirements for imposing vicarious liability, if the exception were adopted, a plaintiff would merely have to allege quid pro quo harassment and show that he or she was the victim of an intentional act by an employee in a particular custodial environment. Providers of public services would be liable for the unforeseeable criminal acts of their employees as long as claimants could couch their claims under the CRA, and the dangers of such a broad basis for seemingly unlimited strict liability, discussed earlier in this opinion, would become realities. Such a standard would apply to a wide range of public-service providers whose employees interact regularly with recipients of public services, including teachers, correctional and probation officers, physicians, nurses, and firefighters, to name a few.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Because public entities cannot increase prices or otherwise alter business practices to absorb the increased risk of liability, a governmental agency\u2019s only option may be to cut funding or curtail beneficial public programs. In justifying our decision to overrule <em>Champion </em>on this basis, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>downplay the heinous nature of the crime that plaintiff suffered. However, permitting liability against defendants under these circumstances would impose too great a burden on public-service providers and on society in general, which is clearly contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We therefore conclude that <em>Champion </em>was wrongly decided and that overruling it would not interfere with legitimate reliance interests. We overrule <em>Champion </em>because it is inconsistent with longstanding Michigan law that employers, including public-service providers, are not vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment on the basis of the unforeseeable criminal acts of their employees.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">E RESPONSE TO THE DISSENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We disagree with the dissenting justices regarding whether <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided and should be overruled. Although the dissenting justices concede that <em>Champion </em>was unprecedented, they adhere to <em>Champion\u2019s </em>reasoning to conclude that the exception to common-law agency principles is necessary to give effect to the broad purpose of the CRA and the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. Yet the dissenting justices\u2019 conclusion that <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided for this reason ignores the fundamental flaws inherent in <em>Champion. </em>Notably, the dissenting opinions, like <em>Champion, </em>do not cite any language from the CRA to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>this view, even though a statute\u2019s language is the best indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent. Instead, the dissenting justices rely on caselaw describing the CRA as \u201cremedial,\u201d just as <em>Champion </em>did, for the proposition that \u201cthe exception to common-law agency principles established in <em>Champion </em>[is] necessary to give effect to the broad purpose of the CRA.. . .\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Apparently, this \u201cnecessity\u201d is based on the dissenting justices\u2019 concern, as was the concern in <em>Champion, </em>that without the exception, discriminatory conduct would not be eradicated and the purpose of the CRA would be defeated.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> This fear vastly overstates the effect of our decision because, as we have explained, employers and public-service providers will still be vicariously liable for sexual harassment under traditional and longstanding principles of respondeat superior. In short, the dissenting justices\u2019 reliance on <em>Champion </em>itself for the proposition that <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided lacks merit for reasons we have already explained.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The dissenting justices compound their erroneous reasoning by wrongly interpreting subsequent opinions of this Court as confirming that <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided and as explicitly confirming that <em>Champion </em>adopted an exception \u201cvery similar to the aided-by-agency exception.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Contrary to the dissenting justices\u2019 view, <em>Zsigo </em>did <em>not </em>expressly confirm <em>Champion </em>in this regard, and <em>Chambers </em>did <em>not </em>expressly hold that <em>Champion </em>is a valid part of Michigan\u2019s common law, both of which <em>the </em>dissenting justices suggest.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Further, although the dissenting justices acknowledge that the CRA incorporates common-law agency principles, they then ignore the explicit and unambiguous holding in <em>Zsigo, </em>namely that this Court has never recognized the aided-by-agency exception, or a similar rule, as part of this state\u2019s common law. Despite Zsigo\u2019s unambiguous holding, the dissenting justices continue to declare that <em>Champion </em>should be applied in sexual discrimination cases because the exception can be \u201cnarrowly tailored.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The <em>Zsigo </em>majority rejected any notion that the exception had such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>boundaries, which demonstrates that <em>Zsigo </em>does not support <em>Champion </em>in this regard. Thus, it is the dissenting justices who seek to aggressively expand the law of this state, while our holding merely reaffirms and applies traditional common-law rules that have always governed in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Not surprisingly, using the faulty premise that <em>Champion\u2019s </em>reasoning is correct, the dissenting justices advocate a straightforward application of <em>Champion. </em>This approach ignores an irreconcilable tension in our law. Although <em>Champion </em>and this case are similarly framed civil rights cases involving allegations of quid pro quo sexual harassment, the conflicting dispositions in the courts below demonstrate the tension between the multiple precedents of this Court at issue in this case. The circuit court below relied on <em>Zsigo </em>to grant summary disposition to defendants, recognizing that <em>Zsigo </em>established \u201ca very clear bright line rule\u201d that an employer is not liable when an employee unforeseeably acts outside the scope of his or her employment, as was the case here. The Court of Appeals reversed, relying instead on <em>Champion, </em>which had never been applied outside the employment context, for the proposition that a public-service provider may be vicariously hable when its employee uses his or her \u201cauthority over a subordinate as a means of subjecting that subordinate to abusive and unlawful conduct.\u201d Thus, in this case, we are presented with conflicting principles: those of the traditional common-law rule that have guided Michigan law for more than a century as articulated in <em>Zsigo </em>and those underlying the rule of <em>Champion, </em>which inexplicably departed from the requirements that have always been held as necessary to impose respondeat superior liability. The existence of these conflicting precedents and principles cries out for clarity and compels our decision to overrule <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Further, we disagree with the main dissent\u2019s view that principles of stare decisis do not support overruling <em>Champion. </em>The main dissent applies a stare decisis test set forth in <em>Petersen v Magna </em>Corp<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> that is not the law of this state. Because a majority of this Court did not adopt that test, and a majority of justices have agreed to the rule articulated in <em>Robinson v </em>Detroit,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> the test in <em>Robinson </em>governs this analysis. Nevertheless, overruling <em>Champion </em>is the right result, regardless of which test is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The most basic error in the main dissent\u2019s stare decisis analysis is its misunderstanding of why <em>Champion </em>is unworkable. The dissent posits that the aided-by-agency exception is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d because it applies only when an agency relationship aided a supervisor in committing a wrongful act.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> According to the dissent, the exception does not apply when an agency relationship merely provided a supervisor an opportunity to accomplish a wrong. This interpretation is nothing more than a semantic exercise that demonstrates the capricious nature of <em>Champion: </em>An employment relationship will always provide a supervisory employee an opportunity to commit a wrong, but when does that opportunity become an \u201caid\u201d? Similarly, in the public-services context, a citizen\u2019s interaction with an employee administering public services will always arise during the administration of those services while the employee is exercising his or her authority; when are public-service employees \u201caided\u201d and when are they not \u201caided\u201d while exercising their authority? There is no meaningful demarcation.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>adherence to <em>Champion </em>would require jurors and judges to determine vicarious liability according to their subjective whims. For this same reason, the dissent\u2019s view that <em>Champion </em>provides \u201cimportant guidance to trial courts\u201d is simply wrong.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Finally, we find unpersuasive the main dissent\u2019s reliance on decisions from other jurisdictions that have applied the aided-by-agency exception in the context of their civil rights laws. If liability is to be imposed under Michigan law on an employer for sexual harassment committed by its employee, that liability must be mandated by the Michigan CRA.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The aided-by-agency exception in the context of civil rights cases is not so well accepted and \u201cnearly unanimous\u201d as the main dissent appears to claim.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Most states have <em>not </em>recognized the aided-by-agency exception in civil rights cases and, at least with respect to the jurisprudence of this Court, application of the aided-by-agency exception remains an aberration.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Michigan law has never imposed liability on an employer for the unforeseeable criminal actions of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>employees, except in <em>Champion. </em>Nor has Michigan common law incorporated an exception based on an aided-by-agency theory of liability. Accordingly, we conclude that a provider of a public service may not be held vicariously liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment affecting public services on the basis of unforeseeable criminal acts that its employee committed outside the scope of employment. Because <em>Champion </em>is inconsistent with our holding and with Michigan\u2019s common and statutory law, we overrule <em>Champion. </em>We reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s order granting summary disposition in favor of defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-4\">YOUNG, C.J., and MARKMAN and ZAHRA, JJ., concurred with Mary Beth Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> Wayne County jail regulations require that a female officer be in attendance when female inmates are present.

An \u201cavoidability test\u201d is the type of test the dissenting justices favor. In their view, defendants\u2019 policy prohibiting male deputies from being alone with female inmates demonstrates, in itself, that the sexual assault was preventable and foreseeable. However, reliance on the policy alone to impose liability obliterates any real foreseeability requirement; an employer\u2019s policy is irrelevant to assessing what the employer knows with respect to a specific employee. The consequence would be imposition of vicarious liability every time an employee disobeys the employer\u2019s policy, regardless of whether the act was unforeseeable under the actual circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">Rather, as we have explained, a defendant\u2019s specific knowledge of past misconduct and propensity to act in conformity with such conduct must be the focus of a foreseeability analysis. This analysis, which the dissenting justices term a \u201cnewly imposed foreseeability analysis,\u2019\u2019post at 58, merely recognizes that foreseeability has always been the touchstone for when vicarious liability will be imposed. The criticism by the main dissent is not surprising, given that Justice Cavanagh has previously expressed support for what effectively amounts to the imposition of strict liability in lieu of a foreseeability analysis. See <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 570-580 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting); <em>Anderson v Pine Knob Ski Resort, Inc, </em>469 Mich 20, 30-35; 664 NW2d 756 (2003) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\"> For a catalogue of some of the difficult questions that would confront an employer operating under the dissenting justices\u2019 rule, see <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 566-570 (Maekman, J., concurring). \u201cThe rule proposed by the dissent, and the unanswered questions arising from that rule, would create confusion and uncertainty among employers throughout this state .. . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566.

According to the dissenting justices, defendants had notice that Johnson would sexually assault a female inmate because Johnson, 13 years earlier, had engaged in a physical altercation initiated by a male inmate. In their view, <em>any </em>past violent conduct may create a jury-submissible question regarding foreseeability. Moreover, their contention that the question of foreseeability should have been submitted to the jury because this matter is substantially similar to <em>Hersh </em>is unavailing. In that case, the defendant\u2019s employee had a criminal conviction for <em>similar </em>prior conduct 10 years earlier, which the employer knew about, thus establishing a factual question regarding whether the employee had \u201cvicious propensities.\u201d <em>Hersh, </em>385 Mich at 413, 415. As we have indicated, evidence of <em>dissimilar </em>violent conduct is-not reasonably predictive of violent sexual conduct. Nor can it be said that a reasonable employer could genuinely have foreseen Johnson\u2019s sexual assault of plaintiff on the basis of a single instance of entirely dissimilar violent conduct that arose as a result of provocation by a male inmate 13 years earlier. The dissenting justices fail to recognize that the temporal distance and the dissimilarity between past conduct and the conduct at issue make it unreasonable to conclude that an employer could have foreseen that Johnson would engage in quid pro quo sexual harassment or commit a criminal sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 712 n 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 705-707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 712 n 6. 1 Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 219(2), p 481, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">[a] master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 712 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 713-714.

SUMMARY OF <em>CHAMPION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In <em>Champion, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor offered job security in exchange for sexual favors, and when the plaintiff refused, the supervisor used his authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>isolate the plaintiff in a remote portion of the building where they worked and raped her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court explained that under MCL 37.2103(i), a party pursuing a quid pro quo harassment claim in an employment context must establish \u201c(1) that she was subject to any of the types of unwelcome sexual conduct or communication described in the statute, and (2) that her employer or the employer\u2019s agent used her submission to or rejection of the proscribed conduct as a factor in a decision affecting her employment.\u201d <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 708-709. Like defendants in this case, the defendant in <em>Champion </em>argued that the plaintiff could not satisfy the second prong of a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim because the attacker was acting outside the scope of his authority when he raped the plaintiff and, as a result, was not acting as the defendant\u2019s agent. This Court unanimously rejected that argument, stating that \u201cwhen an employer gives its supervisors certain authority over other employees, it must also accept responsibility to remedy the harm caused by the supervisors\u2019 unlawful exercise of that authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712. We further noted that \u201can employer rarely authorizes an agent to break the law or otherwise behave improperly; yet, liability is frequently imputed to an employer for such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712 n 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In concluding that the plaintiff could pursue a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim against the defendant, <em>Champion </em>explained that a contrary result would \u201ccreate an enormous loophole in the statute\u201d that \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>defeat the remedial purpose underlying this state\u2019s civil rights statute and would lead to a construction that is inconsistent with the well-established rule that remedial statutes are to be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, citing <em>Eide v Kelsey-Hayes Co, </em>431 Mich 26, 34; 427 NW2d 488 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">II. <em>CHAMPION WAS </em>CORRECTLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The majority claims that <em>Champion </em>\u201cwas contrary to the plain language of the CRA,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 22, and, thus, was wrongly decided. Although I generally agree with the majority that the CRA incorporated the common law of agency, the exception to common-law agency principles established in <em>Champion </em>was necessary to give effect to the broad purpose of the CRA and the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. See <em>Henson v City of Dundee, </em>682 F2d 897, 910 n 21 (CA 11, 1982) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he common law rules of respondeat superior will not always be appropriate to suit the broad remedial purposes\u201d of civil rights statutes).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, this Court has previously considered the purpose of the CRA as a method of discerning the legislative intent behind the act. See <em>Victorson v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>439 Mich 131, 143-144; 482 NW2d 685 (1992). Indeed, even the majority recognizes that a statute\u2019s purpose is a relevant consideration in determining the legislative intent. See <em>ante </em>at 22 n 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The CRA recognizes that \u201cfreedom from discrimination because of sex is a civil right.\u201d <em>Chambers v Trettco, Inc, </em>463 Mich 297, 309; 614 NW2d 910 (2000). Thus, the CRA is intended to \u201cremedy[] discrimination in employment, ... public accommodations, services, and educational institutions.\u201d <em>Eide, </em>431 Mich at 31; see, also, <em>Miller v C A Muer Corp, </em>420 Mich 355, 363; 362 NW2d 650 (1984) (\u201cThe Michigan civil rights act is aimed at the prejudices and biases borne against persons because of their membership in a certain class... and seeks to eliminate the effects of offensive or demeaning stereotypes, prejudices, and biases.\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, as the majority acknowledges, the CRA is a remedial statute, and \u201cremedial statutes are to be liberally construed....\u201d <em>Eide, </em>431 Mich at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In light of this understanding of the CRA\u2019s purpose and the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the CRA, I believe that <em>Champion </em>properly advanced the legislative intent by ensuring that clearly discriminatory conduct is eradicated. The majority\u2019s interpretation, however, bars plaintiff from pursuing a claim in furtherance of this goal and ignores \u201cthe legislative intent that employers, not the victims of sexual harassment, bear the costs of remedying and eradicating discrimination.\u201d <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 714. The majority erroneously discards <em>Champion\u2019s </em>interpretation of the leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>islative intent as based \u201cpurely on policy considerations,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 25, and ignores the fact that the policy considerations discussed in <em>Champion </em>were the motivation behind the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the CRA..<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result, \u201cin seeking to shield employers from liability, the majority instead places the burden of preventing an abuse of authority and the corresponding harm on people powerless to prevent it.\u201d <em>Zsigo v Hurley Med Ctr, </em>475 Mich 215, 236; 716 NW2d 220 (2006) (Marilyn Kelly, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Chambers </em>to support its conclusion that <em>Champion </em>was wrongly decided is misplaced. In fact, <em>Chambers </em>expressly acknowledged <em>Champion's </em>holding as a valid part of Michigan\u2019s common law related to quid pro quo sexual harassment under the CRA. See <em>Chambers, </em>463 Mich at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>311 (\u201cVicarious liability exists in the case of quid pro quo harassment because the quid pro quo harasser, by definition, uses the power of the employer to alter the terms and conditions of employment. <em>Champion, supra\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Similarly, the majority erroneously interprets <em>Zsigo </em>as supporting its conclusion that <em>Champion </em>misinterpreted the CRA. The <em>Zsigo </em>majority expressly recognized that the <em>Champion </em>Court, like many other courts, applied an exception to quid pro quo sexual harassment claims that is very similar to the aided-by-agency exception. <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 227 n 28 (listing state and federal opinions adopting the aided-by-agency exception in sexual harassment cases). While I continue to adhere to the <em>Zsigo </em>dissent\u2019s conclusion that a narrowly tailored interpretation of the aided-by-agency exception should be applied outside the context of sexual harassment cases, that disagreement with <em>Zsigo </em>is of no moment in this case, given that the case before us is obviously a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim. Thus, under <em>Chambers </em>and even under the majority opinion in <em>Zsigo, Champion\u2019s </em>exception applies to this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Finally, contrary to the majority\u2019s concern that <em>Champion </em>created an exception that swallows the general agency rules, <em>Champion\u2019s </em>exception \u201cdoes not extend unlimited liability to employers whose supervisors rape subordinates.\u201d <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 713. A mere supervisor-subordinate relationship is not enough. Rather, an employer is only liable when \u201cthe supervisor accomplishes the rape <em>through the exercise of his supervisory power over the victim.\u201d Id. </em>at 713-714 (emphasis added). As <em>Champion </em>explained, this approach is \u201cfully consistent. . . with the legislative intent that employers, not the victims of sexual harassment, bear the costs of remedying and eradicating discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Furthermore, as the dissent in <em>Zsigo </em>aptly explained, it is entirely possible to adopt a narrowly tailored interpretation of the aided-by-agency exception in order to avoid swallowing the general agency rules. <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 239-243 (MARILYN KELLY, J. dissenting).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>reviewing various other jurisdictions\u2019 efforts to balance the scope of the aided-by-agency exception, the <em>Zsigo </em>dissent concluded that an opinion from the Vermont Supreme Court represented the most compelling approach. See <em>Doe v Forrest, </em>2004 VT 37, \u00b6 21; 176 Vt 476; 853 A2d 48 (2004), citing <em>Burlington Indus, Inc v Ellerth, </em>524 US 742; 118 S Ct 2257; 141 L Ed 2d 633 (1998), and <em>Faragher v Boca Raton, </em>524 US 775; 118 S Ct 2275; 141 L Ed 2d 662 (1998). <em>Doe </em>explained that under <em>Faragher, </em>in order to properly apply the aided-by-agency exception, a court should consider three factors: (1) \u201cthe opportunity for contact created by the relationship,\u201d (2) \u201cthe powerlessness of the employee to resist the perpetrator and prevent the unwanted contact,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe opportunity to prevent and guard against the conduct.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>2004 VT 37 at \u00b6 33; 176 Vt at 491. Thus, in response to the questions posed by the majority regarding when an employer will be held liable for an employee\u2019s conduct, see <em>ante </em>at 34, an employer would only be liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment arising out of an employee\u2019s conduct if the three factors were met, or, as <em>Champion </em>put it, when \u201cthe supervisor accomplishes the rape <em>through the exercise of his supervisory power over the victim.\u201d Champion, </em>450 Mich at 713-714 (emphasis added). Accordingly, <em>Champion </em>can be applied without imposing the boundless liability that the majority fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In summary, <em>Champion </em>properly relied on the legislative intent and the purpose behind the CRA when it adopted a widely accepted exception to the general rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of agency. And given that the Legislature has not chosen to amend the applicable CRA provisions during the 15 years since <em>Champion </em>was decided, I think that it is fair to conclude that the Legislature believes that <em>Champion </em>accurately reflected the legislative intent behind the CRA, rather than representing a dangerous departure from it, as the majority claims. See, e.g., <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>473 Mich 562, 613-614; 702 NW2d 539 (2005) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting) (explaining the significance of the Legislature\u2019s decision not to modify a statute after this Court has interpreted it). Because it is \u201c \u2018the nature of the common law that every appellate decision represents the development of the common law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 241 n 11 (MARILYN KELLY, J., dissenting) (citation omitted), <em>Champion </em>has been a valid part of Michigan\u2019s common law for the last 15 years and should be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">III. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In light of the preceding analysis, it is clear that <em>Champion </em>furthers the Legislature\u2019s intent when it enacted the CRA. As a result, <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided and no further stare decisis consideration is needed. However, even accepting the majority\u2019s faulty conclusion that <em>Champion </em>was wrongly decided, I do not agree that its decision to overrule <em>Champion </em>is supported by stare decisis principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The United States Supreme Court has explained that the doctrine of stare decisis \u201cpromotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827; 111 S Ct 2597; 115 L Ed 2d 720 (1991). As a result, \u201ca stare decisis analysis should always begin with the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tion that upholding the precedent involved is the preferred course of action.\u201d <em>Petersen v Magna Corp, </em>484 Mich 300, 317; 773 NW2d 564 (2009) (opinion by MARILYN Kelly, C.J.). Thus, \u201coverturning precedent requires more than a mere belief that a case was wrongly decided,\u201d <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 211; 795 NW2d 517 (2010), and the presumption in favor of upholding precedent \u201cshould be retained until effectively rebutted by the conclusion that a compelling justification exists to overturn the precedent,\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 317 (opinion by MARILYN KELLY, C.J.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Several of the criteria discussed in <em>Petersen </em>weigh particularly heavily in favor of upholding <em>Champion </em>rather than overruling it: (1) <em>Champion </em>provided a practical and workable rule, (2) <em>Champion </em>has not been robbed of significant application or justification because it remains a highly significant and relevant guidepost in the area of civil rights law, (3) other jurisdictions have adopted exceptions similar to the one in <em>Champion, </em>and (4) overruling <em>Champion </em>is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Contrary to the majority\u2019s claims, <em>Champion </em>has not proved to be unworkable, and thus this criterion weighs in favor of upholding <em>Champion. </em>Again, although I disagree with the <em>Zsigo </em>majority\u2019s decision to limit <em>Champion </em>by applying it only to cases raising quid pro quo sexual harassment claims, that limitation is an example of an arguably workable bright-line rule regarding the scope of Champion\u2019s exception. Therefore, the majority\u2019s claim that <em>Champion </em>is unworkable because it results in unlimited vicarious liability \u201cdespite our attempt in <em>Zsigo </em>to limit <em>Champion,\u201d ante </em>at 25, is inexplicable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Indeed, the Court of Appeals opinions the majority cites in support of this claim, <em>ante </em>at 26-27 n 68, are either irrelevant or demonstrate <em>Champion\u2019s </em>workability rather than its unworkability.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In <em>Diamond v Witherspoon, </em>265 Mich App 673; 696 NW2d 770 (2005), and its companion case, the Court of Appeals rejected a city\u2019s claims of governmental immunity and permitted the plaintiffs to bring quid pro quo sexual harassment claims under the CRA based on the same city police officer\u2019s sexual conduct during traffic stops. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Court of Appeals explained that governmental immunity is not a defense to actions under the CRA but did not directly address the vicarious liability issues arising out of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 691. As a result, <em>Diamond </em>is of little import in determining <em>Champion\u2019s </em>workability.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The other opinion the majority cites in this regard, <em>Salinas v Genesys Health Sys, </em>263 Mich App 315; 688 NW2d 112 (2004), actually demonstrates <em>Champion\u2019s </em>workability and exhibits the \u201cmeaningful demarcation\u201d that the majority so desperately seeks.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>ante </em>at 34. In that case, the Court of Appeals applied the aided-by-agency exception and concluded that vicarious liability did not extend to the employer because the attacker\u2019s agency relationship with the defendant merely provided the attacker with the opportunity to commit the sexual assault. Thus, the agency relationship did not aid the attacker in committing the sexual assault. <em>Salinas, </em>263 Mich App at 320-321. In my view, <em>Salinas </em>provided an example of how <em>Champion </em>did not create limitless liability, even in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Finally, <em>Champion </em>itself explained that its holding \u201cdoes not extend unlimited liability to employers . . ..\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 713. Rather, an employer is only liable if its employee \u201caccomplishes the rape through the exercise of his supervisory power over the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-714. Such a limitation is eminently workable, as the Court of Appeals opinion in <em>Salinas </em>demonstrated. Additionally, as discussed earlier in this opinion, Vermont\u2019s high court has provided a clear example of a narrowly tailored approach to applying the aided-by-agency exception that would limit the scope of an employer\u2019s liability. <em>Doe, </em>2004 VT 37 at \u00b6 33; 176 Vt at 491; see, also, <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 239-243 (MARILYN KELLY, J., dissenting) (arguing in favor of adopting Noe\u2019s three-factor test). In sum, <em>Champion </em>has remained workable from the time it was first published until its untimely demise at the hands of the majority today. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of upholding <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Champion </em>also remains a highly significant and relevant guidepost in the area of civil rights law, which weighs in favor of upholding it. <em>Champion </em>remains relevant because it properly recognized that failing to impose liability on an employer when its employees use supervisory powers delegated by the employer to commit quid pro quo sexual harassment is a \u201cfar too narrow\u201d construction of agency principles. <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 712. As <em>Champion </em>explains, \u201cimmunizing an employer where it did not authorize the offending conduct would create an enormous loophole in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. Therefore, <em>Champion </em>correctly concluded that when an employer delegates authority to an employee, the employer must accept the responsibility of remedying the harm caused by misuse of that authority, which is consistent with the \u201clegislative intent that employers, not the victims of sexual harassment, bear the costs of remedying and eradicating discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714. Thus, <em>Champion </em>provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>important guidance to trial courts and ensures that the legislative intent behind the CRA is implemented. Accordingly, <em>Champion </em>should be upheld.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Further supporting the conclusion that stare decisis does not support overruling <em>Champion </em>is the fact that numerous other jurisdictions have adopted the aided-by-agency exception in the context of civil rights cases. See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320 (opinion by MARILYN Kelly, C.J.). To begin with, as <em>Champion </em>stated, application of the aided-by-agency exception is a \u201cnearly unanimous view\u201d in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment committed by supervisory personnel. <em>Champion, </em>450 Mich at 712.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>however, claims that <em>Champion </em>and this dissent err in this determination because it is improper to consider federal caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Although the majority is correct that we are not bound by federal caselaw, it can be instructive, particularly when the federal and state statutes at issue are similar. See, e.g., <em>People v Victor, </em>287 Mich 506, 548; 283 NW 666 (1939) (endorsing the use of federal caselaw in applying Michigan\u2019s Due Process Clause). Notably, the United States Supreme Court has concluded that the federal Civil Rights Act has a \u201cbroad remedial purpose[],\u201d <em>Arizona Governing Comm for Tax Deferred Annuity &amp; Deferred Compensation Plans v Norris, </em>463 US 1073, 1090; 103 S Ct 3492; 77 L Ed 2d 1236 (1983), to \u201cachieve equality . . . and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group,\u201d <em>Griggs v Duke Power Co, </em>401 US 424, 429-430; 91 S Ct 849; 28 L Ed 2d 158 (1971). Given that the legislative intent and purpose behind the CRA and the federal Civil Rights Act are strikingly similar, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision to adopt an exception to further that purpose in <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher </em>is persuasive authority in favor of upholding <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Furthermore, regardless of whether \u201c[o]nly a few jurisdictions have adopted the [aided-by-agency] exception wholesale . . . such that it applies to a typical tort claim,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 24 n 63, many of our sister states have \u2014 as this Court did in <em>Champion </em>\u2014 adopted comparable exceptions in the realm of civil rights sexual harassment cases in order to accomplish goals analogous to those in the CRA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Champion </em>is not an \u201cinexplicable exception,\u201d <em>ante </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>21-22 n 54 (quotation marks and citation omitted), or \u201cisolated aberration,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 25, nor is it \u201chard to square . . . with any conventional notion of agency,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 21 n 54 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, <em>Champion </em>reflects a well-reasoned exception to the general rules of agency that many other jurisdictions have adopted in order to ensure that civil and human rights statutes are successful in achieving the goal of suppressing the evil of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Finally, the fact that the majority\u2019s decision in this case is likely to result in serious detriment prejudicial to public interests weighs heavily in favor of upholding <em>Champion. </em>See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320 (opinion by Marilyn Kelly, C.J.). As discussed at length in this opinion, <em>Champion </em>properly recognized the significant public interest embodied in the CRA and adopted a narrow exception to traditional agency rules that accurately reflects the legislative intent to require employers to bear the costs of remedying and eradicating discrimination. By overruling <em>Champion, </em>the majority instead places that burden on the very people whom the CRA is intended to protect and who are powerless to prevent the discrimination that the CRA is intended to eliminate. The detriment to the public interest created by the majority opinion today is obvious and weighs heavily in favor of affirming <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In summary, <em>Champion </em>(1) provides a practical and workable rule in furtherance of the purpose of the CRA, (2) has not been robbed of significant application or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>justification because it remains a highly significant and relevant guidepost in the area of civil rights law, (3) is consistent with the caselaw of other jurisdictions that have adopted the aided-by-agency exception, and (4) avoids a serious detriment prejudicial to public interests. Therefore, in my view, the principles of stare decisis do not support the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Champion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">IV THE MAJORITY REACHES THE WRONG RESULT UNDER ANY STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The majority\u2019s application of its own standard is hopelessly flawed. The majority immunizes defendants from liability in this case by concluding that Johnson\u2019s acts were unforeseeable. <em>Ante </em>at 16. The majority supports this conclusion by claiming that, even when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Johnson\u2019s past violent conduct toward members of the public <em>and inmates </em>merely amounted to \u201ca propensity to disobey work-related protocol.. . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 16. Furthermore, the majority concludes that Johnson\u2019s rape of plaintiff was \u201chighly unpredictable,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 13, and, \u201cin essence, unpreventable,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The majority\u2019s characterization of Johnson\u2019s conduct is extraordinarily one-sided, however. First, Johnson\u2019s conduct was clearly not \u201cunpreventable\u201d because defendants had a policy in place that required a female officer to be present anytime a female inmate was in the jail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Presumably, the motivation behind this policy is at least in part to prevent the type of conduct that Johnson committed in this case. Defendants violated that policy on the night in question, which allowed Johnson to use the supervisory powers delegated to him by defendants to violently rape plaintiff. Thus, the rape of plaintiff was entirely preventable, had defendants merely followed their own policy. Furthermore, the fact that such a policy existed also strongly implies that defendants considered conduct like Johnson\u2019s foreseeable. Therefore, regardless of whether the rape was preventable, defendants\u2019 policy is one of several factors that create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Johnson\u2019s conduct was <em>foreseeable, </em>even under the majority\u2019s flawed new test.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Second, as the majority concedes, Johnson\u2019s alleged threatening calls to his landlord and the physical altercation <em>with an inmate </em>reveal Johnson\u2019s tendency to react violently when provoked. One would think that working as a deputy in a jail would entail frequent provocation by inmates. Accordingly, tendencies such as those displayed by Johnson, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, present a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether his subsequent violent rape <em>of an inmate </em>was sufficiently foreseeable to hold defendants vicariously liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The majority strains to support the weight of its misguided holding by citing the majority opinion in <em>Brown v Brown, </em>478 Mich 545; 739 NW2d 313 (2007).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>In <em>Brown, </em>the attacker had no criminal history and had not previously committed any violent acts but had repeatedly made heinous sexual comments to the plaintiff of which the defendant-employer was aware. Subsequently, while working with the plaintiff on the night shift, the attacker violently raped the plaintiff. The <em>Brown </em>majority concluded that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the attacker\u2019s comments alone were not sufficient to make the subsequent rape foreseeable. <em>Id. </em>at 554-555. The <em>Brown </em>majority chastised the Court of Appeals panel in that case for relying on <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>385 Mich 410; 189 NW2d 286 (1971), to reach the opposite conclusion because, according to the <em>Brown </em>majority, <em>Hersh </em>was distinguishable on its facts. In <em>Hersh, </em>an employee who had a prior manslaughter conviction violently attacked a client of the defendant-employer. This Court unanimously held that the defendant-employer was liable for its employee\u2019s violent attack on the client because the defendant knew of the employee\u2019s past violent act. <em>Id. </em>at 413.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The <em>Brown </em>majority seized on this reasoning to conclude that the defendant in <em>Brown </em>could not be liable for its employee\u2019s rape of the plaintiff because the employee had only engaged in \u201cboorish\u201d sexual <em>comments </em>toward the plaintiff but had no history of violent <em>acts. Brown, </em>478 Mich at 557-562.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Although the <em>Brown </em>majority\u2019s analysis created a dangerous rule whereby <em>\u201cno </em>infirmity of character, shown by speech, [is] sufficient to allow a jury to decide whether, in light of the employee\u2019s conduct, the employer had a duty to act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 576 (CAVANAGH, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dissenting), Johnson\u2019s conduct in this case, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact even under the rule in <em>Brown. </em>Johnson did not merely engage in sexual comments toward plaintiff; rather, he had a specific history of violent and abusive behavior toward inmates.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, because the unanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Hersh </em>Court and the majority in <em>Brown </em>concluded that an employee\u2019s prior violent criminal acts are generally sufficient to put a defendant on notice of the employee\u2019s propensity to commit similar violent acts,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> defendants\u2019 knowledge of Johnson\u2019s prior violent acts is sufficient to at least raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the foreseeability of his eventual rape of plaintiff.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, even under the majority\u2019s newly adopted standard for quid pro quo sexual harassment claims under the CRA, the majority reaches the wrong result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Finally, by overruling <em>Champion, </em>the majority has caused a major shift in Michigan\u2019s quid pro quo sexual harassment jurisprudence. Thus, even if I agreed with the majority\u2019s new standard, I could not support its hasty decision to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. As the majority readily admits, <em>Champion </em>clearly applies to this case, and plaintiffs arguments appropriately focused on the principles set forth in <em>Champion </em>rather than the majority\u2019s newly imposed foreseeability analysis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As a result, the Court of Appeals did not consider the merits of plaintiffs claims under the foreseeability standard that the majority now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>adopts. Accordingly, the majority should not reach the merits of this case because this unexpected shift away from <em>Champion </em>prevented plaintiff from making arguments related to the standard that the majority now applies. Rather, given its holding, the majority should remand this case to the lower courts for further proceedings so that plaintiff may develop arguments related to the majority\u2019s newly applicable, yet erroneous, standard for quid pro quo sexual harassment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to overrule <em>Champion </em>because that case was correctly decided and furthers the legislative intent and purpose of the CRA. Moreover, the doctrine of stare decisis weighs against overruling <em>Champion. </em>Furthermore, the majority misapplies its newly created standard in this case and usurps the role of the jury when it concludes that defendants are entitled to a favorable decision as a matter of law. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-6\">Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> The concurring justices joined the analysis in full.

See, e.g., <em>Adair v </em>Michigan, 486 Mich 468, 477; 785 NW2d 119 (2010) (stating that \u201cthe primary and fundamental rule of constitutional or statutory construction is that the Court\u2019s duty is to ascertain the <em>purpose and intent </em>as expressed in the constitutional or legislative provision in question\u201d) (emphasis added). Indeed, the members of the majority in this case recently found the purpose of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act worthy of lengthy consideration <em>inMich Ed Ass\u2019n v Secretary of State (On Rehearing), </em>489 Mich 194; 801 NW2d 35 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-5\"> The majority\u2019s suggestion that the language of the CRA does not support this interpretation of the act\u2019s purpose is remarkable, given that this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Eide, Miller, </em>and many other cases have similarly summarized the CRA\u2019s purpose. See, e.g., <em>Radtke v Everett, </em>442 Mich 368, 379; 501 NW2d 155 (1993) (quoting the CRA and concluding that \u201c[t]he Civil Rights Act is aimed at the prejudices and biases borne against persons because of their membership in a certain class, and seeks to eliminate the effects of offensive or demeaning stereotypes, prejudices, and biases\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted); see, also, MCL 37.2102, MCL 37.2202, and MCL 37.2302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> Ironically, the majority in this case also relies on policy considerations, claiming that <em>Champion </em>creates an unfair \u201csocietal burden\u201d and an unbearable financial burden on employers. <em>Ante </em>at 14-15, 28-29. It is odd that the majority opinion finds it appropriate to rely on these policy considerations while simultaneously rejecting <em>Champion </em>for its consideration of the policy concerns reflected in the CRA. Setting that contradiction aside, however, what is even more telling is the fact that <em>Champion\u2019s </em>policy considerations were rooted in the legislative intent and purpose of the CRA. Indeed, the CRA\u2019s title expressly states that the CRA is intended to \u201cprohibit discriminatory practices, policies, and customs ....\u201d Title of 1976 PA 453. The majority opinion in this case does exactly the opposite in furtherance of policy considerations that do not appear in the CRA. Nowhere did the Legislature indicate that the \u201csocietal burden\u201d or the financial burden on employers is a valid consideration when interpreting and applying the act. In fact, the CRA indicates that the Legislature intended that governmental employers bear the cost of eliminating sexual harassment, not avoid it, as shown by the specific inclusion of state and political subdivisions and their agents as employers covered by the act. MCL 37.2103(g) and (h) and MCL 37.2201(a); see, also, <em>Mack v Detroit, </em>467 Mich 186, 195; 649 NW2d 47 (2002) (noting that there are areas in which \u201cthe Legislature has allowed specific actions against the government to stand, such as the Civil Rights Act\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b317-5\"> Although the majority is correct that <em>Zsigo </em>held that the aided-by-agency exception is not a part of Michigan\u2019s <em>general </em>common law, the majority\u2019s efforts to counter this dissent\u2019s interpretation of <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Zsigo </em>are unavailing because both of those opinions recognized that <em>Champion\u2019s </em>exception applied <em>in the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment cases, </em>as the majority acknowledges. See <em>ante </em>at 21; see, also, <em>Chambers, </em>463 Mich at 311 (citing <em>Champion </em>for the premise that \u201c[v]icarious liability exists in the case of quid pro quo harassment because the quid pro quo harasser, by definition, uses the power of the employer to alter the terms and conditions of employment\u201d), and <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 224 n 19 (recognizing that <em>Champion </em>applies \u201cin the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment under MCL 37.2103G)\u201d). Indeed, the fact that the majority finds it necessary to expressly overrule <em>Champion </em>today further demonstrates that <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Zsigo </em>did not dispatch the exception created in <em>Champion. </em>The majority\u2019s refusal to accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>fact that <em>Champion </em>has been part of Michigan\u2019s common law for the last 15 years does not make its view so. Rather, as this dissent thoroughly explains, <em>Champion </em>is a longstanding, unanimous precedent of this Court that is consistent with the purpose and legislative intent behind the CRA and with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court and many other jurisdictions in similar civil rights cases. Accordingly, the majority is mistaken when it claims that I seek to \u201caggressively expand the law of this state\u201d while it merely seeks to \u201creaffirm!] ... common-law rules that have always governed in Michigan.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 33. Rather, as demonstrated by its need to overrule a deep-rooted opinion of this Court, it is the majority that embarks on an ill-advised major change in the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\"> The majority erroneously implies that I only rely on nonbinding dissenting opinions of this Court to support my conclusion that <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided. Although I think that the <em>Zsigo </em>dissent provides an example of a narrow, workable interpretation of the aided-by-agency exception, the bulk of my analysis in support of my conclusion that <em>Champion </em>was correctly decided rests on the reasoning from <em>Champion\u2019s </em>well-established and unanimous opinion, which was not overruled by either of the majority opinions in <em>Chambers </em>and <em>Zsigo. </em>Surprisingly, the majority disparages my analysis for relying on <em>Cham</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>piort\u2019s </em>reasoning, see <em>ante </em>at 31 n 79, but I am quite certain that relying on longstanding, unanimous precedent from this state\u2019s highest court is a well-accepted method of legal analysis. Furthermore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s claim that <em>Champion </em>is the only \u201cbinding Michigan law\u201d supporting my conclusion. <em>Ante </em>at 31 n 79. Rather, I believe that the CRA itself also supports my analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b321-5\"> In <em>Petersen, </em>then Chief Justice Marilyn Kelly provided a nonexhaustive list of criteria for consideration when a court engages in a stare decisis analysis, hut no single criterion is determinative, and a given criterion need only be evaluated if relevant. <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 320. The majority\u2019s implication that my stare decisis analysis is invalid because I apply <em>Petersen </em>is misplaced, given that <em>Petersen\u2019s </em>test simply expands on the test from <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 464; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). Further <em>Petersen </em>is more respectful of precedent, and thus is more consistent with the principles of stare decisis. See <em>Petersen, </em>484 Mich at 315-319 (opinion by Marilyn Kelly, C.J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> Although Chief Justice Kelly also recognized that reliance on the rule in question may be a valid consideration when engaging in a stare decisis analysis, the majority\u2019s extensive reliance on this factor to support its decision to overrule <em>Champion </em>is misplaced. In my view, this factor is of little importance in this case because no one plans on being sexually harassed or employing persons who commit sexual harassment. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>there is little reason for anyone to \u201cconform his conduct to a certain norm\u201d in reliance on <em>Champion. Ante </em>at 27 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, <em>Champion </em>provided a remedy for an unexpected and unwelcome event. Therefore, I find unpersuasive the majority\u2019s claim that <em>Champion </em>may be overruled because parties have not relied on its holding to their detriment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> Moreover, the majority\u2019s claim that <em>Champion </em>allows plaintiffs to engage in \u201c[a]rtful pleading,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 29 n 74, in order to \u201cavoid governmental immunity by framing a claim under the CRA,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 26, is misplaced and, frankly, offensive. See, also, <em>ante </em>at 31 n 78. Plaintiff in this case, and presumably the plaintiffs in other sexual harassment cases, bring actions under the CRA because the sexual harassment infringed on their civil rights. By assuming that plaintiffs bring CRA claims to manipulate the judicial system, the majority throws salt in these plaintiffs\u2019 raw wounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> Moreover, as discussed earlier in this dissent, the three-prong test established in floe, 2004 VT 37, and favored by the <em>Zsigo </em>dissent further establishes a \u201cmeaningful demarcation\u201d of an employer\u2019s liability for an employee\u2019s improper use of delegated supervisory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s claims, the distinction exemplified by <em>Salinas </em>is quite clear: if an employee is merely presented with an opportunity to commit sexual harassment by having the employer\u2019s permission to be in a certain location, the employer is not vicariously hable because the employee did not use any employer-delegated authority to aid in the creation of the opportunity to commit the sexual harassment. But if, as in <em>Champion </em>and the case at bar, the employee actively uses the powers delegated by the employer to direct the victim to a location or otherwise create circumstances that aid in the commission of sexual harassment, vicarious liability may attach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\"> The majority also states that because \u201cthe drafters of the Third Restatement of Agency have excluded the aided-by-agency exception included in the Second Restatement of Agency,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 19 n 42, <em>Champion </em>no longer reflects the preferred approach and I \u201cignore\u201d this \u201cchangeD in the law,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 31-32 n 79. To begin with, as the comments to the Third Restatement of Agency explain, the Third Restatement now addresses \u201c[t]he purposes likely intended to be met by the \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 basis [for imposing vicarious liability]... by a more fully elaborated treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care that a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through employees and other agents\u201d elsewhere in the Restatement. 2 Restatement Agency, 3d, \u00a7 7.08, comment b, p 228. Thus, there has arguably been no \u201cchangeD in the law,\u201d given that the Third Restatement of Agency addresses the same concerns represented by the aided-by-agency exception from the Second Restatement of Agency. And, regardless, the Restatement has no precedential value and, thus, is not \u201cthe law.\u201d <em>Champion, </em>on the other hand, obviously has substantial precedential value as a well-established, unanimous opinion of this Court. Accordingly, any support for overruling <em>Champion </em>that the majority derives from the fact that the Third Restatement of Agency no longer expressly includes the aided-by-agency exception is unpersuasive, especially when, as noted later in this opinion, other jurisdictions continue to apply that exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> Although the majority mistakenly attributes this premise to me, see <em>ante </em>at 35, it was actually the unanimous <em>Champion </em>Court that concluded that its holding was consistent with the majority of other jurisdictions. I do, however, agree with <em>Champion\u2019s </em>conclusion, given that, as explained in footnote 15 of this opinion, the United States Supreme Court and many states apply Champion-like exceptions in the context of civil rights cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> See, e.g., <em>Farmers Ins Group v Santa Clara Co, </em>11 Cal 4th 992, 1016 n 14; 47 Cal Rptr 2d 478; 906 P2d 440 (1995) (acknowledging that the applicable statutes \u201cindicate that respondeat superior and scope of employment principles are supposed to play an integral role in fixing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>employer\u2019s liability for both supervisor and nonsupervisor sexual harassment\u201d but applying the aided-by-agency exception because \u201cit is reasonably clear that the purpose underlying the comprehensive statutory scheme is to ensure that all employers maintain their worksites free from prohibited sexual harassment, regardless of the lack of foreseeability of such harassment in their particular enterprises\u201d); <em>Doe, </em>2004 VT 37 at \u00b6 39; 176 Vt at 494 (adopting the aided-by-agency exception, in part because it creates an \u201cincentive for vigilance\u201d by those in the best position to prevent harassing behavior); <em>Lehmann v Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc, </em>132 NJ 587, 619; 626 A2d 445 (1993) (adopting the aided-by-agency-exception in sexual harassment cases to ensure \u201cjust results in the great variety of factual circumstances presented by sexual harassment cases and to accomplish the [statutory] purposes\u201d); <em>Ocana v American Furniture Co, </em>2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 31; 135 NM 539, 552; 91 P3d 58 (2004) (adopting the aided-by-agency theory because it \u201cfurther[s] the policies that underlie tort law\u201d by redistributing the economic burden from injured individuals and deterring objectionable conduct in the future); <em>College-Town, Div of Interco, Inc v Mass Comm Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass 156, 165; 508 NE2d 587 (1987) (noting that although the court was not bound by federal courts\u2019 interpretation of analogous federal statutes, vicarious liability based on a standard similar to the aided-by-agency exception was appropriate in order to remain consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose and clear legislative intent \u201cthat an employer be liable for discrimination committed by those on whom it confers authority\u201d); <em>Frieler v Carlson Mktg Group, Inc, </em>751 NW2d 558, 567-570 (Minn, 2008) (adopting the aided-by-agency exception for sexual harassment cases as consistent with the purposes of the Minnesota Human Rights Act); <em>Veco, Inc v Rosebrock, </em>970 P2d 906, 914 (Alas, 1999) (adopting the aided-by-agency theory because harassment by supervisors is \u201cfacilitated, made more serious, and is less apt to be reported because supervisors are understood to be clothed with the employer\u2019s authority\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>Parker v Warren Co Utility Dist, </em>2 SW3d 170,176 (Tenn, 1999) (adopting the aided-by-agency exception for sexual harassment claims under Tennessee\u2019s human rights act for the reasons stated in <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher)-, American Gen Life &amp; Accident Ins Co v Hall, </em>74 SW3d 688, 692 (Ky, 2002) (acknowledging that Kentucky applies the aided-by-agency exception to sexual harassment claims under Kentucky\u2019s civil rights act consistently with <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher), Henningsen v World-corn, Inc, </em>102 Wash App 828, 843; 9 P3d 948 (2000) (applying the aided-by-agency exception in a sexual harassment case); <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc v Itz, </em>21 SW3d 456, 470 (Tex App, 2000) (same); and <em>Edwards v Ohio Institute of Cardiac Care, </em>170 Ohio App 3d 619, 627-628; 868 NE2d 721 (2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>As these opinions make obvious, <em>Champion </em>by no means represents an earth-shattering decision in the realm of civil rights law, and, contrary to the majority\u2019s claim, in no way do I \u201cconcede that <em>Champion </em>was unprecedented... .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 30.

Although inconvenient to the majority\u2019s analysis, it is notable that defendants considered Johnson\u2019s actions \u201cmisconduct\u201d and reprimanded him for it. Therefore, it appears that defendants did not consider Johnson\u2019s violent conduct toward an inmate as insignificant as the majority would have us believe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> The majority bristles at my characterization of its test as \u201cnew.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at 14 n 32. However, given that the majority overrules <em>Champion, </em>which it admits would otherwise apply to this case, classifying its test as \u201cnew\u201d is entirely accurate, in my judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\"> Although I continue to adhere to my dissent in <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 570-580 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting), I will apply the majority opinion from <em>Brown </em>because, even under the <em>Brown </em>majority\u2019s excessively narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>standard of foreseeability, this case presents a genuine issue of material fact. And because I apply the rule from the majority opinion in <em>Brown, </em>the majority\u2019s critique of the <em>Brown </em>dissent, <em>ante </em>at 14 n 32, is entirely irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> Justice Black concurred in the result. See <em>Hersh, </em>385 Mich at 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> The majority claims that the \u201cdissimilar\u201d nature and the \u201ctemporal distance\u201d between Johnson\u2019s past violent conduct and the rape at issue immunizes defendants from foreseeability as a matter of law. First, these arguments abandon the reasoning from <em>Hersh </em>because, in that case, the attacker\u2019s conviction for manslaughter occurred 10 years before the attack in question, and the defendant in <em>Hersh </em>\u201cwas not aware of [the attacker\u2019s] specific convictions ....\u201d <em>Hersh v Kentfield Builders, Inc, </em>19 Mich App 43, 45 n 1; 172 NW2d 56 (1969). Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis today, the caselaw <em>does not </em>hold that an employee\u2019s conduct is only foreseeable to an employer if the employee had recently committed the precise conduct at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Second, these arguments also demonstrate that the majority\u2019s new test for quid pro quo sexual harassment cases creates a moving target that is impossible for plaintiffs to hit. In <em>Brown, </em>the majority claimed that the attacker\u2019s aggressive sexual comments were not sufficient to make it foreseeable that the attacker would later rape the target of those comments. In this case, even though Johnson had committed a violent act against an inmate in the past, the majority claims that this conduct occurred too long ago and was too dissimilar to the conduct at issue. The majority makes no effort to explain why the acceptable 10-year gap in <em>Hersh </em>is substantially different from the 13-year gap in this case and only summarily argues that Johnson\u2019s prior violent act against an inmate was too dissimilar to his violent rape of plaintiff while she was an inmate. <em>Ante </em>at 16-17 n 36. Viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, I fail to see a difference between a violent physical altercation with an inmate and a subsequent violent rape of an inmate that is sufficient to justify deciding this case as a matter of law. Rather, given the substantial similarities between the facts of this case and the facts in <em>Hersh, </em>I believe that this Court\u2019s unanimous conclusion in <em>Hersh </em>that \u201c[w]hether the employer knew or should have known of [the employee\u2019s] vicious propensities should not be determined by any court as a matter of law, but by the jury\u201d is equally applicable to this case, even under the majority\u2019s flawed new test. <em>Hersh, </em>385 Mich at 415. But under the majority position, this is apparently not so, given that the majority seemingly believes that an employee\u2019s act of committing a rape is only foreseeable if the employer knows that the employee actually raped someone in the recent past. The unworkabilify of such a requirement is obvious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b333-4\"> Specifically, <em>Hersh, </em>385 Mich at 413, stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he employer\u2019s knowledge of past acts of impropriety, violence, or disorder on the part of the employee is <em>generally considered sufficient to forewarn the employer,\u2019 \u201d </em>quoting 34 ALR2d 390, \u00a7 9 (emphasis added), and the majority in <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 560, quoted this passage from <em>Hersh.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b333-5\"> Although the majority opinion cites <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 555, for the proposition that \u201c[e]ven the incident of aggression [toward an inmate] did not put defendants on reasonable notice that Johnson would sexually assault an inmate [because] violent actions do not inevitably lead to acts of criminal sexual conduct,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 16, the cited portion of <em>Brown </em>does not actually support that conclusion. Rather, the relevant portion of <em>Brown </em>states that <em>\u201c[cComments </em>of a sexual nature do not inexorably lead to criminal sexual conduct any more than an exasperated, angry <em>comment </em>inexorably results in a violent criminal assault.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>478 Mich at 555 (emphasis added). Furthermore, <em>Brown </em>later stated, while discussing <em>Hersh, </em>that \u201cit is the employee\u2019s <em>known past acts </em>that provide a basis for the employer\u2019s knowledge of the employee\u2019s \u2018impropriety, violence, or disorder\u2019 and that those acts potentially place an employer on notice of the employee\u2019s violent propensities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561. Therefore, it appears that the majority has even further limited the scope of previous conduct by an employee that will be sufficient to put an employer on notice of the employee\u2019s violent propensities. Disregarding the fact that a rape is an \u201cincident of aggression,\u201d the majority claims that Johnson\u2019s previous \u201cincident of aggression\u201d toward an inmate did not make his subsequent rape of plaintiff foreseeable because the previous \u201cincident of aggression\u201d was not a \u201csexual assault.\u201d The majority\u2019s efforts to distinguish the differences between various violent acts leaves plaintiffs vulnerable to harm and immunizes employers from liability unless an employee commits the exact same act that he or she previously committed. In my view, the majority\u2019s analysis is arbitrary and undercuts the clear legislative intent of the CRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\"> Curiously, the majority proclaims that \u201c[n]o meaningful distinction can be drawn between the facts in <em>Champion </em>and those in the present matter,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 26, but later finds fault in my conclusion that a straightforward application of <em>Champion </em>is appropriate in this case. My conclusion is not faulty; rather, it simply reflects an adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis. It is the majority that falters in its effort to satisfy the burden of explaining its imprudent decision to forgo precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s argument that the \u201cconflicting dispositions in the courts below\u201d support its decision to overrule <em>Champion, ante </em>at 33, is simply one more example of the majority\u2019s misplaced efforts to satisfy its burden. While it is true that the trial court in this case applied <em>Zsigo </em>and the Court of Appeals applied <em>Champion, </em>a simple answer exists for this apparent conflict. Although our trial courts work diligently and, in the vast majority of instances, reach the correct result, the trial courts do, on occasion, err. Indeed, the Court of Appeals and this Court exist in large part to address this reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">In this case, the trial court erred by applying <em>Zsigo </em>because <em>Zsigo </em>did not consider a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim. Rather, as the Court of Appeals correctly determined, the proper course of conduct in this quid pro quo sexual harassment case was to apply <em>Champion, </em>not <em>Zsigo. </em>Indeed, as repeatedly noted in this dissent, the <em>Zsigo </em>majority recognized that <em>Champion </em>applies \u201cin the context of quid pro quo sexual harassment under MCL 37.2103(i).\u201d <em>Zsigo, </em>475 Mich at 224 n 19. Therefore, the resolution of this case should be simple: <em>Champion </em>should apply because this is a quid pro quo sexual harassment case.
