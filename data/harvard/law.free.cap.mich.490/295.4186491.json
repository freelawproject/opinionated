BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">On May 25, 2011, the Governor signed into law Enrolled House Bill 4361, which became 2011 PA 38. The particular provisions at issue here are MCL 206.30(7) and MCL 206.30(9) of the Income Tax Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which will take effect January 1, 2012. MCL 206.30(7) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">For a taxpayer whose total household resources[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] are $75,000.00 or more for a single return or $150,000.00 or more for a joint return, the personal exemption allowed under [MCL 206.30(2)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] shall be adjusted by multiplying the exemption for the tax year for a single return by a fraction, the numerator of which is $100,000.00 minus the taxpayer\u2019s total household resources, and the denominator of which is $25,000.00, and for a joint return by a fraction, the numerator of which is $200,000.00 minus the taxpayer\u2019s total household resources, and the denominator of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>$50,000.00. The personal exemption allowed under [MCL 206.30(2)] shall not be allowed for a single taxpayer whose total household resources exceed $100,000.00 or for joint filers whose total household resources exceed $200,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">MCL 206.30(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">In determining taxable income under this section, the following limitations and restrictions apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">(a) For a person born before 1946, this subsection provides no additional restrictions or limitations under [MCL 206.30(1)(fi)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">(b) For a person born in 1946 through 1952, the sum of the deductions under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i), (ii), and (iv)][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>is limited to $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. After that person reaches the age of 67, the deductions under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(\u00bf), (ii), and (iv)] do not apply and that person is eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return, which deduction is available against all types of income and is not restricted to income from retirement or pension benefits. However if that person\u2019s total household resources exceed $75,000.00 for a single return or $150,000.00 for a joint return, that person is not eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. A person that takes the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(e)][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] is not eligible for the unrestricted deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return under this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">(c) For a person born after 1952, the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i), <em>(ii), </em>or (iv)] does not apply. When that person reaches the age of 67, that person is eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return, which deduction is available against all types of income and is not restricted to income from retirement or pension benefits. If a person takes the deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return, that person shall not take the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(iii)][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] and shall not take the personal exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tion under [MCL 206.30(2)]. That person may elect not to take the deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return and elect to take the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1) (f) (\u00bf\u00a3\u00bf)] and the personal exemption under [MCL 206.30(2)] if that election would reduce that person\u2019s tax liability. However, if that person\u2019s total household resources exceed $75,000.00 for a single return or $150,000.00 for a joint return, that person is not eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. A person that takes the deduction under [MCL 206.30(l)(e)] is not eligible for the unrestricted deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return under this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">(d) For a joint return, the limitations and restrictions in this subsection shall be applied based on the age of the older spouse filing the joint return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Before the enactment of 2011 PA 38, public-pension benefits were completely deductible,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> private-pension benefits were deductible up to $42,240 for a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>return and $84,480 for a joint return (subject to annual inflation adjustments), and all taxpayers were entitled to a personal exemption of $2,500 (subject to annual inflation adjustments). See MCL 206.30(1)(f), (2), and (7), as amended by 2009 PA 134. Pursuant to 2011 PA 38, however, not all public pensions are deductible, not all private pensions are deductible up to $42,240 or $84,480, and not all taxpayers are entitled to a personal exemption. MCL 206.30(7) and (9). Instead, only those taxpayers whose total household resources are less than $75,000 for a single return or $150,000 for a joint return are entitled to the entire personal exemption (which is now $3,700),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> while those taxpayers whose total household resources are between $75,000 and $100,000 for a single return or $150,000 and $200,000 for a joint return are entitled to a portion of this personal exemption, and those taxpayers whose total household resources exceed $100,000 for a single return or $200,000 for a joint return are not entitled to any portion of the personal exemption. MCL 206.30(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In addition, while 2011 PA 38 does not affect the available pension deductions of those people born before 1946, it does affect the pension deductions of those people born in 1946 and thereafter. MCL 206.30(9). For those people born on or after January 1, 1946 and not after December 31, 1952, public and private pensions are subject to the same deductions up to $20,000 for a single return and $40,000 for a joint return. MCL 206.30(9)(b). And, upon reaching the age of 67, although the pension deductions are no longer available, a general deduction <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is available for those people up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>$20,000 for a single return and $40,000 for a joint return as long as the taxpayer\u2019s total household resources do not exceed $75,000 for a single return or $150,000 for a joint return. <em>Id. </em>Finally, for those people born after December 31, 1952, although the pension deductions are no longer available, upon reaching the age of 67, a general deduction is available up to $20,000 for a single return and $40,000 for a joint return as long as the taxpayer\u2019s total household resources do not exceed $75,000 for a single return or $150,000 for a joint return. MCL 206.30(9)(c). However, if a taxpayer takes the general deduction, he or she cannot take the deduction for social security benefits or the personal exemption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">The Governor, in a letter dated May 31, 2011, requested an advisory opinion regarding the constitutionality of 2011 PA 38. On June 15, 2011, we granted this request, invited the Attorney General to submit briefs and argue as both opponent and proponent of the matters at issue, invited other interested parties to file briefs amicus curiae, and, on September 7, 2011, heard oral arguments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">II. STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\u201cStatutes are presumed to be constitutional, and courts have a duty to construe a statute as constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent.\u201d <em>Taylor v Gate Pharm, </em>468 Mich 1, 6; 658 NW2d 127 (2003). \u201cWe exercise the power to declare a law unconstitutional with extreme caution, and we never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>exercise it where serious doubt exists with regard to the conflict.\u201d <em>Phillips v Mirac, Inc, </em>470 Mich 415, 422; 685 NW2d 174 (2004). \u201c \u2018Every reasonable presumption or intendment must be indulged in favor of the validity of an act, and it is only when invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution that a court will refuse to sustain its validity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423, quoting <em>Cady v Detroit, </em>289 Mich 499, 505; 286 NW 805 (1939). Therefore, \u201cthe burden of proving that a statute is unconstitutional rests with the party challenging it,\u201d <em>In re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71, </em>479 Mich 1, 11; 740 NW2d 444 (2007), in this case the opposing Attorney General. \u201c[W]hen considering a claim that a statute is unconstitutional, the Court does not inquire into the wisdom of the legislation.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>468 Mich at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\u201cThe presumption of constitutionality is especially strong with respect to taxing statutes.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>440 Mich 400, 413; 488 NW2d 182 (1992). \u201cState legislatures have great discretionary latitude in formulating taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018The legislature must determine all questions of State necessity, discretion or policy in ordering a tax and in apportioning it. 1 Cooley, Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 67. And the judicial tribunals of the State have no concern with the policy of State taxation determined by the legislature. 1 Cooley, Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 67.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, quoting <em>C F Smith Co v Fitzgerald, </em>270 Mich 659, 670; 259 NW 352 (1935). Therefore, \u201c[a] taxing statute must be shown to clearly and palpably violate[] the fundamental law before it will be declared unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>440 Mich at 415, quoting <em>O'Reilly v Wayne Co, </em>116 Mich App 582, 592; 323 NW2d 493 (1982) (citations and quotation marks omitted; alteration in <em>O\u2019Reilly).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201c \u2018When reviewing constitutional provisions, the objective of such review is to effectuate the intent of the people who adopted the constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Straus v Governor, </em>459 Mich 526, 533; 592 NW2d 53 (1999), quoting <em>Straus v Governor, </em>230 Mich App 222, 228; 583 NW2d 520 (1998). \u201c \u2018The lodestar principle is that of \u201ccommon understanding,\u201d the sense of the words used that would have been most obvious to those who voted to adopt the constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Both sides have cited portions of the \u201cAddress to the People\u201d and the record of the Constitutional Convention, both of which may properly be considered in interpreting constitutional provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Straus, </em>495 Mich at 533, quoting <em>Straus, </em>230 Mich App at 228 n 2.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, it must be remembered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>although this Court has continually recognized that constitutional convention debates are relevant to determining the meaning of a particular provision,. .. the proper objective in consulting constitutional convention debates is not to discern the intent of the framers in proposing or supporting a specific provision, but to determine the intent of the ratifiers in adopting the provision ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">Bearing this principle in mind, the primary focus. .. should not [be] on the intentions of the delegates ... but, rather, on any statements they may have made that would have shed light on why they chose to employ the particular terms they used in drafting the provision to aid in discerning what the common understanding of those terms would have been when the provision was ratified by the <em>people. [Studier v Mich Pub Sch Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642, 655-657; 698 NW2d 350 (2005) (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">A. ACCRUED FINANCIAL BENEFIT</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The first issue contained in the Governor\u2019s request for an advisory opinion concerns whether reducing or eliminating the statutory exemption for public-pension incomes as set forth in MCL 206.30 impairs accrued financial benefits of a \u201cpension plan [or] retirement system of the state [or] its political subdivisions\u201d under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. The first clause of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 provides, \u201cThe accrued financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>impaired thereby.\u201d Before \u00a7 24 was adopted, \u201c[i]t had long been the general rule that pensions granted by public authorities were not contractual obligations but gratuitous allowances which could be revoked at will by the authority because the pensioner was not deemed to have had any vested right in their continuation.\u201d <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 258, </em>389 Mich 659, 662; 209 NW2d 200 (1973).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The obvious intent of \u00a7 24, however, was to ensure that public pensions be treated as contractual obligations that, once earned, could not be diminished. As explained by Delegate Richard Van Dusen, who served on the Finance and Taxation Committee and was the chairman of the Rules and Resolutions Committee, at the Constitutional Convention of 1961-1962,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">[\u00a7 24] is designed to . .. give to the employees participating in these plans a security which they do not now enjoy, by making the accrued financial benefits of the plans contractual rights. This, you might think, would go without saying, but several judicial determinations have been made to the effect that participants in pension plans for public employees have no vested interest in the benefits which they believe they have earned; that the municipalities and the state authorities which provide these plans provide them as a gratuity, and therefore it is within the province of the municipality or the other public employer to terminate the plan at will without regard to the benefits which have been, in the judgment of the employees, earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">Now, it is the belief of the committee that the benefits of pension plans are in a sense deferred compensation for work performed. And with respect to work performed, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the opinion of the committee that the public employee should have a contractual right to benefits of the pension plan, which should not be diminished by the employing unit after the service has been performed. [1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 770-771, quoted with approval in <em>Advisory Opinion, </em>389 Mich at 663.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, however, says nothing about whether these pension benefits can be taxed. And given the broad authority to tax granted to the Legislature by Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 1<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the specific constitutional prohibition against \u201csurrendering], suspending] or contracting] away\u201d this authority, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a limitation on the Legislature\u2019s authority to tax pensions cannot reasonably be read into Const 1963, art <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>9, \u00a7 24. If the ratifiers of the Constitution had intended to limit the Legislature\u2019s authority to tax pensions in the same manner as all other forms of income, they would have expressly said so in \u00a7 24.

As the Ohio Supreme Court explained in upholding the validity of Ohio\u2019s decision to eliminate a public-employee-pension-tax exemption, \u201cthere is a definite legal distinction between reducing the rate of a pension and levying a tax upon the income received from that pension.\u201d <em>Herrick v Lindley, </em>59 Ohio St 2d 22; 391 NE2d 729, 733 (1979).

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The second issue contained in the Governor\u2019s request for an advisory opinion concerns whether reducing or eliminating the statutory tax exemption for pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>incomes as set forth in MCL 206.30 impairs a contractual obligation in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 or US Const, art I, \u00a7 10(1). Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 provides, \u201cNo bill of attainder, ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contract shall be enacted.\u201d Similarly, US Const, art I, \u00a7 10(1) provides, \u201cNo State shall. . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . .. .\u201d As discussed earlier, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 provides that an accrued public pension is a \u201ccontractual obligation.\u201d However, as also discussed earlier, \u201cthe obligation of [the] contract\u201d specifically consists of the pension income, not the tax exemption of that income, and thus reducing or eliminating the tax exemption does not affect, much less impair, the obligation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">Several of the amicus curiae briefs argue that regardless of whether the tax exemption is an \u201caccrued financial benefit\u201d and thus a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d for purposes of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, merely by enacting a statutory tax exemption, the Legislature created a contractual right to this exemption that cannot subsequently be diminished without violating Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10. However, as this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">Of primary importance to the viability of our republican system of government is the ability of elected representatives to act on behalf of the people through the exercise of their power to enact, amend, or repeal legislation. Therefore, a fundamental principle of the jurisprudence of both the United States and this state is that one legislature cannot bind the power of a successive legislature....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">Although this venerable principle that a legislative body may not bind its successors can be limited in some circumstances because of its tension with the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>prohibitions against the impairment of contracts, thus enabling one legislature to contractually bind another, such surrenders of legislative power are subject to strict limitations that have developed in order to protect the sovereign prerogatives of state governments. A necessary corollary of these limitations that has been developed by the United States Supreme Court, and followed by this Court, is the <em>strong presumption that statutes do not create contractual rights. </em>This presumption, and its relation to the protection of the sovereign powers of a legislature, was succinctly described by the United States Supreme Court in <em>[Nat\u2019l R Passenger Corp v Atchison, T &amp; S F R Co, </em>470 US 451, 465-466; 105 S Ct 1441; 84 L Ed 2d 432 (1985)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\u201cFor many decades, this Court has maintained that absent some clear indication that the legislature intends to bind itself contractually, the presumption is that \u2018a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.\u2019. .. This well-established presumption is grounded in the elementary proposition that the principal function of a legislature is not to make contracts, but to make laws that establish the policy of the state.... Policies, unlike contracts, are inherently subject to revision and repeal, and to construe laws as contracts when the obligation is not clearly and unequivocally expressed would be to limit drastically the essential powers of a legislative body. Indeed, ! \u201c[t]he continued existence of a government would be of no great value, if by implications and presumptions, it was disarmed of the powers necessary to accomplish the ends of its creation.\u201d \u2019 Thus, the party asserting the creation of a contract must overcome this well-founded presumption,... and we proceed cautiously both in identifying a contract within the language of a regulatory statute and in defining the contours of any contractual obligation.\u201d <em>[Studier, </em>472 Mich at 660-662 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Accordingly, \u201c[i]n order for a statute to form the basis of a contract, the statutory language \u2018must be \u201cplain and susceptible of no other reasonable construction\u201d than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that the Legislature intended to be bound to a contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662 (citations omitted). That is, \u201c[b]efore a statute, particularly one relating to taxation, should be held to be irrepealable or not subject to amendment, an intent not to repeal or amend must be so directly and unmistakably expressed as to leave no reason for doubt. Otherwise the intent is not plainly expressed.\u201d <em>Harsha v Detroit, </em>261 Mich 586, 594; 246 NW 849 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">For example, \u201c[i]f the statutory language \u2018provides for the execution of a written contract <em>on behalf of the state </em>the case for an obligation binding upon the state is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 662, quoting <em>Nat\u2019l R Passenger Corp, </em>470 US at 466 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Statutes containing an express covenant not to amend the legislation are also deemed to create contractual obligations. <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 663. \u201cBut, \u2018absent \u201can adequate expression of an actual intent\u201d of the State to bind itself,\u2019 courts should not construe laws declaring a scheme of public regulation as also creating private contracts to which the state is a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, quoting <em>Nat\u2019l R Passenger Corp, </em>470 US at 466-467, quoting <em>Wisconsin &amp; Mich R Co v Powers, </em>191 US 379, 386-387; 24 S Ct 107; 48 L Ed 229 (1903).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">As was the case in <em>Studier, </em>none of the statutory tax exemption provisions that are at issue here contain any language \u201cproviding] for a written contract on behalf of the state of Michigan or even use terms typically associated with contractual relationships, such as \u2018contract,\u2019 \u2018covenant,\u2019 or \u2018vested rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>at 663-664.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cHad the Legislature intended to surrender its legislative powers through the creation of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>tractual rights, it would have expressly done so by employing such terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. And, as in <em>Studier, </em>\u201cnowhere in the statute[s] did the Legislature covenant that it would not amend the statute[s] to remove or diminish the obligation\u201d in question. <em>Id. </em>at 665. \u201cAgain, had the Legislature intended to surrender its power to make such changes, it would have done so explicitly.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cThus, there is no indication that the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>that enacted [these provisions] intended to do anything beyond . . . set forth a policy to be pursued until one of its successor legislatures ordained a new policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665-666. Because there is no language in any of the statutory tax exemption provisions at issue here indicating that the Legislature intended to be contractually bound by these provisions forever, and because Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 2 prohibits the Legislature from contracting away its taxing authority, we conclude that the tax exemption statutes do not create contractual rights that cannot be altered by the Legislature. Indeed, it is \u201cwell established that a taxpayer does not have a vested right in a tax statute or in the continuance of any tax law.\u201d <em>Detroit v Walker, </em>445 Mich 682, 703; 520 NW2d 135 (1994); see also <em>Ludka v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>155 Mich App 250, 260; 399 NW2d 490 (1986) (noting that the Legislature is free to take rights that arise under a tax statute away at any time); <em>United States v Carlton, 512 </em>US 26, 33; 114 S Ct 2018; 129 L Ed 2d 22 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(\u201cTax legislation is not a promise, and a taxpayer has no vested right in the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">For these reasons, reducing or eliminating the statutory tax exemption for pension incomes as set forth in MCL 206.30 does not impair any contractual obligation in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 or US Const, art I, \u00a7 10(1). In short, we are able to identify absolutely no provision within either constitution that provides that public employees, and <em>only </em>public employees, are entitled in perpetuity to receive pension income without having to pay taxes on that income and that such income alone will be forever exempt from having to support the costs of government. The opposing Attorney General contends that, come war, come natural disaster, come impending bankruptcy, only the pension income of public employees, among all individual income, will be off-limits from ever being used to pay the costs of government, including, significantly, the costs of public employees themselves. The opposing Attorney General, in our judgment, argues in behalf of a Constitution that does not exist, and we firmly reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">C. EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The third issue concerns whether determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions on the basis of date of birth as set forth in MCL 206.30(9) violates the equal protection of the law under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2 or the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tion. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2 states, in pertinent part, \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws . . . Similarly, US Const, Am XIV \u00a7 1 states, \u201c[N]or shall any state . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cOf course, most laws differentiate in some fashion between classes of persons.\u201d <em>Nordlinger v Hahn, </em>505 US 1, 10; 112 S Ct 2326; 120 L Ed 2d 1 (1992). Indeed, the enactment of laws that differentiate between classes of persons lies at the heart of the legislative power. Welfare laws that apportion benefits on the basis of income, criminal laws that establish terms of imprisonment on the basis of conduct and criminal histories, and tax laws that take into account such circumstances of the taxpayer as the number of children, the amount of charitable contributions, and the level of medical expenses all differentiate among legislatively determined classes of persons. \u201cThe Equal Protection Clause does not forbid classifications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAs a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>rule, \u2018legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., quoting McGowan v Maryland, </em>366 US 420, 425-426; 81 S Ct 1101; 6 L Ed 2d 393 (1961). Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has made it \u201cclear that, unless a classification warrants some form of heightened review because it jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Nordlinger, </em>505 US at 10.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This is known as the \u201crational basis\u201d standard. Any less deferential standard of review would transform this Court into a body in which review, and reversal, of the judgments of the Legislature would become increasingly routine given the ordinary incidence of laws in which the Legislature has established classifications among persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The opposing Attorney General argues that a heightened standard of review \u2014 specifically, strict scrutiny \u2014 is required because there is a constitutional right to a tax-free pension. But, of course, this Court has determined this proposition to the contrary. For the reasons discussed with regard to the first two issues, there is no constitutional right to a tax-free pension. There is no right on the part of public employees, alone among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>all persons, to such a benefit. Furthermore, even if there were such a constitutional right, not all constitutional rights warrant application of the strict-scrutiny standard, only those that are considered \u201cfundamental rights,\u201d i.e., those rights \u201ctraditionally protected by our society\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>470 Mich at 434 (citations and quotation marks omitted). The right to a tax-free pension has never been held to be a constitutional right, much less a fundamental right.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It is uncontested that the classification at issue here does not involve a suspect class because age has never been held to constitute such a class. <em>Massachusetts Bd of Retirement v Murgia, </em>427 US 307, 314; 96 S Ct 2562; 49 L Ed 2d 520 (1976) (\u201cEven if the statute could be said to impose a penalty upon a class defined as the aged, it would not impose a distinction sufficiently akin to those classifications that we have found suspect to call for strict judicial scrutiny.\u201d); <em>Kimel v Florida Bd of Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>gents, </em>528 US 62, 83; 120 S Ct 631; 145 L Ed 2d 522 (2000) (\u201c[A]ge is not a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause. States may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the Fourteenth Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d) (citations omitted). Because the classification at issue here does not pertain to either a fundamental right or a suspect class, the rational-basis standard is applicable. \u201c[B]ecause an age classification is presumptively rational, the individual challenging its constitutionality bears the burden of proving that the \u2018facts on which the classification is apparently based could not reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decisionmaker.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kimel, </em>528 US at 84, quoting <em>Vance v Bradley, </em>440 US 93, 111; 99 S Ct 939; 59 L Ed 2d 171 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The rational-basis standard is \u201ca relatively relaxed standard reflecting the Court\u2019s awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one.\u201d <em>Murgia, </em>427 US at 314. \u201cPerfection in making the necessary classifications is neither possible nor necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSuch action by a legislature is presumed to be valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, under the rational-basis standard, \u201c \u2018courts will uphold legislation as long as that legislation is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips, </em>470 Mich at 433, quoting <em>Crego v Coleman, </em>463 Mich 248, 259; 615 NW2d 218 (2000). \u201cThe rational basis test does not test \u2018the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation ....\u2019\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>470 Mich at 434, quoting <em>Crego, </em>463 Mich at 260.

Recognizing that older individuals may have a \u201cdiminishing earning capacity\u201d also constitutes an altogether legitimate reason for basing eligibility for the pension exemption on age. <em>Cruz v Chevrolet Grey Iron Div of Gen Motors Corp, </em>398 Mich 117, 133-134 (opinion by COLEMAN, J.), 137-138 (opinion by LEVIN, J.); 247 NW2d 764 (1976) (holding that the \u201cdiminishing earning capacity\u201d of older workers constitutes a rational basis for the provision in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.357, that provides for reduction in compensation payments to employees over the age of 65).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>For these reasons, determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions on the basis of age or date of birth as set forth in MCL 206.30(9) does not violate the equal protection of the law under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2 or the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">D. GRADUATED INCOME TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The final issue concerns whether determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions and deductions on the basis of total household resources as set forth in MCL 206.30(7) and (9) creates a graduated income tax in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7 provides, \u201cNo income tax graduated as to rate or base shall be imposed by the state or any of its subdivisions.\u201d A graduated income tax is generally understood to be a tax on income that imposes a proportionately greater tax burden on the earnings of higher-income taxpayers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>than on that of lower-income taxpayers.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7 prohibits both an income tax graduated as to rate and an income tax graduated as to base. It is uncontested by the parties that the provisions at issue here do not create an income tax graduated as to \u201crate\u201d because all individual taxpayers will be required to pay a flat 4.35 percent income tax. Instead, the issue is whether the provisions create an income tax graduated as to \u201cbase\u201d because only certain taxpayers, depending on their income levels, will be entitled to the personal exemption and to the $20,000 or $40,000 deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">It is also uncontested that a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d consists of his or her net taxable income and that exemptions and deductions reduce a taxpayer\u2019s base by reducing the amount of a taxpayer\u2019s income subject to taxation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> That is, if a taxpayer is entitled to an exemption or deduction, his or her base is reduced, and if a taxpayer is not entitled to an exemption or deduction, his or her base is not reduced. Concomitantly, an <em>income-based </em>deduction or exemption is one to which taxpayers are, or are not, entitled as a function of their incomes. Traditionally, in a progressive or graduated tax system, taxpayers with lower incomes are allowed the exemption or deduction, while taxpayers with higher incomes are deprived of the exemption or deduction in order to create graduation. Consequently, everything else being equal, taxpayers with higher incomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>will have <em>disproportionately </em>larger bases than taxpayers with lower incomes because a higher proportion of their income is included in their base. Therefore, income-based exemptions and deductions result in an income tax that is graduated as to base, which can occur even when all income is taxed at a flat rate.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This is exactly what the ratifiers of our Constitution explicitly prohibited by adopting \u00a7 7, which provides, \u201cNo income tax graduated as to . . . base shall be imposed by the state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We do not believe that the ratifiers could have been any clearer in their intent to prohibit a graduated income tax, and we believe that the statutory provisions at issue here create such a prohibited tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">MCL 206.30(7) conditions a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to the personal exemption on his or her income. If a taxpayer\u2019s income is less than $75,000 for a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>return or $150,000 for a joint return, the taxpayer is fully entitled to the $3,700 personal exemption. However, if a taxpayer\u2019s income is between $75,000 and $100,000 for a single return or between $150,000 and $200,000 for a joint return, the taxpayer is only entitled to a declining proportion of the exemption, and this proportion depends entirely on the extent to which the taxpayer\u2019s income exceeds the threshold levels of $75,000 for a single return or $150,000 for a joint return.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Finally, if a taxpayer\u2019s income exceeds $100,000 for a single return or $200,000 for a joint return, the taxpayer is not entitled to any portion of the $3,700 personal exemption. This \u201cphaseout\u201d of the personal exemption creates an income tax graduated as to base because entitlement to the exemption \u2014 and the extent of such entitlement, which reduces the taxpayer\u2019s base \u2014 is entirely dependent on the taxpayer\u2019s income level.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> To the extent that MCL 206.30(7) conditions a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to the personal exemption on his or her income, it is an income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>graduated as to base<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and plainly violative of Const <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">With regard to the $20,000/$40,000 deduction, MCL 206.30(9) conditions a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to the $20,000 deduction for a single return or $40,000 deduction for a joint return on his or her income. If a taxpayer\u2019s income is $75,000 or less for a single return or $150,000 or less for a joint return, the taxpayer may be entitled to the $20,000/$40,000 deduction. However, if the taxpayer\u2019s income exceeds $75,000 for a single return or $150,000 for a joint return, the taxpayer is not entitled to the $20,000/$40,000 deduction. This $75,000/$150,000 income limitation creates an income tax graduated as to base because entitlement to the $20,000/$40,000 deduction, which reduces a taxpayer\u2019s base, is entirely a function of the taxpayer\u2019s income level. Once again, to the extent that MCL 206.30(9) conditions a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to the $20,000/$40,000 deduction on his or her income, it is an income tax graduated as to base and plainly violative of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The supporting Attorney General argues that the \u201cbase\u201d language <em>only </em>prohibits taxation that is piggybacked on the federal tax liability. In support of this argument, he cites the Address to the People, which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>This is a new section making it clear that neither the state nor any local unit of government may impose a graduated income tax. The words \u201cor base\u201d are necessary to prevent \u201cpiggyback\u201d taxation based on the federal tax liability. Without such language, a tax nominally imposed at a flat rate might actually adopt all of the graduation of the federal tax. [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3399.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">This language certainly does indicate that one purpose of using the term \u201cbase\u201d was to prevent piggyback taxation, in which tax graduation is achieved by means of imposing a state income tax defined in terms of a particular percentage of the graduated federal income tax. However, nothing in the Address \u2014 and, even more significantly, nothing in the text of the Constitution itself \u2014 suggests that this was the <em>only </em>intended purpose of using \u201cbase.\u201d The necessary implication of the supporting Attorney General\u2019s argument is that the constitutional ratifiers intended to prohibit one, and only one, specific means of creating a graduated base, while permitting all other means of creating a graduated base. We do not believe that such an implication can fairly be drawn from a provision of the Constitution that states, <em>\u201cNo </em>income tax graduated as to ... base\u201d shall be imposed by the state. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">This Court\u2019s understanding of the \u201cbase\u201d language was also expressed by the delegates during the constitutional convention debates. For example, Delegate Van Dusen explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">Without the words \u201cor base\u201d you do not really have any protection against an <em>indirectly </em>graduated state income tax, because a flat rate tax imposed upon the federal tax liability would simply pick up all of the graduation of the federal liability. Without these words \u201cor base\u201d there is no question but what in my judgment a nominally flat rate tax could be made a graduated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>income tax. [1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 894 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">That the delegates understood their new constitutional provision to prohibit the imposition of a graduated income tax, directly or indirectly, is clear. As Delegate Van Dusen further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">The prohibition against the graduated income tax with which we are now dealing is one which has not been in our constitution up until now largely because the evil of the graduated income tax has not been as apparent until the last twenty years. The progressivity, the steep graduation of our federal system has taught us that this is a problem, and if there is to be some balance in our total tax structure \u2014 all of us, after all, are federal taxpayers as well as state taxpayers \u2014 this is a limitation which we as citizens of this state may reasonably impose upon our legislature. <em>[Id. </em>at 879-880.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">And Delegate Henry Woolfenden explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">This country has been built, in my judgment, in my conviction, because of equality of opportunity and not because of legislative equality. If we want to make equal by legislation, then we should join some socialist government; but I am in favor of equality of opportunity, and I think a graduated income tax which says if my next door neighbor earns twice as much money as I do that he should not pay twice as much, he should pay 4 times as much, is essentially an immoral tax. I am absolutely opposed to it.... I do not believe we are hamstringing the legislature; I think we are merely stating the American philosophy of free enterprise and equality of opportunity. <em>[Id. </em>at 888.][<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">And Delegate O. Lee Boothby explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>There are 2 uses of taxes. The one use is to take care of the legitimate needs of government and that is the legitimate use, and the other use that has been seized upon by some people is to use taxation for the principle of distributing wealth. This is what I call a Robin Hood style of government where you take it from the rich and give it to the poor. I do not believe this is the legitimate purpose of taxation and I feel that it is necessary to write into the constitution a prohibition against a government adopting this theory of taking it from the rich and distributing it and leveling all people to the same status in society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">... I thought it was most interesting to note that 2,300 years ago the Greeks tried the so called progressive income tax \u2014 and there is nothing progressive about an income tax, it was tried 2,300 years ago by the Greeks, and a leading scholar of that day, Socrates, made this comment; he said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cIt would appear that success is to be punished; that exorbitant taxes have made it a crime for man to prosper. The end result of such order can only be removal of incentive, the discouragement of our people and the destruction of our free society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">When a few years later the Spartans came and attacked Athens, the Greeks did not seem to feel they had anything to fight for. <em>[Id. </em>at 890.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Regardless of whether one today agrees or disagrees with the reasoning of the delegates in adopting Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7, one thing is clear: the delegates\u2019 understanding of this constitutional provision was that it would prohibit a graduated income tax, plain and simple,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and there is nothing whatsoever in the express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>language of this provision that would suggest in any way that the ratifiers\u2019 understanding was any different. Indeed, it is hard to identify any significant provision of the Michigan Constitution that is more explicit and more straightforward than Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">This clarity undoubtedly explains Attorney General Frank Kelley\u2019s understanding of \u00a7 7 in 1965:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">The term \u201cgraduated rate\u201d was used in reference to the Federal income tax rate structure.... The base restriction was to prohibit graduation by <em>indirection....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Graduation as to base means producing the effect of a tax graduated as to rate by reducing the tax base for lower incomes and increasing it for higher incomes received by a particular class of taxpayers within a tax period. In either instance, the result forbidden by the Constitution is the imposition of a proportionately greater income tax burden on the income of high income groups than on that of low income tax groups. Granting of a deduction and/or applying a uniform rate to all in a class is valid so long as the classification is reasonable and is not made in reference to the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>income received in a tax period. [OAG, 1965-1966, No 4428, pp 52-53 (March 31, 1965) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Furthermore, this is also the understanding of \u00a7 7 adopted by this Court. In <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>this Court held that tax credits for property tax and city income tax liability did not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7 because, as the Court of Appeals had explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201c[t]he credits for property and income taxes are allowed against the tax liability of all taxpayers <em>without regard to their income. </em>The limitations upon the amounts of credits that may be claimed by a taxpayer are <em>not based upon the taxpayer\u2019s </em>income; the effect is not to impose a tax violative of the constitutional prohibition against a tax graduated as to rate or base.\u201d <em>{Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 389; 183 NW2d 796 (1971), quoting <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>15 Mich App 364, 371; 166 NW2d 697 (1968) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">That this Court focused on the fact that a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to the credits was not determined by the taxpayer\u2019s income \u2014 and ultimately upheld the credits\u2014 suggests that it may have believed that basing a taxpayer\u2019s entitlement to a credit on his or her income might run afoul of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Thus, the implication of this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kuhn </em>is that the Court believed that an income-based credit <em>might </em>be a \u201ctax violative of the constitutional prohibition against a tax graduated as to rate or base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Indeed, in <em>Butcher v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>we recognized that \u201cby closely examining the credits, exclusions, and exemptions ... challenged [in <em>Kuhn], </em>we at least implied that a constitutional violation can occur by the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>income criteria for determining their amounts\u201d and that \u201c \u00a3[t]he dispositive question [was] whether the credit at issue indirectly creates a progressive or graduated <em>income tax </em>rate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butcher v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>425 Mich 262, 273-274; 389 NW2d 412 (1986), quoting <em>Butcher v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>141 Mich App 116, 121; 366 NW2d 15 (1984) (emphasis in the original). We held that the credit at issue, i.e., the property-tax credit, did not create a graduated income tax even though it was income-dependent because it was \u201cin effect a <em>property tax rebate </em>that employs the income tax as a vehicle for its reconciliation\u201d and, thus, \u201cart 9, \u00a7 7, which is concerned only with <em>income taxes, </em>[was] inapplicable ....\u201d <em>Butcher, </em>425 Mich at 276 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> We reached this conclusion because \u201c \u00a3a property taxpayer may file for this property tax rebate and receive such a rebate even if the computed rebate exceeds the amount of income taxes the property taxpayer might owe or even if the property taxpayer has no state income tax liability whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, quoting <em>Butcher, </em>141 Mich App at 122. Unlike the properiy-tax credit at issue in <em>Butcher, </em>it is uncontested that the income-tax exemptions and deductions at issue in the instant case are clearly <em>income taxes. </em>The only question is whether they <em>ace graduated </em>income taxes and, for the reasons explained above, we conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">We conclude that determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions and deductions on the basis of total household resources as set forth in MCL 206.30(7), or age and total household resources as set forth in MCL 206.30(9) creates a graduated income tax in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>E.

The only unconstitutional portions of the act at issue here are those that ground eligibility for the personal exemption and for the $20,000/$40,000 deduction on the taxpayer\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We are convinced that severing these unconstitutional provisions is not inconsistent with the manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>intent of the Legislature. MCL 8.5. First, there is no indication in the act that the drafters of 2011 PA 38 intended a different severability rule than MCL 8.5 to apply. Second, this is the remedy expressly requested by the supporting Attorney General, who represents the views of a majority of the Legislature. And third, it seems clear to this Court that the Legislature \u201cwould have passed the statute had it been aware that portions therein would be declared to be invalid and, consequently, excised from the act.\u201d <em>Pletz v Secretary of State, </em>125 Mich App 335, 375; 336 NW2d 789 (1983); see also <em>Eastwood Park Amusement, </em>325 Mich at 73 (stating the general rule that unconstitutional provisions may be severed even absent a severability clause if, among other conditions, \u201cit is clear from the ordinance itself that it was the intent of the legislature to enact these provisions irrespective of the others\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted). As the Legislature stated in the title of the act, 2011 PA 38 is \u201c[a]n act to meet deficiencies in state funds . . . .\u201d The language limiting the personal exemption and the $20,000/$40,000 deduction are but two ways in which the Legislature has sought to accomplish this goal. Although the extent to which 2011 PA 38 addressed \u201cdeficiencies in state funds\u201d will be diminished to a small degree as the result of the severance, what will remain nonetheless enables the Legislature to realize its stated objectives. As the result of severance, the estimated level of revenues from 2011 PA 38 will be reduced from $1.4237 billion in fiscal year 2012-2013 to $1.3325 billion, a reduction of 6.4 percent.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> We believe that, had the Legislature \u201cbeen aware that portions [of 2011 PA 38] would be declared to be invalid and, consequently, excised from the act,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Pletz, </em>125 Mich App at 375, it would nonetheless have enacted the remainder of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">In addition, we are convinced that the remainder of the act can be given effect without the invalid portions. See MCL 8.5.

The right of the legislature to control the public treasury, to determine the sources from which the public revenues shall be derived and the objects upon which they shall he expended, to dictate the time, the manner, and the means both of their collection and disbursement, is firmly and inexpugnably established in our political system. This supreme prerogative of the legislature, called in question by Charles I, was the issue upon which Parliament went to war with the king, with the result that ultimately the absolute control of Parliament over the public treasury was forever vindicated as a fundamental principle of the British Constitution. The American commonwealths have fallen heirs to this great principle, and the prerogative in question passes to their legislatures without restriction or diminution, except as provided by their Constitutions, by the simple grant of the legislative power.

[1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 774.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Thus, although there was much discussion at the constitutional convention of creating a contractual right to receive pension benefits, there was absolutely no discussion of creating a contractual right to tax-free pension benefits.

Given that neither the actual language of \u00a7 24 nor the Address to the People mentions such a right, the ratifiers would have had absolutely no reason to suppose that, by adopting \u00a7 24, they would be creating a contractual right to tax-free pension benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b593-4\"> Chairman Van Dusen also stated that \u00a7 24 \u201cwas simply designed to put pension benefits earned in public service on the same basis as deferred compensation earned in private employment.\u201d 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 773.

It does this with no analysis of the dispositive language \u201caccrued financial benefit\u201d and thus offers no explanation for its conclusion that the tax exemption itself, as distinguished from the pension benefits, constitutes an \u201caccrued financial benefit.\u201d Justice Hathaway contends that we \u201ccreateD an unnecessary distinction\u201d because \u201ca tax is a tax, whether it comes in the form of a direct tax increase or the elimination of a deduction.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 371. We agree that there is no significant distinction for present purposes between a tax increase and the elimination of a deduction, and we make no such distinction. Again, the distinction that Justice Hathaway misses is the one between pension benefits and tax exemptions, not the one between a tax increase and the elimination of a deduction. Finally, Justice Hathaway cites an opinion of the Attorney General for the proposition that a tax exemption is a \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d without noting that the Attorney General expressly stated in the same opinion that he was not answering the question that is now at issue: \u201cwhether the Legislature may, without violating Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, limit or repeal the tax exemptions in the four retirement statutes ... as to current retirees and members without providing equal alternative benefits in place thereof.\u201d OAG, 1991-1992, No 6697, p 121 (December 18, 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\"> In <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 668, this Court held that the statute establishing health-care benefits for public school retirees, MCL 38.1391(1), does not create a contractual right to receive health-care benefits because \u201cthe plain language of MCL 38.1391(1) does not clearly indicate that the Legislature intended to surrender its legislative powers through the statute\u2019s enactment... .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\"> See, for example, the former tax exemption provision of the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act, MCL 38.40(1), as amended by 2002 PA 99, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">The right of a person to a pension, an annuity, a retirement allowance, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, the various funds created by this act, and all money and investments and income of the funds, <em>are exempt </em>from any state, county, municipal, or other local tax.

There is a rational basis for allowing an individual who otherwise would not receive the pension exemption to receive it if his or her spouse was born before 1946. Married persons plan for their financial futures together, and when one spouse cannot easily adjust to or absorb changes in a tax law because of his or her age, the other spouse necessarily shares in that burden.

To the contrary, there is a rational basis for this: the state is attempting to phase out the availability of the broadest exemptions and deductions for pension incomes altogether. While the legislation is designed to protect older pensioners who have greater reliance on the pre-2011 PA 38 tax rules, the key protection built in to the stratified system is <em>from the changes immediately occurring in the tax code in 2012. </em>That is, the Legislature has determined that it is not necessary to protect pensioners progressively as they age because the younger pensioners are at the time of the changes in 2012, the better they will be able to anticipate and plan for their tax liability when they retire. The primary goal, which the stratified system achieves at a more gradual pace, is to equalize the tax burden among Michigan citizens, by means of having public pensioners share to a greater extent in the cost of government from the income they are continuing to earn in retirement. Whether we agree or disagree with these policy determinations, there exists a rational basis to support the system designed by the Legislature to accomplish this goal, and thus it is neither capricious nor arbitrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> All seven justices agree that there is no equal protection violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b609-4\"> See OAG, 1965-1966, No 4428, p 53 (March 31, 1965) (\u201c[T]he result forbidden by the Constitution is the imposition of a proportionately greater income tax burden on the income of high income groups than on that of low income tax groups.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b609-5\"> See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), which defines \u201ctax deduction\u201d as \u201c[a] subtraction from gross income in arriving at taxable income\u201d and defines \u201ctax exemption\u201d as \u201c[\u00a1Immunity from the obligation of paying taxes in whole or in part.\u201d \u201cTax deductions are technically different from tax exemptions, but the effect of both is to reduce gross income in computing taxable income.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 1310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"AcZ\"> It is not in dispute that the Legislature can enact nonincome-based exemptions and deductions even though such exemptions and deductions may have the incidental effect of creating different <em>effective </em>tax rates.

Given that the term \u201ctotal household resources\u201d is defined as including \u201call <em>income </em>received by all persons of a household in a tax year while members of a household,\u201d MCL 206.508(4) (emphasis added), we are unpersuaded by this argument.

Accordingly, when the supporting Attorney General argues merely that \u201ctotal household resources\u201d is calculated differently from AGI or even \u201ctaxable income\u201d as defined in MCL 206.30(1), this does not show that <em>the concept of \u201ctotal household resources\u201d differs qualitatively from the concept of income. </em>The Legislature cannot avoid the constitutional prohibition of a graduated income tax by simply replacing the term \u201cincome\u201d with the term \u201ctotal household resources\u201d when these two terms are largely equivalent. That one term may include some forms of income that the other does not does not alter the fact that both terms are still at their core referring to income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> The supporting Attorney General\u2019s answer to the following question suggests what would be left of the Constitution\u2019s prohibition against a graduated income tax if his arguments on income-based phase-outs prevailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\"><em>Justice Markman: </em>[I]s it your argument that.. . akin to the alternative minimum tax which we have in the federal system, the Legislature could phase-out whatever deductions or exemptions it wanted to, [it] could phase them out at whatever rate of acceleration it wanted to, and it could phase them out completely at whatever low level it wanted to, and not be in violation of art 9, \u00a7 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\"><em>Supporting Attorney General: </em>That is correct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> To illustrate how 2011 PA 38 creates a graduated base by conditioning the receipt of the <em>personal exemption </em>on a taxpayer\u2019s income, consider the following individual taxpayers each taxed at a flat rate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Income Pre-38 Exemption Tax Base Exemption PA 38 PA 38 Tax Base</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8\">$10,000 3.600 6.400 3.600 6.400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALQ\">$50,000 3.600 6.400 3.600 46.400</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOg\">$87,500 3.600 83,900 1,800 85,700</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An4\">$100,000 3.600 96.400 0 100,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-27\">The personal exemption is tied to inflation: in 2010 it was set at $3,600; in 2011, it will be $3,700. The exemption is kept constant here for demonstration purposes. Under the pre-2011 PA 38 exemption, every taxpayer receives a $3,600 personal exemption off the top of household income, and thus each taxpayer\u2019s base is reduced by the set amount irrespective of income. However, 2011 PA 38 alters the personal exemption system by phasing out the personal exemption at $75,000 and completely eliminating it at $100,000. Thus, the two right columns on the chart illustrate how the current income tax exemption would be affected by the new income-dependent provisions and how the exemption phase-out is precisely the kind of graduated income tax base that the Constitution prohibits: the two highest earners illustrated have larger tax bases on which they must pay the flat 4.35 percent tax rate, and their tax bases are larger to the extent that the exemption does not apply to them <em>for no other reason than their higher incomes. </em>By basing an income exemption solely on income, 2011 PA 38 effectively delays the point from which the tax clock will begin to run on income for some, but not all, taxpayers. Accordingly, it is contrary to a flat-tax system.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-28\">The $20,000 deduction employs a similar graduated structure by eliminating the ability to claim the deduction for earners who make more than $75,000. The only notable difference between the two is that instead of providing a phase-out as the personal exemption does, it employs a \u201ccliff\u201d whereby as soon as an individual taxpayer earns more than $75,000, he or she loses the entire deduction. Thus, this also impermissibly conditions the receipt of a deduction affecting tax hase on income criteria, thereby again creating impermissible graduation. Within the range in which both the exemption and the deduction would be phased out and/or eliminated ($75,000-$100,000), earners with pension income would incur the highest marginal tax rates by far under the statute \u2014 the closer their earnings to the lower figure, the higher their rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> The constitutional convention record indicates that an applause followed this statement and that several other delegates expressed their agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> Given the rationale so clearly expressed by delegates in support of the prohibition of a graduated income tax, there is no conceivable reason why they would have been any less concerned about a graduated income tax that is created <em>directly </em>by conditioning eligibility for deductions and exemptions on taxpayers\u2019 income levels than they would have been about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>a graduated income tax that is created <em>indirectly </em>by imposing an income tax defined in terms of a particular percentage of the undeniably graduated federal income tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> It is also interesting to note that the people of this state have rejected, in substantial numbers, three efforts to <em>repeal </em>the prohibition against a graduated income tax in Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.

If the intent of the Legislature is more truly in accord with the analysis of Justice Hathaway\u2019s opinion than with that of this opinion, the Legislature is, of course, free to act on its own to conform with that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Further, in asserting as Justice Hathaway does that this Court should strike down the deduction and exemption sections in their entirety, we conclude that, just as the Legislature did not \u201cintend\u201d that this Court strike down the limited portions of the law that the Court determines to be unconstitutional, the Legislature also did not \u201cintend\u201d that the <em>entirety </em>of these sections be struck down. Moreover, if we were to strike down these entire sections, and return the law to its status before 2011 PA 38 was passed, deductions and exemptions would <em>still </em>apply to those taxpayers earning $75,000 or more, just as they did before the enactment of the law. Thus, at least in this respect, Justice Hathaway\u2019s proposed remedy is no different from ours: both would allow taxpayers earning $75,000 or more to receive these deductions and exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b628-7\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7I\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur in result only with part III(C) of the majority opinion because I do not believe 2011 PA 38 offends either the state or federal guarantees of equal protection under the law. Additionally, I concur in result only with part III(D) of the majority opinion because I agree that 2011 PA 38 violates the prohibition against a graduated income tax under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7. However, I respectfully dissent from part 111(A) of the majority opinion because, in my view, 2011 PA 38 violates Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 as to those pension benefits that will have accrued before January 1, 2012, when 2011 PA 38 goes into effect. I would hold that the right to the statutory tax exemptions provided by the former MCL 206.30(l)(f) and similar statutes is an accrued financial benefit that attaches to the pension benefits at the time they accrue and that the right to the deferred exemption is therefore a contractual obligation that may not be diminished or impaired. See Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. As applied to any pension benefits that accrue after January 1, 2012, however, I do not believe that 2011 PA 38 would violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>I. ACCRUED FINANCIAL BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The first sentence of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 provides that \u201c[t]he accrued financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired thereby.\u201d Therefore, the critical question is whether the tax exemption contained in the preamendment version of MCL 206.30(l)(f) constitutes an accrued financial benefit of a public pension plan or retirement system. If the answer is affirmative, then the tax exemption is a contractual obligation that may not be diminished or impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">I believe that the ratifiers of the 1963 Constitution intended the term \u201caccrued financial benefit[]\u201d to encompass statutory tax exemptions for public pensions. Rather than choosing a precisely limited term \u2014 such as \u201cmonetary payment\u201d or \u201ccash distribution\u201d \u2014 the framers chose to include in article 9, \u00a7 24 the broader, generalized term \u201cfinancial benefits.\u201d In <em>Musselman v Governor, </em>448 Mich 503, 514; 533 NW2d 237 (1995), this Court explained that a general rule is broader than \u201ca set of specific commands\u201d and that a general rule \u201cgoverns possibilities that could not have been anticipated at the time.\u201d Given that a general rule is intended to encompass possibilities that may not yet exist, the term \u201caccrued financial benefits\u201d is certainly broad enough to encompass statutory tax exemptions, some of which already existed when the 1963 Constitution was ratified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Indeed, Michigan has a long history of exempting public pensions from taxation. Annuity payments to employees in city library employees\u2019 retirement systems have been exempt from all state, county, township, city, village, and school district taxes since the 1920s, and state employee pensions have been similarly exempt since 1943 under the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Act (SERA). See MCL 38.705; MCL 38.40. Because these public-pension exemptions were firmly in place long before the 1963 Constitution was ratified, the financial benefits they provided to covered employees would certainly have been known to the framers and the ratifiers. In 1969, the Legislature enacted 1969 PA 332, which amended \u00a7 30 of the Income Tax Act, MCL 206.30, and extended the state\u2019s longstanding tax exemptions to the benefits received from all public pension and retirement systems. See MCL 206.30(1)(f), as amended by 2009 PA 134. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Extending the tax exemption to all public employees provided an incentive that would attract much-needed professionals to critical jobs in public employment and partially compensated retirees for the comparatively lower compensation received during their years of service to the state. With this history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>in mind, I believe that the statutory tax exemptions for public pensions are well within the types of benefits to which the ratifiers intended to extend contractual protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Concluding that the right to the tax exemption at distribution is both a \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d and an \u201caccrued benefit\u201d is consistent with this historical background. Specifically, there is no dispute that the various tax exemptions for public pensions provide a financial benefit because they result in a greater net monetary payment to retirees. There is likewise no dispute that taxing pension benefits diminishes those payments because removing the exemption will result in a reduced net monetary payment to retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Turning to the phrase \u201caccrued benefit,\u201d the majority relies in large part on the definition in <em>Studier v Mich Pub Sch Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642; 698 NW2d 350 (2005), to hold that \u201c[a] pension-tax exemption is not an \u2018accrued\u2019 benefit because it does not \u2018grow over time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 314-315, quoting <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 654. In holding that health-care benefits were not accrued financial benefits, the <em>Studier </em>majority concluded that the \u201cratifiers of our Constitution would have commonly understood \u2018accrued\u2019 benefits to be benefits of the type that increase or grow over time \u2014 such as a pension payment or retirement allowance that increases in amount along with the number of years of service a public school employee has completed.\u201d <em>Studier, </em>472 Mich at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although I do not take issue with the majority\u2019s recitation of the various dictionary definitions of \u201caccrue,\u201d I do not see how these definitions mandate that the benefit must \u201cincrease or grow over time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, not all the definitions the majority provides encompass the idea of accumulation over time. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>example, the quoted definitions of \u201caccrue\u201d include \u201cto come into existence as an enforceable claim,\u201d \u201cto vest as a right,\u201d and \u201cto become a present and enforceable right or demand.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 313-314 (citations and quotation marks omitted). None of these definitions requires accumulation over time. Instead, these definitions acknowledge that a right can accrue immediately.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">As I stated in my <em>Studier </em>dissent, \u201c[t]he term \u2018accrued financial benefits\u2019 was meant to include benefits that an employee <em>had worked in reliance on and continued to work in reliance on.\u201d Studier, </em>472 Mich at 676 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Like the health-care benefits at issue in <em>Studier, </em>I believe that our public employees have \u201cworked in reliance on and continued to work in reliance on\u201d Michigan\u2019s contractual promise that their pension benefits \u2014 once accrued \u2014 would not be taxed by the state at the time of distribution. Given Michigan\u2019s longstanding exemptions for state employees and city librarians, I believe that this interpretation is well within the common understanding of the people at the time of ratification. See <em>Goldstone v Bloomfield Twp Pub Library, </em>479 Mich 554, 570-571; 737 NW2d 476 (2007) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Regardless, I believe that the tax exemption for public pensions fits even the <em>Studier </em>majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201caccrued benefit,\u201d because the finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cial benefit provided by what is essentially a deferred tax exemption <em>does </em>\u201cincrease or grow over time.\u201d Specifically, the increase in the value of the tax exemption correlates precisely to the increase in the value of the employee\u2019s retirement account. As the value of an employee\u2019s retirement account grows over time, so too does the amount of money that will be exempt from taxation upon distribution, resulting in a financial benefit that increases with one\u2019s length of service to the public employer. Thus, I believe that the tax exemptions at issue here fit even the <em>Studier </em>majority\u2019s narrow definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In my view, the financial benefits of a pension plan \u2014 including any right to a tax exemption at distribution \u2014 accrue as an employee performs work for the public employer. See comments of Delegate Richard Van Dusen, 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 771) (\u201cAnd with respect to work performed, it is the opinion of the committee that the public employee should have a contractual right to benefits of the pension plan, which should not be diminished by the employing unit after the service has been performed.\u201d); <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 258, </em>389 Mich 659, 663; 209 NW2d 200 (1973) (holding that \u201cthe Legislature cannot diminish or impair accrued financial benefits, but we think it may properly attach new conditions for earning financial benefits which have not yet accrued\u201d). And because prior to January 1, 2012, the financial benefits of public pension plans accrued under a statutory framework that exempted those benefits from taxation at distribution, I believe that the right to the tax exemption attaches to the benefits themselves \u2014 as they are earned \u2014 and accrues simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Thus, while I agree that one generally cannot have any vested right in the continuation of any tax law, <em>Detroit v Walker, </em>445 Mich 682, 703; 520 NW2d 135 (1994), this is not true if the Constitution provides otherwise, see <em>Shivel v Kent Co Treasurer, </em>295 Mich 10, 15; 294 NW 78 (1940). I believe that article 9, \u00a7 24 provides otherwise. As I have explained, the Legislature is free to amend the tax exemptions, and indeed has seen fit to do so with 2011 PA 38 and similar acts. Accordingly, because article 9, \u00a7 24 protects the pension benefits that have already accrued from diminishment or impairment, and because I believe that the right to the tax exemption at distribution is essentially a deferred tax exemption that accrues simultaneously with the benefits themselves, I do not believe it is constitutional for the state to tax any pension benefits that will have accrued before January 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In contrast to the majority, I do not perceive any conflict with Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 2, which provides that \u201c[t]he <em>power of taxation </em>shall never be surrendered, suspended or contracted away.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The key phrase in article 9, \u00a7 2 is \u201cpower of taxation,\u201d which is a far different concept from actual taxation. In <em>W A Foote Mem </em>Hosp, <em>Inc v City of Jackson Hosp Auth, </em>390 Mich 193; 211 NW2d 649 (1973), this Court concluded that article 9, \u00a7 2 was not violated when the Legislature chose to grant a tax exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 214-215. This Court held that rather than surrendering its power of taxation by granting the exemption, the Legislature was affirmatively exercising its taxation power and discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 215. Likewise, in enacting MCL 206.30(1)(f), the Legislature again exercised its discretion by creating a tax exemption, but did not forever surrender its power to tax. The import of article 9, \u00a7 2, of course, is that the Legislature can repeal or amend the tax exemption created by MCL 206.30(1)(f), as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>has chosen to do in 2011 PA 38. And while the Legislature may properly tax any pension benefits that accrue after January 1, 2012, when 2011 PA 38 goes into effect, in my view, article 9, \u00a7 24 protects from taxation any pension benefits that will have already accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\">I also find it unavailing for the majority to argue that the second sentence of article 9, \u00a7 24 supports the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 24 was never meant to include a tax exemption because a tax exemption cannot be funded yearly. As the convention comments indicate, the second sentence of \u00a7 24 was intended to ensure the annual funding of pension liabilities. See 2 Constitutional Convention 1961, Official Record, p 2659. A tax exemption is not a liability. A tax exemption does not represent money the state must pay out; it only limits what the state may take in. Offering a tax exemption as a financial benefit for its employees allows the state to attract and retain talented and dedicated employees without incurring any yearly funding obligation for the benefit given. Therefore, the second sentence of \u00a7 24 is irrelevant to whether a tax exemption is encompassed within the meaning of \u201caccrued financial benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In addition, it is well established that \u201can advisory opinion does not constitute a decision of the Court and is not precedentially binding in the same sense as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>decision of the Court after a hearing on the merits.\u201d <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 461 n 1; 208 NW2d 469 (1973). With this premise in mind, I believe the majority opinion sweeps far too wide in attempting to foreclose the myriad possible challenges premised on individual factual circumstances. For example, how does the removal of the tax exemption affect collective-bargaining agreements, in which the rate of future pension benefits was calculated, at least in part, in reliance on Michigan\u2019s longstanding exemption for pension benefits? As Justice LEVIN cautioned in a previous advisory opinion, \u201c[w]hen a court holds an act to be constitutional it does no more than deny a particular claim of unconstitutionality. It ought not, by premature expressions on generalized abstract claims, to appear to foreclose persons differently situated from advancing more concrete claims of unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484 (LEVIN, J., concurring). Footnote 9 of the majority opinion does just that: it attempts to foreclose differently situated persons from advancing concrete claims, and it does so with \u201cpremature expressions on generalized abstract claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Likewise, I believe the majority opinion reaches too far by attempting to foreclose future challenges to the Legislature\u2019s revocations of the individual exemptions contained in SERA, MCL 38.40(1); the Public School Employees Retirement Act, MCL 38.1346(1); the Michigan Legislative Retirement System Act, MCL 38.1057(1); the city library employees\u2019 retirement system act, MCL 38.705; and the Judges Retirement Act, MCL 38.2670(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In my view, the existence of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>specific tax exemptions for public employees within the individual retirement acts themselves creates a strong argument that, under article 9, \u00a7 24, the exemptions are part of \u201ceach pension plan [or] retirement system,\u201d independent of the Income Tax Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">I think it important to emphasize that until the current fiscal crisis, the state of Michigan was perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>content to receive the reciprocal benefits of the promise made to its prospective and current employees that, should they continue in service to the state long enough to be eligible for retirement, they would be rewarded with a tax exemption for the retirement benefits they had earned. Only now do our state employees and retirees learn that their reliance on Michigan\u2019s promise was unfounded, and today\u2019s majority decision affixes a judicial stamp of approval to the revocation of that promise. Between MCL 206.30(1)(f) and article 9, \u00a7 24, the state of Michigan entered into a contract with its employees, promising that in return for their years of service, their pensions would not be taxed. Promises must be kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">I, therefore, respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision because I believe that Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, requires the state to keep its promise. I would hold that 2011 PA 38 is unconstitutional as applied to any pension benefits that will have accrued before January 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that 2011 PA 38 does not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. In my view, removing the tax exemptions formerly provided by MCL 206.30(1) (f) and similar statutes violates article 9, \u00a7 24, but only as applied to any public-pension benefits that will have accrued before January 1, 2012, when the new law goes into effect. As to pension benefits that accrue after January 1, 2012, taxation of those benefits must be limited as stated in part III(D) of the majority opinion, because I agree with the majority that 2011 PA 38 violates the prohibition against a graduated income tax under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> Because the framers chose a broad, generalized term, I find irrelevant the majority opinion\u2019s assertion that there is some import to the constitutional silence regarding whether pension benefits can be taxed. Simply put, the term \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d is intentionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>broad enough to encompass far more than the monetary payments due to retirees at the time of distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Before the enactment of 2011 PA 38, MCL 206.30(1)(f) provided that the following were to be deducted from the adjusted gross income when computing state income taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">(i) Retirement or pension benefits received from a federal public retirement system or from a public retirement system of or created by this state or a political subdivision of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">(ii) Retirement or pension benefits received from a public retirement system of or created by another state or any of its political subdivisions if the income tax laws of the other state permit a similar deduction or exemption or a reciprocal deduction or exemption of a retirement or pension benefit received from a public retirement system of or created by this state or any of the political subdivisions of this state.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> For example, if one deposits $100 into a bank account, the right to withdraw the $100 \u201caccrues\u201d or \u201cvest\u00eds] as a right\u201d immediately, regardless of whether additional money is deposited into the account. The customer has an immediate, enforceable claim to withdraw the money. The only conditions imposed are those contained in the contract between the bank and the customer. Thus, if one deposits $100 into an account under the contractual promise that if the customer waits 10 years, the customer will be entitled to withdraw $150 \u2014 free of any additional costs or fees \u2014 then the right to withdraw that amount in 10 years vests at the point of the original deposit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-5\"> The majority opinion\u2019s claim that my analysis proves inconsistent is premised on the majority\u2019s tautological assumption that <em>only </em>those benefits that are capable of being funded annually qualify as accrued financial benefits under article 9, \u00a7 24. The correctness of the majority\u2019s accusation of inconsistency rests on its conclusion that the second sentence of article 9, \u00a7 24 is indispensible to the definition of \u201caccrued financial benefits.\u201d The majority obfuscates my point, however, which is that the second sentence of article 9, \u00a7 24 is irrelevant to tax exemptions because, while a tax exemption <em>is </em>an accrued financial benefit, it is not a liability that can be funded annually.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> All these provisions have been amended to remove the exemptions, beginning January 1, 2012. See Public Acts 41 through 45 of 2011. Notably, the Governor did not request that this Court review the constitutionality of these other statutory amendments. Nevertheless, my view that the statutory tax exemption within the Income Tax Act creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>accrued financial benefits for purposes of article 9, \u00a7 24 applies equally to the tax exemptions found within these retirement acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> For example, before the amendments contained in 2011 PA 41, \u00a7 40 of SERA provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">The right of a person to a pension, an annuity, a retirement allowance, any optional benefit, <em>any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, </em>the various funds created by this act, and all money and investments and income of the funds, are exempt from any state, county, municipal, or other local tax. [MCL 38.40(1), as amended by 2002 PA 99 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In my view, there is a strong argument that the tax exemption provided by SERA is an inherent part of the deferred compensation embodied in pension plan. Nevertheless, given my belief that the tax exemptions are \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, it is not necessary to opine on whether the tax exemption statutes found within the individual retirement acts \u2014 such as the tax exemption previously found within SERA \u2014 create contractual obligations for purposes of the Contracts Clause, as have other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Hughes v Oregon, </em>314 Or 1, 21 n 27; 838 P2d 1018 (1992). Further, because I conclude that 2011 PA 38 violates article 9, \u00a7 24 of the Constitution, I do not find it necessary to conclusively opine on whether the statutory amendments also violate the Contracts Clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions. Nevertheless, it briefly bears mentioning that there is an arguable Contracts Clause violation in this case. Because I believe that the statutory tax exemptions are accrued financial benefits under article 9, \u00a7 24, these benefits are \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d that implicate the Contracts Clauses. Accordingly, under the framework for Contracts Clause analyses set forth in <em>Romein v Gen Motors Corp, </em>436 Mich 515, 534-536; 462 NW2d 555 (1990), it is arguable that the modifications of the tax exemption statutes will amount to a substantial impairment of that contractual right. See <em>Bailey v North Carolina, </em>348 NC 130, 151; 500 SE2d 54 (1998). Finally, even if there is a legitimate purpose behind the statutory amendments, I question whether violating article 9, \u00a7 24 of the Constitution is a reasonable means of carrying out that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b639-4\">HATHAWAY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdR\">(dissenting). I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision in this matter because the majority allows unconstitutional limitations on retirement-based income-tax deductions to remain in place and engages in policymaking decisions that should properly be left to the Legislature and the Governor. The majority not only fails to strike down provisions of 2011 PA 38<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that are clearly unconstitutional, but also redrafts a section of this act to provide tax deductions and exemptions that the Legislature clearly did not intend. I would hold that the restrictions on the deductions of retirement income, as well as the income-based restrictions on personal exemptions, enacted by 2011 PA 38 are unconstitutional. The restrictions on deductions of retirement benefits contained in \u00a7 30(9) of the Income Tax Act, MCL 206.30(9), as amended by 2011 PA 38, clearly violate article 9, \u00a7 24; article 1, \u00a7 10; and article 9, \u00a7 7 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution. The income-based restrictions on personal exemptions contained in \u00a7 30(7) of that act, as amended by 2011 PA 38, clearly violate article 9, \u00a7 7 of the Michigan Constitution. Moreover, I would follow the established rules of statutory construction and refrain from judicially creating tax deductions and exemptions for individuals earning more than $75,000 annually and couples earning more than $150,000 annually, which the Legislature clearly did not intend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>would leave to the Legislature the important role of deciding the best tax policy for the citizens of this state and limit the judiciary to its proper role of reviewing statutes to determine whether they are in accordance with our Constitution. Because the majority usurps this important legislative function in its decision today, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">On May 25, 2011, the Governor of Michigan signed 2011 PA 38 into law. Among the various changes to the tax code enacted in 2011 PA 38 is a sliding scale for limitations on deductions of retirement income based on age and income level. The act also imposes a sliding scale for limitations on income exemptions based on income level. Opponents of the act argue that these changes violate the United States and Michigan Constitutions, while supporters of the act contend that its provisions are consistent with the Legislature\u2019s power to tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">On May 31, 2011, the Governor asked this Court to render an advisory opinion on issues pertaining to whether certain provisions of 2011 PA 38 are constitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The specific inquiries raised by the Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>were (1) whether reducing or ehminating the statutory exemption for public-pension incomes as described in MCL 206.30, as amended, impairs accrued financial benefits of a \u201cpension plan [or] retirement system of the state [or] its political subdivisions\u201d under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24; (2) whether reducing or eliminating the statutory tax exemption for pension incomes as described in MCL 206.30, as amended, impairs a contractual obligation in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 or US Const, art I, \u00a7 10(1); (3) whether determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions on the basis of total household resources, or age and total household resources as described in MCL 206.30(7) and (9), as amended, creates a graduated income tax in violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7; and (4) whether determining eligibility for income-tax exemptions on the basis of date of birth as described in MCL 206.30(9), as amended, violates equal protection of the law under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2 or the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">This Court agreed to hear oral argument on the Governor\u2019s questions and requested that the Attorney General provide briefing in support of and in opposition to the constitutionality of the statutory sections at issue. <em>In re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding Constitutionality of 2011 PA 38, </em>489 Mich 954 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">A. MCL 206.30(9) VIOLATES ARTICLE 9, \u00a7 24 OF THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The first issue is whether reducing or eliminating the statutory deduction for public-pension income as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>scribed in MCL 206.30 impairs accrued financial benefits of a \u201cpension plan [or] retirement system of the state [or] its political subdivisions\u201d under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24. I conclude that it clearly does.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The starting point for this analysis is the language of article 9, \u00a7 24, which protects accrued retirement benefits of public employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 provides, in part: \u201cThe accrued financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions shall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired thereby.\u201d Pursuant to this constitutional provision, accrued financial benefits of public-pension and retirement systems <em>shall not be diminished or impaired. </em>This constitutional provision was ratified by the citizens of the state of Michigan and represents the will of the voters. Article 9, \u00a7 24 is not discretionary; it is a mandatory provision of our state Constitution that the Legislature is bound to follow. Moreover, the judiciary is bound to abide by this provision in determining whether a legislative enactment withstands constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Before the enactment of the current version of MCL 206.30,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the prior version of MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>206.30(1)(f)(i)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> unequivocally provided that public pensions are not subject to state income tax. At issue is whether MCL 206.30(9), which now abrogates the protection of public-pension benefits for individuals born in or after 1946<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and imposes a tax on payments of public-pension benefits, is consistent with the Constitution. Subsection (9) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In determining taxable income under this section, the following limitations and restrictions apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">(a) For a person born before 1946, this subsection provides no additional restrictions or limitations under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">(b) For a person born in 1946 through 1952, the sum of the deductions under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i), <em>(ii), </em>and iv)] is limited to $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. After that person reaches the age of 67, the deductions under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i), <em>(ii), </em>and (iv)] do not apply and that person is eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return, which deduction is available against all types of income and is not restricted to income from retirement or pension benefits. However if that person\u2019s total household resources exceed $75,000.00 for a single return or $150,000.00 for a joint return, that person is not eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. A person that takes the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(e)] is not eligible for the unrestricted deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return under this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">(c) For a person born after 1952, the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i), <em>(ii), </em>or (iv)] does not apply.

If a person takes the deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return, that person shall not take the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(iii)] and shall not take the personal exemption under [MCL 206.30(2)]. That person may elect not to take the deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return and elect to take the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(iii)] and the personal exemption under [MCL 206.30(2)] if that election would reduce that person\u2019s tax liability. However, if that person\u2019s total household resources exceed $75,000.00 for a single return or $150,000.00 for a joint return, that person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>is not eligible for a deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return. A person that takes the deduction under [MCL 206.30(1)(e)] is not eligible for the unrestricted deduction of $20,000.00 for a single return and $40,000.00 for a joint return under this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">(d) For a joint return, the limitations and restrictions in this subsection shall be applied based on the age of the older spouse filing the joint return. [MCL 206.30(9).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In reviewing this statute, we must examine the language of the statute itself, and the effect or impact of this new tax on the benefits received by public employees born in or after 1946, to determine whether \u201caccrued financial benefits\u201d are \u201cimpaired or diminished.\u201d This statute, without question, imposes a new tax on public-employee pensions that did not previously exist. It does so by restricting and limiting the pension and retirement deductions set forth in MCL 206.30(1)(f) on the basis of age and income level. These restrictions and limitations create various degrees of tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">It is undisputed that public-employee pensions and retirement plans are an \u201caccrued financial benefit\u201d for purposes of article 9, \u00a7 24. As stated in <em>Studier v Mich Pub Sch Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>472 Mich 642, 654; 698 NW2d 350 (2005), \u201cthe ratifiers of our Constitution would have commonly understood \u2018accrued\u2019 benefits to be benefits of the type that increase or grow over time \u2014 such as a pension payment or retirement allowance that increases in amount along with the number of years of service [an] employee has completed.\u201d Accordingly, MCL 206.30(9) clearly implicates an accrued financial benefit. The inquiry then becomes whether that accrued financial benefit is diminished or impaired by the imposition of a state tax directly on that pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In analyzing this issue, the effect or impact the provision will have on public pensions cannot be ig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>nored. MCL 206.30(9) has no impact on public pensions for those persons born before 1946. However, all persons entitled to receive public pensions born in or after 1946 will be directly impacted. These public employees with vested pensions will have their benefits reduced. This is a direct financial impact. For example, before the enactment of MCL 206.30(9), a retiree born after 1952 who earned annual public-pension benefits of $20,000 would receive the full $20,000 annually. Under MCL 206.30(9), however, that retiree\u2019s $20,000 pension is no longer deductible. That $20,000 is subject to the state\u2019s 4.35 percent income tax rate, which results in an $875 reduction in the total amount of money that the retiree will receive annually. This is a direct tax on a public pension that will in most instances be deducted directly from the pension benefit at the time of distribution. This results in a financial reduction in the benefit to the pension recipient. A financial reduction of a benefit is a diminishment or impairment under any definition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, a direct tax on public pensions contravenes the constitutional prohibition contained in article 9, \u00a7 24. Specifically, by diminishing the vested pension and retirement benefits of public employees, MCL 206.30(9) violates the constitutional mandate that such benefits \u201cshall not be diminished.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The majority opines that MCL 206.30(9) only reduces or eliminates tax deductions based on retirement and pension benefits and does not directly reduce the benefits themselves. The majority reasons that \u201ctax deductions\u201d do not amount to an accrued financial benefit and, therefore, the deductions do not fall within the purview of article 9, \u00a7 24.1 find the majority\u2019s reasoning unpersuasive and erroneous because it creates an unnecessary distinction. Simply stated, a tax is a tax, whether it comes in the form of a direct tax increase or the elimination of a deduction. The elimination of this tax deduction results in a new tax, which is directly imposed on vested pensions. The pension benefits are irrefutably \u201caccrued financial benefits.\u201d The majority disregards this. The majority also disregards the fact that the payout of pension benefits is reduced. But the impact remains the same: pension benefits, which are accrued financial benefits, will be diminished or impaired because they will be directly reduced by this tax. As former Attorney General Frank Kelley correctly stated in an opinion of the Attorney General:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">[T]here is little question that an exemption from taxation for pension benefits constitutes \u201cfinancial benefits\u201d within the meaning of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24, since the exemption usually will result in greater net pension payments for the recipient. In Robert Tilove\u2019s treatise, <em>Public Employee Pension Funds </em>(1976), <em>cited with approval </em>by Justice Williams for the unanimous Court in <em>Kosa v State Treasurer, </em>408 Mich 356, 372 n 22; see also pp 372-373; 292 NW2d 452 (1980), the author, Tilove, in referring to public pension income tax exemptions generally, states: \u201c[a]n income tax exemption has precisely the same effect as a benefit.\u201d (At p 244.) [OAG, 1991-1992, No 6697, p 119 (December 18, 1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The public-pension tax exemptions themselves have become part of the accrued financial benefits for vested employees, and reducing or eliminating them violates the Constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, under article 9, \u00a7 24, the Legislature cannot circumvent the prohibition against reducing accrued financial benefits by reducing or eliminating tax deductions unless it replaces the loss of benefits caused by the reduction or elimination of the deductions. The result of cutting the deduction for benefits is the same as directly cutting the benefits themselves, and it is unconstitutional. The Legislature cannot do indirectly what the Constitution directly prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">B. MCL 206.30(9) VIOLATES ARTICLE 1, \u00a7 10 OF MICHIGAN\u2019S CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The next issue is whether reducing or eliminating the statutory deduction for vested public-pension income as described in MCL 206.30 results in a \u201claw impairing the obligation of contract\u201d under article 1, \u00a7 10 of the Michigan Constitution. I conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 specifies that accrued financial benefits of public-retirement and pension plans are constitutionally mandated and protected \u201ccontractual obligation[s] . . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 provides that \u201c[n]o bill of attainder, ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contract shall be enacted.\u201d Stated plainly, article 9, \u00a7 24 creates an undiminishable, unimpairable contractual obligation with regard to accrued financial benefits of retirement income, and article 1, \u00a7 10 prohibits the Legislature from passing laws that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>impair contractual obligations. Therefore, if a statutory provision reduces the constitutionally afforded contractual obligations surrounding accrued financial benefits of retirement income, that statutory provision violates these constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">As explained in the discussion of the previous issue, MCL 206.30(9) reduces the accrued financial benefits of public retirement and pension plans. By reducing the amount of benefits that public employees receive as part of the contractual obligation owed them by public entities, MCL 206.30(9) impairs that contractual obligation. Thus, the reduction of such benefits violates the constitutional protections afforded to contractual obligations and must be struck down.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">C. MCL 206.30(7) AND (9) VIOLATE ARTICLE 9, \u00a7 7 OF MICHIGAN\u2019S CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The third issue before us is whether the income-based criteria for determining tax liability in MCL 206.30 create a graduated income tax in violation of article 9, \u00a7 7 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution. Like the majority, I conclude that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Article 9, \u00a7 7 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution prohibits a graduated income tax. That provision states: \u201cNo income tax graduated as to rate or base shall be imposed by the state or any of its subdivisions.\u201d This Court has previously stated that article 9, \u00a7 7 was designed to prohibit a graduated income-tax system that is similar to the federal tax system, in which tax rates increase as income increases. <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 389; 183 NW2d 796 (1971). The income-based criteria contained in sections MCL 206.30(7) and (9),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which increase tax liability for higher levels of income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>are unconstitutional. Such criteria create a graduated income tax that effectively increases the tax rate on the basis of a taxpayer\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The supporters of MCL 206.30 argue that it does not directly create higher tax rates for higher levels of income because the tax rate remains flat at 4.35 percent. The supporters argue that it is irrelevant whether the effective tax rate increases as \u201chousehold resources\u201d \u2014 meaning income \u2014 increase, as long as the 4.35 percent tax rate remains intact. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>argument that MCL 206.30 is constitutional because it does not <em>directly </em>do what the Constitution prohibits is unpersuasive. In <em>Butcher v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>425 Mich 262, 273; 389 NW2d 412 (1986), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\">It is clear that in <em>Kuhn, </em>by closely examining the credits, exclusions, and exemptions there challenged, we at least implied that a constitutional violation can occur hy the use of income criteria for determining their amounts. The <em>reduction </em>of a credit.. . would be no exception to such an implication, if... it was determined that such a reduction was influenced by income bracketing, and such factors affected the income tax liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">While the income-based criteria in MCL 206.30(7) and (9) do not directly increase the tax rate or base proportional to income level, the effect of imposing those criteria is to create a graduated tax rate tied to income level.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">For example, consider two single retirees born after 1952 who have reached the age of 67. Retiree A earns $100,000 a year, and Retiree B earns $50,000 a year. Under MCL 206.30(9), Retiree A is not entitled to a $20,000 deduction in taxable income because he or she makes more than $75,000, while Retiree B makes less than $75,000 and is entitled to the deduction. Thus, Retiree B only pays taxes on $30,000 of taxable income. With a tax rate of 4.35 percent on taxable income, Retiree A pays $4,350 in taxes, which is an effective rate of 4.35 percent on $100,000. Meanwhile, Retiree B pays $1,305 in taxes, which is an effective rate of 2.61 percent on $50,000. The result is a graduated tax rate based on level of income. The same calculations produce similar results for the income-based reduction and elimination of personal exemptions for all taxpayers found in MCL 206.30(7). All income-based criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>limiting and restricting taxable income using income brackets are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Accordingly, I would hold that both MCL 206.30(7) and (9) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">D. THE MAJORITY\u2019S RESOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The final issue is one created by the majority\u2019s perplexing resolution of this case, in light of its holding that MCL 206.30(7) and (9) violate the Constitution. I agree with the majority that the income-based factors in subsections (7) and (9) unconstitutionally create a graduated income tax. However, I disagree with the troubling method that the majority has chosen to resolve the Governor\u2019s questions with regard to the constitutionality of those subsections. Rather than striking down those subsections, the majority carves out the sentences from subsections (7) and (9) that limit personal exemptions and deductions on the basis of income.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In doing so, the majority has created entirely different laws than those passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. Specifically, the majority provides judicially created tax exemptions and deductions, despite the fact that the Legislature did not provide such tax breaks. The majority\u2019s decision changes the tax code and now allows individuals earning more than $75,000 annually, and couples earning more than $150,000 annually, to have their tax liability reduced. This is the opposite of what the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The majority claims that it is simply severing the unconstitutional portions from the statute. However, the statutory rules of severability do not permit such an outcome. Those rules are contained in MCL 8.5, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>In the construction of the statutes of this state the following rules shall be observed, <em>unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature, </em>that is to say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">If any portion of an act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application, <em>provided such remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable, </em>and to this end acts are declared to be sever-able. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Under these rules, this Court must consider whether an entire section has to be struck down or whether the unconstitutional portions of that section can be severed from the remainder of the statute. Unconstitutional language can be severed when \u201cthe remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, that only applies if the remaining portion of the statute is not \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In this matter, the majority attempts to justify its result by stating that the Legislature was aware that portions of 2011 PA 38 could be held unconstitutional and that those portions could be severed to keep the rest of the act constitutional. The majority asserts that members of the Legislature would have known which words from each section it passed could be held unconstitutional. This is groundless guesswork by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Moreover, the majority attempts to justify its restructuring of sections MCL 206.30(7) and (9) by arguing that the Attorney General requested this remedy in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>brief supporting the law. This argument overlooks a fundamental tenet of statutory analysis: the Court\u2019s primary obligation is to ascertain legislative intent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Legislature duly enacted this statute, and the Governor signed it into law. We have a clear indication of what the Legislature intended when it limited personal exemptions and deductions of retirement income: the actual language of the statute before us.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Given the language of MCL 206.30(7) and (9), it is indisputable that the Legislature intended to determine tax liability on the basis of factors such as age and income, and it is also indisputable that the Legislature chose not to grant exemptions and deductions to taxpayers in higher income brackets. Raising or lowering tax liability is a highly political undertaking in this state. The Legislature, for its own policy reasons, chose not to lower the tax liability of individuals earning more than $75,000 annually and couples earning more than $150,000 annually, and it incorporated language into MCL 206.30 to fulfill this intention. While that policy decision was unconstitutional, it is not the place of this Court to make tax policy choices for the Legislature by severing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>parts of the sections at issue. In so doing, the majority expands the exemptions and deductions contemplated by the Legislature. Such a result is clearly against the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In this advisory matter, the Governor asked this Court to opine on whether MCL 206.30(7) and (9) are unconstitutional. Our proper role is to advise the Governor if either of these subsections violates the Constitution. Now that we have done so, it is up to the Legislature to determine whether the Income Tax Act should be redrafted \u2014 and, if so, how \u2014 in light of our ruling. Accordingly, I would follow the established rules of statutory construction and refrain from judicially creating deductions and exemptions that the Legislature clearly did not intend. I would leave to the Legislature the important role of deciding the best tax policy for the citizens of this state and limit the judiciary to its proper role of reviewing statutes to determine whether they are in accordance with our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">I would hold that MCL 206.30(9) is unconstitutional because it clearly violates article 9, \u00a7 24; article 1, \u00a7 10; and article 9, \u00a7 7 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution. Furthermore, I would hold that MCL 206.30(7) is unconstitutional because it also clearly violates article 9, \u00a7 7 of Michigan\u2019s Constitution. The majority not only fails to strike down parts of MCL 206.30 that are clearly unconstitutional, but also redrafts parts of this statute to provide tax exemptions and deductions that the Legislature clearly did not intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In sum, I would follow the established rules of statutory construction and refrain from judicially creating deductions and exemptions for individuals earning more than $75,000 annually and couples earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>more than $150,000 annually, which the Legislature clearly did not intend. Moreover, I would leave to the Legislature the important role of deciding the best tax policy for the citizens of this state and properly limit the judiciary\u2019s role to reviewing statutes to determine whether they are in accordance with our Constitution. Because the majority usurps this important legislative function in its decision today, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\"> Section 30(9) of the Income Tax Act, as amended by 2011 PA 38, is focused on \u201cdeductions\u201d against retirees\u2019 income. Section 30(7) is focused on \u201cexemptions\u201d with regard to the income of all taxpayers who qualify for the personal exemption under \u00a7 30(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> It is clear from the language of 2011 PA 38 that the Legislature did not intend to extend deductions or exemptions to individuals and couples with higher incomes. The Legislature specifically did not extend the deductions at issue to individuals earning more than $75,000 and couples <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>earning more than $150,000 annually. The Legislature similarly limited personal exemptions for individuals earning between $75,000 and $100,000 and for couples earning between $150,000 and $200,000. Further, the Legislature specifically prohibited individuals earning more than $100,000 and couples earning more than $200,000 from claiming any personal exemptions. Despite this legislative intent, the majority provides such deductions and exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> At the time the Governor asked this Court for an advisory opinion, 2011 PA 38 was still referred to by its public act number. It went into effect on October 1, 2011, and the provisions of 2011 PA 38 are now referred to by their statutory numbers, e.g., MCL 206.30.

The maximum amounts allowed under this subparagraph shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction for retirement or pension benefits claimed under [MCL 206.30(1)(f)(\u00bf)] or [MCL 206.30(1)(e)] and by the amount of a deduction claimed under subdivision [MCL 206.30(1)(p)].

I do recognize that there is a distinction; however, that distinction is not the relevant inquiry in this matter.
