We hold that in such cases, dismissal with prejudice must follow because allowing amendment of the deficient AOM would directly conflict with the statutory scheme governing medical malpractice actions, the clear language of the court rules, and precedent of this Court. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing plaintiff\u2019s case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Edris Ligons underwent a colonoscopy on January 14, 2002, and four days later developed vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 22, 2002, still suffering from those symptoms, Ligons went to the emergency room at defendant Crittenton Hospital, where she was treated by defendant Dr. David Bauer. An abdominal x-ray suggested the possibility of a partial small-bowel obstruction. When Ligons refused to be admitted to the hospital, she was given antibiotics, treated for dehydration, and discharged with instructions to follow up with her treating physician the next day. Ligons did so and was immediately sent to the emergency room, where she was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">After extensive testing and the involvement of seven doctors, it was determined that surgery was necessary. Ligons initially refused any surgery, but eventually agreed. Exploratory surgery performed on January 24, 2002, revealed a perforated colon, an inflamed pelvic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>mass, and an abscess. The exploratory surgery further showed that Ligons had an advanced form of liver failure and that her liver had become hard and rocklike in appearance. Ligons had been an alcoholic for more than 30 years and suffered from acute cirrhosis with ascites, alcoholic pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, coagulopathy, diverticulosis coli, and colon polyps. Removal of her colon was impossible because of these preexisting conditions. Ligons never recovered from the surgery and died on January 29, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Plaintiff was appointed personal representative of Lig\u00f3n\u2019s estate on February 22, 2005, and delivered to defendants a notice of intent to sue<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (NOI) on June 8, 2005. On October 21, 2005, plaintiff delivered a supplemental NOI providing more detail regarding proximate cause. He filed a complaint in the Oakland Circuit Court on April 7, 2006, accompanied by two AOMs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The first AOM, signed March 8, 2005, was executed by Dr. George Sternbach, an emergency-medicine specialist. Although the AOM contained 23 paragraphs regarding the manner in which the standard of care had been breached, only two of those paragraphs pertained specifically to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">v. [The failure to ajdmit the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">w. [The failure to o]btain appropriate consults on January 22, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Regarding the manner in which these breaches were the proximate cause of the injury, the AOM provided, \u201cAs a direct and proximate cause of the imprudent acts and omission committed by the individuals identified herein, Edris Ligons, died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The second AOM, signed on June 17, 2005, by Dr. Fred Thomas, did not address the required standard of practice or care, the breach of the standard of care, or the actions that should have been taken or omitted to comply with the standard of care. Rather, the Thomas AOM addressed only the manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the alleged injury: \u201cIt is my opinion that had the defendants admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consults on January 22, 2002, as outlined in Dr. Sternbach\u2019s affidavit!,] that Edris Ligons would not have died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In March 2007, Bauer and defendant Rochester Emergency Group, EC. (Bauer\u2019s practice group) moved for summary disposition, arguing that plaintiffs NOIs and AOMs did not comply with the governing statutes. In April 2007, Crittenton concurred in the motion. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motions on May 22, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Bauer and Rochester Emergency applied for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, which the Court of Appeals initially denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bauer and Rochester Emergency then applied for leave to appeal in this Court and, in lieu of granting their application, we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals later granted Crittenton\u2019s application for leave to file a delayed cross-appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiffs two NOIs collectively satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the requirements of MCL 600.2912b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But a majority of the panel disagreed with the trial court\u2019s ruling that the AOMs were sufficient, concluding that neither AOM contained the required statement describing \u201c[t]he manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The majority reasoned that \u201cit is insufficient to merely allege that the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence caused the injury,\u201d and the AOMs \u201ccontain[ed] no explanation regarding how Dr. Bauer\u2019s decision not to admit the decedent on January 22, 2002, or obtain appropriate consultations was the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[E]ven when read as a whole,\u201d the AOMs \u201cestablish[ed] no connection between the purpose of the consultations, or what condition they might have revealed, and the cause of the decedent\u2019s death,\u201d nor did they explain how a one-day delay in admitting Ligons resulted in death rather than recovery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Recognizing that the defective AOMs required dismissal of the case under <em>Kirkaldy v </em>Rim,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals further held that dismissal in this case had to be with prejudice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned that, although filing a complaint and an AOM tolls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>statutory limitations period pursuant to MCL 600.5856(a) until the AOM is successfully challenged,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> tolling was unavailable here because plaintiff had not filed his complaint within the limitations period. Plaintiff filed his complaint after the limitations period expired, but within the saving period afforded him as a personal representative under MCL 600.5852. Under <em>Waltz v Wyse,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>statutes that toll periods of limitations or statutes of repose, such as MCL 600.5856(a), do not toll saving provisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that no tolled time remained during which plaintiff could refile his suit after defendants successfully challenged his AOMs. Thus, dismissal with prejudice was required on statute-of-limitations grounds.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected plaintiffs argument that he should be permitted to amend his defective AOMs under the then existing version of MCR 2.118(A), which permitted the amendment of \u201cpleadings.\u201d The Court noted that the term \u201cpleading\u201d was restrictively defined by MCR 2.110(A) to include only complaints, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party complaints, answers to any of these documents, and replies to those answers. This list does not include \u201cmandatory attachments\u201d such as AOMs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finding no \u201cpositive authority suggesting that an affidavit of merit may be amended pursuant to MCR 2.118(A),\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cthe only permissible remedy for a defective affidavit of merit is the one prescribed in <em>Kirkaldy, </em>which is dismissal.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>of Appeals reversed the trial court and remanded the case for entry of an order of dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Plaintiff applied to this Court for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision. We granted leave and directed the parties to address the following issues: \u201c(1) whether the plaintiff may amend his affidavits of merit in light <em>of Bush v Shabahang, </em>484 Mich 156 [772 NW2d 272] (2009), and/or MCL 600.2301, and (2) whether the recent amendment of MCR 2.118 applies to the plaintiffs affidavits of merit.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This case involves questions of statutory interpretation, which we also review de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We interpret court rules using the same principles that govern the interpretation of statutes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Our goal when interpreting and applying statutes or court rules is to give effect to the plain meaning of the text. If the text is unambiguous, we apply the language as written without construction or interpretation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">A. INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF MCL 600.2912d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">MCL 600.2912d was enacted in 1986 and amended in 1993 as an element of broad tort reforms established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the Legislature.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In part, the legislation placed \u201cenhanced responsibilities\u201d on medical malpractice plaintiffs.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> MCL 600.2912d(1) requires the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">Subject to subsection (2), the plaintiff in an action alleging medical malpractice or, if the plaintiff is represented by an attorney, the plaintiffs attorney shall file with the complaint an affidavit of merit signed by a health professional who the plaintiffs attorney reasonably believes meets the requirements for an expert witness under [MCL 600.2169],[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] The affidavit of merit shall certify that \u25a0the health professional has reviewed the notice and all medical records supplied to him or her by the plaintiffs attorney concerning the allegations contained in the notice and <em>shall contain a statement of each of the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">(a) The applicable standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">(b) The health professional\u2019s opinion that the applicable standard of practice or care was breached by the health professional or health facility receiving the notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">(c) The actions that should have been taken or omitted by the health professional or health facility in order to have complied with the applicable standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">(d) <em>The manner in which </em>the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">MCL 600.2912d(2) and (3) extend the time during which an AOM may be filed under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">(2) Upon motion of a party for good cause shown, the court in which the complaint is filed may grant the plaintiff or, if the plaintiff is represented by an attorney, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>plaintiffs attorney an additional 28 days in which to file the affidavit required under subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">(3) If the defendant in an action alleging medical malpractice fails to allow access to medical records within the time period set forth in [MCL 600.2912b(6)], the affidavit required under subsection (1) may be filed within 91 days after the filing of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In <em>Scarsella v Poliak,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court addressed the consequences of a plaintiffs failure to file an AOM with the complaint as required by the statute. We stressed the Legislature\u2019s \u201c \u2018mandatory and imperative\u2019 \u201d language:<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> MCL 600.2912d(1) requires that a plaintiff <em>\u201cshall </em>file with the complaint an affidavit of merit... .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In light of this legislative requirement, we held that \u201c \u2018for statute of limitations purposes in a medical malpractice case, the mere tendering of a complaint without the required affidavit of merit is insufficient to commence the lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We rejected the plaintiffs argument that he should have been permitted to amend his complaint by appending an untimely AOM, which would have been related back to the time the complaint was filed under MCR 2.118(D),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> because permitting such amendment would have \u201c \u2018effectively repealed] the statutory affidavit of merit requirement\u2019 \u201d:<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201c[M]edical malpractice plaintiffs could routinely file their complaints without an affidavit of merit, in contravention of the court rule and the statutory requirement, and \u2018amend\u2019 by supplementing the filing with an affidavit at some later date. This, of course, completely subverts the requirement of MCL 600.2912d(1). .. that the plaintiff \u2018shall file with the complaint an affidavit of merit,\u2019 as well as the legislative remedy of MCL 600.2912d(2)..., allowing a twenty-eight-day extension in instances where an affidavit cannot accompany the complaint. \u201d[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In other words, <em>Scarsella </em>established that, when a plaintiff \u201cwholly omits to file the affidavit required by MCL 600.2912d(1),\u201d \u201cthe filing of the complaint is ineffective, and does not work a tolling of the applicable period of limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> When the untolled period of limitations expires before the plaintiff files a complaint accompanied by an AOM, the case must be dismissed with prejudice on statute-of-limitations grounds.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Dismissal without prejudice is proper, however, if the untolled limitations period has not yet expired.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The issue whether a timely filed yet defective AOM tolled the limitations period was resolved in <em>Kirkaldy. Kirkaldy </em>observed that, under MCL 600.5856(a),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> MCL 600.2912d, and Scarsella, \u201cthe period of limitations is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tolled when a complaint and affidavit of merit are filed and served on the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Distinguishing a wholly absent AOM from a potentially defective but timely filed AOM, we stressed the holding in <em>Saffian v </em>Simmons<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that \u201c \u2018when an affidavit is filed, it is presumed valid. It is only in subsequent judicial proceedings that the presumption can be rebutted.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Kirkaldy </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">[A] complaint and affidavit of merit toll the period of limitations until the validity of the affidavit is successfully challenged in \u201csubsequent judicial proceedings.\u201d Only a successful challenge will cause the affidavit to lose its presumption of validity and cause the period of limitations to resume running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">Thus, if the defendant believes that an affidavit is deficient, the defendant must challenge the affidavit. If that challenge is successful, the proper remedy is dismissal without prejudice. <em>Scarsella, </em>[461 Mich] at 551-552. The plaintiff would then have whatever time remains in the period of limitations within which to file a complaint accompanied by a conforming affidavit of merit.[<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In <em>Waltz, </em>this Court clarified that MCL 600.5856, by its terms, tolls only periods of limitations or statutes of repose.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> A saving statute is neither a statute of limitations providing a hmitations period nor a statute of repose; rather, it is \u201can <em>\u2018exception </em>to the statute of hmitations\u2019 \u201d that allows \u201ccommencement of a wrongful death action as many as three years after the applicable statute of limitations has expired.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In other words, once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>limitations period has run, tolling is no longer available, even if a saving statute would still allow commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Read together, the cases establish four points necessary to resolving the case currently before us. First, a plaintiffs failure to file a timely AOM <em>or </em>to file a timely AOM that satisfies the requirements of MCL 600.2912d(1) generally results in the dismissal of the case.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Second, that dismissal must be without prejudice unless other grounds for the dismissal exist, such as the expiration of the limitations period.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Third, the timely filing of a defective AOM with the complaint tolls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>limitations period unless and until the court finds the AOM defective. Fourth, only limitations periods may be tolled; the timely filing of a defective AOM cannot toll a saving period.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">B. THE AFFIDAVITS OF MERIT WERE INSUFFICIENT</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As noted in part III(A), MCL 600.2912d(1) sets forth several requirements for affidavits of merit: (1) a certification that the health professional has reviewed the notice and all medical records supplied to him or her by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney concerning the allegations contained in the notice, (2) the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>standard of practice or care, (3) the health professional\u2019s opinion that the applicable standard of practice or care was breached by the health professional or health facility receiving the notice, (4) the actions that should have been taken or omitted by the health professional or health facility in order to have complied with the applicable standard of practice or care, and (5) <em>the manner in which </em>the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice. The failure to include any of the required information renders the affidavit of merit insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Plaintiffs AOMs failed to provide any statement of the manner in which the breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged. Dr. George Sternbach\u2019s AOM provided only that \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate cause of the imprudent acts and omission committed by the individuals identified herein, Edris Ligons, died.\u201d Dr. Fred Thomas\u2019s AOM provided only: \u201cIt is my opinion that had the defendants admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consults on January 22, 2002, as outlined in Dr. Sternbach\u2019s affidavit that Edris Ligons would not have died.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We have often said that it is insufficient to simply state the result when required to state the manner in which there was a breach: The answer to <em>\u201cHow </em>was the standard of care breached?\u201d is never \u201cThe standard of care was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>breached.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Similarly, answering the question \u201cHow was the breach the proximate cause of the injury?\u201d requires more than \u201cThe breach caused the injury.\u201d In other words, the \u201c \u2018mere correlation between alleged malpractice and an injury is insufficient to show proximate cause.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Contrary to the dissents\u2019 conclusions, this analysis does not require a heightened level of specificity; rather, it simply gives meaning to the level of specificity required by the statute itself. The Legislature requires a statement not just that a breach caused the injury, but the <em>manner in which </em>the breach caused the injury.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In this case, even the Court of Appeals dissent acknowledged that the AOMs were silent regarding how the defendants\u2019 actions or inactions caused Ligons\u2019s death. A statement answering how is precisely what MCL 600.2912d(1)(d) requires, and this case demonstrates the importance of that requirement. Ligons\u2019s colon was perforated by a doctor (who is not a defendant here) eight days before she went to the hospital. She then refused to be admitted to the hospital, only to come back a day later, when the perforated colon was discovered. With so many different parties and procedures involved, as well as Ligons\u2019s own medical history, plaintiff must state how defendants\u2019 alleged negligence in not diagnosing the perforated colon one day earlier was the proximate cause of Ligons\u2019s death. Plaintiff failed to do so, as required by MCL 600.2912d(l)(d); therefore, the AOMs were statutorily deficient.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">C. A PLAINTIFF MAY NOT AMEND A DEFECTIVE AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Plaintiff nonetheless argues that MCR 2.112, MCR 2.118, MCL 600.2301, and <em>Bush v </em>Shabahang,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> permit retroactive amendment of defective AOMs. We are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>persuaded that these authorities compel that conclusion, one that is directly contrary to the rules of <em>Scarsella </em>and <em>Kirkaldy, </em>which call for dismissal in the event of an absent or defective AOM.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">1. AN AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT IS NOT A \u201cPLEADING\u201d THAT MAY BE AMENDED UNDER THE APPLICABLE VERSION OF MCR 2.118</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Plaintiff urges that amendment should be permitted under the version of MCR 2.118 in effect at the time this case was pending in the trial court.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> MCR 2.118 governs amended and supplemental pleadings. Both the prior and current versions of MCR 2.118(A)(1) permit a party to \u201camend a pleading once as a matter of course within 14 days after being served with a responsive pleading by an adverse party . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> MCR 2.118(A)(2) further provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in subrule (A)(1), a party may amend a pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party. Leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Former MCR 2.118(D), which governed the relation back of amendments, provided, \u201cAn amendment that adds a claim or a defense relates back to the date of the original pleading if the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>or occurrence set forth, or attempted to be set forth, in the original pleading.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">By its terms, former MCR 2.118 applied only to a \u201cpleading.\u201d MCR 2.110(A) defines \u201cpleading\u201d for purposes of the Michigan Court Rules restrictively to include <em>\u201conly: </em>(1) a complaint, (2) a cross-claim, (3) a counterclaim, (4) a third-party complaint, (5) an answer to a complaint, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party complaint, and (6) a reply to an answer. <em>No other form of pleading is allowed.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>57</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As with statutes, when a court rule \u201cspecifically defines a given term, that definition alone controls.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> An AOM, even if required to be appended to a complaint, is not included in this restrictive definition of a \u201cpleading.\u201d Plaintiff relies heavily on a statement in <em>Barnett v Hidalgo </em><footnotemark><em>59</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which described an AOM as \u201cpart of the pleadings\u201d in determining that an AOM is \u201cgenerally admissible as an adoptive admission[.]\u201d But plaintiff fails to appreciate the context in which the statement was made: describing a document as \u201cpart\u201d of the pleadings when addressing an evidentiary issue does not turn the document into a pleading for purposes of MCR 2.118(D) if it does not meet the definition in MCR 2.110(A).<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Indeed, elsewhere <em>Barnett </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>clearly referred to the AOM as distinct from the complaint, stating that AOMs \u201care required to accompany a complaint. .. <em>Id. </em>at 160. Under MCR 2.110(A)(1), for purposes of the court rules it is the \u201ccomplaint\u201d itself that constitutes a \u201cpleading,\u201d not the complaint and any document accompanying it. <em>Barnett </em>neither held nor relied on the premise that an AOM is a pleading for purposes of the rule permitting amendment of pleadings, MCR 2.118.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Plaintiff also argues that the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Scarsella </em>compels the conclusion that an AOM is a pleading. He stresses the <em>Scarsella </em>Court\u2019s holding that \u201c \u2018the mere tendering of a complaint without the required affidavit of merit is insufficient to commence the lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Then plaintiff notes that, pursuant to MCL 600.1901, which applies generally to all civil actions, \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d And he similarly notes that the general civil complaint tolling statute cited in <em>Scarsella, </em>MCL 600.5856(a), permits tolling \u201c[a]t the time the complaint is filed . .. .\u201d Because <em>Scarsella </em>held that a medical malpractice action is not commenced \u2014 and tolling does not occur \u2014 if the complaint is not accompanied by an AOM, plaintiff reasons that, for <em>Scarsella </em>to be consistent with MCL 600.1901 and MCL 600.5856(a), an AOM must be <em>\u201cpart and parcel\u201d </em>of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">But <em>Scarsella, </em>like <em>Barnett, </em>did not rule that an AOM is a complaint or is \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the complaint. Rather, the Court consistently referred to the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and AOM as distinct documents. For example, the Court noted that \u201c \u2018medical malpractice plaintiffs must file <em>more than </em>a complaint; they \u201cshall file <em>with the complaint </em>an affidavit of merit....\u201d\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Importantly, <em>Scarsella </em>clarified that commencement of a medical malpractice action is not governed solely by the general statutes applicable to civil suits. Rather, medical malpractice suits are governed in detail by specific statutes unique to this area of law. In contrast to the generic rule that a civil action may be commenced through the mere filing of a complaint, MCL 600.2912b(1) establishes that, generally, \u201ca person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice . .. unless the person has given the [defendants] written notice under this section not less than 182 days before the action is commenced.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Similarly, as <em>Scarsella </em>held, pursuant to MCL 600.2912d(1) a medical malpractice claimant must file not just a complaint, but \u201cshall file <em>with the complaint </em>an affidavit of merit. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> A defendant, moreover, is not simply required to file an answer to the complaint, but must also file an affidavit of meritorious defense \u2014 the counterpart to a plaintiffs AOM \u2014 within 91 days after the plaintiff files an AOM.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">These specific statutes governing medical malpractice actions, which \u201cappl[y] to the more narrow realm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>circumstances,\u201d prevail over the more general rules applicable to all civil actions.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Accordingly, it does not necessarily follow that, simply because other civil plaintiffs may commence suit by filing a complaint, an AOM <em>is </em>a complaint \u2014 or is part and parcel of a complaint\u2014 particularly for purposes of applying the Michigan Court Rules.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Permitting amendment of a deficient AOM also runs directly counter to the statutes governing medical malpractice suits, particularly MCL 600.2912d. By its terms, MCL 600.2912d requires that a plaintiff obtain a qualified expert willing to review the medical records and certify that the claim has merit because, in the expert\u2019s opinion, each defendant breached the applicable standard of practice or care, there were actions the defendant should have taken or omitted in order to comply with the standard, and the breach was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the presuit notice.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Consistently with its purpose to certify merit at the outset of the case, MCL 600.2912d(1) directs that the plaintiff \u201cshall file\u201d the AOM \u201cwith the complaint.\u201d If the plaintiff is unable to comply with this mandate, the statute provides two alternatives for recourse: MCL 600.2912d(2) permits the court to grant an additional 28 days in which to file the AOM \u201c[u]pon motion of a party for good cause shown,\u201d and MCL 600.2912d(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>affords the plaintiff \u201c91 days after the filing of the complaint\u201d to file the AOM if the defendant failed \u201cto allow access to medical records within the time period set forth in [MCL 600.2912b(6)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Accordingly, the statute clearly conveys that the AOM must be provided within the relevant time frames. For this reason, permitting a plaintiff to correct deficiencies in the AOM through amendment as a matter of course within 14 days after service of a responsive pleading, MCR 2.118(A)(1), and indefinitely thereafter by leave of the court or consent of the adverse party, MCR 2.118(A)(2), would directly conflict with the legislative remedies provided in MCL 600.2912d(2) and (3), which allow a plaintiff who is unable to submit a conforming AOM with the complaint an additional 28 or 91 days, respectively, to complete and submit the AOM. Just as the <em>Scarsella </em>Court reasoned in rejecting retroactive \u201camendment\u201d of untimely AOMs under MCR 2.118, permitting amendment of a deficient AOM would similarly subvert the AOM statute by allowing plaintiffs to routinely file complaints without conforming AOMs.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Because permitting amendment of a defective AOM runs counter to the established statutes, court rules, and cases governing this area of law, we hold that a plaintiff may not amend a deficient AOM under the version of MCR 2.118 in effect during the pendency of this suit in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">2. MCL 600.2301 AND <em>BUSH v SHABAHANG </em>DO NOT AUTHORIZE AMENDMENT OF AN AFFIDAVIT OF MERIT</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Next, plaintiff urges that we permit amendment of deficient AOMs under MCL 600.2301 and this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>2009 decision in <em>Bush.</em><footnotemark><em>70</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But retroactive amendment of a deficient AOM has never been authorized under any court rule or statute, and as explained in part 111(C)(1), would actually be contrary to the specific statutory scheme governing medical malpractice actions. This Court has long recognized that an attachment to a complaint or pleading is neither a \u201cprocess\u201d nor a \u201cproceeding\u201d under MCL 600.2301.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> In fact, this Court noted in 1892 that there was no statutory support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>allowing amendment of an affidavit on the ground that it was a process or a proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">There is no statute now in force permitting amendments to attachment affidavits, and such amendments have never been deemed admissible under [How Stat] 7631, which provides that \u201cthe court in which any action shall be pending shall have power to amend any process, pleading, or proceeding in such action, either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice.[<footnotemark>72</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The <em>Bush </em>Court\u2019s application of MCL 600.2301 to a medical malpractice NOI was rooted in the Legislature\u2019s 2004 amendment of MCL 600.5856(c), the notice-tolling statute, and does not apply to AOMs. Unlike NOIs, which give notice to defendants, AOMs are meant to weed out frivolous cases before they are ever filed. Applying <em>Bush </em>beyond the scope of the 2004 amendment of MCL 600.5856(c) and NOIs to AOMs would be an unwarranted expansion of its focus on the notice-tolling statute, would free the opinion from its statutory moorings, would frustrate the purpose of the AOM requirement, and would create unnecessary conflict with existing caselaw, such as <em>Kirkaldy, </em>which <em>Bush </em>did not overrule. We therefore decline to apply the rationale of <em>Bush </em>beyond its limited statutory focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">3. THE NEW VERSIONS OF MCR 2.112 AND MCR 2.118 ARE NOT APPLICABLE</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Finally, we address plaintiffs argument that he should now be permitted to amend his AOMs in light of the 2010 amendments of MCR 2.112 and MCR 2.118. In addition to mandating that a party challenge an allegedly defective AOM or affidavit of meritorious defense within 63 days of service, MCR 2.112(L)(2)(b) now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>states, \u201cAn affidavit of merit or meritorious defense may be amended in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in MCR 2.118 and MCL 600.2301.\u201d In turn, MCR 2.118(D) now states, in relevant part, \u201cIn a medical malpractice action, an amendment of an affidavit of merit or affidavit of meritorious defense relates back to the date of the original filing of the affidavit.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The February 16, 2010, order adopting the amendments unequivocally stated that they became effective May 1, 2010, long after the complaint and the AOMs in this case were filed and, indeed, after the Court of Appeals resolved the case and plaintiffs application for leave to appeal was filed in this Court.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Because this Court explicitly ordered that the amended rules have prospective effect, we will not apply the rules retroactively at plaintiffs request. Moreover, as defendants argue, full retroactive application of the rules is impossible at this late stage and would result in prejudice to defendants; defendants cannot go back in time and comply with the new requirement that, to challenge an AOM at all, they must do so within 63 days of service. Accordingly, retroactive application of the rules would render defendants\u2019 challenge to the AOMs ineffective and afford them no opportunity to renew their arguments concerning their deficiency or to oppose any motion plaintiff might bring for amendment at the court\u2019s discretion under MCR 2.118(A)(2). A newly adopted court rule will not be applied to pending actions if a \u201cparty acts, or fails to act, in reliance on the prior rules and the party\u2019s action or inaction has consequences under the new rules that were not present under the old rules.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In other words, amended court rules will not apply retroactively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>if compliance with the newly prescribed time limits is impossible.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> We therefore decline to apply the amended versions of MCR 2.112 and MCR 2.118 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">D. DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE WAS REQUIRED</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Plaintiffs case was dismissed with prejudice because the two-year statutory limitations period provided in MCL 600.5805(6) for his medical malpractice action expired before his AOMs were deemed defective; therefore, no tolling was available to him upon his filing the complaint under MCL 600.5856(a). The alleged malpractice by defendants occurred on January 22, 2002. Accordingly, the two-year limitations period expired on January 22, 2004. If the suit had been commenced before January 22, 2004, the limitations period would have been tolled when the complaint was filed with the accompanying AOMs. But no suit was filed within the limitations period, so no tolling was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Instead, plaintiff filed suit within the saving period afforded him under MCL 600.5852, which permits the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate to commence an action \u201cat any time within 2 years after letters of authority are issued although the period of limitations has run\u201d as long as commencement is \u201cwithin 3 years after the period of limitations has run.\u201d Plaintiff was appointed personal representative on February 22, 2005.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> He had until January 22, 2007 \u2014 three years after the two-year period of limitations expired on January 22, 2004 \u2014 in which to file suit during the saving period. He filed his complaint and AOMs on April 7, 2006. Although plaintiff filed suit during the saving period, because the limitations period had ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>pired, there was nothing left to toll under MCL 600.5856(a) when he filed the complaint even though it was accompanied by AOMs. For these reasons, the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed plaintiffs case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Pursuant to the plain and controlling language of MCR 2.110(A), the applicable version of MCR 2.118, MCL 600.5856, MCL 600.2912d, and this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Scarsella, Kirkaldy, </em>and <em>Waltz, </em>we hold that a defective AOM may not be retroactively amended and that the proper response to a defective AOM is dismissal. Although the timely filing of a defective AOM tolls the limitations period until a court finds the AOM defective, an AOM filed during a saving period after the limitations period has expired tolls nothing, as the limitations period has run and the saving period may not be tolled. In this case, because the limitations period had run before the complaint was filed, plaintiff cannot amend his defective AOMs retroactively. Given that the saving period has expired, plaintiffs case had to be dismissed with prejudice. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b366-8\">Young, C.J., and Markman and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> The physician who performed the colonoscopy is no longer a party to this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\"> See MCL 600.2912b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\"> <em>Ligons v Crittenton Hosp, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered January 16, 2008 (Docket No. 278622).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> <em>Ligons v Crittenton Hosp, </em>482 Mich 1005 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\"> <em>Ligons v Crittenton Hosp, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered March 2, 2009 (Docket No. 288793).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b344-6\"> <em>Ligons v Crittenton Hosp, </em>285 Mich App 337, 343-349; 776 NW2d 361 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> MCL 600.2912d(1)(d); <em>Ligons, </em>285 Mich App at 349-351.

The full provision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall dismiss a claim not included in the notice required under [MCL 600.2912f], This subsection does not apply to a claim that results from previously unknown information gathered during discovery. [Format altered from strikethrough/insert format to show language as proposed.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>On this same issue, Justice Markman observed the following in <em>Bush:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">As an initial matter, this seems entirely unrelated to the statute of limitations under which dismissal is granted. The Legislature\u2019s rejection of an unrelated provision can hardly be used to alter the clear meaning of a statute. It seems far more reasonable to conclude that the Legislature rejected this provision in favor of [MCL 600.2912b(3)], which provides for similar treatment of the same subject matter: undiscovered claims.... How can [Justice Hathaway] draw an informed conclusion concerning legislative history from a provision <em>never </em>enacted without even considering a provision that <em>has </em>been enacted and actually substituted for the never-enacted provision? <em>[Bush, </em>484 Mich at 203-204 (Markman, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> We decline plaintiff\u2019s invitation to overrule the prior decisions of this Court instead of adhering to the doctrine of stare decisis. \u201cStare decisis means \u2018To abide by, or adhere to, decided cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 463 n 20; 613 NW2d 307 (2000), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (rev 4th ed), p 1577.

While Justice MARILYN KELLY\u2019s dissent examined MCL 600.2912b, addressing the contents of a notice of intent to sue (NOI), I believe that her analysis is persuasive as it relates to the AOM statute, MCL 600.2912d.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">As the <em>Roberts </em>dissent explained, it is this Court\u2019s duty to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent, which begins with an examination of a statute\u2019s language. <em>Roberts, </em>470 Mich at 705 (MARILYN KELLY, J., dissenting). Because the \u201cLegislature knows what phrasing to use when it intends to require extensive detail,\u201d it is noteworthy that the Legislature did not \u201cexplicitly mandate such specificity\u201d in the AOM context. <em>Id. </em>at 709. Specifically, like the NOI statute, MCL 600.2912d only requires a \u201cstatement\u201d regarding the alleged manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, as Justice HATHAWAY notes, the AOM statute does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>not expressly require a heightened level of specificity, as do other statutes. See <em>Roberts, </em>470 Mich at 708-709 (MARILYN Kelly, J., dissenting) (examining other statutes that require \u201cdetailed,\u201d \u201ccomplete,\u201d or \u201cfull\u201d statements, or that require statements made \u201cwith specificity\u201d). Further, because the purpose of the AOM statute is to deter frivolous medical malpractice claims by requiring a certification that a claim is valid, a general assertion of the items required by the AOM statute is sufficient to lend professional credence to the claim\u2019s legitimacy and thus is likely sufficient to meet the statute\u2019s apparent intent. See <em>id. </em>at 707-708. Therefore, I agree with Justice HATHAWAY that a high level of specificity is not required in the AOM context.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that the AOM <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this case was deficient, I believe that MCL 600.2301<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should apply to allow a cure of the alleged deficiency within the AOM. To begin with, applying MCL 600.2301 would not conflict with MCL 600.2912d, when the latter is read as a whole. Indeed, as recognized by Justice HATHAWAY, the AOM statute does not expressly provide a penalty for deficiencies within the contents of an AOM. And, notably, the allowances of additional time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>file an AOM in MCL 600.2912d(2) and (3) do not explicitly preclude amending or disregarding defects within the contents of an AOM.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, those provisions merely provide a plaintiff additional time in which to file the initial AOM and, thus, do not address curing an arguably defective AOM. And while I continue to adhere to my position in <em>Kirkaldy v Rim, </em>478 Mich 581, 586-587; 734 NW2d 201 (2007) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring), as Justice HATHAWAY suggests, allowing a defect within an AOM to be cured under MCL 600.2301 would simply provide an alternative remedy to that of <em>Kirkaldy, </em>in which the majority opined that the remedy for a successful challenge to a deficient AOM is dismissal without prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 586 (majority opinion). Accordingly, I believe that MCL 600.2301 should apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Notably, the aim of MCL 600.2301 is to \u201c \u2018 \u201cabolish technical errors in proceedings and to have cases disposed of as nearly as possible in accordance with the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Boodt v Borgess Med Ctr, </em>481 Mich 558, 569; 751 NW2d 44 (2008) (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Gratiot Lumber &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>Coal Co v Lubinski, </em>309 Mich 662, 668-669; 16 NW2d 112 (1944). And, by its terms, MCL 600.2301 applies to any \u201cprocess\u201d or \u201cproceeding\u201d before a court, allowing amendment, in either form or substance, at \u201cany time\u201d before judgment is rendered. See, also, <em>Bush v Shabahang, </em>484 Mich 156, 176; 772 NW2d 272 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In this case, judgment had not yet been entered and, in my view, an AOM is part and parcel of a medical-malpractice \u201cproceeding,\u201d given that it must be filed with the medical-malpractice complaint. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed) (defining \u201cproceeding\u201d as including \u201c[t]he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment\u201d; \u201c[a]ny procedural means for seeking redress from a tribunal or agency\u201d; and \u201c[a]n act or step that is part of a larger action\u201d); see, also, <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 176-177; <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 568 n 6 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>because MCL 600.2301 permits amendment \u201ceither in form or substance,\u201d amending the substance of an AOM to more clearly state the manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury is proper. See <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 569 (CAVANAGH J., dissenting); <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 177 (recognizing that MCL 600.2301 allows for amendment of errors in form or substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Also, permitting amendment of a defective AOM would be \u201cfor the furtherance of justice,\u201d consistent with MCL 600.2301. As I explained in <em>Boodt, </em>justice is furthered by applying MCL 600.2301 in a case in which a statute operates as a \u201cterminal trap\u201d for the unwary when as here, defendants seek to avoid litigation of a potentially meritorious claim on the basis of a technical defect in an otherwise sufficient<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and timely filed AOM. See <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 569 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). Additionally, when plaintiffs AOM is read as a whole, the contents of the AOM do not evidence an utter lack of a good-faith attempt to comply with the proximate-causation requirement of MCL 600.2912d(1)(d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if plaintiffs AOM were deficient, allowing the alleged defect to be cured under MCL 600.2301 would be in the furtherance of justice. See <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 180-181.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Further, I do not believe that defendants\u2019 substantial rights would be affected by permitting MCL 600.2301 to cure the alleged defect in plaintiff\u2019s AOM. See <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 177-178. Unlike an NOI, which is aimed at providing notice of a claim to a defendant and promoting settlement, see <em>Roberts, </em>470 Mich at 707-708 (MARILYN Kelly, J., dissenting), and <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 174, the purpose of an AOM is to demonstrate that a valid claim exists. Thus, because an AOM is not intended to provide details in an effort to give notice of an impending claim and to promote settlement, a stronger justification likely exists for allowing a minor defect in the contents of an AOM to be cured. Stated another way, despite a technical defect in the AOM, a defendant would certainly be apprised of the fact that a health-care professional who had reviewed the plaintiff\u2019s medical records believed that there was a valid claim, furthering the intent of the AOM statute. And although a defendant is required to file an answer to a plaintiff\u2019s complaint within 21 days after an AOM is filed, a defendant\u2019s affidavit of meritorious defense is not dependent on the contents of a plaintiff\u2019s AOM.

See <em>Boodt, </em>481 Mich at 567-572 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting); <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 177 n 38. For this reason I disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that this Court has \u201clong recognized\u201d that an AOM cannot be amended under MCL 600.2301. Indeed, the only case that the majority cites for this position is <em>Freer v White, </em>91 Mich 74; 51 NW 807 (1892). <em>Yet Freer </em>did not cite any Michigan authority for its assertion that amendments to \u201cattachment affidavits\u201d \u201chave never been deemed admissible\u201d under a predecessor of MCL 600.2301. <em>Id. </em>at 76. More importantly, however, <em>Freer </em>did not address the statute at issue in this case. Instead, <em>Freer </em>involved an <em>\u201cattachment </em>affidavit\u201d in an attachment proceeding. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). See, generally, MCR 3.103 (explaining the process for seeking a writ of attachment). Thus, because <em>Freer </em>involved an attachment proceeding, its statements regarding the applicability of the predecessor of MCL 600.2301 it discussed, which, by its terms, only expressly involved attachment affidavits, should not be read as applying to all affidavits generally, especially when this Court has held that statutes such as the predecessors of MCL 600.2301 should be \u201cliberally construed.\u201d See <em>Beecher v Wayne Circuit Judges, </em>70 Mich 363, 367; 38 NW 322 (1888).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b371-5\"> Notably, in this case, only the AOM\u2019s statement regarding the manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury is at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\"> Instead, the AOM in this case indicated that, in order to comply with the applicable standard of care, defendants should have admitted the decedent to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consultations on that date and that, as a direct and proximate cause of defendants\u2019 acts and omissions, the decedent died. Compare, <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 178, 180 n 43, 182-183 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s one-page blanket denial provided an example of a failure to demonstrate a good-faith attempt to comply with the content requirements of the NOI statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> In my view, any claim of prejudice to defendants\u2019 rights rings hollow in this case. Like the AOM statute, the NOI statute similarly requires a statement regarding proximate causation. MCL 600.2912b(4)(e). In this case, defendants cannot legitimately claim that they would be unfairly prejudiced by allowing the alleged defects in the AOM to be cured, given that plaintiff\u2019s statement regarding proximate causation in the supplemental NOI was deemed sufficient by the Court of Appeals and defendants were served with plaintiffs supplemental NOI before plaintiff filed the complaint and AOM.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> For the reasons stated in this dissent, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that permitting a cure would affect defendants\u2019 substantial rights. See, also, <em>Bush, </em>484 Mich at 178. Further, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that permitting a trial court to cure a technical defect within an AOM is erroneous.

I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss plaintiffs medical malpractice action with prejudice. The majority holds that plaintiffs affidavits of merit (AOMs) were defective, that they cannot be amended pursuant to MCL 600.2301, and that plaintiffs complaint must therefore be dismissed with prejudice. The majority\u2019s conclusions are erroneous because plaintiffs AOMs were not defective and even in cases involving AOMs with content defects, MCL 600.2301 clearly provides relief. Moreover, the plain language of the AOM statute, MCL 600.2912d(1), does not contemplate, let alone require, that a plaintiffs complaint be dismissed with prejudice for defects contained in an AOM. Thus, the majority\u2019s decision ignores the plain language of the relevant statutes. The majority abandons the rule of law and reaches its result by rewriting the applicable statutes. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">I. THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AOM STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">At issue is whether plaintiffs AOMs met the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ments of MCL 600.2912(1(1), the AOM statute. To correctly resolve this issue, we must first examine the language of the AOM statute and determine its correct interpretation. In examining this statute, we follow the established rules of statutory construction. The purpose of statutory construction is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In doing so, we first look to the actual language of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a statute is clear and unambiguous, it must be enforced as written and no further judicial construction is allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply stated, we must avoid a construction that would render any part of the statute nugatory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and similarly, we are \u201cnot free to add language to a statute or to interpret a statute on the basis of this Court\u2019s own sense of how the statute should have been written.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, a statute must be read as a whole,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and while individual words and phrases are important, the words and phrases should be read in the context of the entire legislative scheme.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">MCL 600.2912d, the AOM statute, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(1) Subject to subsection (2), the plaintiff in an action alleging medical malpractice or, if the plaintiff is represented by an attorney, the plaintiffs attorney shall file with the complaint an affidavit of merit signed by a health professional who the plaintiffs attorney reasonably be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>lieves meets the requirements for an expert witness under [MCL 600.2169]. The affidavit of merit shall certify that the health professional has reviewed the notice and all medical records supplied to him or her by the plaintiffs attorney concerning the allegations contained in the notice and shall contain a statement of each of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">(a) The applicable standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">(b) The health professional\u2019s opinion that the applicable standard of practice or care was breached by the health professional or health facility receiving the notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">(c) The actions that should have been taken or omitted by the health professional or health facility in order to have complied with the applicable standard of practice or care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">(d) The manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The majority focuses on the requirements of subdivision (d), which states that the AOM shall contain a statement of \u201c[t]he manner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.\u201d In this case, plaintiff submitted two separate AOMs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The majority holds that these AOMs were deficient because they \u201cfailed to provide <em>any </em>statement of the manner in which the breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This conclusion is disingenuous because the plaintiffs AOMs <em>did contain statements </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>regarding causation. The statements were just not made to the level of exacting detail that the majority asserts is required by the statute. However, the majority\u2019s interpretation of what is required by MCL 600.2912d, the AOM statute, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In analyzing the AOM statute, we must be mindful that the Michigan Legislature has enacted many statutes requiring that a party detail certain facts or elements of a claim with varying levels of heightened specificity. For example, the Legislature used the phrase \u201cwith specificity\u201d in MCL 333.17015(10), MCL 333.22231(4), and MCL 769.1a(8). The phrase \u201cstating specifically\u201d was used in MCL 38.416 and MCL 500.8133(3). The Legislature mandated in MCL 38.14, MCL 125.1510(1), MCL 408.1027(2)(b), MCL 462.319(l)(a), MCL 600.557b(2), and MCL 600.6461(2) that a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d be made; required a \u201cfull statement\u201d in MCL 224.25, MCL 491.920(3), and MCL 500.424(2); required a \u201ccomplete statement\u201d in MCL 14.283(b) and MCL 462.2(2); and required a \u201cfull and complete statement\u201d in MCL 247.172, MCL 324.51904, and MCL 390.758.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Legislature chose <em>not </em>to incorporate any of these phrases heightening the level of specificity in the AOM statute. If the Legislature had chosen to incorporate such qualifying language in MCL 600.2912d(1), then the majority might have a basis for its conclusion. However, MCL 600.2912d(1) is <em>silent </em>concerning the level of specificity with which the information in an AOM must be conveyed. Nothing in the plain language of this statute mandates the heightened level of specificity that the majority demands, and this Court is not free to add words or phrases to a statute. Thus, the requirement that the AOM \u201cshall contain a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of each of the following\u201d simply means what it says.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute requires that <em>\u201ca statement\u201d </em>must be made, not a \u201cdetailed statement,\u201d \u201ca complete statement,\u201d or a \u201cfull explanatory statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Moreover, the majority distorts the word \u201cmanner\u201d as used in MCL 600.2912d(1)(d). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority opines that the word \u201cmanner\u201d requires a detailed statement of \u201chow\u201d the breach caused the injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">We have often said that it is insufficient to simply state the result when required to state the manner in which there was a breach: The answer to <em>\u201cHow </em>was the standard of care breached?\u201d is never \u201cThe standard of care was breached.\u201d <em>Similarly, answering the question \u201cHow was the breach the proximate cause of the injury ?\u201d requires more than \u201cThe breach caused the injury. </em>\u201d[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">However, this conclusion is inconsistent with how the word \u201cmanner\u201d has been interpreted in other statutes such as MCL 28.258(12)(b), MCL 52.202(1), and MCL 52.205. Our courts have consistently interpreted the word \u201cmanner\u201d as used in relation to those statutes as allowing for a single word description such as \u201chomicide,\u201d \u201csuicide,\u201d or \u201caccident.\u201d In <em>People v Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">Over the next two days Ashton\u2019s condition continually deteriorated. Ashton died on November 10, 2003. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was loss of consciousness caused by brain swelling. The Medical Examiner determined that Ashton had been violently shaken, causing his head to snap back and forth. The Medical Examiner concluded that the <em>manner </em>of death was homicide.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>See also, <em>Maiden v Rozwood, </em>461 Mich 109, 115; 597 NW2d 817 (1999) (\u201c[T]he \u2018manner of death was an accident.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>People v Bailey, </em>451 Mich 657, 664; 549 NW2d 325 (1996) (\u201c \u2018The manner of death is homicide.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>People v Schmitt, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued July 31, 2007 (Docket No. 264176), p 2 (ZAHRA, EJ., dissenting) (\u201cThe medical examiner determined the manner of Richard\u2019s death to be a homicide . . . .\u201d), rev\u2019d 480 Mich 963 (2007); and <em>People v Small, </em>unpublishaed opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 28, 1999 (Docket No. 205544), p 1 (\u201cThe assistant medical examiner testified that the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds and that manner of death was homicide.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Thus the use of the word \u201cmanner\u201d in the AOM statute does not mandate a detailed description of how the breach caused the injury; rather the manner in which the breach was the proximate cause of the injury can be set forth in a similarly succinct description such as \u201cthe malpractice caused the death\u201d or \u201cthe breaches of the standard of care caused the death,\u201d or \u201cthe death was caused by the breaches of the standard of care.\u201d Thus, all that MCL 600.2912d(1)(d) requires is a statement that the breach of the standard of care caused the result. To require the parties to provide further description creates a requirement not found in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s ruling transforms an AOM into something that it is not. The AOM statute is one part of a larger statutory scheme for malpractice claims, and it must be read in the context of that larger legislative scheme. As set forth by the clear language of MCL 600.2912d(1), an AOM is designed only to act as certification that the claim is supported by the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of a qualified expert. The statute states that the plaintiff \u201cshall file ... an affidavit of merit signed by <em>a health professional who the plaintiffs attorney reasonably believes meets the requirements for an expert witness </em>.... <em>The affidavit of merit shall certify that the health professional has reviewed the notice [of </em>intent] . . . concerning the allegations contained in the notice . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, an AOM is intended to function as a <em>certification </em>that the allegations contained within the notice of intent (NOI) are meritorious. An AOM is filed with the complaint and is not the notice pleading. The NOI is the notice pleading. The AOM serves as certification that the allegations of the claim are meritorious, and its <em>only </em>role is to deter the filing of unsupported claims. By failing to read the AOM statute in its entirety and in the context of the malpractice statutory scheme, the majority simply misconstrues the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The majority compounds its error by focusing solely on the statements made in the AOM, rather than reading the AOM in concert with the NOI, as contemplated by the AOM statute. The AOM statute requires that \u201c[t]he affidavit of merit shall certify that <em>the health professional has reviewed the notice </em>and all medical records supplied to him or her by the plaintiffs attorney <em>concerning the allegations contained in the notice </em>. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As evidenced by this plain language, an AOM is not a standalone document. Rather, it is to be <em>read in concert </em>with the NOI. The statute requires that the expert review the NOI and certify that he or she supports allegations contained therein, and while the statute requires the expert to make a statement on proximate causation, it does not require that the expert repeat the contents of the NOI in the AOM.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>II. THE SUFFICIENCY OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S AFFIDAVITS OF MERIT</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In this case, the NOI set forth in detail the nature of the claim and how the plaintiffs decedent, Edris Ligons, died. From the pleadings, plaintiffs allegations appear to be relatively straightforward and uncomplicated. The NOI and AOMs alleged that professional negligence occurred during a visit to defendant Crittenton Hospital\u2019s emergency room, where Ligons was seen by defendant David Bruce Bauer, M.D. Plaintiff claimed that Ligons had suffered a perforation of her colon during a recently performed colonoscopy and that she developed sepsis as a result of the perforation. Ligons went to the emergency room for follow-up treatment, and plaintiff claimed that Dr. Bauer failed to admit her to the hospital for the proper diagnostic testing and treatment. Plaintiff further claimed that this improper treatment allowed the sepsis to become overwhelming, leading to multiple organ failure, causing Ligons\u2019s death. The NOI set forth the factual background of plaintiffs claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">Edris Ligons was a 54-year-old woman, with a history of colon polyps, with one atypical polyp found on a previous colonoscopy. She came to Crittenton Hospital for an outpatient follow-up colonoscopy on January 14, 2002. Dr. Tayeb noted during the procedure that the colon was very tortuous and pressure had to be applied to reach the cecum. The clinical diagnosis was diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">On January 22, 2002 Mrs. Ligons presented to the Emergency Department at Crittenton with a four-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever. She had a fever of 102.4. She had abdominal tenderness on examination. She had a [white blood cell count] of 15,400. An abdominal x-ray showed an abnormal gas pattern with mildly dilated small bowel loops, and paucity of gas or bowel content in the colon. The report indicated that this could reflect early or partial bowel obstruction. The radi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ologist specifically recommended progress views. She was treated for gastroenteritis and dehydration. She was given antibiotics and fluids. She was discharged within six hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">She went to Dr. Tayeb\u2019s office on the 23rd due to severe pain. She was immediately sent to the Emergency Department. Examination revealed changes consistent with peritonitis because of a perforated colon. She developed sepsis. Exploratory laparatomy revealed an extensive pelvic abscess, and surgical resection was not possible. Despite extensive medication, the sepsis that developed due to the perforated colon led to multiple organ failure and death on January 29, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Plaintiffs supplemental NOI further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">As a direct and proximate result of the negligence and malpractice alleged above Edris Ligons experienced conscious pain and suffering and ultimately died due to the negligence. Specifically, had Dr. Bauer admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002 and had appropriate consults been obtained including surgery and [gastrointestinal] and had progress X-rays been obtained the patients [sic] peritonitis would have been diagnosed much earlier. The perforated] colon would have been detected and surgery would have been performed much earlier. This would have avoided the overwhelming sepsis that led to the multi organ system failure and ultimately death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The AOM signed by Dr. Fred Thomas certified that he had reviewed the NOI and all the medical records concerning the allegations contained in the notice and concluded, \u201cIt is my opinion that had the defendants admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consults on January 22, 2002, as outlined in Dr. Sternbach\u2019s affidavit that Edris Ligons would not have died.\u201d The AOM signed by Dr. George Sternbach similarly certified his review and concluded, \u201cAs a direct and proximate cause of the imprudent acts and omission committed by the individuals identified herein, Edris Ligons, died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>While I do not opine on whether plaintiff would ultimately prevail on the merits, it is pure folly to suggest that these statements do not meet the requirements of MCL 600.2912d(1)(d). To reach such an erroneous conclusion, the majority effectively ignores the statements that the \u201cper[forated] colon would have been detected and surgery would have been performed much earlier\u201d and \u201c[t]his would have avoided the overwhelming sepsis that led to the multi organ system failure and ultimately death.\u201d The majority further ignores the Dr. Thomas\u2019s certification that he had reviewed that statement and the supporting medical records and ignores his opinion that \u201chad the defendants admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consults on January 22, 2002, as outlined in Dr. Sternbach\u2019s affidavit that Edris Ligons would not have died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the contents of the NOI must be repeated in the AOM is at odds with the plain language of the statute. Plaintiffs AOMs met the requirements of MCL 600.2912d(l)(d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The AOMs, when read in concert with the NOI, set forth a \u201cstatement\u201d regarding the \u201cmanner in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.\u201d Nothing more is required by the statute. Thus, plaintiffs AOMs were not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">III. DISMISSAL OF A CASE INVOLVING AN AOM WITH CONTENT DEFECTS IS NOT REQUIRED BY <em>KIRKALDY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The majority further errs by holding that if an AOM contains any defect, the only possible remedy is dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>missal under <em>Kirkaldy v Rim</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In so opining, the majority expands the ruling of <em>Kirkaldy </em>well beyond its facts and legal conclusion. In <em>Kirkaldy, </em>the plaintiffs AOM was found to be defective because it was not signed by an expert who met the requirements of the expert-witness statute, MCL 600.2169. The plaintiff in <em>Kirkaldy </em>was not seeking relief from a defect in content. Instead, the plaintiff sought the ability to replace an AOM, signed by an unqualified expert, with an entirely new AOM signed by a qualified expert. Thus, <em>Kirkaldy </em>addressed the ability to substitute the original AOM for one signed by an entirely different expert witness. Nothing in <em>Kirkaldy </em>addressed an AOM containing purported defects in content. Rather, the defect at issue in <em>Kirkaldy </em>was that the expert was not qualified to support the claim. Significantly, the plaintiff in <em>Kirkaldy </em>filed a second complaint accompanied by a new AOM signed by a qualified expert. The plaintiff requested that the original case be dismissed without prejudice so that she could pursue the second complaint. This Court simply granted one of the avenues of relief requested by the plaintiff when it dismissed the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><em>Kirkaldy </em>decided the issue of whether filing the original complaint tolled the period of limitations under MCL 600.5856, and this Court held that even an AOM signed by an unqualified expert tolls the period of limitations. <em>Kirkaldy </em>did not address whether alternative remedies short of dismissal, such as amendment of an AOM, were available under MCL 600.2301. Thus, it is erroneous to state that dismissal is the only remedy for an AOM with content defects because this Court did not address that issue in <em>Kirkaldy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>IV DISMISSAL OF AN AOM WITH CONTENT DEFECTS IS CONTRARY TO THE AOM STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The proper starting point for identifying the required penalties and available remedies for AOMs with content defects is the language of the AOM statute itself. While MCL 600.2912d(1) mandates that a plaintiff shall not commence an action for medical malpractice without timely filing an AOM, <em>nothing </em>in the plain language of this statute requires or compels dismissal of the case for defects in the AOM. Despite the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion, the AOM statute makes no reference whatsoever to a mandatory dismissal penalty in the event of a defect. Instead, the statute is <em>silent </em>regarding the consequences of filing an AOM that contains content defects. Thus, we must determine whether mandatory dismissal with prejudice was the intent of the Legislature when it enacted MCL 600.2912d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The legislative history of the AOM statute reveals that the Legislature did not intend for a defect in an AOM to be grounds for dismissal with prejudice. The clearest indicator of this intent is the Legislature\u2019s complete rejection of a \u201cmandatory dismissal with prejudice\u201d clause contained in the original draft of the legislation. The AOM statute was originally introduced as part of Senate Bill No. 270 on January 28, 1993. AOMs (referred to as \u201ccertificate[s]\u201d in SB 270 as introduced) were addressed in proposed \u00a7 2912d. Proposed \u00a7 2912d contained a mandatory dismissal penalty. The bill as introduced linked the NOI and the AOM together. It also provided for dismissal of claims without the benefit of tolling afforded in MCL 600.5856, which in essence would have resulted in a dismissal with prejudice. Section 2912d as introduced stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(1) A person shall not commence an action alleging medical malpractice unless the complaint is accompanied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>by the certificate signed by the person or, if the person is represented by an attorney, by the attorney reflecting that the person has complied with section 2912f [concerning NOIs], <em>If the complaint is not accompanied by the certificate required under this subsection, the complaint does not toll the statute of limitations as provided in section 5856(1).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in an action alleging medical malpractice, <em>the court shall dismiss a claim not included in the notice required under section 2912f. </em>[Emphasis added; formatting altered from strikethrough/insert format to show language as proposed.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Significantly, while AOMs and NOIs remained linked in the version of the bill actually adopted, the penalty provisions did not survive. There simply were not sufficient votes in the Legislature to enact a statute with such harsh penalties. This unequivocally demonstrates that mandatory dismissal was not the will of the Legislature. Michigan law makes clear that \u201c[w]here the Legislature has considered certain language and rejected it in favor of other language, the resulting statutory language should not be held to explicitly authorize what the Legislature explicitly rejected.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the Legislature specifically omitted proposed dismissal language from the enrolled bill, it is unreasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended for courts to reinsert dismissal as the only permissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>remedy. The majority\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cshall contain a statement\u201d as meaning \u201cshall dismiss the case if there is a possible defect no matter how minor\u201d is misguided.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">V CONTENT DEFECTS IN AN AOM MAY BE CORRECTED</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The AOMs in this case were not defective. However, even in cases involving AOMs with content defects, a party who files a defective AOM is entitled to seek relief. The first question is whether a plaintiff is entitled to relief under the former version of MCR 2.118. The majority claims that a plaintiff whose case was pending while the former version of MCR 2.118 was in effect<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is not entitled to relief under the former rule because an AOM is not a pleading. To reach this conclusion the majority disavows the holding in <em>Barnett v Hidalgo, </em>478 Mich 151, 161; 732 NW2d 472 (2007), that an AOM is part of a pleading and, therefore, admissible as substantive evidence at trial because it constitutes an admission by a party opponent. However, now the majority claims that because <em>Barnett </em>held that an AOM is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201cpart of the pleadings,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> an AOM is not a \u201cpleading\u201d subject to amendment under MCR 2.118. This distinction is dubious at best, as nothing in former MCR 2.118 stated or suggested that a pleading can be amended but a part of it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Regardless of whether relief is available under the former court rule, the majority completely disregards MCL 600.2301. Once again, this Court must turn to the actual language of the statute. MCL 600.2301 contains two clear and unambiguous provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">The court in which any action or proceeding is pending, has power to amend any process, pleading or proceeding in such action or proceeding, either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice, on such terms as are just, at any time before judgment rendered therein. The court at every stage of the action or proceeding shall disregard any error or defect in the proceedings which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The plain language of this statute imposes a duty that cannot be ignored on all courts of this state. It requires that \u201c[t]he court at every stage of the action or proceeding shall disregard any error or defect in the proceedings which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d This is not a discretionary provision. It is a legislative mandate that this Court must follow. Unless substantial rights are affected, the court <em>shall </em>disregard any error or defect at every stage of the action or proceeding. This provision applies to all actions or proceedings. Thus, even if we were to accept the majority\u2019s erroneous conclusion that an AOM is not a pleading, an AOM is nevertheless part of the \u201caction\u201d or \u201cproceeding.\u201d Clearly, the failure to repeat statements already made cannot be characterized as affecting a substantial right. According to the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>statute, this Court must disregard technical defects, such as the ones the majority claims are in plaintiffs AOMs. By failing to do so, the majority ignores a clear and direct mandate imposed on this Court by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Moreover, even in instances in which an AOM contains more substantial defects or substantial rights might be affected, trial courts still have discretion under MCL 600.2301 to afford relief by way of amendment when justice so requires. MCL 600.2301 states that \u201c[t]he court in which any action or proceeding is pending, has power to amend any process, pleading or proceeding in such action or proceeding, either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice, on such terms as are just. . . .\u201d MCL 600.2301 clearly provides for amendment of more than just pleadings. It allows for amendments of <em>\u201cany </em>process, pleading or proceeding.\u201d An AOM is without question part of the process or proceeding. Thus, an AOM is a document that courts have the power to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The majority claims it can disregard the plain language of MCL 600.2301 by asserting that <em>Freer v White, </em>91 Mich 74, 76; 51 NW 807 (1892), represents the long-established law in Michigan that amendment of an affidavit is prohibited. However, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Freer </em>(discussing \u201cattachment\u201d affidavits used in debtor-creditor disputes in the 1800s) is misguided.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Emerson v Detroit Steel &amp; Spring Co, </em>100 Mich 127, 132; 58 NW 659 (1894), this Court limited the holding in <em>Freer </em>to its facts and recognized that <em>Freer </em>had not overruled <em>Barber v Smith, </em>41 Mich 138; 1 NW 992 (1879), which had previously allowed for amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>to attachment affidavits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Freer </em>does not, as the majority claims, support its decision to ignore the plain language of MCL 600.2301.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">VI. WHEN COURTS SHOULD ALLOW AMENDMENT OF AN AOM</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Next we must determine under what circumstances a court should allow amendment of an AOM with content defects that affect the substantial rights of the parties. While allowing an amendment is a discretionary matter, a court should view a party\u2019s request to amend in light of the statutory directive that amendments should be in \u201cthe furtherance of justice, on such terms as are just. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If failing to allow amendment would result in the dismissal of a plaintiffs case with prejudice, as the majority holds in this case, the result would not be in the furtherance of justice. Such a result slams the courthouse doors in the plaintiffs face, leaving that plaintiff without a forum in which to pursue a claim that an expert has certified as meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Citizens of this state are entitled to a forum to resolve claims on their merits. Furtherance of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>cannot be achieved without providing citizens access to justice. Access to justice is a cornerstone of our system of jurisprudence, and without it, confidence in the judiciary is lost. Allowing for amendment of an AOM to correct defects in content is in the furtherance of justice. Such relief permits a plaintiff to pursue his or her claim and have it decided on its merits rather than on a hypertechnical reading of an AOM or a misguided reading of the AOM statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Unfortunately, instead of following the rule of law, the majority denies the plaintiff in this case access to justice by rewriting the language of the AOM statute in order to come to its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss this medical malpractice action with prejudice. The majority\u2019s conclusions are erroneous because plaintiffs AOMs were not defective and even in cases involving AOMs with content defects, MCL 691.2301 clearly provides relief. Moreover, the plain language of the AOM statute does not contemplate, let alone require, that a plaintiffs complaint be dismissed with prejudice for defects contained in an affidavit. The majority\u2019s decision ignores the plain language of the relevant statutes. The majority abandons the rule of law and reaches its result by rewriting the applicable statutes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> <em>Potter v McLeary, </em>484 Mich 397, 410; 774 NW2d 1 (2009), citing <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> <em>Potter, </em>484 Mich at 410.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 236.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> <em>People v McGraw, </em>484 Mich 120, 126; 771 NW2d 655 (2009), citing <em>Baker v Gen Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639, 665; 297 NW2d 387 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\"> <em>Kirkaldy v Rim, </em>478 Mich 581, 587; 734 NW2d 201 (2007) (Cavanagh, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\"> See <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\"> <em>Herman v Berrien Co, </em>481 Mich 352, 366; 750 NW2d 570 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> Plaintiffs AOM containing a statement from Dr. Fred Thomas provided in pertinent part that \u201c[i]t is my opinion that had the defendants admitted the patient to the hospital on January 22, 2002, and obtained the appropriate consults on January 22, 2002, as outlined in Dr. Sternhach\u2019s affidavit that Edris Ligons would not have died.\u201d Plaintiffs AOM containing a statement from Dr. George Sternbach provided in pertinent part that \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate cause of the imprudent acts and omission committed by the individuals identified herein, Edris Ligons, died.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> <em>Ante </em>at 77 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> MCL 600.2912d(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"> MCL 600.2912d(1)(d) states, \u201cThe <em>manner </em>in which the breach of the standard of practice or care was the proximate cause of the injury alleged in the notice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> <em>Ante </em>at 77-78 (second emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> <em>People v Williams, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 29, 2005 (Docket No. 256123), p 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b379-5\"> MCL 600.2912d(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\"> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\"> <em>Kirkaldy, </em>478 Mich 581.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\"> This is not to suggest or imply that parties are not free to engage in repetition or that being repetitive renders an AOM defective.
