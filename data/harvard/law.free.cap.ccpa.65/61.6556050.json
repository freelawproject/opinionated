Ct. 1, C.D. 4705, 432 F. Supp. 1354 (1977), which dismissed an action challenging the classification of certain imported merchandise as \u201cTooth brushes\u201d under item 750.40, TSUS, and claiming classification as \u201cElectrical articles and electrical parts of articles, not specifically provided for\u201d under item 688.40, TSUS, or alternatively as \u201cMachines not specially provided for, and parts thereof\u201d under item 678.50; TSUS. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The merchandise was denominated on the commercial and special customs invoices as \u201cBroxodent devices (electric toothbrushes).\u201d They' are, in essence, complete, hand-held power units adapted to receive a detachable brush; the brushes, however, were not included in the importation. Appellant markets the merchandise, together with, <em>inter alia, </em>brushes as the \u201cBroxodent\u201d electric toothbrush.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">The competing provisions of the Tariff Schedules, with rates in effect at the time of importation, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">General Interpretative Rule 10(h):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">[Ujnless the context requires otherwise, a tariff description for an article covers such article, whether assembled or not assembled, and whether finished or not finished [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">Classified Under:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-15\">SCHEDULE 7. - SPECIFIED PRODUCTS; MISCELLANEOUS AND NONENUMERATED PRODUCTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-16\">Part 8. - Combs; Hair Ornaments; Brooms and Brushes; Paint Rollers; Umbrellas and Canes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-17\">Subpart A. - Combs, Hair Ornaments, Brooms and Brushes, Paint Rollers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Subpart A headnotes':</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\">1.

On this issue, the Customs Court held that the \u201cBroxodent\u201d devices were properly denominated as unfinished toothbrushes. It reasoned that since a brush comprises one percent of the cost to appellant of a complete unit (\u201cBroxodent\u201d device-f-one brush), and since all that is required to make the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device a complete electric toothbrush is the brush, for the purpose of Rule 10(h) the \u201cBroxodent\u201d devices are \u201csubstantially' complete\u2019\u2019 electric-toothbrushes. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In determining whether the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device should be classified as a toothbrush, unfinished, by virtue of Rule 10(h), the Customs Court applied a substantiality test, viz.; if the imported merchandise is a substantially complete article then it should be classified as the article itself. Appellant, relying on <em>Authentic Furniture Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>61 CCPA 5, C.A.D. 1109, 486 F. 2d 1062 (1973), asserts that the Customs Court erred in this regard and that the correct test is the substantial; or essential.-test, viz., if the imported merchandise lacks a substantial or essential part then it cannot be classified as the article itself. Since a brush is a concededly essential component of a complete electric toothbrush, appellant views <em>Authentic Furniture </em>as dictating a reversal of the Customs Court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In <em>Authentic Furniture, </em>unassembled pieces of wooden bunk beds, which did not include the siderails, were classified by the customs officials and the lower court as parts of furniture under item 727.40, TSUS, as modified. Appellant therein claimed classification as unfinished furniture, pursuant to Rule 10(h), under item 723.35, TSUS, as modified. A majority of this court, <em>supra </em>at 6, 486 F. 2d at 1063, agreed with the lower court that the \u201csubstantially complete\u201d test was the proper criterion for distinguishing between parts of an article and the unfinished article for the purpose of Rule 10(h). However, the majority also indicated that \u201cthe absence of a substantial or essential part precludes classification as the unfinished article itself.\u201d <em>supra </em>at 7, 486 F. 2d at 1064. The Customs Court construed <em>Authentic Furniture </em>as requiring this latter test to be applied only in the situation where there is a competing parts provision, as was the case in <em>Authentic Furniture. </em>Without commenting on the situation where there is a competing parts provision, suffice it to say that in the present case, where there is no such competing provision, the Customs Court\u2019s application of the substantiality test was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The absence of an essential part, while certainly a <em>relevant factor </em>to be considered in determining whether the imported merchandise is a substantially complete article, does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>preclude classification as the article itself. The majority in <em>Authentic Furniture </em>viewed the absence of siderails, which were essential parts in the sense of making the bunk beds usable to the ultimate consumer, <em>i.e., </em>functional essentiality, as precluding the imported merchandise therein from being considered substantially complete bunk beds. For reasons to be discussed <em>infra, </em>we do not believe the absence of a brush, albeit a functionally essential part of an electric toothbrush, precludes the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device from being considered a substantially complete toothbrush.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Appellant concedes that the brush component comprises approximately one percent of the cost to it of the entire \u201cBroxodent\u201d electric toothbrush, and may be purchased at retail separately from the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device. In point of fact, all that is required to make the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device a complete electric toothbrush is a detachable brush. Moreover, one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, a product manager for appellant, on cross-examination, characterized, <em>inter alia, </em>the brushes as \u201caccessories.\u201d Thus, we consider the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device to be a classic example of the type of merchandise to which Rule 10(h) was intended to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Appellant relies on <em>Jack Schaefer, Inc., </em>v. <em>United States, </em>11 Cust. Ct. 78, C.D. 798 (1943), as supportive of its position that the brushes are not only essential, but also substantial. There, the court decided that football cases and \u201cTeth-R-Ball\u201d cases, imported without rubber bladders, were not unfinished balls designed for use in physical exercise. <em>Jack Schaefer </em>is clearly distinguishable on its facts. There, the cost of the imported merchandise was approximately 45-50 cents each, while the cost of the finishing material was 18 cents for the football and 23 cents for the \u201cTeth-R-Ball.\u201d The court viewed these costs for the finishing material as \u201cnot \u2018negligible,\u2019 but rather substantial.\u201d In contradistinction, the cost here for the missing part, <em>i.e., </em>the brush, as discussed <em>supra, </em>is approximately one percent of the cost to appellant of a complete unit. Therefore, the cost of the missing part here is far less substantial in proportion to the total cost of the finished article than was the case in <em>Jack Schaefer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In further support of the conclusion that the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device was properly classified in item 750.40, TSUS, we note plaintiff\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) exhibit five, which consists of an agreement covering the manufacture and sale of the imported merchandise, dated March 30, 1970, between appellant and the manufacturer, Tavaro S.A. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Whereas, Squibb is the exclusive proprietor of the . . . patents and trademark rights for the sale of an <em>electrically driven tooth</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>brush device (hereinafter called the Broxodent Device) </em>and desires to purchase the Broxodent Device not including the brushes and the case from Tavaro and Tavaro is willing to manufacture and sell the Broxodent Device to Squibb[.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">While appellant\u2019s statement in this agreement equating the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device with an \u201celectrically driven toothbrush device\u201d does not act as an estoppel, we view it as evidence against appellant\u2019s \u25a0contradictory claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Finally, we believe the legislative history of \u00a7 77 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-241, 79 Stat. 933 (codified in 19 USO 1202), is illuminating on the determination of the proper classification of the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device. It amended headnote l(i) of schedule 7, part 8, subpart A, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">(i) mechanical combs, brooms or brushes <em>(other than combs or brushes which are toilet articles), </em>or combs, brooms, or brushes which are parts of articles (other than toilet articles) [.] [Emphasized portion is the new language that was added by the 1965 amendment.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In the report of the Senate Committee on Finance to accompany the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act, S. Hep. No. 530, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1965), the amendment to headnote l(i) (then \u00a7 79) was described, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\"><em>Section 79. Electric toothbrushes. </em>\u2014 This section insures that electric toothbrushes and other mechanical combs and brushes which are toilet articles will be classified as toilet articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">While the aforementioned legislative history does not elaborate on what was intended to be encompassed by the term \u201celectric toothbrushes,\u201d it does, nonetheless, evince a clear Congressional intent that electric toothbrushes <em>qua </em>electric toothbrushes be classified under item 750.40, TSUS. <em>Accord, </em>H.R. Rep. No. 342, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 44 (1965). To classify the \u201cBroxodent\u201d device, which is a \u2022complete electric toothbrush in every respect except for the absence of an interchangeable brush of nominal value, in the basket provision \u2022of either items 688.40 or 678.50, TSUS, instead of in the <em>eo nomine </em>provision for toothbrushes in item 750.40, TSUS, would, in our view, thwart a clear manifestation of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-30\"> Rates of duty as modified by T.D. 68-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-31\"> See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-32\"> See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b90-11\">Miller, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHj\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">I agree with the result reached by the majority. However, it should he pointed out that in the <em>Authentic Furniture </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 7, 486 F. 2d at 1064, the majority, without citation of authority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">We consider the application of the test, whereby the absence of a substantial or essential part precludes classification as the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>finished article itself, to be well founded in the case law so ably discussed by the lower court and aptly followed in the present case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">My dissenting opinion there set forth the correct test, namely: the absence of a substantial <em>and </em>essential part.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The problem the majority now faces is that the \u201cwell founded\u201d test it proclaimed in <em>Authentic </em>would, if applied, preclude classification of the merchandise in this case as the unfinished article, namely: \u201cTooth brushes.\u201d It is stuck with the Customs Court\u2019s finding, <em>supra </em>at 3, 432 F. Supp. at 1356, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">Both the Broxodent device and a brush are essential components of plaintiff\u2019s electric toothbrush.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The majority attempts to meet the problem by limiting its \u201cwell founded\u201d test to situations where there is a competing parts provision. There being no competing parts provision here, it finds application of a test of substantiality alone to be proper. However, there is no logical basis or authority for such a distinction, and there is authority to the contrary. <em>See Twin Pin Co. of U.S.A. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>24 Cust. Ct. 430, 431 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Instead of trying to distinguish the misstated and misapplied test set forth in <em>Authentic, </em>the majority would far better rest its decision on legislative intent, which is well and persuasively set forth in the opinion. Of course, the correct test stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Authentic </em>would also support the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
