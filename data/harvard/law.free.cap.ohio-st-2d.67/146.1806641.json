Supp. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A living insured with no assets suffers injury when an excess judgment is obtained against him because such a judgment will potentially impair his credit, place a cloud on the title to his exempt estate, impair his ability to successfully apply for loans, diminish his reputation and future prospects and the like. See <em>Crabb </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co. </em>(S.D. 1973), 205 N.W. 2d 633; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co., supra; </em>and <em>Lange </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">A solvent estate may also pursue an excess judgment against the insurer since the interests of the estate are involved and a full and fair recovery enables the fiduciary of the estate to distribute assets free from the claim of the holder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the excess judgment. <em>Henke </em>v. <em>Iowa Home Mut. Casualty Co., supra; </em>and <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Prudence Mut. Cas. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A decreasing minority of jurisdictions adopt the \u201cpayment rule,\u201d which advocates the reasoning that, if an insured did not and cannot pay out any money in satisfaction of an excess judgment, the insured was not harmed, and, therefore, the insurer is not to be held responsible for its bad faith in defending the insured\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We adopt the rationale of a majority of jurisdictions, which espouse the \u201cjudgment rule.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The seminal case law authority in this area is <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Prudence Mut. Cas. Co., supra </em>(98 Ill. App. 2d 190). The court, in <em>Wolfberg, </em>succinctly gave the rationale for the adoption of the \u201cjudgment rule,\u201d when it stated, at page 197:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u201cWe are persuaded that the majority view is the sounder one both in justice and logic. The very fact of the entry of judgment itself constitutes damage and harm sufficient to permit recovery. The damage to the estate is the creation of liability for the judgments. The rule of damages is that incurrence is equivalent to outlay.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\"><em>it </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u201cWere payment or showing of ability to pay the rule, encouragement would be given to an insurer with an insolvent insured to unreasonably refuse to settle. Such a course would impair the use of insurance for the poor man. Further, the fullness or the emptiness of an insured\u2019s purse would be an irrelevant and poor measure of liability and performance of duty by the insurer under his contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The Court of Appeals, which adopted the \u201cjudgment rule,\u201d carved a sole exception to the foregoing principle. The court formulated a hybrid exception to the \u201cjudgment rule\u201d which sounds much akin to the rationale of the \u201cpayment rule.\u201d It reasoned that there is no damage to the insured or his estate either now or in the future, because the estate is insolvent, and, therefore, there is no present or future detriment to the estate. Thus, the court concluded that the insurer, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>lee, is relieved from paying the excess judgment even though it has been adjudicated to have acted in bad faith which resulted in the excess judgment rendered against the estate of Jack Pelfrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Because of theoretical and practical considerations, we find no reason to carve this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Theoretically, it would be a windfall to the insurer and \u201csuch a course would impair the use of insurance for the poor man.\u201d See <em>Wolfberg, supra, </em>at page 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">As to a practical aspect, it is also improper to relieve an insurer from its contractual duty to act in good faith simply because the insured is deceased and insolvent. It is a large assumption that the estate, which at the time of its inventory is insolvent, will remain insolvent. There are numerous instances in which the total net estate may increase and cause an insolvent estate to go through a full administration. For example, the estate of Jack Pelfrey may obtain a solvent status if there are newly discovered assets, such as a lost bank account, unaccounted for real estate in a different jurisdiction or assets such as hidden stock certificates. See R. C. 2109.50. It is also feasible, albeit not common, that the estate of Jack Pelfrey may also inherit money or assets by means of another\u2019s will clause granting assets to \u201cJack Pelfrey or to the estate of Jack Pelfrey.\u201d Any one or a series of the foregoing could cause an influx of assets into the estate of Jack Pelfrey raising the insolvent estate to a taxable estate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">As noted herein, if the estate of Jack Pelfrey were solvent, then it or its assignee could sustain an action against the insurer for \u201cbad faith.\u201d We find no reason to fashion an exception to the judgment rule when an estate is insolvent and yet allow an action of \u201cbad faith\u201d when an estate is solvent, especially in light of the foregoing, which clearly demonstrates that an insolvent estate may easily become solvent, and, therefore, the assets of the estate would be subject to the claims of the holder of the excess judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">In <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Schropp </em>(1977), 222 Kan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>612, 567 P. 2d 1359, the court, when presented with an identical factual situation as herein, at pages 623-624, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u201c * * * The court observed that virtually everything that has been written on this subject in the past fifteen years has favored the judgment rule over the prepayment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\"><em>a* </em>*c *</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u201cWe do not think that the prepayment rule serves the ends of justice, and decline to adopt it. On the contrary, we see no reason why the insolvency of an insured or his estate should excuse the insurer from exercising the same good faith it would be expected to exercise, were the insured fully financially responsible.***\u201d Accord, <em>Sweeten </em>v. <em>National Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1963), 233 Md. 52, 194 A. 2d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Therefore, based upon the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-10\">W. Brown, Sweeney and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b178-11\">Celebrezze, C. J., P. Brown and Holmes, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\"> <em>Wolfberg, infra, </em>states, at page 196:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">\"A review of the authorities persuades us to the view that the cases relied on by appellee constitute the earlier and minority view on this issue. These cases were considered in <em>Wooten </em>v. <em>Central Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(La. App. 1966), 182 So. 2d 146, which noted that these cases were not persuasive, had been severely criticized, and were expressly refused or failed to be followed in other federal circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">\u201cThe majority view in this country is represented by <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp., </em>349 Mass. 699, 212 N.E. 2d 464, 465, 467 (Sup. Ct.

Ins. Co., </em>286 F. 2d 295 (4th Cir.); <em>Wessing </em>v. <em>Amemcan Indem. Co., </em>D.C., 127 F. Supp. 775; <em>Henke </em>v. <em>Iowa Home Mut. Cas. Co., </em>250 Iowa 1123, 97 N. W. 2d 168, and other cases.)\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\"> The Court of Appeals for Wood County, in <em>Spitler </em>v. <em>State Auto Mut. </em>(case No. WD 78-27, decided January 26,1979), also opted for the judgment rule instead of the payment rule. That case was before this court, but the issue presented in the cause <em>sub judice </em>was not raised on appeal. See <em>Spitler </em>v. <em>State Auto Mut. </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\"> The assignment for the action against appellee from the estate of Jack Pelfrey to the appellants also had a value.
