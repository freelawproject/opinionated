We are also cognizant of the fact that the test for determining the validity of proposed ballot language is not whether the members of this court might have used different words to describe the language used in the proposed amendment, but, rather, whether the language adopted by the ballot board properly describes the proposed amendment. <em>State, ex rel. Foreman, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 139, 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Because of the relative uniqueness of each case and the necessarily subjective nature of any synopsis of a given statute or constitutional amendment, it is difficult to establish firm criteria against which the decisions of the ballot board may be measured. Nevertheless, such criteria do exist and it is appropriate to state that the following are generally applicable to cases of this nature. First, a voter has the right to know what it is he is being asked to vote upon. <em>State, ex rel. Burton, </em>v. <em>Greater Portsmouth Growth Corp. </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 34, 37. Second, use of language which is \u201c \u2018in the nature of a persuasive argument in favor of or against the issue***\u2019 \u201d is prohibited. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 473, 474-475. And, third, \u201cthe determinative issue* **is whether the cumulative effect of these technical defects [in ballot language] is harmless or fatal to the validity of the ballot.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Williams, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 13, 19; <em>State, ex rel. Commrs. of the Sinking Fund, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Testing the proposed ballot language in light of these criteria, it appears that the same is invalid in two respects. First, use of the word \u201cpresently\u201d in conjunction with the phrase \u201cat no cost to the Ohio taxpayers,\u201d in the second paragraph of the proposed ballot language, creates the clear impression that, if the amendment is adopted, Ohio taxpayers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>will be required to bear some of the cost of providing protection to injured workers. This statement creates more than a mere inference that such will transpire. It is in the nature of an argument against adoption of the amendment. While we are reluctant to read too much into this statement, this court is fully aware that effective arguments can be made as easily by what is said as by what is left unsaid, or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The second prong of relators\u2019 attack is upon the first phrase in the third paragraph of the proposed ballot language: \u201cThis proposed amendment would change the existing nonprofit Ohio workers\u2019 compensation system***.\u201d Respondents urge that \u201c***[t]he ballot language does not state that the proposed amendment would change either the existing state fund or the level of the benefits. It states that it would change the existing system* * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">This language is subject to the same criticisms as the language contained in paragraph two of the proposed ballot language. The clear inference to be garnered from a perusal of the language is that the \u201cnon-profit\u201d system would be changed into something else; presumably, a system that is profit making. To include this language in the ballot is in the nature of an argument and misleads the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">We find, therefore, that the proposed ballot language, as particularly set forth above, is invalid. Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is allowed, and respondents, members of the Ohio Ballot Board, are hereby ordered to reconvene, forthwith, and adopt ballot language which properly describes the proposed constitutional amendment in order that such may appear on the ballot at the forthcoming general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-9\">Celebrezze, C. J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-10\">W. Brown and C. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-11\">William B. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGqH\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. Section 1, Article XVI of the Ohio Constitution places a mandatory duty on the Ohio Ballot Board to prescribe ballot language for constitutional amendments, which \u201c***shall properly identify the substance of the proposal to be voted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>upon.\u201d In addition, this article affords original jurisdiction to this court to hear challenges to the ballot language and further provides that \u201c***ballot language shall not be held invalid unless it is such as to <em>mislead, deceive, </em>or <em>defraud the voters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In light of these constitutional instructions approved by the mandate of the people of Ohio in the election of May 7, 1974,1 cannot hold the proposed ballot language invalid, for it properly identifies the substance of the proposal. The contested language in the proposed amendment that the Ohio workers\u2019 compensation system presently operates at no cost to Ohio taxpayers is factually correct. No appropriations are made by the General Assembly from tax revenues to either the Industrial Commission or the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. The operating costs for these agencies are derived from assessments against employers. See, generally, R. C. 4123.341 and 4123.342. The State Insurance Fund is also maintained with monies derived from assessments against employers. R. C. 4123.29, 4123.30, 4123.34, 4123.35 and 4123.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Likewise, the submitted language that the proposed amendment would change the existing system by requiring the General Assembly to pass laws permitting insurance companies to sell workers\u2019 compensation coverage in Ohio is factually correct. The existing government-based system is in fact non-profit, and, currently, insurance companies are not permitted to provide such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The relators\u2019 argument, while concerned with the factual correctness of this proposed language, concentrates more specifically on the impression that the language creates. Relators contend that the proposed ballot language should be held invalid since it misleads the voters by improperly implying that adoption of the amendment will both increase taxes and cause the system to be transformed into a \u201cprofit-making enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">This court has, however, previously recognized that the <em>possible impression </em>which ballot language may create in the minds of the voters is not a sufficient basis to invalidate the language. <em>State, ex rel. Commrs. of Sinking Fund, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 71. This court should heed the admonition of the writer and noted historian George Bancroft that \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>is no end to the difficulty in choosing language which will awaken in the reader the very same thought that was in the mind of the writer.\u201d (Cited in <em>State, ex rel. Commrs. of Sinking Fund, </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>at page 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">This court has consistently held that although it might have used different words to describe the amendment, it will not substitute its decision for that of the ballot board so long as the language adopted properly describes the proposed amendment. <em>State, ex rel. Foreman, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 139, at 148-149. For the reasons stated above, it is my opinion that the ballot language properly identifies the substance of the proposal and would allow the voter to identify the proposal on the ballot. The objections made by the relators to the ballot language are through implications and inferences, and are insufficient to support their claim that the language would mislead, deceive, or defraud the voters.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-6\">C. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
