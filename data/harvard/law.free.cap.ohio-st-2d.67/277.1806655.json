Appellants contend, in essence, that the trial court committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>reversible error because the question of whether the tractor trailer is a \u201creasonably discernible object,\u201d for R. C. 4511.21 purposes, is a factual issue that is more appropriately resolved by a jury and not by the court through a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The seminal case on the assured-clear-distance-ahead rule is <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Elmer C. Breuer Transportation Co. </em>(1952), 156 Ohio St. 430, in which this court ruled that a driver has a duty to operate his automobile in a sufficiently careful manner so that the vehicle can be brought to a stop without colliding with a reasonably discernible object located ahead of him in his lane of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In deciding this case, we are mindful of the observation that:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u201cIn most instances the question whether the object with which the collision occurs is reasonably discernible gives little difficulty. <em>A train on a highway crossing or a truck or an automobile on the highway in the driver\u2019s path can be considered reasonably discernible without more evidence than the fact of its presence.***\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>McFadden </em>v. Breuer, <em>supra, </em>at page 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Similarly, in <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Goff-Kirby Co. </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St. 2d 5, we ruled that a jury question as to the discemibility of an object is <em>not </em>presented when reasonable minds could not differ on the issue of the reasonableness of an object\u2019s discemibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Our review of the record in this case compels us to conclude that the trial court correctly entered a directed verdict in appellee\u2019s favor. June 25, 1975, was a clear, dry night. The object that was in appellant\u2019s lane of travel was a 62-foot long white tractor-trailer with red and blue lettering. The tractor-trailer\u2019s headlights and reflectors were in place and operational. The scene was further illuminated by (1) the headlights of the third vehicle, in the northbound lane, that had stopped to the south of appellee\u2019s truck and (2) appellant\u2019s own headlights. Furthermore, despite the fact that the distance from the hill on State Route 60 to the truck was 609 feet, appellant failed to apply his brakes or take other evasive action, even though he had ample opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The foregoing facts, upon which there is no genuine dispute, lead us to conclude that, as a matter of law, appellee\u2019s tractor-trailer was a reasonably discernible object for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of R. C. 4511.21. We note, parenthetically, that appellant has proffered no valid claim of a legal excuse or an emergency. Since, in our judgment, reasonable minds could not disagree on the discernibility of the tractor-trailer, we find that the trial court properly rendered a directed verdict, pursuant to Civ. R. 50, in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">For all these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-7\">Celebrezze, C.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Adh\">dissenting. This court today holds that reasonable minds cannot differ over whether the truck across plaintiffs lane of travel constituted a \u201creasonably discernible object\u201d for purposes of R. C. 4511.21. At the risk of impugning my \u201creasonableness,\u201d I dissent. The very fact that one member of this court disagrees should be sufficient to support a determination that reasonable minds can and do differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The collision here occurred on a moonless night on a hilly stretch of a two-lane road unilluminated by street lighting. Plaintiff drove his vehicle over the crest of a hill heading south, into the lights of a northbound vehicle which were shining <em>under </em>the tank trailer jackknifed across the road. These lights of the northbound vehicle gave an appearance and impression that there was no truck or discernible object in plaintiffs lane of travel. Plaintiff proceeded to drive into and under the truck, because of the foregoing lack of discernibility, causing serious injuries to himself and his seven children passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Given these peculiar circumstances, I am convinced reasonable minds <em>could </em>differ over whether plaintiff breached any duty when failing to discern the truck in his lane of travel. Whether plaintiff violated R. C. 4511.21, Ohio\u2019s assured-clear-distance-ahead statute, is, to this reasonable mind, a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Instead of being support for a directed verdict for defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>dant in the case <em>subjudice, </em>the cited seminal case <em>o\u00ed McFadden </em>v. <em>Elmer C. Breuer Transportation Co. </em>(1952), 156 Ohio St. 430, supports the plaintiffs position that a jury issue exists. In <em>McFadden </em>whether a roll of steel, 34 inches in height, 3 feet 11 inches in diameter, in the path of plaintiffs decedent\u2019s automobile was a \u201creasonably discernible object\u201d this court determined to be a jury question, as demonstrated by paragraph two of the syllabus in that case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The decision of this court today is an unwarranted and regrettable retreat from <em>McFadden.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b307-5\">W. Brown and Holmes, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\"> Paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>McFadden </em>holds:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u201cWhere in an action for wrongful death of the operator of an automobile which collided with a roll of steel, 34 inches in height, 3 feet, 11 inches in diameter and weighing over 13,000 pounds, which dropped from defendant\u2019s truck, which was going in the opposite direction, into the path of the operator of the automobile, the defendant truck owner admits negligence proximately contributing to the collision but asserts as a defense that the operator of the automobile was guilty of contributory negligence in that he violated the provision of Section 6307-21, General Code, commonly referred to as the assured-clear-distance-ahead rule, the burden is upon the defendant, in order to make a <em>prima fade </em>case of such contributory negligence, to present substantial evidence (a) that the object with which such operator\u2019s vehicle collided had been in his path or lane of travel before the collision at a sufficient distance ahead of him to have made it possible for him, in the exercise of ordinary care, to stop such vehicle and avoid a collision, and (b) that such object was a reasonably discernible one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The concluding part of the opinion in <em>McFadden, </em>at page 443, reveals that a jury question existed:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u201c***The trial court apparently did consider this jury question and decided it in favor of the plaintiff. As there was ample evidence to support such decision upon the facts as to discemibility, the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff was correct and must remain in effect. The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the judgment of the trial court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
