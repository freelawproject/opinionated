Code 4901:1-11-01 (D). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In answering this question, we are mindful of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>that appellant, pursuant to R. C. 4909.191 (C),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has the burden of demonstrating that its costs are fair, just and reasonable. It should also be noted that this court will not disturb the findings and order of the commission unless it appears from the record that such findings and order are manifestly against the weight of the evidence and are so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension or mistake or willful disregard of duty. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 403, paragraph eight of the syllabus, certiorari denied 423 U. S. 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">R. C. 4909.191 (D)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> empowers the commission to order a customer refund if a utility\u2019s rates result from, <em>inter alia: </em>errors, imprudent or unreasonable fuel procurement policies and practices, or such other practices, policies, and factors as the commission considers appropriate. We have reviewed the entire record in this case and conclude that the commission\u2019s order is amply supported by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Initially, the record demonstrates that, whether inadvertently or otherwise, appellant paid NACCO an amount in ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>cess of the $1,644 per ton profit that was agreed upon in the interim agreement. Despite the fact that appellant evidently believed that the $1,644 figure <em>included, </em>the 23.4 cents per ton profit, the evidence proves that appellant paid NACCO $1,644 per ton <em>and </em>an additional 23.4 cents per ton. In effect, appellant tendered a double profit payment to NACCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Secondly, there is simply no question, based on this record, that appellant paid NACCO for capital improvements which NACCO failed to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In essence, then, appellant (1) paid NACCO more than NACCO was due and (2) paid NACCO for structural improvements that never materialized. Hence, the commission correctly concluded that these overpayments were made in contravention of R. C. 4909.191 (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We note, significantly, that much of the evidence upon which the commission relied in making its findings and order was evidence directly supplied by appellant itself, through its own audits, investigations, studies and witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">We categorically reject appellant\u2019s contention that it is entitled to recover its <em>actual </em>fuel cost expenditures. R. C. 4909.191 (C) unambiguously entitles appellant to fair, just and reasonable costs. Appellant\u2019s \u201cactual cost\u201d theory, if pursued to its logical conclusion, would enable a utility and a supplier to contract for fuel at disproportionately inflatedprices and pass these artificial costs along to the customers. This we refuse to legitimatize. As this court recently and unanimously stated in <em>Ohio Power Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 342, 344:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\u201c* * * Fuel adjustment clauses are not and may not be permitted to become a carte-blanche authorization to an electric utility to pass through to its tariff customers expenses other than fuel costs fairly attributable to the production of the service to those customers. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">\u201cWe perceive that the requirement of fairness which compels adjustment in rates to compensate utilities for escalating fuel costs also compels retrospective reconciliation to exclude charges identifiably resulting from unreasonable computations or inclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Finally, we are unable to find\u2014and are unwilling to create \u2014precedent establishing the proposition that the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>was under a duty to defer its proceedings and order until appellant and NACCO resolved their contractual dispute, either through private negotiation or litigation. We note, parenthetically, that, while the commission issued its order on July 9, 1980, the appellant\u2019s litigation with NACCO, in the Court of Common Pleas of Belmont County, did not commence until September of 1980, approximately five months after the commission\u2019s hearings concluded and two months after the issuance of the commission\u2019s order. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the commission and this court recognize that appellant has considerable discretion in pursuing its legal rights against NACCO, we do not believe that the customers\u2019 right to a refund of unjustifiable fuel charges is contingent on the ultimate disposition of the NACCO claim. In our judgment, the critical consideration in cases of this nature is the customers\u2019 right to adequate utility service and facilities at just and reasonable rates. See, <em>e.g., C </em>&amp; <em>SOE </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we find that appellant\u2019s costs resulting from the interim agreement with NACCO are not includable fuel costs. The commission correctly concluded that the charges resulting therefrom were not fair, just and reasonable. These conclusions are consistent with the manifest weight of the evidence and amply supported by the record. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm., supra. </em>Accordingly, the order of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-8\">Celebrezze, C. J., W.
