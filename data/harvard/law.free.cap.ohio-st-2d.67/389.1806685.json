The decision as to whether a party is taken by surprise by the testimony of its hostile witness is a decision that is entrusted to the broad, sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Minneker, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Duff </em>(C.A. 6,1964), 332 F. 2d 702. We have examined the record in this case and agree with the finding of the trial court and the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the state was surprised by McGhee\u2019s trial testimony. The courts below correctly decided that the state had a right to believe that McGhee would not willfully contradict, under oath, his prior grand jury testimony, thus subjecting himself to a potential perjury charge. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring McGhee to be a hostile witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">As the transcript demonstrates, McGhee\u2019s trial testimony differed radically and materially from his prior testimony before the grand jury. The prosecutor, in reading McGhee\u2019s grand jury testimony to him, did so for the purpose of affording him ample opportunity to correct his mistakes or omissions. It is imperative to note that the prosecutor did not, in refreshing McGhee\u2019s recollection, offer the grand jury testimony as substantive evidence of appellee\u2019s guilt or for the purpose of impeaching the witness. <em>Stated differently, the grand jury testimony was employed not for the purpose of proving that appellee forged a check or received stolen property, but, rather, for the purpose of refreshing McGhee\u2019s memory. </em>As this court stated in <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>State </em>(1888), 46 Ohio St. 320, 323:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201c***The recollection of the witness may be so refreshed by directing his attention to a former conversation or declaration, as to cause him promptly to correct his testimony or explain the apparent inconsistency. For this purpose such examination may afford valuable aid in judicial investigation; and, if it be competent at all for that purpose, the reason for admitting it would seem to require, that the examination should be allowed to extend so far as to permit the former statements to be repeated to the witness, and inquiry to be made of him concerning them; for the repetition of the statement itself, referring to the circumstances of its utterance, would be the most likely means of awakening the recollection of the witness, enabling him to recall the facts, satisfy him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>his mistake, and induce a correction or explanation. Or, if the witness be a perverse or false one, such examination may serve to probe his conscience, and move him to relent and speak the truth. We think it a reasonable rule, that a party who calls a witness, and is taken by surprise by his unexpected adverse testimony, may be permitted to interrogate him in respect to declarations and statements previously made by him which are inconsistent with his testimony, for the purpose of refreshing his recollection and inducing him to correct his testimony, or explain his apparent inconsistency, and for such purpose his previous declarations may be repeated to him; and he may be called upon to say whether they were made by him.\u201d Our reading of the trial transcript<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> compels us to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that the prosecution properly directed McGhee\u2019s attention to his prior, conflicting grand jury testimony for the purpose of refreshing McGhee\u2019s recollection and inducing him to explain the apparent inconsistencies between his trial testimony and his grand jury testimony. We also observe, parenthetically, that there is no indication in the record that defense counsel requested a limiting instruction from the court in order to explain to the jury the purpose for which this grand jury testimony was being used. Thus, through this point in the trial, the prosecutor\u2019s examination of McGhee was, in light of all the factors, routine and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">However, the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to call, as a witness, the court reporter who had transcribed McGhee\u2019s grand jury testimony and in permitting her to read, into evidence, the identical portion of the grand jury testimony that the prosecutor had used in attempting to refresh McGhee\u2019s recollection. While it is beyond our purview to second-guess prosecution strategy, we are unable to understand the tactical rationale of calling the reporter as a witness. Using another witness, like the reporter, to read McGhee\u2019s grand jury testimony into evidence to prove his inconsistent statements violates the principle of not impeaching one\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>witness, as established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dick </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Minneker, supra; State </em>v. <em>Duffy, supra; Hurley </em>v. <em>State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Conceding that the court reporter\u2019s testimony was erroneously allowed, the focal point of this case then becomes whether such error was prejudicial to appellee. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 18; <em>State </em>v. <em>Eubank </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 183; <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 223; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 391; <em>State </em>v. <em>Abrams </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">It must be emphasized that the court reporter read the identical portion of the grand jury testimony that the prosecutor had used in attempting to refresh McGhee\u2019s recollection. Thus, the jury had already heard this grand jury testimony by the time the court reporter repeated it. While, as previously indicated, allowing the court reporter to testify in this fashion was erroneous, we are unable to discern any harm to appellee\u2019s cause from the rote repetition of grand jury testimony with which the jurors were already familiar. Thus, the court reporter\u2019s testimony added nothing prejudicial to the record. Consequently, under the unique facts of the case at bar, we conclude that the admission of the court reporter\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We summarily reject appellee\u2019s contention that the use of McGhee\u2019s grand jury testimony violates his constitutional right to confront his accusers. A careful reading of the Confrontation Clause cases from this and other courts reveals that a constitutional issue is normally only raised when the prior testimony or statement of an unavailable witness is used at a subsequent trial as substantive evidence of guilt of a defendant. See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U. S. 56 (admission at defendant\u2019s prosecution of testimony of unavailable witness given at defendant\u2019s preliminary hearing under questioning of defense counsel, held not violative of Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause). See, also, <em>California </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1970), 399 U. S. 149; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968), 390 U. S. 719; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madison </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 322. The case at bar is readily distinguishable from the foregoing precedent because (1) McGhee was available and testified at the trial, and (2) his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>grand jury testimony, as previously discussed, was principally used to refresh his recollection and not used as substantive evidence of appellee\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">A case like this compels us to make, in conclusion, several observations. First, one reason we sanction the prosecutor\u2019s use of the grand jury testimony to refresh McGhee\u2019s recollection is because this tactic, as articulated in <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>is designed to elicit fully the facts material to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Secondly, to tolerate the chicanery of McGhee in this case<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is an affront not only to the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to enforce the law, but also to the people of Ohio, whom the prosecutor represents. To affirm the Court of Appeals in this case would be to legitimatize one more headwind to effective law enforcement. This we refuse to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">As Justice Cardozo so perceptively stated in <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U. S. 97, 122: \u201c***But justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained til it is narrowed to a filament. We are to keep the balance true.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u201c*** There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into contempt\u2014that discredit will even touch the great immunities assured by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014if gossamer possibilities of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience to local law, and set the guilty free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-9\">Celebrezze, C.

McGhee testified at trial and was subject to cross-examination by defense counsel. What follows is the extent of that cross-examination by both defense attorneys:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\n<em>\u201cCross Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\n<em>\u201cBy Mr. Bennington:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u201cQ.

S. 149, 157-158:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">\u201cOur own decisions seem to have recognized at an early date that it is this literal right to \u2018confront\u2019 the witness at the time of trial that forms the core of the values furthered by the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">\u201c \u2018The primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, such as were sometimes admitted in civil cases, being used against the prisoner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\u2019 <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U. S. 237, 242-243 (1895).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">Clearly, appellee had the opportunity to confront McGhee at the trial. The use which defense counsel made of this confrontation is, of course, a matter of trial strategy. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(C.A. 10,1969), 409 F. 2d 611, 613. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 191, 199 (Celebrezze, C. J., dissenting), reversed <em>sub nom, Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U. S. 56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b422-14\"> In his grand jury testimony, McGhee implicated the Diehl brother. However, in his trial testimony, McGhee implicated, instead, a Mr. Don Engle, who had been killed in a barroom fight and thus, conveniently was unavailable to corroborate or deny this story.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b422-12\">Stephenson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">dissenting. I fully concur in the majority opinion with respect to the conclusions therein that the introduction of the grand jury testimony of McGhee through testimony of the court reporter who recorded the grand jury proceedings was error, but not a violation of appellee\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. However, I am unable to join in the further conclusion that the error was harmless and, hence, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">The rule in effect when this cause was tried is succinctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dick </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 162, 165, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThis court has long adhered to the principle that \u2018when taken by surprise by the adverse testimony of its own witness, .. . the state may interrogate such witness concerning his prior inconsistent. . . statement... for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness, <em>but not for the purpose of offering substantive evidence against the accused.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 16, 17. See <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>State </em>(1888), 46 Ohio St. 320, 322; <em>State </em>v. <em>Minneker </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 155.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">My analysis of the record differs from that set forth in the majority opinion in that I am persuaded the state, and in all probability the jury, improperly utilized the grand jury testimony of McGhee through the hearsay testimony of the grand jury reporter, not only as direct impeaching evidence, but as substantive testimonial evidence of appellee\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The trial court gave no instruction, either at the time of admission of the testimony of the grand jury reporter or in the general charge, limiting the use of such testimony for impeachment purposes only.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record tends to establish that the court itself viewed the testimony as substantive evidence in that, in response to a motion for acquittal by counsel for appellee\u2019s brother and co-defendant at the end of the state\u2019s case upon the basis that the evidence was circumstantial and insufficient, the court stated, \u201cIf that was the only thing, I would direct, but you have got the testimony of McGhee. Overruled.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Since the in-court testimony of McGhee was exculpatory as to both defendants, \u201cthe testimony of McGhee\u201d necessarily refers to his testimony before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">That the prosecution utilized the court reporter\u2019s testimony as substantive evidence, and urged its acceptance by the jury as evidence of appellee\u2019s guilt, is demonstrable by the following excerpts from the state\u2019s closing argument: \u201cNow, all the pieces fit together. Danny Diehl had to have a check to make it out and where is Danny Diehl going to get the check? How is he going to get it out of the residence of Mrs. Morris? That check didn\u2019t fly. It had to come from that residence to him, and I submit to you his brother was the one that was working in there and his brother was the one that had the access to it <em>and his brother is the one that Benny McGhee says gave him the check.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Again, in final closing argument by the state and in response to a defense argument that one Scarborough who was with William Diehl was in the Morris home and could have taken the check which McGhee in his in-court testimony stated he found in an auto parts store, the state argued as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AXoq\">\u201cIf you want to believe that story, that is your prerogative, but it doesn\u2019t hold water. It doesn\u2019t hold water at all. <em>In fact, the testimony of Mr. McGhee, as he gave it to the Grand Jury, holds water very well. He told you there were three people, him and two others, and he told you who those two people were and that was verified by Mr. Bangart. </em>When he gets on the stand here, he says only two and one of them is a dead guy and the dead guy filled it in, which is in conflict with your expert testimony that says this man filled it in.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take all of the evidence we presented you together. <em>You have got to take Benny McGhee\u2019s testimony. </em>You\u2019ve got to take the handwriting. You\u2019ve got to take the fact that the check was stolen in a place that he was working. No one piece of evidence will stand on its own, but just as in the law of large numbers, 12 points make the case. In this case, all the evidence we have combined is sufficient to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt, which is our requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In its instructions to the jury the court gave a standard evidence instruction which provided, <em>inter alia, \u201cEvidence is all of the testimony received from the witnesses during the trial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and the exhibits which you will have with you m the jury room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The Court of Appeals considered and rejected the question of whether the error was harmless in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe evidence against appellant was far from overwhelming and much of the evidence presented was circumstantial. In light of the fact that both appellant and his brother, William Diehl, were tried together, the admission of Benjamin McGhee\u2019s earlier testimony before the grand jury that he (McGhee) had obtained the check in question from William Diehl, that both William and Danny Diehl (appellant) were with him when he cashed the check and that William Diehl shared in the proceeds from the check was particularly damaging, especially in view of the testimony establishing a close association among appellant, his brother (William Diehl) and Benjamin McGhee. We cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that had the grand jury testimony of Benjamin McGhee not been erroneously admitted, the jury would nevertheless have reached the same conclusion and found appellant guilty of the offenses charged. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">I agree with the above analysis. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the error is non-constitutional in character so the strict standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 18, need not be applied and that a lesser standard of whether substantial evidence exists to support the guilty verdict without such erroneous evidence applies, see <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App. 2d 335; Crim. R. 33(E)(3); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cowans </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 96, even under such standard the error is not, in my view, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-8\">P. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> As to the use for impeachment, and also substantive evidence, of prior inconsistent statements of a witness, made under oath in a prior proceeding, permitted by the Ohio Rules of Evidence, effective July 1, 1980, see Evid. R. 801(D)(1)(a), and the limitation therein respecting the right of cross-examination at the time such prior inconsistent statement was made. In essence, as noted in the staff note to such rule, grand jury testimony still cannot be utilized as substantive evidence against a defendant because of the lack of the right of cross-examination of the witness before the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\"> In allowing the interrogation of one\u2019s own witness, when taken by surprise by unfavorable and unexpected testimony, as to declarations and statements previously made by the witness, the opposite party is entitled to an instruction \u201cthat such previous contradictory testimony is not to be considered as evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Duffy </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 16, 23. However, appellee herein cannot be penalized for failure to request a limiting instruction with respect to the court reporter\u2019s testimony since it was not admissible for <em>any </em>purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
