Were the question simply one of which bid was lowest, the answer would be clear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants, however, were not required to award the contract to the lowest bidder; rather, they were empowered to make a qualitative determination as to which bid was both lowest and \u201cbest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In reaching their decision, as to which bid was lowest and best, appellants were required by ordinance to consider only the bidder\u2019s affirmative action program and its \u201cprobable effectiveness.\u201d Appellants had \u201cno problems\u201d with the affirmative action programs of either Fryman-Kuck or Schroeder. Additionally, it was acknowledged that both bidders were capable of performing the contract in an acceptable manner. Thus, in these important areas, the qualifications of Fryman-Kuck and Schroeder were identical. The contractors differed in only one respect\u2014Schroeder was a \u201cresident\u201d of the city of Dayton, whereas Fryman-Kuck was not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Appellants argue that, in the exercise of their sound discretion, they were entitled to consider and give controlling weight to the fact that Schroeder was a city \u201cresident.\u201d Appellants, through the city deputy director of law, advanced, as the rationale for favoring \u201cresident\u201d bidders, the assertion that such bidders offered \u201cyear-round employment with the city and* * * [paid] city income and property taxes. The permanent tax base provided by companies situated within the city is an essential element in the city\u2019s ability to provide necessary municipal services to its citizens.\u201d In support of this contention, the director of the city\u2019s department of urban development stated that it was one of the city\u2019s \u201cpremier policies\u201d to encourage businesses to locate within the city and, in furtherance of this policy, appellants awarded contracts to businesses which did locate within the city. The Court of Appeals held that utilization of the unannounced criterion of residency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>constituted an abuse of discretion. For the reasons set forth below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201cThe meaning of the term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019**\u2019\u201cconnotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude***.\u201d <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>Custer </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 448, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Conner </em>v. <em>Conner </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 85; <em>Rohde </em>v. <em>Farmer </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 82; and <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 151. \u201cArbitrary\u201d means \u201cwithout adequate determining principle; ***not governed by any fixed rules or standard.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.). \u201cUnreasonable\u201d means \u201cirrational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the facts of the instant cause, we find appellants\u2019 actions to have been both arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Despite the purported primacy of the policy to prefer resident bidders, appellants did not announce or disclose the existence of such policy to the bidders <em>until after the bids were opened. </em>It appears, therefore, that appellants made a conscious decision to withhold this pertinent information until after they had actual knowledge of the amounts of the bids. In effect, appellants modified their requirements without notice. This action tended to undermine the integrity of the competitive bidding process. See <em>Boger Contracting Corp. </em>v. <em>Board </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App. 2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Moreover, the record demonstrates no logical nexus between appellants\u2019 goal of increasing the city\u2019s tax base and their decision to award the contract to Schroeder. On the state of the record, it is impossible for appellants to have reached any reasonable conclusion that would justify the deference shown Schroeder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The arbitrary nature of appellants\u2019 decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>is illustrated by the following testimony presented at the hearing on the injunction:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u201c[Appellants\u2019 counsel Mr. Randolph] Q. Now here again I might be engaging in speculation but, or asking you to, when you say to award contracts to business, that is not in every circumstance, is it?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u201c[Schierloh] A. No it\u2019s not.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u201c[Objection.] ***</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201cMR. RANDOLPH: The point is, your honor, the recommendation was made by the department director here and we would not want to leave the court with the impression that he always recommends the contract go to the local bidder and the question is if the difference in the award were, say ten percent, what his recommendation would be, would his recommendation be the same?* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u201c[Schierloh] A. Well if you, if the items have been entered and as we state, the difference is approximately one half of one percent difference, we\u2019d recommend we go this way. <em>If the difference were many percentages greater than that, I would not say we at all could recommend that to the department or City Manager for approval, in fact, we have not in the past done that.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The evil here is not necessarily that \u201cresident\u201d bidders are preferred but that there are absolutely no guidelines or established standards for deciding by how \u201cmany percentages\u201d a bid may exceed the lowest bid and yet still qualify as the \u201clowest and best\u201d bid. Absent such standards, the bidding process becomes an uncharted desert, without landmarks or guideposts, and subject to a city official\u2019s shifting definition of what constitutes \u201cmany percentages.\u201d Neither contractors nor the public are well served by such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">While municipal governing bodies are necessarily vested with wide discretion, such discretion is neither unlimited nor unbridled. The presence of standards against which such discretion may be tested is essential; otherwise, the term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d would be meaningless. In its opinion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>trial court stated that: \u201c***[t]he lack of an announced standard and priority of miscellaneous considerations allows unbridled discretion and political favoritism.\u201d We find neither allegation nor proof of political favoritism. However, we do find, due to the lack of announced standards, that appellants\u2019 action in this case was arbitrary. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-6\">Stephenson, P. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b387-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b387-8\">Stephenson, J., of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting for W.

In determining which is the lowest and best bid, the director shall give consideration to the affirmative action program submitted in accordance with \u00a7 35.16 with particular attention to the probable effectiveness of such program in insuring minority group representation in all trades and all phases of the bidder\u2019s operation. The director shall further give consideration to whether the bidder is a minority-owned firm, and the number of minority persons such bidder employs.***\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\"> This is true notwithstanding the opinion of the appellants that the difference between the bids was \u201cinsubstantial\u201d or, as stated by the trial court, that the bids were \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> Fryman-Kuck General Contractors, Inc., listed its \u201c[h]ome office address\u201d as Brookville, Ohio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> Schierloh\u2019s testimony on this point demonstrates the absence of any logical or rational connection between the espoused purposes for awarding contracts to \u201cresident\u201d bidders and the decision to award the contract in question to Schroeder. Schierloh stated, in part, that when \u201cmaking a determination\u201d based upon \u201ccity residency,\u201d the city considers \u201cthe location of the home office* * *and the fact there is a work force employed there within the city full time, year round office personnel and staff, etc.\u201d It is difficult to determine from what source the appellants derived these \u201cfacts\u201d regarding Schroeder\u2019s work force, since Schierloh also testified that it was beyond the city\u2019s \u201cability or discretion\u201d to determine the residency of the bidder\u2019s employees, nor did Schierloh speak with Schroeder or visit its offices to ascertain whether there was a full-time, \u201cyear round\u201d staff employed. It further appears that the only source for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Sehierloh\u2019s opinion that Schroeder was a \u201cresident\u201d of the city, and the basis for his recommendation, was Schroeder\u2019s \u201c[h]ome office address\u201d as reflected on the \u201cbidder\u2019s proposal\u201d and the fact that Schierloh had driven by this address \u201cmany times\u201d and observed the building located at that address.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b387-9\">Celebrezze, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcG\">dissenting. Since, in my estimation, relator has failed to establish his standing to even argue the merits of whether the city commission abused its discretion in awarding the contract to Leo B. Schroeder, Inc., I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The majority opinion, conveniently, omits the critical consideration in this case\u2014that Scandrick, the relator, is an employee of Fryman-Kuck, the unsuccessful bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">However, since relator has characterized his suit as a taxpayers\u2019 action, pursuant to R. C. 733.56 through 733.59, the threshold issue is what harm, if any, has been done to the <em>public </em>by the awarding of the contract to Leo B. Schroeder, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">A plaintiff, in bringing a taxpayers\u2019 action, is exercising a privilege which is only exercisable in a public capacity. <em>Trustees of Prairie Twp. </em>v. <em>Garver </em>(1931), 41 Ohio App. 232. A taxpayers\u2019 action which is brought for the sole purpose of serving the private interest of another person cannot be maintained. It is beyond dispute that an Ohio court will not grant relief to a taxpayer who is a mere figurehead for an unsuccessful bidder. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1913), 15 N.P. (N.S.) 297. See, generally, <em>State, ex rel. Nimon, </em>v. <em>Village of Springdale </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 1; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Ohio Building Authority </em>(1975), 74 Ohio Op. 2d 184 (Holmes, J.). Indeed, R. C. 733.56 through 733.59 only contemplate a taxpayers\u2019 action in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>face of the misapplication of public funds, abuse of corporate powers, fraud, or corruption, elements which are clearly inapplicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Applying the foregoing principles to the facts <em>sub judice, </em>it is immediately evident that relator is not suing under the guise of the public-spirited citizen-watchdog, but rather, as a figurehead for the unsuccessful bidder who is now attempting to secure collateral review of the bidding process. This we should refuse to legitimatize. Conspicuous by its. absence from relator\u2019s complaint and brief are allegations of public harm, resulting from the misapplication of public funds, abuse of corporate powers, fraud, or corruption. Relator\u2019s only claim is that Fryman-Kuck was adversely affected by the contracting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">This court has recently and emphatically stated that we do not sit as a super board of zoning appeals. <em>Peachtree Development Co. </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 345; see <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 488; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 93. Yet the majority\u2019s philosophy will thrust this court into the role of a super board of contract appeals, reviewing, clause by clause, the provisions of the thousands of contracts which are let by the public bodies of this state every year. The majority\u2019s approach threatens to mature into a judicial Midas, roaming through all contracts and turning everything that it touches into an actionable taxpayers\u2019 claim. For me, this lack of standing is too high a hurdle to leap and, accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
