Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuP\">The initial question before this court is whether R. C. Chapter 119, the Administrative Procedure Act, may be invoked to appeal the establishment of a bank branch. Under R. C. 1111.02, no bank branch may be established without the prior approval of that branch by the Superintendent of Banks. The second question to be decided is whether a bank operating in the community for which the branch in question was approved is a proper party to pursue such an appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">R. C. 119.12 controls the right to appeal administrative adjudications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second paragraph of that section gives a right to appeal \u201cany order\u201d to the Franklin County common pleas court other than orders which, <em>inter alia, </em>either deny admission to an examination or deny an applicant his request for a license. By framing the right in terms allowing the appeal of \u201cany order,\u201d the General Assmebly evidenced an intent to grant an extensive right of review under R. C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">However, the action appealed from must be an order of an \u201cagency,\u201d as that term is defined in R. C. 119.01(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the Superintendent of Banks is not one of the enumerated authorities specifically made subject to appeals under R. C. Chapter 119, an appeal may be taken under R. C. 119.12 from an order of any state authority which constitutes an exercise of its \u201clicensing functions.\u201d Therefore, the basic issue to be decided is whether the approval of a bank branch by the Superintendent of Banks is an exercise of the \u201clicensing function\u201d so as to make this an appealable order of an \u201cagency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASU\">An examination of the language in R. C. Chapter 1111 fails to disclose any mention of the terms \u201clicense,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d \u201ccertificate,\u201d \u201ccommission\u201d or \u201ccharter.\u201d* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, R. C. 1111.02(E) refers to \u201capproval\u201d or \u201cdisapproval,\u201d and R. C. 1111.03 to \u201cthe consent of the superintendent of banks.\u201d The use of these terms caused the lower courts to conclude that the order involved here was not an exercise of the \u201clicensing function.\u201d Certainly, if the General Assembly had failed to elaborate on what the process for \u201capproval\u201d or \u201cconsent\u201d should be, we would agree that no \u201clicense\u201d by an \u201cagency\u201d was contemplated. <em>Home Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Boesch </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">However, the General Assembly has detailed the procedure necessary for the establishment of a bank branch. R. C. 1111.02(A) sets forth the procedure for submitting an application for a branch bank.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Division (B) of that section requires notice to be given to interested parties and a thorough investigation by the superintendent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Division (C) requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>superintendent to issue preliminary findings and a summary of the information submitted by the applicant relating to its lending record.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Division (D) requires that the superintendent hold a public hearing whenever \u201cany person\u201d timely files written objection to the application, and allows \u201cany person\u201d to present testimony at such hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Division (E) mandates action by the superintendent \u201cas promptly as possible,\u201d and in any event, within 90 days following filing of the application, unless the applicant consents in writing to an extension of time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Divisions (F), (G), and (H) set out specific quantitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>and qualitative considerations the superintendent is required to address, referring, <em>inter </em>alia, to R. C. 1111.03.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Clearly, the thrust of R. C. 1111.02 and 1111.03 is to guarantee a full and fair adjudication of rights and interests before any bank branch can be established. This court long ago defined \"license\u201d as \"permission granted by some competent authority to do an act which, without such permission, would be illegal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hipp </em>(1882), 38 Ohio St. 199, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Despite the absence of the specific term \u201clicensee\u201d or its equivalent in R. C. Chapter 1111, the action of the superintendent approving a bank branch constitutes an \u201cexercise of the licensing function.\u201d Any other interpretation, given the elaborate substantive considerations and procedural rights spelled out in the statute, would sacrifice substance for form. <em>Clermont National Bank </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1970), 27 Ohio App. 2d 91. By establishing such specific criteria for approval of bank branches, the General Assembly implied a right to judicial review of the decision making process. Otherwise, there could be no assurance it was accomplished in a proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">However, we need not rely on any implied right to review of the superintendent\u2019s decisions. The original statutory language providing for approval of bank branch applications included a right to appeal from disapprovals of such applications.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal provision was eliminated by the 1953 code revision at the same time changes were made to the Administrative Procedure Act excluding certain activities of the Superintendent of Banks from the definition of \u201cagency.\u201d None of these excluded acts involved approval of bank branches. See footnote 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">By failing to include this function in the list of excluded activities, the General Assembly intended both to preserve the right to appeal disapprovals of bank branch applications, and to enlarge that right to include all the procedural safeguards of a R. C. Chapter 119 appeal. Such a right necessarily includes approvals of bank branch applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Therefore, the action of the Superintendent of Banks approving or disapproving a branch bank application is an exercise of the licensing function by an agency, entitling \u201cany party adversely affected\u201d by the action to appeal pursuant to R. C. 119.12. The General Assembly intended this quasi-judicial act to be subject to review. <em>Fortner </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1970), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>22 Ohio St. 2d 13, paragraph one of the syllabus. The reviewing court must decide whether the order is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence, and is in accordance with law. <em>Ohio Real Estate Comm. </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1962), 90 Ohio Law Abs. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Having concluded that appeal is appropriate under R. C. Chapter 119, we next consider whether appellant is a proper party to pursue such an appeal. R. C. 119.12 provides for appeal by \u201c[a]ny party adversely affected\u201d by an order of an agency issued pursuant to its licensing function. Appellant received notice of this branch application pursuant to R. C. 1111.02, filed objections to the superintendent\u2019s findings, participated in a hearing on the matter, and was adversely affected by the superintendent\u2019s approval of the application. The interests of appellant are bound together intimately with those of the applicant bank, such that the General Assembly saw fit to grant an absolute right to participate in the licensing process to all banks located within the county, or within 15 miles, of the proposed branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">R. C. 119.01(G) defines \u201cparty\u201d as \u201cthe person whose interests are the subject of an adjudication by an agency.\u201d Appellee urges that use of the term \u201cparty,\u201d as opposed to \u201cperson,\u201d adversely affected, denies appellant standing to appeal. This court will not infer an illogical definition of \u201cparty\u201d in this context. Certainly, if the only person entitled to appeal the approval of a bank branch is the bank granted the right, then no effective review exists. We will not lightly infer preclusion of judicial review of an administrative action. <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1970), 397 U. S. 159, 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Accordingly, we hold that appellant was a \u201cparty adversely affected\u201d by the superintendent\u2019s decision, and entitled to appeal that decision. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-8\">P.

Counsel for appellee has appropriately pointed out my dissent in <em>Clermont National Bank </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1970), 27 Ohio App. 2d 91,110.1 dissented upon the basis that within the context of the legislative scheme in effect at that time for the establishment of branch banks, no right of hearing was afforded objecting established banks in the area. It was, therefore, my conclusion that an objecting bank would not qualify as a \u201cparty\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act, even though I would have conceded that such an objecting bank may have been adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">However, in 1979, amendments were made to the chapter of law relating to bank branching, the most important of which, for purposes of this discussion, were the amendments to R. C. 1111.02 which now, under subsection (D) thereof, the Superintendent of Banks is mandated to hold public hearings whenever he receives from any person, including of course any established banks in the area, a written objection to the superintendent\u2019s preliminary findings issued pursuant to the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">My concurrence, here, is not upon the basis that the appellant\u2019s counsel has convinced me of the error of my ways as espoused in <em>Clermont, </em>but is based upon my view that the General Assembly has in essence done that which I suggested in <em>Clermont </em>in order to render the objecting bank a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">What with the ever-growing banking industry within this state, and the laws enacted permitting statewide branching of banks, the General Assembly has recognized the desire, if not the right, of established banks in the area to be heard on the question of the determinations of the Superintendent of Banks concerning branches to be located in their areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">These changes in the laws affecting both the allowance of increased branching and the associated rights of existing banks to be heard on such determinations, have now provided to me the missing link to establish the \u201cparty\u201d status of the objecting bank, within the meaning of an R. C. Chapter 119 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Therefore, I concur in the syllabus and the judgment herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Celebrezze, C.

C. 119.01(B) defines license in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201c \u2018License\u2019 means any license, permit, certificate, commission, or charter issued by any agency.***\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Conspicuous by its absence from R. C. Chapter 1111 is any use of the words license, permit, certificate, commission, or charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In <em>Home Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Boesch </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 115, 119, a case dealing with an application for a building and loan association branch office, this court unanimously made the distinction between (1) licensing a building and loan association to <em>commence </em>business, and (2) allowing a building and loan association to <em>expand </em>its business by opening a branch office. As the court specifically ruled, at page 119:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u201cThe superintendent performs a licensing function when he certifies that a building and loan association may commence doing business pursuant to R. C. 1151.03. When he allows an application for a branch office, pursuant to R. C. 1151.05, he allows the association to expand that business in a specific location and no licensing function is involved. The right to commence operations is the subject of the licensing function, and whether the association may operate a branch is ancillary to that right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">I submit that the similarity of the case at bar to <em>Home Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Boesch, supra, </em>requires us to apply, in this instance, the <em>Boesch </em>rationale. Applying the <em>Boesch </em>ruling to the facts <em>sub judice </em>leads to the conclusion that the already-licensed Bank of Elmore Company, in seeking permission to expand by opening a branch office, is not attempting to secure another license. Therefore, since appellant is attempting to challenge a non-licensing action of the Superintendent of Banks, it has no statutory foundation upon which to construct an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Accordingly, I believe that both the trial and appellate courts correctly concluded that appellant\u2019s cause was not an appeal of a licensing function.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-12\">W.
