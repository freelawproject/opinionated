First, the board ruled that the apportionment was not a determination, finding, computation, or order, as those terms are used in R. C. 5717.02; thus, it was stated by the board, the apportionment was not an appealable order. Alternatively, the board reasoned that by virtue of R. C. 5727.47, the apportionment was not a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Addressing first the question of whether the apportionment was an appealable order, we look to R. C. 5717.02, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u201cAppeals from final determinations by the tax commissioner or the commissioner of tax equalization of any preliminary, amended, or final tax assessments, reassessments, valuations, determinations, findings, computations, or orders made by either commissioner may be taken to the board of tax appeals by the taxpayer, by the person to whom notice of the tax assessment, reassessment, valuation, determination, finding, computation, or order by either commissioner is required by law to be given, by the director of budget and management if the revenues affected by such decision would accrue primarily to the state treasury, or by the county auditors of the counties to the undivided general tax funds of which the revenues affected by such decision would primarily accrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Central to answering this question is whether the apportionment which R. C. 5727.21 requires the appellee to make is a determination, finding, computation, or order. We hold that the language used by the General Assembly in R. C. 5717.02 is broad enough to encompass this apportionment. Essentially, the appellee is required to \u201ccompute\u201d or \u201cdetermine\u201d the proportionate share of the value of property to be allocated to each county in which the property is located. This allocation, pursuant to R. C. 5727.21, is to be made according to \u201cthe proportion that the length of the lines of wire owned by the company in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>the county bears to the whole length of the lines of wire in all the counties in the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">However, the board ruled that certain language used in R. C. 5727.47 evidences legislative intent that an apportionment is not an appealable order. R. C. 5727.47 gives public utilities the right to be heard by the Tax Commissioner as to the correctness of any determination, finding, or order after it has been certified to the proper officer. The second paragraph of R. C. 5727.47 requires notice of any application for review filed by a utility to be sent to the county auditor and county treasurer of each county \u201cto which any such determination, finding or apportionment has been certified.\u201d Because the word \u201capportionment\u201d was substituted for \u201corder,\u201d the board reasoned that an apportionment must not be a determination, finding, or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We disagree. The fact that \u201corder\u201d and \u201capportionment\u201d are used interchangeably in R. C. 5727.47 leads to a conclusion opposite to the one reached by the board. This interchanged use demonstrates that the General Assembly intended the concepts to be synonymous. Therefore, we conclude that an apportionment made under R. C. 5727.21 is an appealable order pursuant to R. C. 5717.02.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Next, we must decide whether the apportionment was the final determination of the Tax Commissioner. It has been stated repeatedly that, under R. C. 5717.02, the board has jurisdiction to hear appeals only from final orders. See, <em>e.g., Turner Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 124. The question of finality is raised because R. C. 5727.47<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allows a utility taxpayer to seek redetermination and review by the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Thus, appellee argues that there is no right of appeal to the board unless and until the public utility taxpayer has exercised its right under R. C. 5727.47 for redetermination and review. In support of this argument, appellee relies on <em>Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Michelin Tire Corp., </em>a taxpayer appealed a preliminary assessment to the board. However, the taxpayer had not exercised his right of review and redetermination which was provided for in R. C. 5711.31. In affirming the board\u2019s dismissal of the taxpayer\u2019s appeal, this court held that the preliminary assessment did not become final, for purposes of appeal, until and unless the taxpayer exercised his right of review and redetermination, provided for by R. C. 5711.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Michelin Tire Corp. </em>is distinguishable from the present appeal because, here, the appellant had no right to review and redetermination. The appellant could do nothing to require the appellee to reconsider the apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">That the appellee\u2019s order was final, insofar as it was applicable to this appellant, is further demonstrated by R. C. 5727.23. This section<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires the county auditor, upon receipt of the apportionment from the commissioner, to place the apportioned valuation on the proper tax lists and duplicates. The county auditor has no opportunity to obtain review of any sort by the commissioner. As far as the county auditor is concerned, the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction terminates with the certification required in R. C. 5727.23. The fact that the General Assembly has afforded a public utility taxpayer a right of review to the commissioner should not be the basis for denying an otherwise valid appeal by a county auditor. Consequently, we hold that for purposes of an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, by a county auditor, the commissioner\u2019s determination made pursuant to R. C. 5727.21 is final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>when certified to the county auditor, as required by R. C. 5727.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Based upon the foregoing, we hold that R. C. 5717.02 invests the Board of Tax Appeals with jurisdiction to hear a county auditor\u2019s appeal of the apportionment made by the Tax Commissioner pursuant to R. C. 5727.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-7\">Sweeney, Locher and C.

Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> In ruling that the apportionment was not an appealable order, the board also relied upon <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>Tax Commission </em>(1928), 28 Ohio App. 398. However, a comparison of R. C. 5717.02, set forth above, and G.C. 5611-1, the statute upon which <em>Stanton </em>was based (see 28 Ohio App. at 409), demonstrates that <em>Stanton </em>is of no precedential value to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> The relevant portion of R. C. 5727.47 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u201cAny public utility may be heard by the tax commissioner as to the correctness of any determination, finding, or order of the commissioner after the same has been certified to the proper officer. A copy of such certification shall be mailed to the public utility, and the mailing thereof shall be prima-facie evidence of the receipt of the same by the public utility to which it is addressed. Application for a review and redetermination of any such determination, finding, or order must be filed in writing within thirty days from the date of the mailing of such copy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\"> R.

Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUW\">dissenting. The sole issue presented herein is whether the Board of Tax Appeals erred in its determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the auditor\u2019s appeal of the commissioner\u2019s apportionment order. The majority holds that it did. However, since I find no error, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Basic to my dissent is the fact that the Board of Tax Appeals is a creature of statute\u2014having been created by the General Assembly, the power and authority of the Board of Tax Appeals is limited to that conferred by statute. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 7; <em>Turner Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 124; and <em>Steward </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 547. Therefore, absent an express grant of authority, the Board of Tax Appeals may not exercise jurisdiction in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">While I agree with the majority that, for purposes of R. C. 5727.47, the words \u201corder\u201d and \u201capportionment\u201d are used interchangeably, I do not believe that this finding is dispositive of the issue herein presented. The ultimate question remains: Does R. C. 5717.02 authorize an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals of the commissioner\u2019s apportionment order? I am of the opinion that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">In pertinent part, R. C. 5717.02 states: \u201cAppeals from final determinations by the tax commissioner* **of any preliminary, amended, or final <em>tax </em>assessments, reassessments, valuations, determinations, findings, computations, or orders* * *may be taken to the board of tax appeals* * *.\u201d (Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>phasis added.) The majority holds that the commissioner\u2019s apportionment decision falls within the ambit of R. C. 5717.02 because the commissioner \u201cis required to \u2018compute\u2019 or \u2018determine\u2019 the proportionate share of the value of property to be allocated to each county***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In reaching today\u2019s decision, the majority effectively eradicates the modifying word \u201ctax\u201d from the statute. The General Assembly did not intend that all computations would be appealable; rather, it intended that only the commissioner\u2019s \u201ctax\u201d computations are subject to appeal. In order to qualify as a \u201ctax\u201d computation, the commissioner\u2019s action must relate to the <em>taxable status </em>of the property in question. See <em>Pittsburgh Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 14. Inherent in any determination affecting the taxable status of property is an exercise of some discretion or decision making on the part of the commissioner. Such discretion is clearly absent in this case. Here, the taxable status of the property had already been established, without objection. The commissioner\u2019s action merely divided the value of the property among the appropriate counties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Because I do not believe that the computation involved herein was a \u201ctax\u201d computation, I would affirm the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-7\">Celebrezze, C. J., and W. Brown, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> In R. C. 5727.21, the General Assembly has established a simple and direct formula for apportioning the value of utility property among the counties. In essence, the apportionment is made on a wire-mile basis. The gist of appellant\u2019s complaint is that the commissioner has failed to properly apply the statutory apportionment formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">There are no facts before us from which we can decide this issue; however, it appears, at least facially, that the appellant\u2019s claim has merit. R. C. 5727.21 requires the apportionment to be based upon the \u201clines of wire\u201d owned by the company in the county. In his apportionment order, the commissioner apparently distinguishes between \u201cordinary wire\u201d and \u201ccoaxial cable.\u201d I can see no statutory basis for this distinction\u2014either something is a \u201cline of wire\u201d or it is not. To the extent the commissioner has deviated from the statutory formula, appellant may be entitled to relief. However, I remain firm in my conviction that such relief is by way of mandamus and not by appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
