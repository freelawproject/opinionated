The suit was commenced in April, 1848. The Defendant pleaded the general issue, and the cause was referred and brought to a hearing before the referee on the 4th of August. Upon the hearing, it appeared that one Willham Benedict was jointly interested with the Plaintiff in the profits of the trip when the corn in question was transported. When this fact was disclosed, the Plaintiff\u2019s counsel proposed to amend his declaration by adding the name of Benedict as a Plaintiff. This proposition was declined, but the Defendant\u2019s counsel proposed that the trial should proceed, with liberty to the Plaintiff to make his application for an amendment after the trial should be concluded. The Plaintiff\u2019s counsel declined proceeding with the trial, and moved for an adjournment, to enable Mm to make his motion to amend, which was granted. He now moves for leave to amend his declaration by adding the name of Benedict as a co-plaintiff therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-9\">J. K.

The very terms of the section are sufficient to show that it was the intention <em>offhe </em>framers of the code to endow the court with the most enlarged d\u00bfgcr\u00e9tionary power in granting amendments. The only proper inquiry for the court is whether the amendment proposed will <em>change substantially the cause of action or </em>defence, or if not, whether it will be <em>\u201c infarther anee of justice </em>to allow it. In this case, it cannot be pretended that by adding the name of Benedict as a Plaintiff, the cause of action will be substantially changed. The object of the suit will remain what it was before\u2014the recovery of any sum due from the Defendant for the transportation of a certain quantity of corn\u2014nor will it substantially change the defence. To say that it deprives the Defendant of that branch of his defence which rests upon the non-joinder of Benedict as a party, and that therefore the amendment would materially change the defence, would be, in effect, to declare that no amendment could be made by adding the name of a Plaintiff. In this case, I think, too,. it will be in furtherance of justice to allow the amendment. The motion is therefore granted upon payment of the costs of hearing before the referee to be taxed. The Plaintiff having offered to pay those costs, if the Defendant would consent to the amendment, should not, I think, have costs for resisting this motion. The amendment to \"be made without prejudice to the proceedings before the referee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
