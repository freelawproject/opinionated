The writ of error is void;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">1st. It was allowed to remove a cause from the supreme court, where Conley &amp; Johnson were Plaintiffs in error; whereas it removes a cause from the supreme court where Palmer was Plaintiff in error, and Conley &amp; Johnson, Defendants in error. (Reference to the endorsement of the supreme court commissioner of the allowance and stay of proceedings on the writ, where the title was \u201c <em>Supreme </em>Court\u2014John W. Conley &amp; Wm.
