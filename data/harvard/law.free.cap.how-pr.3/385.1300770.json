If the action is one in which, in case the Defendant makes no defence, judgment may be entered under the <em>first </em>subdivision of the 262d section, then, in no event, can more than $7 be allowed for all the proceedings before notice of trial. On the other hand, if the action be one in which, in case of no defence, application must be made to the court for proper judgment under the <em>second </em>subdivision of the same section, then, in every case in which he recovers costs, the Plaintiff is entitled to $12. The clerk is, therefore, wrong in his construction of the section referred to, and the motion must be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
