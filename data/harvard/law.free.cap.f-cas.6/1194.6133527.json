The claimant objected to the amendments, urging that their effect might be to expose the sureties for the vessel to a greater responsibility than they originally assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-24\">HELD BY TjHE COURT: That such increase is only conjectural as yet. The general rule is that the precise limitations of the obligations of suretyship are not disturbed by collateral arrangements, voluntary or involuntary, between the principals without the assent of the sureties. Motion granted.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b1197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>[NOTE.
