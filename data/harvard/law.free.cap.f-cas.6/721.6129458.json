The indorsement being in full, cannot be struck out at the time of trial.

The bill was regularly protested for non-acceptance, and non-payment. No proof of notice being given, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, on that ground; and because the bill has an indorsement on it, and no proof that the plaintiff had paid the amount to the indorser, or had in any other way become entitled to the bill. As to the second objection, WASHINGTON, Circuit Justice, asked if the plaintiff might not now strike out the indorsement, possession of the bill being prima facie evidence, that the plaintiff had paid the indorser? J. R. Ingersoll and Cbauncey, for the defendant, answered; that if the bill had been indorsed in blank, this might have been done, but not where the indorsement is in full, and cited [Gorgerat v. McCarty] 2 Dali. [2 U. S.] 144; [Steinmetz v. Currey] 1 Dali. [1 U. S.] 234.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b723-12\">[For a prior nonsuit, see Case No. 3,320.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-13\">Shoemaker, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b723-14\">J.
