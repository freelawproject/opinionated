Craigie died in Otter Tail county, in the state of Minnesota, September 8, 1872, leaving real and personal estate, and on petition of Annie McArthur letters of administration were granted to her March 13, 1876, by the probate court of that county. On May 18, 1876, the administratrix filed a petition for a final accounting, and for distribution of the estate, in which she claimed to be the sole heir at law of said James G. Craigie, deceased, and prayed that a decree be entered assigning to and vesting in her all the real and personal property in her hands or otherwise, belonging .to said estate. A citation was issued by the probate court, fixing June 13, 1876, as the day upon which a hearing-would be had of the matters contained in the petition, and notice to all parties interested was ordered to be given by publication in a newspaper, to show cause, on that day,, why the prayer of the petition should not be-granted. Objection was filed in writing, on the day fixed for the hearing, by Barbara Craigie, John Craigie, Charles Craigie, Alexander M. Craigie, Elizabeth Enslie, Ann Clark, and Ellen R. Shephard, and, after the hearing and due consideration of the same, a decree was entered Jume 14, 1876, which, after reciting the proceedings in the administration of the estate, is as follows: \u201cNow, therefore, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the administration of the estate of said James G. Craigie be and the same is hereby concluded, and that the administratrix of said estate be and she is hereby discharged, and that all and singular the property and estate which was of the said James G. Craigie at the time of his death, and the increase thereof, * * * be and the same\u2019 are hereby distributed, assigned to, and vested in the said Annie McArthur as the heir, and sole heir at law, of the said James G.

All the essential elements of a controversy exist. There are parties, and a contest in reference to property, and informal pleadings under which the disputed matters are to be settled by a court. The act of congress authorizes a removal from a court of limited or general jurisdiction, and a controversy in a probate court involving the distribution of an estate between parties who appear and submit to the jurisdiction and litigate therein, is certainly a suit of \u201ca civil nature * * * in equity.\u201d 45 Me. 571; 4 Pa. St. 301; 22 N. <em>Y. </em>421; 20 Minn. 247 [Gil. 220]; 19 Wis. 200. The probate court of the state of Minnesota is a constitutional court of record, with a seal, and regular terms fixed by law. Section 1, art. 6, Const. Minn.; 2 Biss. St. Minn. 739; 1 Biss. St. Minn. p. 672, \u00a7 169. Its decrees, orders, and judgments are binding upon all persons, and the right of appeal is given to the district court, and finally to the supreme court of the state. Pleadings are not necessary, but all applications made to the court orally or in writing are embodied in its records. At the time when the proceedings in that court assume the form of a controversy between parties, and the'conditions requisite exist, the suit is removable. .Gaines v. Fuentes,' 92 U. S. 14. When, in answer to a notice of the hearing of the matters to be determined in the probate court,' the p\u00e9titioners filed their objection and instituted a contest, the right of removal could have been enforced. It is urged that there is no controversy inter partes in the probate court, and that the appeal is the commencement of a new suit, when, for the first time, it is known who are the parties interested. I do not so understand the situation of such controversies. The notice authorized to be published by the probate court fixed the time when the matters set forth in the petition would, be determined by. the court, and specified the several questions which would be settled. If no objection is made, a decree in accordance with the prayer of the petition would be conclusive; but opposition being made, a hearing or trial must take place, and all the matters at issue litigated. When the contestants interposed objections, certainly the parties to a- controversy were known, and the decree was binding upon them, as well as all others interested. It is too late, after the determination of the litigated matters in the probate court, and an appeal taken to the district court of the state, to initiate steps for a removal. No such right then exists, and to entertain jurisdiction would-be an attempt to exercise a revisory power over the judgment of the probate court. which is given by law to another tribunal. This court has entertained jurisdiction of the removal of a suit pending in a state court,, on an appeal from commissioners appointed by that court to fix the value of private\u2019 property taken under the right of eminent domain, by an incorporated company \u2014 3 Dill. 465 [Fattex-son v. Mississippi &amp; R. K. Boom Co., Case No. 10,829]\u2014 but this appeal is of an entirely different character. In the former case, the 'appeal was from an appraisement by commissioners authorized under the charter of the company, which pi'ovided for an appeal from the award to the district court, and upon the appeal being taken the clei'k is authorized to set it down as a cause upon the docket of the court appointing the commissioners. A suit, then, for the first time is instituted in a court. In the case before nxe, the initiatoi'y proceedings and contest were in a court recognized as one of the judicial tribunals of the state, and the appeal was from a decree of that com-t. The l'emoval of a suit, under the act of congi\u2019ess of March 3, 1S75, must be from the court of original jurisdiction.</p>\n<author id=\"b739-9\">DILLON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A1UU\">I am of opinion that the removal was not applied for in time, under the act of March 3, 1875. and that the cause should be remanded. .Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
