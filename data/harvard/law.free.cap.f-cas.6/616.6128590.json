The declaration averred that Payne did carry on the business for the term above specified, but kept no account and had delivered no brandy or other spirits. A special demand was alleged on the 20th of June, 180G. The action was commenced on the 10th of June, 1807. The defendant pleaded full payment. This plea was traversed and issue joined thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-18\">The counsel for defendant stated that they should rely upon the lapse of time in support of the plea. By our statute of limitations no action can be sustained on any bond, bill, or note for the payment of money only, unless brought within seventeen years (St. Conn. tit. 101, c. 1, \u00a7 3); but as this bond was given. for the performance of certain collateral acts, the statute does not attach upon it. The length of time in this case i such that payment is to be presumed at common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-19\">The counsel for plaintiff then introduced proof of the situation and circumstances of the parties to repel the presumption arising from lapse of time. It appeared that the plaintiff was a poor man; that soon after the execution of the bond he went out of the state, and was absent several years; that when he returned the defendant did not know him at first, though on hearing his name he recollected him. The defendant was a man of large property. A special demand was proved, as stated in the declaration. As to the amount of damages, it was proved that the defendant had carried on the business of distilling cider brandy for several years; but no specific quantity was proved to have been distilled except in one year. It was shown, on the other hand, that during some part of the period in question there was no cider to be had.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-20\">T. S.

The condition was therefore broken and the bond forfeited at the end of the first year, which was \u2022more than twenty years before the commencement of the action. (3) That from the \u00a1situation and circumstances of the parties, which had been proved, the presumption of payment was rather strengthened than rebutted. The defendant was a man of property, and abundantly able to pay. If the plaintiff was poor he stood in greater need \u2022of his money, and was more likely to call for it. (4) That' in this state payment ought to be presumed after the lapse of seventeen years, in analogy to cases within the statute. Thus it has been held that an equity of redemption shall be barred after fifteen years\u2019 possession by the mortgagee, in analogy to the statute limiting the right of entry into lands. Smith v. Skinner, 1 Day, 124.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b619-5\">LIVINGSTON, Circuit Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Av_U\">This is an \u00a1action of debt on bond, the condition of which is that the defendant should distil cider brandy and keep an account thereof for seven years and three months, and deliver one tenth part therepf to the plaintiff. The defendant pleads payment generally, and relies altogether upon the lapse of time since the date of the bond. In England payment is presumed in twenty years, but this rule is controlled by courts of justice where the presumption of payment is opposed by other circumstances. But in Connecticut, as the legislature1 have acted on this subject, and fixed a term after which bonds of a certain description shall not be enforced, it deserves serious consideration whether the rule is to be extended to cases not within the statute. Upon this point, however, the court deem it unnecessary to express an opinion. For in our view of the case the plaintiff had no right of action for his part of -the brandy distilled until the expiration of the term of seven years and three months, \u25a0which was in July, 17S7; though, had the defendant distilled no brandy at all, perhaps the plaintiff might have sustained an action at the end of the first year, as such neglect would have been a breach of the condition. But if twenty years had elapsed since the cause of action accrued, we think the circumstances disclosed by the plaintiff are such as to remove any presumption of payment. (Here his honor commented minutely upon tile evidence.) Though the plaintiff, upon strict principles of law, is entitled to recover, it is difficult to estimate the damages. The demand is, indeed, a stale one. The plaintiff calls upon the defendant, after a great lapse of time, for an account of the brandy he has made; yet it cannot be expected that the defendant should have kept such an account until this time. No inference is to be made against him for not producing it now. He had good reason to believe he never should be called upon. He would have been justified even had he destroyed it. Under such circumstances, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove the quantity distilled. During one year the plaintiff has furnished some data, from which an estimate may be made; in no other year is there any. The jury have no right to supply this want of proof by conjecture, or to calculate that he distilled as much in other years as in this, especially when it appears that in some of these years there was no cider.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Daggett inquired whether the rule of damages should be the value of the brandy at the time of the demand, or at the time the right of action accrued?</p>\n<author id=\"b619-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"ApcE\">The brandy was to be delivered on demand. The value at the time of the demand, therefore, is to furnish the rule. Verdict for the plaintiff for $G9.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Daggett moved that costs be allowed the defendant, under the twentieth section of the first judiciary act 1 Stat. Cl.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">PER CURIAM. The court will not exercise their discretion to tax costs against a prevailing plaintiff, except where he has knowingly brought forward an unfounded claim, or, in other words, where he must have known that he was not entitled to five hundred dollars damages. In this case the plaintiff might naturally and fairly suppose he was entitled to recover more than five hundred dollars. Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
