The second objection is, \u201cthe declaration is not sufficient.\u201d The declaration is sufficient (3) \u201cThe whole sum is not due for which judgment was rendered.\u201d The averments in the declaration are sufficient to charge the defendant, and warrant a judgment for the debt and interest (4) \u201cThe instrument declared on is not a promissory note, as described in the declaration; and the court erred m rendering judgment on a different instrument than the one declared on.\u201d It does not appear that the court rendered judgment on any instrument in writing other than the one set forth in the declaration. The production of it did not make it a part of the record, unless it was produced on oyer. (5) \u201cThe computation of interest was from a wrong time; three days of grace ought to be allowed.\u201d This court has before decided that the days of grace allowed on mercantile paper do not attach to promissory notes. (G) \u201cThe judgment is not sufficient, or such as the law requires in such cases.\u201d This objection is answered by the opinion in the case of Fisher v. Reider [Case No. 4,822a]. (7) \u201cThe whole proceedings are erroneous, prout patet per recordum.\u201d The whole proceedings, except the defendant\u2019s plea, are regular, prout patet per recordum.\u201d (8) \u201cThe contract is a nudum pactum, and shown to be so in the declaration, and therefore no judgment could be entered.\u201d The promissory note, as set out in the declaration, is not a nudum pactum. It is averred to be for \u201cvalue received;\u201d but even if it did not, our statute makes it unnecessary to show that a note is made on a good consideration. On its face it imports a consideration. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
