While that decision does vary from the judgment in certain respects, most significantly in the provision for visitation, a subsequent decision of the court, dated August 26, 1991, deciding a motion by defendant, pursuant to CPLR 4404 (b), specifically notes, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court \"will meet with the child Eric at a time to be arranged with counsel and will confer with the parties and counsel <em>prior to amending the visitation schedule previously promulgated\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, the court\u2019s previously issued decisions were consistent with the judgment thereafter settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In addition, the record supports the actions taken by the nisi prius court, with the exception of its award of custody to the plaintiff giving him the sole decision-making power as to the child\u2019s health and welfare, and we modify, accordingly, solely to grant the parties joint custody.
