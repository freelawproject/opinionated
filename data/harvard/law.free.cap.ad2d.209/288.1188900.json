Each of the six figure loans claimed to constitute partial performance of an overriding oral agreement is evidenced by a written instrument that contains no reference to any other transaction and was made within what defendants admit was an ongoing relationship with the plaintiff\u2019s Private Banking Department, and therefore can be unintelligibly explained without reference to the alleged oral agreement <em>(see, Anostario v Vicinanzo, </em>59 NY2d 662, 664). And even if plaintiff had orally agreed to the large loan, there would be nothing about such an agreement inherently incompatible with enforcement of the smaller written loans <em>(see, Rose v Spa Realty Assocs., </em>42 NY2d 338, 344). Nor would defendants be able to show the necessary element of justifiable reliance, the individual defendant as the IAS Court aptly noted, being a sophisticated real estate investor who could not have believed that plaintiff would extend a $2 million loan \"on a word and a handshake\u201d while requiring a complicated set of writings for loans in far smaller amounts <em>(see, Ginsberg v Fairfield-Noble Corp., </em>81 AD2d 318, 321-322).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Defendants\u2019 assertion of their jurisdictional defense is a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>based argument that could have been countered had it been made before the IAS Court, and will therefore not be heard for the first time on appeal <em>(see, City of New York v Stack, </em>178 AD2d 355, <em>lv denied </em>80 NY2d 753). Were we to consider it, we would find it without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">We have considered the defendants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Concur\u2014Sullivan, J.
