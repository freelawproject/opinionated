Even if the Notice was premature, the court properly applied the \"erroneous date rule\u201d <em>(Kent &amp; Sons v Helena Rubinstein, Inc., </em>47 NY2d 561, 566). Finally, there was no showing that plaintiff, by accepting payment after the Notices of Default and Termination had been served, manifested an intentional waiver of the right to enforce the acceleration <em>(see, Gilbert Frank Corp. v Federal Ins. Co., </em>70 NY2d 966, 968). Concur\u2014 Sullivan, J. P., Wallach, Ross, Rubin and Williams, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
