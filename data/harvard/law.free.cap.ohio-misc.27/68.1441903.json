Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>claim a prescriptive right to use such small stream for their drainage, as same has been so used for more than 21 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The evidence showed that defendants did empty their wastes such as sewage, wash water and the like into this stream, that the same was offensive, particularly in warm weather, that dead tadpoles and minnows had been seen in this stream, when in the opinion of witness, they could have survived in clear water. Also, that this small stream had been so used since the early 1940\u2019s, when the houses now owned by defendants were built.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The waters of this small branch flow into Second Creek, in or near Blanchester, and this creek flows into Todds Fork (of the Little Miami Eiver) southeasterly from Morrow, Warren County, and this fork flows into the Little Miami Eiver in Morrow, and this river flows into the Ohio Eiver on the easterly side of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The waters of this little branch (or run, or brook, or rivulet), are governed by the provisions of R. C. 6111, styled \u201cWater Pollution Control,\u201d of which several sections are pertinent here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cR. C. 6111.01. Definitions: As used in R.

Any such action is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, except in such cases where the water pollution control board has issued a valid and unexpired permit, or renewal thereof, as provided in R.

Of that Act, G. C. 1261-1b, as amended is now R. C. 6111.01; G. C. 1261-1e, as amended, is now R. C. 6111.04; and G. C. 1261-1i, as amended, is now R. C. 6111.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The defendants rely upon <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Standard Bag &amp; Paper Company </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 324, for support of their theory of prescriptive right for their pollution of this small stream:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The law therein was no longer law in Ohio, prior to the enactment of the Water Pollution Control Act of Ohio in 1951, as is seen by <em>Vian </em>v. <em>Sheffield Building &amp; Development Co. </em>(1948), 85 Ohio App. 191, of which the syllabus is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u2018 \u2018 1. One may not obtain by prescription, or otherwise than by purchase, a right to cast sewage upon the lands of another without his consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">\u201c2. The discharge of effluent, from a disposal system, into a public watercourse, from which, through natural and artificial means, it finds its way onto the lands of another, and the permitting of overflow from a sewage wet well to drain onto the lands of another, may be enjoined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">This case is no longer law in Ohio, except as to the enjoining of pollution of waters of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Modern thinking upon the pollution of waters is in <em>Board of Commissioners of Lake County </em>v. <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. </em>(1965), 6 Ohio Misc. 126, in which the question was alleged pollution of Lake Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">No claim was made by the defendants that there had been a valid permit issued to any of them by the Water Pollution Control Board after September 27,1952, for their wastes to go into this small stream, and therefore their such acts have been illegal since September 27, 1952, and are now illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">The court finds that there is pollution of this small stream, that it comes from the wastes from the properties of the defendants, who have no prescriptive right to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>such wastes, causing the pollution, to enter this small stream, and further finds that the plaintiff, through whose land this small stream flows, has a right of action to enjoin these defendants from polluting this small stream in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The court finds that the prayer of the plaintiff must be granted and an injunction ordered herein against the three defendants, each of them, from causing any pollution of this small stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The court therefore enjoins each defendant from allowing any wastes of any kind, coming within the description of \u201csewage\u201d (R. C. 6111.01 [B]), and \u201cother wastes\u201d (R. C. 6111.01 [D]), to enter this small stream, which is one of the \u201cwaters of the state\u201d (R. C. 6111.01[H]), which would result in \u201cpollution\u201d (R. C. 6111.01 [A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">; And the court orders that the defendants, each of them, to so treat these wastes from their property so that the waters in this small stream, after their wastes enter it, are not \u201charmful or inimical to the public health, or to animal \u2022or aquatic life, or to the use of such waters for domestic water supply, or industrial or agricultural purposes, or for \u25a0recreation\u201d (R. C. 6111.01[A]).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u25a0 As the defendants will need some time to change the plan of disposal of their wastes that now flow into this small stream, the above order of injunction against each defendant shall be suspended for a period of 120 days, within which each defendant shall so change his waste disposal system that there can be no pollution of this small stream from his own waste disposal system, and the three defendants shall jointly so change the joint system that there can be no pollution of this small stream from the joint waste outlet into the small stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The defendants to pay the costs herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
