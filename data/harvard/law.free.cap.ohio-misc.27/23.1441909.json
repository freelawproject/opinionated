Frolking, who died on February 22, 1969. The will was executed on February 16, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">There was no surviving spouse, but Mrs. Frolking left two surviving children, Mrs. Elizabeth F. McBride and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Peter H. Frolking. Peter Frolking is unmarried, but Mrs. McBride has two minor children, Heather, born October 25, 1960, and Holly, born April 11, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The first paragraph of Item III of Mrs. Frolking\u2019s will reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my granddaughter, Heater <em>(sic.) </em>Cate McBride, and to each of any other children that may hereafter be born to her, or to my son, Peter H. Frolking, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) payable either in cash or in securities of that value, to be theirs absolutely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Concededly the word \u201cHeater\u201d in the above-quoted passage is a misprint, and the testatrix was referring to her granddaughter, Heather.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">However, plaintiff correctly states that the provision creates a patent ambiguity in that the apparent intent of the testatrix to benefit any grandchildren who might be living at her death is not in harmony with the language used, and plaintiff asks the court to construe the paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">From a purely grammatical point of view, the word \u201cher\u201d in the above quotation relates to Heather McBride. Overlooking the mistaken designation of Heather as \u201cHeater, \u2019 \u2019 the sentence may be parsed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my granddaughter, Heather Cate McBride, and to each of any other children that may hereafter be born to my granddaughter, Heather Cate McBride, or to my son. <em>* * *\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Obviously, this implies that when the will was executed, Heather already had a child. But at that time, Heather was only a few months over one year of age, and, of course, had no child. Moreover, and even more ridiculous, parsing the sentence grammatically would result in Heather\u2019s being her own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">It becomes apparent, then, that a literal reading of the clause in question makes no sense. The language of the Supreme Court of Ohio in an early case applies perfectly to this situation. Said the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">\u201cThe terms of a will are not, of necessity, to be construed technically and with a strict reference to grammatical accuracy; but they are to be viewed sensibly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>liberally, in order to give effect to the testator\u2019s intentions. Of all the instruments that need the benefit of a liberal construction \u2014 a construction that prefers substance to mere form \u2014 wills need it the most.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1854), 4 Ohio St. 333, 351.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">To the same effect, see <em>Brasher </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1864), 15 Ohio St. 103, 109; <em>Fifth-Third Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Athenaeum of Ohio </em>(Prob. Ct. 1959), 12 O. O. 2d 188, 197, 169 N. E. 2d 707, 718; 4 Bowe-Parker, Page on Wills, Sec. 30.24, p. 153 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Construing the will \u201csensibly and liberally,\u201d we have no trouble in reaching the result intended by the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Item II of the will leaves household goods, clothing, and other articles of tangible chattel property to Mrs. Frolking\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth F. McBride, and to Mrs. Frolking\u2019s son, Peter H. McBride, to be divided equally between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">It is evident that the \u201cher\u201d in Item III refers to Mrs. McBride, whose child, Heather, specifically designated as a beneficiary in Item III, was Mrs. Frolking\u2019s granddaughter when the will was executed. Substituting the words \u201cmy daughter, Elizabeth F. McBride\u201d for the word \u201cher\u201d in Item III gives us the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my granddaughter, Heather Cate McBride, and to each of any other children that may hereafter be born to my daughter Elizabeth F. McBride, or to my son, Peter H. Frolking. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">This is a sensible \u2014 in fact the only sensible \u2014 interpretation of Item III.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Holly E. McBride was born after the execution of the will and comes within the language \u201ceach of any other children that may hereafter be born to her,\u201d namely, to Elizabeth F. McBride.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">\n<em>Conclusion of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">As a result of my interpretation of Item III of the will, each of the following granddaughters of the testatrix is entitled to the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), \u25a0payable either in cash or in securities of that value, each to have the absolute ownership thereof:</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">Heather Cate McBride</p>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">Holly E. McBride</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
