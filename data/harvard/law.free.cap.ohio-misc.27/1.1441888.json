Defendant Ronald J. Heeg moves that plaintiff be required to replead herein, citing two authorities where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>upon removal of action from state to Federal courts, plaintiff was required to replead with short statement of the claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b12-4\">In the \u201cReport of Commissioners\u201d to the General Assembly of Ohio, dated January 15, 1853, as to the proposed Code of Civil Procedure (which became law, effective July 1, 1853, by Act of March 11, 1853, 51 Ohio Laws 57-166), the Commissioners, in their comments, on pages 52-53, state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b12-5\">\u201cPleadings should be plain and truthful. * * * The object of the provisions we have recommended, is, as we have said, to secure plainness and truthfulness. We do not aim to make pleading a system of dialectics, nor to lay the foundation for a new and cunning science of disputation. On the contrary, the aim is to avoid such a result and confine pleading within its proper bounds, making it a mere auxiliary in the administration of justice, never defeating it. We would not allow it to \u2018impede the cause of justice, by deciding causes, not upon their merits, but by its rules which are sometimes only ceremonial.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b12-6\">In \u201cSwan\u2019s Pleading and Precedents\u201d (1860, republished 1867), on pages 146-148 (cited in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Farm-Orama Associates, Inc. </em>[1965], 3 Ohio Misc. 13, 19), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b12-7\">\u201cThe rule of pleading * * * does not provide how a cause of action or defense shall be stated, or what particularity or certainty of statement shall be made * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b12-8\">\u201c* * * independent of all rules of pleadings, the general principles of law require a certain state of facts to exist to entitle a party to his action and the relief he seeks, or to constitute a defense; <em>* * * </em>and these only, * # * the Code requires to be stated in the pleadings. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b12-9\">\u201cIt is obvious * * * that a work upon Code pleading, defining what facts should be stated in a petition, as a cause of action, or in a defense, would be a treatise upon civil jurisprudence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b12-10\">Thus, in the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, effective July 1, 1970, Rule 8, \u201cGeneral Rules of Pleading\u201d (A) \u201cClaims for Relief,\u201d says: \u201cA pleading which sets forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b13-4\">And it is further stated in the same Rule 8, in (E) (1) \u2018 \u2018 Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading or motions are required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b13-5\">Rule 12 (F) \u201cMotion to Strike,\u201d states: \u201cUpon motion made by a party # * * or upon the court\u2019s own initiative, at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient claim or defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b13-6\">There is no rule for the court to order a plaintiff to \u201creplead\u201d without showing specific reason for the same, after a ruling by the court upon a \u201cMotion for Definite Statement,\u201d under Rule 12 (E), or after a ruling by the court upon \u201cMotion to Strike,\u2019\u2019 under Rule 12 (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b13-7\">The moving defendant Ronald E. Heeg does not bring his \u201cMotion\u201d for an order for plaintiff to \u201creplead\u201d under either Rule 12 (E) \u201cMotion for Definite Statement\u201d or Rule 12 (F) \u201cMotion to Strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b13-8\">The court is aware of Rule 8 (F) \u201cConstruction of Pleadings,\u201d \u201cAll pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b13-9\">The court finds that \u201csubstantial justice\u201d will be done by allowing the plaintiff\u2019s first pleading to remain as it is, as the same does state a good cause of action, even though it does contain much detail and much surplusage of language.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-10\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
