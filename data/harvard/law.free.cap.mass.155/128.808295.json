After the former decision, reported 153 Mass. 447, the case was heard by Morton, J., upon an application by the plaintiff to settle the form of the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-11\">The evidence of an expert was introduced tending to show that to complete the proposed alterations in the club-house would require from three to four months. It also appeared in evidence, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, that on May 8, 1891, an application was made to the Legislature to suspend the enforcement of any decree that might be entered against the defendant with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>out waiving any of the Commonwealth\u2019s rights in the premises, but that this application, and a resolve framed in accordance therewith, were referred to the next General Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-3\">The judge ordered a final decree to be entered, by which the defendant was ordered, within three months and at its own expense, and in accordance with certain plans and specifications furnished by it under an order of the court, to remove and alter, among other things, certain portions of its club-house, \u201cas set forth in the said plans and specifications and in conformity thereto, viz. in the manner following, to wit: The solid walls, or 1 screens,\u2019 so called, which close in front the triangular spaces between the two bay windows on each side of the porch, and between the porch and the inner bays, on the first or basement story of the said building, and which form, in conjunction with the front walls of said bays and porch, a continuous basement front, and also the said inner bays with the foundation walls sustaining the same, and also the balconies over the said triangular spaces and over the said inner bays, are to be removed so that the entire space between the said porch and the outer or flanking bays on each side of said porch shall be on the same face as the main front wall of the said club-house.\u201d The decree also ordered the defendant to pay the costs of the suit. The defendant thereupon appealed to the full court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\">(r. <em>Putnam, </em>for the defendant, contended that the decree directed the removal of the foundations as well as the superstructures of the inner bay windows, and, no objections to such foundations having been raised at any previous stage of the case, so much of the decree as related thereto was erroneous, and should be stricken out; that time should be afforded the defendant to see whether the General Court would pass upon the question whether the Commonwealth would not be content with a declaration of its rights, and refrain from insisting that the alterations should be carried out; and that in arcase of this kind the costs should not be given to the Commonwealth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-5\"><em>H. N. Shepard, </em>for the Attorney General.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-6\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFn\">We express no opinion as to whether the restrictions in the Commonwealth\u2019s deeds apply to foundations under ground, because we are of opinion that the decree, properly construed, does not purport to require foundations under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ground to be removed. The words, \u201c the said inner bays with the foundation walls sustaining the same . . . are to be removed,\u201d are limited by the words \u201c so that the entire space . . . shall be on the same face as the main front wall,\u201d which declare the end, and the only end, to be accomplished. To remove all doubt, the decree may be modified by inserting, after \u201c foundation walls sustaining the same,\u201d the words \u201cif any above the surface of the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">It is quite true, and it fairly is to be inferred from the report and plans, that at the hearing on the merits no evidence was taken, fact found, or argument made as to the foundations, and we should be slow to read the decree as embracing other projections than those brought to the attention of the court at the proper time. The defendant is so far justified in its appeal, that there was perhaps reasonable ground to apprehend that the decree had a more extensive meaning. But there is nothing in the present situation or in the defendant\u2019s past conduct to make the granting of delay proper. We shall allow the time allowed by the original decree, three months from the date of the re-script, and the decree of the full court. We perceive no reason why costs should not follow the event. <em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
