Gould, for a promissory note for $1,400, dated December 7,1887, payable on demand to the order of the intestate, and signed by the Haverhill Aqueduct Company. The defendant filed the following answer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-11\">\u201c And now comes the defendant, and for answer denies each and every allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s writ and declaration contained, as fully as if the same were herein specifically set forth and denied. And further answering, the defendant says that Mary I. Gould, while the holder and owner of the note set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s writ, died intestate, and that Sarah F. Gould, mother of said Mary I. Gould, was entitled by the statute of distributions of this Commonwealth to all the goods and estate of the said Mary I. Gould, after the payment of all lawful debts. And the said Mary I. Gould did not at her death leave any debts, and no administrator was appointed for the estate of said Mary I. Gould until after the death of said Sarah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>F. Gould, her mother. And the said Sarah F. Gould took and retained possession of all of the estate of said Mary I. Gould, including said note, and held the same as her own property, believing that she had a right to do so without authority from any court. And during the lifetime of Sarah F. Gould, and before the appointment of the plaintiff as administrator of said Mary I. Gould, the said Sarah F. Gould gave and delivered to the defendant, upon good consideration, the note mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s writ. Wherefore, in equity and good conscience, the said note became the property of the defendant.

The answer, in substance, alleges that Mary I. Gould died intestate, and was at the time of her death the owner and holder of the note in replevin, and that her mother, Sarah F. Gould, was entitled as distributee to all of Mary\u2019s goods and chattels, after the payment of her debts; that Mary left no debts, and no administrator was appointed on her estate till after her mother\u2019s death; and that the mother took and kept possession of all the estate of Mary, including the note in question, believing she had the right to do so, and gave and delivered the note, upon a good consideration, to the defendant. No question is made that the plaintiff is the duly appointed administrator of the goods and estate of Mary I. Gould, who, we assume, died within twenty years. The defendant contends that Sarah F. Gould was the equitable owner of the note after the death of Mary, and after she had taken possession of it, and that he succeeded to her rights as equitable owner of it, and that under the St. of 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 14, he is entitled in equity and good conscience to be relieved absolutely against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">There is no doubt that upon the death of Mary I. Gould her mother\u2019s right as distributee vested in her at once. <em>Hayward </em>v. Hayward, 20 Pick. 517. <em>Nickerson </em>v. Bowly, 8 Met. 424. 1 Redfield on Wills, (3d ed.) 412. This right gave to her the power to compel, under the direction of the Probate Court, an administrator, when appointed, to account to her ultimately for the estate. <em>Cathaway </em>v. Bowles, 136 Mass. 54. It did not vest in her a legal or equitable title to the estate as a whole, or to any particular portion of it. The title remained in abeyance till the appointment of an administrator, and then vested in him by relation from the death of Mary. <em>Jewett </em>v. Smith, 12 Mass. 309. <em>Clapp </em>v. Stoughton, 10 Pick. 463. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Wright, </em>23 Pick. 128. <em>Hatch </em>v. Proctor, 102 Mass. 351. 1 Wms, on Executors, (6th Am. ed.) 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">As distributee or heir, the mother could lawfully take possession of the note, and keep it safely till the appointment of an administrator, but she could convey no title to it as against an administrator. <em>Lawrence </em>v. Wright, 23 Pick. 128. She could not have retained it herself, as against an administrator, even though she was the sole heir at law. <em>Cathaway </em>v. Bowles, 136 Mass. 54. <em>Bean </em>v. Bumpus, 22 Maine, 549, 554. Though the primary object in the appointment of an administrator is to secure the payment of the debts of the deceased out of his estate, and the distribution among the heirs of any balance that may remain, the Probate Co.urt may appoint an administrator where there are no debts, and that fact does not affect his title to or right to recover the personal property belonging to his intestate. Without doubt, as suggested by the defendant, intestate estates are frequently settled by the heirs among themselves, without the appointment of an administrator. So long, in such cases, as all parties are content to abide by the settlement, it suffices. What the result might be if, after the settlement, a dissatisfied heir or some other person should be appointed administrator, we need not now consider. The defendant concedes that the legal title to the note may be in the plaintiff, and the conclusion to which we have come on this branch of the case is, that he shows no equitable title to or interest in it, and therefore no ground for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The defendant contends, in the next place, that replevin will not lie for a promissory note. He has referred us to no authority for the proposition. In <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Brickett, </em>14 Allen, 62, it seems to have been assumed, as a matter of course, that replevin would lie for bank bills, postage stamps, United States bonds, and promissory notes. And it seems also to have been so held in <em>Black River Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>New York State Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>73 N. Y. 282, and <em>Merrell </em>v. Springer, 123 Ind. 485. See also <em>Drake </em>v. Auerbach, 37 Minn. 505 <em>; Smith </em>v. <em>Eals, </em>81 Iowa, 235; <em>Deshler </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>16 How. 622. We think it is clear that replevin can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
