The complaint was addressed to \u201c George G. Withington, Justice of the Peace in and for the county of Bristol and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, designated and commissioned to issue warrants in criminal cases.\u201d The jurat annexed to the complaint was as follows: \u201c Bristol ss. Received and sworn to the fifth day of January in the year one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one.. Before me, Geo. G. Withington, Justice of the Peace, authorized to issue warrants as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., Phipps testified that he went to the defendant\u2019s shop in July and purchased intoxicating liquor of the defendant for himself and a companion named Lemke; that afterwards he went there on a Saturday night with another companion, and made purchases of intoxicating liquor of the defendant, and on the following Sunday went there alone. The defendant objected that evidence of another sale at that time would be incompetent. The district attorney then stated that, as then advised, he thought this was the sale upon which he should rely as the one named in one of the counts. The judge overruled the objection, and the defendant excepted. Against the defendant\u2019s objection, the witness then testified that he then bought intoxicating liquor of the defendant. Lemke, the only other witness, then testified that on July 22 last he went to the defendant\u2019s place with Phipps, and\"they had two glasses of intoxicating liquor of the defendant, and Phipps paid for it, and that this was the only time he went there with Phipps. The district attorney elected to rely upon the sales on Saturday evening and Sunday, and the court instructed the jury that they must disregard all evidence of any sales except those so elected. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The defendant then filed a motion in arrest of judgment, on the ground that <em>\u201c </em>George G. Withington had no legal authority to receive the original complaint in this case, or to administer the oath to the complainant, or certify thereto, all of which appears of record; wherefore he says that neither this court nor any other court has jurisdiction to enter judgment against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>under said complaint.\u201d The judge overruled the motion; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-5\"><em>J.

The jury were instructed by the court to disregard all evidence of any sales except those relied on by the district attorney. It is to be presumed that they followed the instructions. It was within the discretion of the court to permit the district attorney to elect upon which sales he would rely. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>118 Mass. 443, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The motion in arrest of judgment is disposed of by the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taber, ante, </em>5. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
