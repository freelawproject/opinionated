Hearing before Br\u00e1ley, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-6\">The plaintiff was the owner of a lot of land in Swampscott, bounding fifty feet on Harrison Avenue and running back therefrom at about that width for a distance of one hundred feet, and flowing through the plaintiff\u2019s lot across Harrison Avenue was a . brook which came from a parcel of land belonging to the defendant, and known as the \u201c Stone Field.\u201d In September, 1890, an agreement in writing was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant, by which the plaintiff agreed in writing to allow the defendant to enter upon the plaintiff\u2019s land \u201c for the purpose of digging out a brook and laying sewer or drain pipes through his said land for the benefit of the 6 Stone Field,\u2019 \u201d the defendant agreeing to \u201c hold harmless the said Atkins against any damage on account of said digging,\u201d and to put the premises in as good condition as when he first entered upon them. The defendant thereupon proceeded to dig a trench across the plaintiff\u2019s lot, parallel with and at a distance of several feet from the brook, and to lay pipes in the trench, as he contended he had a right to do under the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">The plaintiff contended that the agreement only gave the defendant a right to lay drain pipes below the bed of the brook, and was permitted, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to introduce evidence of a conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant the day before the agreement was signed, in which the plaintiff understood the defendant to ask the plaintiff if he would give the defendant the right to dig out the brook and lay drain pipes along the bed of the same for the purpose of draining the defendant\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that \u201c under the terms of the instrument set forth in his answer, .he had the right to go across the plaintiff\u2019s land wherever he pleased for the purpose of laying the pipe, using reasonable care so as not to injure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s land more than was necessary, and that paroi evidence was not admissible for any purpose under the terms of the instrument.\u201d The judge refused -so to rule, and ruled that the terms of \u201c the written contract or agreement were not clear, and that the circumstances attending the transaction, and the situation and admissions of the parties, were admissible for the purpose of ascertaining the sense in which they intended the language used, and found and ruled that the defendant would have no right to depart from the bed of the brook in laying his sewer pipe through the plaintiff\u2019s land, and ordered a decree for the plaintiff.\u201d The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-3\">jET. <em>F. Hurlhurt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-4\"><em>W. H. Niles Cr. J.

Sewer or drain pipes laid in the brook would be laid through the land of the plaintiff. The damage which the defendant agrees to hold the plaintiff harmless from is that caused \u201c on account of said digging,\u201d which is the digging out of the brook, not the digging of a trench anywhere through the plaintiff\u2019s land. Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s lot being only fifty feet wide, it would seem hardly reasonable that the parties should have contemplated that the defendant should have the right to deepen the brook, and also to lay drain pipes through the lot. If such had been their intention, it would have been more plainly expressed. If, on the contrary, as we think was the fact, they intended that the defendant should have the right to dig out the brook that ran through the plaintiff\u2019s land for the purpose of laying sewer or drain pipes in it to drain the \u201c Stone Field,\u201d then the language chosen expresses that purpose with sufficient aptness. In the view which we take of the construction to be given to the agreement, even if the testimony of the conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant prior to the execution of the agreement was erroneously admitted, it could have done the defendant no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
