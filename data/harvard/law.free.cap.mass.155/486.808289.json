The declaration further alleges a demand on the defendant, and a refusal to pay, and that the defendant owes the' plaintiff the sum of forty dollars, with interest thereon. It is clear that the action cannot be maintained. The order in each case was an interlocutory order, which the court could enforce by proper proceedings in that case. Pub. Sts. e. 153, \u00a7 3. It can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>not be enforced by an independent action. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Lashley, 2 </em>H.
