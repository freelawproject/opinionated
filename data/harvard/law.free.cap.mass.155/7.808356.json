The defendant testified that he formerly had a license to sell intoxicating liquors in a store connected with his tenement, but the license expired in 1889, and since that time he had not sold any intoxicating liquors himself nor authorized any one to sell for him; that in his own tenement, so far as he knew, no such liquor had been kept or sold; that he went to New York on August 1,1890, and there remained until August 14; that he had no knowledge of the sales testified to; and that if his wife had sold it at any time it was against his wishes, knowledge, or consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction ; but the judge refused so to rule, and submitted the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-6\"><em>J.
