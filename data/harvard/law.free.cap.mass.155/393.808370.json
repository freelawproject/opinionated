At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bond, </em>J., Eames testified that on the day in question, about four o\u2019clock P. M., he was on Tremont Street, and upon hearing an alarm of fire started towards the place where the fire was; that, while standing there about a minute or so with persons all around him, he felt a tug at his watch chain, which was attached to a gold watch that he carried in his waistcoat pocket, and felt a little motion near the pocket; that he immediately looked down and saw the defendant\u2019s hand, which at the time was in the vicinity of the pocket, go down quickly by the defendant\u2019s side and behind him or partly so; that at the same time he saw his watch chain drop and missed the watch; that he had looked at his watch some two and a half minutes before he felt the tug at his chain ; that the defendant at the time was standing very close to him and facing him; that he then grabbed the defendant by the coat and accused him of having his watch; that the defendant said to him, \u201c What is the matter with you ? \u201d and later denied having the watch; that he then held the defendant until an officer came and took the defendant to the police station; that the defendant was searched at the station, but no watch was found upon him; and that he did not see his watch in the hand or possession of the defendant, nor could he say that he saw a confederate take the watch from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>A police officer testified that he had a conversation with the defendant at the station, in which the defendant gave as a reason for being in that vicinity that he went there to see a girl; and the defendant testified in his own behalf, denying that he took the watch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">The judge declined to rule at the defendant\u2019s request, as matter of law, that there was no evidence to warrant a verdict of guilty; and submitted the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-7\"><em>W.

But we think upon both points the case was properly submitted to the jury. The evidence tended to show that his watch, which he had just looked at, was attached to a \u2022watch chain, and he felt a tug at the watch chain and a little motion near the pocket where the watch was carried; that he saw the chain drop, and the defendant\u2019s hand, then near his watch pocket, go down quickly by the defendant\u2019s side, and behind him or partly so. From this and the other evidence the jury might well think that the watch was stolen, and that the defendant was the thief. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
