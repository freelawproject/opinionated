Trial in the Superior Court, before Hammond, J., who allowed the following bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\">\u201cThe defendant is an officer duly qualified to serve civil process, and who claimed a special title under an attachment on a writ, directed to him as such officer, in favor of Clarence Gr. Straight against Fred L. Stiff, a brother of the plaintiff herein. At the trial, the defendant introduced evidence tending to show that, immediately before, and at the time when the attachment was made, the plaintiff told the officer, in the presence and hearing of the keeper, as testified to by them, that the goods attached belonged to said Fred L. Stiff; that Fred partially conducted his business in the place where the goods were attached; and that the day after the attachment was made the plaintiff, by his attorney, for the first time made a claim for said goods as his own. The plaintiff denied this, and introduced evidence to show that at the time named he told the officer that the property was his, and immediately upon the attachment and at all times after claimed it as his own. The defendant asked for the following rulings and instructions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">\u201c1 If the facts present a case where the plaintiff, by his voluntary acts and neglect to act, has misled the defendant to his prejudice, you may find a waiver by the plaintiff of his right to immediate possession, and a verdict for the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201c \u2018 Second. If the plaintiff by word or act deceived the defendant to his injury in relation to the attachment, and by his word or act the defendant as an officer was led to attach the property in question, you must find for the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-3\">\u201c The court refused to rule and instruct as thus requested, but instructed as follows: \u2018 If you find that James, for the purpose of inducing the officer to attach that property as Fred\u2019s, told him it was Fred\u2019s, and that the officer, relying upon that statement, attached the property when he would not otherwise \u2022 have attached it, then James would be estopped from claiming the property as against the man whom he had thus fraudulently induced to attach it. But you must be satisfied that James made the statement for the purpose of having the property attached as Fred\u2019s,, and that the officer relied upon the statement, and attached it when he would not otherwise have attached it.\u2019 Full and appropriate instructions, to which no exception was taken, were given on other points of the case, but this was all the instruction given on this point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-5\"><em>S.

At the trial the plaintiff\u2019s ownership was conceded, but it was contended that he was estopped because he had stated to the defendant, immediately before, and at the time of the attachment,, that the goods belonged to the person sued, and had not claimed them as his own until the next day. The plaintiff denied that he had made any such statement, and introduced evidence tending to show that he had. at all times claimed the property as his own. It did not appear that the plaintiff knew that the defendant was an officer, or was seeking to make an attachment. The only questions are as to the correctness of the instructions asked and denied, and of those given.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Those asked were clearly erroneous, and were properly refused. They would have allowed the jury to find an estoppel, if by the plaintiff\u2019s word or act the defendant had been induced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>make the attachment, although the plaintiff had no intention to deceive him, and no knowledge or cause to believe that he was concerned in his conduct or talk, and although under the circumstances the plaintiff was justified in believing that he was responsible to no one for his speech or conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">The usual form of expressing the situation which founds an estoppel <em>in pais </em>has been that followed in the rulings given, in which, as in many of the older decisions, it is said that an intent to deceive is a necessary element. <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>5 Gray, 420. <em>Audenried </em>v. <em>Betteley, </em>5 Allen, 382, 385. <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>9 Allen, 455, 458. <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Doud, </em>10 Allen, 433, 437. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>11 Allen, 349. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>12 Allen, 401. <em>Zuchtmann </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>109 Mass. 53. <em>Nourse </em>v. <em>Nourse, </em>116 Mass. 101, 104. But under this formula the jury were not prohibited from finding the intention and the estoppel, if, without more, the plaintiff spoke or acted falsely, knowing or having cause to believe that his words or conduct reasonably might influence the defendant\u2019s action. The more modern statement, that one is responsible for the word or act which he knows, or ought to know, will be acted upon by another, includes the older statement that the estoppel comes from an intention to mislead. <em>White </em>v. <em>Duggan, </em>140 Mass. 18, 20. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>145 Mass. 357, 359. <em>O'Donnell </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>145 Mass. 461, 463. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>151 Mass. 132, 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In the state of the evidence, so far as it appears upon the bill of exceptions, the instructions given afforded the jury a sufficiently correct guide to the class of statements and acts which must be shown to found an estoppel. If the situation had made ' it necessary to instruct them as to intention, as distinguished from circumstances in which intention is to be presumed, the presiding justice would have ruled upon that subject. All that he was in fact called upon to do was to correct the error\u2019s of the instructions asked, and to lay down a rule which, under the circumstances, would enable the jury to deal properly with the evidence. We see no reason to suppose that they were misled by the rulings given.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The ruling that they must be satisfied that the defendant attached, when he would not otherwise have done so, was correct. <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>126 Mass. 475, 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overnded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
