Sts. c. 187, \u00a7 2, and c. 153, \u00a7 20, order a judgment to be entered in that court against such other four defendants, <em>nunc pro tune, </em>as of the time, as nearly as may be, when it should have been rendered against them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-9\">Writ of error, to reverse a judgment of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-10\">At the hearing, before Knowlton, J., it appeared that William Burgess, the defendant in error, brought an action against George Curran, the plaintiff in error, Thomas Curran, Samuel Ramsbottom, Joseph Simpson, and Lawrence Fielding, on a joint promissory note dated September 21, 1874, and made payable to the Currans, and indorsed by them, and signed by the three last named; that on October 16, 1890, judgment was entered in the Superior Court in favor of Burgess against all five of these defendants; that at the time the action was brought and at the entry of judgment Ramsbottom was not an inhabitant or resident of this Commonwealth, and had no attachable property here, and no personal service was made upon him, the only service upon him being by publication; that due and sufficient service was made on all the other defendants; that Thomas Curran and Joseph Simpson had died since the entry of judgment and before the petition for this writ of error was brought, neither leaving any property, and no administration had been taken out on the estate of either; that the defendant in error was willing to discontinue as to both of these and as to Rams-bottom <em>: </em>that the defendant in error had apparently now no remedy upon the note upon which the original judgment was entered, the same being barred by the statute of limitations; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and that an action had been brought by the defendant in error upon the judgment which was still pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\">The plaintiff in error contended that the entry should be either, \u201cJudgment for the plaintiff in error, the former judgment reversed,\u201d or simply, \u201c Judgment reversed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The defendant in error contended that the entry should be, \u201c Judgment reversed, and judgment rendered against the defendants George Curran and Lawrence Fielding for the sum for which the original judgment was rendered, with interest added from the date of the original judgment,\u201d or some other entry which shall give to the defendant in error such judgment as the Superior Court should have ordered in the original action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The judge was of opinion that the defendant in error was right in his contention, but, at the request of the plaintiff in error, reported the case for the consideration of the full court, such entry to be made as law and justice might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-8\"><em>M.

Of one of them the court had no jurisdiction. It is conceded that this judgment was erroneous. <em>Wright </em>v. Andrews, 130 Mass. 149. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>147 Mass. 201. By virtue of the Pub. Sts. c. 187, \u00a7 2, \u201c When the judgment is reversed, the court shall render such judgment as the Superior Court should have rendered.\u201d The Superior Court should have rendered judgment against the other four defendants in the original action. Two of these, however, have since died, so that no judgment can now be rendered against them as of the present time; and the plaintiff in error contends that no judgment can now be rendered, and that nothing can now be done except to reverse the former judgment. This would leave the original plaintiff, it is said, without remedy, since the statute of limitations would bar a new action. But we see no difficulty in entering judgment against the other four original defendants, <em>nune pro tune, </em>as of the time (as nearly as may be) when the Superior Court should have rendered it. Pub. Sts. c. 153, \u00a7 20. <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>2 Cush. 52. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>106 Mass. 339. <em>Tapley </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>116 Mass. 275. <em>Tapley </em>v. <em>Goodsell, </em>122 Mass. 176. Such judgment will accordingly be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
