I must respectfully decline to consider the carrying out of the formal acceptance of our verbal agreement (Mr. Hazen and mine) to separate, as an accommodation, but as a matter of business (please refer to his letter to me of Sept. 26th) which has not yet been consummated. This lack of consummation has prevented, and still prevents, my making any business engagements, several of which are offering, as I am still bound as an employee of the Standard Electric Company of Vermont, by a contract then and now uncancelled by any corporate action; and my demand on you for my salary until cancellation by corporate action is simply a matter of business, for which I am not in any way responsible, and assure you that T do not wish this state of affairs to continue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-3\">On November 6, Hazen wrote to the plaintiff as follows: \u201cWe have called a meeting of the directors for Friday of this week, at which time we expect to get a quorum together. . . . Our opinion is that we have already given all the release the law requires, but of course are very glad -to take any further action as soon as we can get a quorum together.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-4\">On November 7, the plaintiff wrote to Hazen as follows: \u201c As to the corporate action and question arising on the deposit, I can only refer you to my letters to your president under dates of Oct. 27th and 30th, and say that I am still waiting here for the corporate release and repossession of deposit.\u201d And on November 13, as follows: \u201c I want to close this business up this week and be at liberty, if your company can act so to release me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">On October 8, the defendant sent the plaintiff its copy of the contract in suit, with holes punched through the signatures and seals, and indorsed, \u201c Cancelled October 8, 1888, by mutual consent between the parties hereto,\u201d this having been done by Hazen as treasurer of the defendant company, or by his clerk under his direction. No vote of the directors of the defendant corporation had been taken at this time authorizing any cancel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>lotion, and the only vote of the directors upon the subject is that of November 9 following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-3\">When the plaintiff received the defendant\u2019s copy of the contract so punched and marked, he wrote across the face of his own copy of the contract the words, \u201c Cancelled October 8,1888, by mutual consent of both parties,\u201d and cancelled the signatures ' of said contract by crossing them over with ink, but did not deliver his copy so marked to the defendant or to any of its officers, nor did he notify the defendant or any of its officers that he made such memorandum on his copy or erased the signatures; and there was no evidence that any officer of the defendant corporation knew of the existence of such memorandum or erasure until the plaintiff delivered his copy of the contract to Hazen, on November 14 following. On November 9, the directors of the defendant corporation held a meeting and passed a vote in the form requested by the plaintiff in his letter of October 11 to William P. Fairbanks. On November 14, the plaintiff and Hazen met in Boston, and the plaintiff made a further indorsement on his copy of the contract as follows\": \u201c Cancelled Nov. 14, 1888, by corporate vote of Standard Electric Company of Vermont, of November 9th, 1888.\u201d He also, on the same day, executed the following release, and attached it to said agreement, and delivered the same to Hazen, for the defendant: \u201c Know all men by these presents, that I, Thomas Pray, Jr., of Boston, in consideration of one dollar to me in hand well and truly paid by the Standard Electric Company of Vermont, the receipt whereof I do hereby acknowledge, do hereby consent and agree to the cancellation of a certain contract made and executed by. the said Standard Electric Company and myself, a duplicate original copy whereof is hereunto annexed, dated January 3, A. D. 1888, the said cancellation having been voted by the board of directors of said company, November 9,1888; and for the consideration aforesaid I do likewise, for myself and my executors and administrators, release and discharge the said company and its successors from any and all claim or demand I now have, or ever had, against it or them by reason of the said contract <em>of </em>otherwise, excepting only a claim against said company for my salary under the said contract from September 29, 1888, to this date, and excepting likewise a claim of ... ; and it is expressly understood that the said claims for salary and for said . . . ar\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>wholly excepted from, and are in no manner affected by, this deed of release.\u201d Hazen attached to the defendant\u2019s copy of said agreement, which had already been delivered to the plaintiff, a certified copy of the vote of November 9, and delivered the same to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">The other form of vote, enclosed in said letter of October 11, was also passed by said board of directors on November 9, and a certified copy thereof furnished to the New England Trust Company on November 14, and thereupon said company delivered up to the plaintiff the packages and documents referred to in said agreement of January 3, 1888, and in the triplicate agreement of March 30, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\">It appeared that nothing had been paid to the plaintiff by the defendant for the period between September 29 and November 14, except as appears in the above evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-7\">On the foregoing evidence, the plaintiff requested the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-8\">\u201c1. On the undisputed testimony in the case, there was no cancellation of the indenture of January 3, 1888, until November 14, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-9\">\u201c 2. Said indenture was not and could not be cancelled except by the mutual and united action of both parties to it, previous to the expiration of its term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-10\">\u201c 3. Unless the court shall find as a fact that the words, 1 Cancelled October 8, 1888, by mutual agreement between parties hereto,\u2019 \u2018 Cancelled October 8, by mutual consent between parties hereto,\u2019 wherever written on the indenture, were fully and unconditionally assented to by the plaintiff, then, as matter of law, they are void and meaningless, and do not affect the parties in any manner, and the indenture remained in full force and effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-11\">\u201c 4. The authority of Mr. Hazen, the treasurer, to cancel the indenture on the part of the defendant, will not be presumed, but must be shown to have been authorized by (a vote of the directors of) the defendant corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-12\">\u201c 5. The only corporate action of the defendant corporation, whereby it acted lawfully and efficiently in any attempt to cancel the indenture, was by vote of its directors, November 9,1888, and such action only became finally effectual by acceptance by the plaintiff, November 14, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201c 6. The true construction of the vote of November 9, 1888, is that the \u2018 Standard Electric Company of Vermont does now cancel its agreement,\u2019 \u2014 that is, on the date of said vote; and not till such cancellation was assented to by the plaintiff by his release of November 14, 1888, in which he said, \u2018I ... do hereby consent and agree to the cancellation,\u2019 was such cancellation completed, and then only to the extent stated in said release.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">\u201c7. By the receipt and acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s release of November 14, 1888, the defendant corporation is conclusively presumed to have assented and agreed to its terms and conditions, and that the plaintiff\u2019s salary had not been paid, or settled, or compromised, up to that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-6\">\u201c 8. Unless the court shall find, by a preponderance of evidence, that the plaintiff waived his claim for salary provided for in the indenture, or that the defendant alleges and proves that the plaintiff did not, or was not ready to perform his part of the indenture, then the plaintiff will be entitled to a verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-7\">The judge gave the second and eighth rulings requested, and the fourth, omitting the words in parentheses, and declined to give the others, but found and ruled as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-8\">\u201c Upon the evidence in this case, I find that the offer of the plaintiff to terminate the contract of January 3,1888, made by the plaintiff to the treasurer of the defendant corporation on or about September 13, 1888, was accepted by the corporation, and that the defendant paid to the plaintiff the money, and did the other acts which by the terms of said offer it was required to do, as the consideration for the consent of the plaintiff to the termination of the contract of January 3, and that by reason of said offer, acceptance, and acts of the parties, said contract was terminated, and that the plaintiff cannot therefore maintain this action ; and I rule that there is competent evidence in the case to suppoi\u2019t the foregoing findings of fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-9\">'The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-10\"><em>S. H. Dudley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-11\"><em>C. M.

The act was not one which, in its nature, required a formal vote of the directors. The contract of March 30, 1888, under which the envelopes were deposited with the trust company, did not call for such formal vote; nor did the plaintiff stipulate for one. In the agreement for the cancellation of the original contract between himself and the defendant, he only stipulated for a written request which should be in fact the request of the defendant. This request, according to the finding of the court, the plaintiff had.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Moreover, the plaintiff accepted and kept the bonus of four hundred dollars paid to him by the defendant, as a part of the consideration for having the original contract cancelled. By keeping that money, he elected to treat the contract as cancelled. He cannot now be heard to say the promise therein contained to pay him a salary continued in force, since he kept the money which the defendant paid to him in order to obtain a release from that promise. <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Thurber, </em>149 Mass. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Without dwelling on other aspects of the case, it seems to us very clear that the finding of the court was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The fact that the defendant was willing to do everything it could afterwards to meet the wishes or requirements of the trust company, as well as the later requests of the plaintiff himself, does not weaken its legal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
