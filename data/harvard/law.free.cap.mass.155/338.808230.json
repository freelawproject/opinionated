Trial in the Superior Court, before Lathrop, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, which, so far as material to the points decided, is as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">The defendant set up in defence that the operations were not performed nor his wife treated with proper care and skill, and also that the nurses at the hospital where the operations were performed were negligent and careless in their treatment of the defendant\u2019s wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">The plaintiff testified that the defendant\u2019s wife eame to him for medical treatment and advice, and that he advised her to have the operations performed, and to go to St. Margaret\u2019s Hospital for that purpose. There was evidence that the defendant\u2019s wife thereupon placed herself under the plaintiff\u2019s charge, and, pursuant to his advice, went to that hospital and there saw the plaintiff and one Sister Gertrude, the head nurse at the same; and that the defendant\u2019s wife did not know that other doctors sent patients there, but supposed that it was the plaintiff\u2019s private hospital. There was no evidence that the plaintiff or any one acting for him represented to the defendant or his wife that St. Margaret\u2019s Hospital was a private hospital of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">On the question of the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility for negligence of the hospital nurses, the plaintiff asked a witness called by him, one Dr. Davenport, in whose general charge the hospital was, whether other physicians sent patients there; and also, on the question of the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s charge, what his standing was as a physician. The defendant objected to these questions, unless it could be shown that the defendant knew these facts; but the judge admitted the questions, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-9\">The plaintiff also asked Sister Gertrude, who was called as a witness by him, what sisterhood had the hospital in charge, who had charge of the nurses and patients there, and whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>plaintiff had anything to do with the selection of nurses. \u25a0 The judge, against the defendant\u2019s objection, permitted the witness to answer that the nursing at the hospital was in charge of the Sisterhood of St. Margaret; that patients were under the supervision of the mother superior; that Dr. Baker had nothing to do with the selection of nurses; and that different physicians in the city were in the habit of sending patients there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">The questions of the negligence of the plaintiff, and of his responsibility for negligence of the hospital nurses, were submitted to the jury, under instructions to which no exception was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-7\"><em>II. </em>_ZVI <em>Allin </em>6r. <em>L. </em>Mayberry, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-8\"><em>Q.

One of the issues was, whether the plaintiff was responsible for the negligence of nurses in the hospital where the defendant\u2019s wife was attended after the surgical operations were performed upon her. As bearing on this question, it was competent to show that the plaintiff was not the proprietor or manager of the hospital, and that it was in charge of the Sisterhood of St. Margaret. The testimony of Dr. Davenport and of Sister Gertrude was rightly admitted for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">It was immaterial that the defendant\u2019s wife supposed it to be the plaintiff\u2019s private hospital, inasmuch as neither the plaintiff nor any one acting for him ever made any representation to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">The testimony of Dr. Davenport, that he knew the standing of the plaintiff as a physician, seems to have been merely preliminary to something else, and it does not appear that he gave any testimony on this subject which could have affected the plaintiff in any way. Whether it would have been competent to show what the plaintiff\u2019s standing was on the question whether his charge was reasonable, it is unnecessary to decide. It is enough that it does not appear that the witness testified in regard to it, to say nothing of the fact that at the close of the evidence the defendant\u2019s counsel admitted the reasonableness of the charge if the plaintiff used proper care and skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\n<em>Bzeeptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
