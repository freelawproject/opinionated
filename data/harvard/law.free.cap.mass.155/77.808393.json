The tenant then brought another writ of entry against a grantee of the demandant to recover the premises, and at the trial admitted that, if the agreement by the attorney was authorized by him, it would be a bar to the action, but offered to show that it was unauthorized, and against his express direction. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was properly excluded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Writ or entry, to recover a life estate in certain real estate in North Attleborough.

Afterwards, the attorney signed an agreement that judgment be entered for the demandant, Sweet, but that the demandant take no costs. Judgment was accordingly so entered, and execution issued, and Sweet was put in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">In the present case Young\u2019s counsel admitted at the trial that, if the above settlement or agreement was authorized by Young, it would be a bar to this action, but offered to show that it was unauthorized, and against his express direction. This evidence was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Both Sweet and Young lived in this Commonwealth, and there was no question of the jurisdiction of the court, or of the authority of Young\u2019s attorney to appear for him, and to do such acts as were within his general authority as an attorney employed to conduct the defence of the action. The record shows a judgment properly entered. <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>6 Johns. 296, 300. If Young would impeach it, he must institute proceedings directly for that purpose. Being a party to it, he cannot impeach it in the present action. <em>Hendrick </em>v. Whittemore, 105 Mass. 23. <em>Needham </em>v.
