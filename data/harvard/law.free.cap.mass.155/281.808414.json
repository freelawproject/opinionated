This excavation was also admitted to have been made in accordance with the ordinances of Boston then in force, and which now are in force, unless they have been modified by the statutes above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">1. There can be no doubt that the statute in question is within the constitutional powers of the Legislature as a police regulation. It is an act for the preservation of the public health, and relates to the disposal of one of the most dangerous forms of sewage. As said by <em>Morton, </em>J., in <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>131 Mass. 306, 308, \u201c It belongs to that class of police regulations to which private rights are held subject, and is founded upon the right of the public to protect itself from nuisances, and to preserve the general health. The authority of the Legislature to pass laws of this character is too well settled to be questioned.\"\u2019 See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>115 Mass. 153, 155, and cases cited; <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>126 Mass. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">2. The defendant contends that the act was not intended to apply to houses already built when the act went into operation. But while the act is broad enough to apply to all buildings, the language of the section imposing a penalty on \u201c any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>violating any provision of this act \u201d (St. 1885, c. 382, \u00a7 22) is prospective in its operation, and applies to violations which continue after its passage, or which then come into existence. <em>Fickett </em>v. Durham, 119 Mass. 159. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>153 Mass. 343, and cases cited. The defendant, however, contends that, as her structure was lawful when built, an act of the Legislature which would render its use unlawful would be unconstitutional, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush. 53, 103. The statutes there in controversy related to harbor lines in Boston, and were not police regulations affecting the public health; and the language of Chief Justice Shaw in that case does not apply to a case like the one now under consideration. <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Hasten Railroad, </em>98 Mass. 431, 443. <em>Watertown </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>109 Mass. 315. <em>Train </em>v. <em>Boston Disinfecting Co. </em>144 Mass. 523, 530. <em>Rideout </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>148 Mass. 368, 374.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdT1\"><em>A. H. Pillshury, </em>Attorney General, (&lt;7. JV\". <em>Harris, </em>Second Assistant Attorney General, with him,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6F\"><em>W. H. Jewell, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">3. The only other question argued by the defendant is whether the structure existing in the defendant\u2019s yard is a water-closet, within the meaning of the act. We are of opinion that it is not. The Legislature, by the use of the word \u201c water-closet,\u201d intended an arrangement, then in common use, connected with a sewer, and having a permanent water supply which can be used systematically and regularly for carrying whatever is deposited therein to the sewer, and not a privy vault, which, although connected with a sewer, has no water supply for flushing it, except such as depends on chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The case comes before us on the report of a justice of the Superior Court, after a verdict of guilty, and the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
