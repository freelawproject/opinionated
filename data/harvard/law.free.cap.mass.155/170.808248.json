On cross-examinatian these witnesses were asked if at another time and place in Lowell they were not grossly intoxicated, and both witnesses denied that they were in any such condition at such time and place. The defendant then offered to show that both witnesses were at the time and place named in a state of gross intoxication, but the judge ruled that the evidence offered was not competent, and excluded the same; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-13\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>N.
