At the trial in the Superior Court, Mason, C. J., at the defendants\u2019 request, ruled that, upon the pleadings and the plaintiff\u2019s opening, he could not maintain the action, and ordered a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. The facts, so far as material to the points decided, appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-5\"><em>]$.

It stated that \u201c the snow lay perfectly level \u201d . where the curbstone was; that the plaintiff was driving through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the defendants\u2019 way \u201c into the way lying beyond, of which it was \u2022. . . an extension,\u201d to reach the works of the company for which he was working. It also stated that, before the defendants controlled the way under the written lease, they owned the premises, erected the building, paved the way, and put in the curbstone; \u201c that ever since this building and other buildings had been erected down there the public made use of that way, as they would use any other street in the city; that is, as much as they had any occasion to pass down there with teams or on foot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It does not appear that the plaintiff had any right in the way, unless he had it as one of the public. There is no allegation or statement that the plaintiff had ever used the way before, or that he knew the way was paved, or noticed whether there was a sign or not. Indeed, if he was then using the way for the first time, the fair inference would be, from the statement of the condition of the snow, that the fact that the way was paved was unknown to him until after the accident, and did not operate as an inducement to enter the way. The declaration contained no allegation as to any use by the public of the way, and the statement in the opening of counsel, that the public made use of that way, was qualified by the words, \u201c that is, as0much as they had any occasion to pass down there with teams or on foot.\u201d It is difficult to see how vehicles of any description could, when the paving was sufficiently visible to act as an inducement, go over that portion of the way which the defendants controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Without laying stress upon these points, we are of opinion that the declaration and the opening of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel do not show that there was any breach on the part of the defendants of any duty which they owed the plaintiff. The defendants were not obliged to put up a sign notifying travellers on the public street that the passageway was not a public way. <em>Galligan </em>v. <em>Metacomet Manuf. Co. </em>143 Mass. 527. <em>Reardon </em>v. Thompson, 149 Mass. 267. <em>Redigan </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>an<em>te, </em>44.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Nor can the fact that the passageway was paved be considered an invitation or inducement to the public to enter upon it for their own convenience. The defendants have a right to pave it for their own use or for the use of their customers. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine </em>Railroad, 125 Mass. 75. <em>Heinlein </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Providence Railroad, </em>147 Mass. 136. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>149 Mass. 267. <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Boston Maine Railroad, </em>151 Mass. 210. <em>Redigan </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine </em>Railroad, <em>ante, </em>44.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">There was in this case no allegation and no statement that the defendants had any knowledge that the public was using the passageway, or of such a condition of things that it can be said that they must have known of it. But if it be assumed that there was such use and such acquiescence that a license might be implied, the plaintiff stands in no better position. \u201c The general rule is,\u201d as stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Thompson, ubi </em>supra, \u201cthat a licensee goes upon land at his own risk, and must take the premises as he finds them.\u201d See also <em>Redigan </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, ante, </em>44; <em>Gautret </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>L. R. 2 C. P. 371, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The licensor has, however, no right to create a new danger while the license continues. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>102 Mass. 489, 502. <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Union Sugar Refinery, </em>98 Mass. 577. <em>Corby </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>4 C. B. (N. S.) 556. So a railroad company which allows the public habitually to use a private crossing of its tracks cannot use active force against a person or vehicle crossing under a license, express or implied. <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Old Colony Newport Railroad, </em>10 Allen, 368. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>133 Mass. 121. <em>Hanks </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>147 Mass. 495. See <em>June </em>v. <em>Boston Albany Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 79, 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">We have no occasion to consider whether the case of <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>151 Mass. 578, is open to the criticism that it is inconsistent with the doctrine that a person who dedicates a footway to the public use is not obliged to keep it in repair, (see <em>Fisher </em>v. Prowse, 2 B. &amp; S. 770, 780, and <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>15 C. B. (N. S.) 221,) as we are of opinion that that case has no application to the case at bar. In <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>the defendant made a continuous pavement in front of his house, partly on his own land and partly on the public land; and it was held that the jury might infer from this an invitation to walk over the whole pavement. In the case at bar, the defendants merely opened a private way into a public street, and we fail to see that they thereby invited the public to use it, even though it were paved.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
