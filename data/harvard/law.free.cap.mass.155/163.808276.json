It deals with offenders for offences committed after its passage, but it provides that, in considering the nature of an offence and the condition into which the offender is brought by it, his previous conduct may be regarded. The meaning of the statute in this particular seems clear, and we have no doubt that it is applicable to the case before us. With this construction it is not unconstitutional as an <em>ex post facto </em>law. In punishing offences committed after its passage, it punishes the offenders for a criminal habit whose existence cannot be proved without showing their voluntary criminal act done after they are presumed to have had knowledge of the statute. Such -an act is a manifestation of the habit, which tends to establish and confirm it, and for which the wrongdoer may well be held responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">That statutes of this kind are constitutional is settled by well considered adjudications of this court. <em>Ross\u2019s case, </em>2 Pick. 165. <em>Commonwealth v.
