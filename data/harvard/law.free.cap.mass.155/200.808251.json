The declaration was at common law, and alleged, among other things, that the accident was due to the defendant\u2019s employing incompetent servants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and to its suffering a mule spinning-machine to be defective and dangerous by reason of the want of a catch or hook to secure the shipper by which the belt operating the machine was guided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Mason, </em>C. J., there was evidence tending to prove the following facts. The plaintiff had been in the defendant\u2019s employ for many years, and was a \u201c mule fixer,\u201d and familiar with the machine in question, which consisted in part of a roller beam and carriage and spindles. At the time of the accident the machine was in the charge of one Swain, who had been sent by the Mason Machine Company to repair this and other mule spinning-machines for the defendant. The plaintiff had been directed, with others, by the defendant\u2019s overseer, to assist Swain, and was engaged in hanging weights on the machine to enable Swain to start and test it. The machine had three pulleys, the \u201c drawing-out \u201d pulley, to draw the carriage away from the roller beam, the \u201c drawing-in\u201d pulley, to draw the carriage towards the roller beam, and between them a loose pulley, upon which the belt ran while the machine was at rest. A \u201cball\u201d or shipper served to throw the belt from one pulley to another. Immediately before the accident, the plaintiff, in assisting Swain, was standing between the roller beam and the carriage, which was drawn out and at rest, and the belt was on the \u201c drawing-out \u201d pulley and the spindles were running. Swain had occasion to stop the spindles, and for that purpose took hold of the shipper so as to throw the belt on to the loose pulley. After he had moved the shipper it slipped from his hand, which was greasy, and the belt was thrown beyond the loose pulley on to the \u201c drawing-in \u201d pulley. The carriage thereupon was drawn in towards the roller beam, and the plaintiff was caught and injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">There was also evidence that at some previous time the machine had been furnished with a hook or catch, by which the shipper, after throwing the belt upon the loose pulley, could be fastened, and the belt kept on that pulley in case the machine was stopped for cleaning or any other purpose, but there was no such hook or catch on the machine when the plaintiff was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">The judge ruled that the plaintiff could not maintain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>action, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-5\"><em>JP. J. </em>Soar, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-6\"><em>S. D. </em>Stetson, <em>(L. LeB. Solmes </em>with him,) for th\u00e9 defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-7\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A85\">This is an action at common law, and not under the employers\u2019 liability act. The accident was due primarily to one Swain, a servant. There was no evidence tending to show that he was incompetent, and the plaintiff has not argued that there was. If we assume that Swain was in the employ of the defendant, then the accident was due to the negligence of a fellow servant. If he was not in the employ of the defendant, then he was in the employ of the Mason Machine Company, and for that reason the- defendant is not liable. The plaintiff contends, however, that the machine on which he was working was defective for want of a catch or hook to hold the \u201c ball \u201d or shipper, and that the accident was due to that fact. Even if we assume that, under the circumstances disclosed in evidence, the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for an accident occurring from a defect in the machine on which he was working, it is difficult to understand how the accident was due to any defect in the machinery. Swain lifted the shipper to stop the machine; it slipped from his hand, which was greasy, and threw the belt on to the drawing-in pulley, and caused the injury to the plaintiff. If there had been a catch, \u2014 and the absence of one is the only defect suggested, \u2014 it is impossible to see what good it would have done. It would not have rendered it unnecessary for Swain to take hold of the shipper, or have prevented the shipper from slipping out of his hand, and it was that which caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201e <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
