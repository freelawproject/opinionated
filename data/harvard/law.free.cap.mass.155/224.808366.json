The indictment was returned into the Superior Court on October 12, 1891, and alleged in due form that the defendant D\u00e9vine was tried in the Police Court of Lawrence \u201c for the crime of maintaining a liquor nuisance at said Lawrence \u201d on May 1, 1891, and on divers other days between that day and October 7, 1891; that at the trial in the police court Catherine Heaney then and there \u201c appeared as a witness, and was then and there duly sworn by said court to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, on the issue then pending between the Commonwealth and the said Patrick Devine; whereupon then and there certain questions became and were material to said issue between said Commonwealth and the said Patrick Devine, in substance and to the effect as follows, that is to say, whether on Monday the fifth day of October in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one, the said Catherine Heaney purchased of one Mrs. Devine, whose Christian name is to said jurors unknown, the wife of said Patrick Devine, a certain quantity of intoxicating liquor, and paid therefor the sum of fifty cents, it being then and there material for the Commonwealth to prove that the said Catherine Heaney did purchase a certain quantity of intoxicating liquor from said Mrs. Devine on Monday, the fifth day of October in the year last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>aforesaid, and paid therefor the sum of fifty cents ; and to these questions the said Catherine Heaney did then and there wilfully and corruptly testify and say in substance and effect that she, the said Catherine Heaney, did not purchase any intoxicating liquor of the said Mrs. Devine on Monday, the fifth day of October aforesaid, and did not pay therefor the sum of fifty cents, whereas in truth and in fact, as the said Catherine Heaney then and there well knew, she, the said Catherine Heaney, did purchase of the said Mrs. Devine on Monday, the fifth day of October aforesaid, a certain quantity of intoxicating liquor, and whereas in truth and in fact, as the said Catherine Heaney then and there well knew, the said Catherine Heaney did pay therefor the sum of fifty cents in money.

It is plain, upon the authorities, that the objection is not tenable on either ground. It is also clear that the principal and accessory may be both joined in one indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>7 Gray, 43. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>127 Mass. 15. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>129 Mass. 112. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>150 Mass. 394. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>111 Mass. 395. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Allen, 243. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Tuckwell, </em>1 C. &amp; M. 215. Train &amp; Heard\u2019s Prec. c. 15. The defendant further objects that the indictment does not allege that Catherine Heaney testified falsely, or that the defendant knowingly procured her to do so. The allegations were, in substance, that she wilfully and corruptly testified that she did not do certain things that were set out, whereas she then and there well knew that she did do those things, and that the defendant did feloniously and maliciously incite her to commit perjury in the manner and form aforesaid. This sufficiently avers that she testified falsely; and the words \u201c feloniously and maliciously \u201d import that the defendant knowingly procured the perjury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>7 Gray, 43. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>152 Mass. 577. There are other objections stated in the defendant\u2019s motion to quash, but we understand the above to be the only ones argued upon his brief, and therefore that the others are waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
