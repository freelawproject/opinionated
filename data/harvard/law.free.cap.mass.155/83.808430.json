The plaintiff testified that she was \u201c skipping \u201d over the crossing; that she had just called out to one of the girls ahead of her, \u201c and did not see any horses around before she started \u201d; and that while she was \u201c skipping along,\u201d and had got almost across, she was struck and injured as above described. On cross-examination she testified that, if she had not been \u201c skipping,\u201d she would not have been hurt; and that she knew that if she was struck by a horse and carriage she would get hurt. The plaintiff introduced evidence, which was contradicted, that the defendant\u2019s servant at the time was whipping the horse, and that the horse was trotting as he turned around the corner; and the defendant introduced evidence, which was also contradicted, that the plaintiff was warned by the other girls, who saw the defendant\u2019s horse and carriage approaching, not to go over the crossing; that the plaintiff answered them that she could get over before the carriage; and that she was \u201cskipping\u201d along without stopping when she was struck and run over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions, without more: \u201c If the plaintiff was <em>\u2018 </em>skipping \u2019 across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the way, and was warned of the approach of defendant\u2019s horse and carriage, and, although so warned, refused to stop, and was injured while trying to get across the way before the horse and carriage should reach her, and took the risk of so doing, she was not in the exercise of due care, and cannot recover for injuries received from her coming into collision with the said horse or carriage by reason of her said conduct.\u201d Having read the request to the jury, the judge said: \u201c I qualify that; it is for you to say whether or not, if she did \u2018 skip \u2019 across, and, refusing to heed the warning, persisted in going across, whether that was due care upon her part; if it was not, then she is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\"><em>M. Reed, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-7\"><em>A. N. Lincoln, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-8\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">It must be assumed from the verdict that the defendant\u2019s servant negligently drove around the corner into Brownell Street, and the only question presented to us is whether the instruction requested as to contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff should have been given. It cannot be said, as matter of law, that skipping across the street was of itself negligence. The jury may have thought that the usual gait of a girl not quite six years old. Ho high degree of caution in guarding against careless driving can be expected from such a child; and the doctrine of voluntary assumption of a risk must have but slight application. The instruction as given was proper and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
