The plaintiff testified that nothing had been said to him about a bond before the execution of the contract declared on. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor testified that shortly after he made the agreement of September 29 he might have told the architect that he was getting a bond fixed up and that it would be ready in a day or two. <em>Held, </em>that the questions whether there ever was an agreement that the giving of a bond should be a condition precedent to the contract becoming of binding force, and whether, if there ever was such an agreement, it had been waived, were for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-3\">Contract for damages resulting to the plaintiff from a refusal by the defendant to permit the plaintiff to carry out a contract in writing which provided that the plaintiff for an agreed price should do the fireproofing for a building for the Knights of Columbus at New Haven, Connecticut, being erected by the defendant as general contractors. Writ in the Superior Court for the county of Middlesex dated September 13, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\">The case was tried before <em>Hardy, </em>J. There was evidence tending to show that one Fernald of a firm called Burge and Fernald, having examined the plans and specifications of one Faxon, an architect, according to which the defendant was to erect the building in question, wrote to the defendant as follows: \u201cBoston, August 20,\" 1904. Messrs. Connors Bros. Boston, Mass. Gentlemen: It will cost for terra cotta arches, partitions, fireproofing beams, columns and girders in building for Knights of Columbus at New Haven, Conn., as per plans and specifications by John Lyman Faxon, architect, the sum of $8537.00. Concrete over said arches will cost $934.00 additional. Respectfully yours, Burge &amp; Fernald.\u201d A duplicate of the bid was sent directly to the architect, who later advised Fernald that'his firm was the successful bidder for the fireproofing, whereupon Fernald wrote to the defendant as follows: \u201c Boston, Sept. 6, 1904. Messrs. Connors Bros., Lowell, Mass. Gentlemen : Mr. Faxon advises us that we are the successful bidders on the Knights of Columbus Building at New Haven, in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>nection with you, and we would ask that, at present, you will please give us an acceptance of this work, and later on, if you care to make any contract, we could do so at most any time. We would like to close this work as we' want to order the goods. Respectfully yours, Burge &amp; Fernald.\u201d Later Fernald had conversations with the architect, with whom were most of his conversations regarding the fireproofing, and on September 29, 1904, as a result of such conversations, signed with other sub-contractors the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-3\">\u201c Sep 29 1904</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">\u201cIn re \u2018int work\u2019 for Knights of Columbus Building, New Haven, Conn. \u2014 under contract with the Connors Bros.
