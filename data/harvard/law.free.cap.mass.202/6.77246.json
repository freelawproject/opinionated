It appeared that about two or three weeks before the accident the defendant had taken up and relaid the sidewalk at the place where the plaintiff was injured, in the course of building a portion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tunnel for the city of Boston under a contract, some of whose provisions were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-4\">\u201cAll the work contemplated and described in this contract shall be done to the satisfaction of the engineer, who shall be sole judge as to the fitness of materials, and shall have the right of correcting any errors or omissions in the plans and specifications, when such correction is necessary for the proper fulfillment of their intention; the action of such correction to date from the time that the engineer gives due notice thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">\u201cThe engineer shall not be deemed to be the agent of the commission or the city for any purpose whatsoever, and shall have no power, direction, or control over the work embraced in this contract, except as herein expressly set forth, or as may hereafter be voted by the commission. The engineer shall have power, without further authority from the commission: to condemn all work which in his opinion is not done in accordance with this contract and specifications, or is not done to his satisfaction; . . . but such power and authority shall be confined to the direction or specification of what is to be done under this contract, and shall not extend to the actual execution of the work, which shall be in the control of the contractor, and for which the contractor alone shall be responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">\u201c Whatever method or plan is made use of in any part of the work or whoever is employed to do the underpinning, the Contractor shall not thereby be relieved of any of his responsibilities under this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-7\">\u201c The contractor shall be responsible for any injury which may result from his act or neglect. He shall exercise skill and great care in carrying on his excavation and other operations, and shall take suitable measures to prevent injury to buildings, the subway and other structures in or near the route of the tunnel.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">\u201c The contractor shall repave the street on a gravel base, and shall keep the surface over and along the trench and other excavations in a safe, neat, and satisfactory condition, and at its proper grade, for a period of one year after the work contemplated in this contract is finished, and shall be responsible for any accident that occurs on account of the defective condition of such surface. (See Article T.) \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u201c The contractor shall assume and have sole charge and possession of all the work included in this contract until the termination thereof, and shall be solely liable for all damage occasioned in any way by his act or neglect, or that of his agents, employees, or workmen, or of any person or persons in and about the work embraced in this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-3\">\u201c Article Q. The contractor shall indemnify and save harmless the city and commission, its and their officers and agents, from all suits or claims, of every name or description, brought against the city or commission, or its or their officers and agents, for or on account of any injury or damages to person or property received or sustained by any person or persons, by or from the contractor, his servants or agents, in or on account of work done under this contract or extensions of or additions thereto, whether caused by negligence or not, or by or in consequence of any negligence in guarding the same, or any materials or explosives, for the same, or by or on account of any improper materials used in its construction, or by or on account of any accident, or of any act or omission of the contractor or his agents; and the contractor further agrees that so much of the money due to him under this agreement as shall be considered necessary by the commission may be retained until all such suits or claims for damages as aforesaid have been settled, and evidence to that effect furnished to the satisfaction of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-4\">\u201c Article T. If, at any time before twelve months have elapsed from the date of the completion of the work contemplated in this contract and any amendment thereof or order for extra work as herein provided, any part shall, in the opinion of the engineer, require repairing, the engineer may notify the contractor, in person or by mail, to make the required repairs. If the contractor neglects to make such repairs promptly, to the satisfaction of the engineer, then the engineer may employ other persons to make the same and the expense thereof shall be paid by the contractor. The commission may cause the expenses of the repairs to be paid out of any money due the com tractor on account of this contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant requested the presiding judge to rule that (1) \u201c Under all the evidence and pleadings in the case the plaintiff cannot recover in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>action \u201d; and (2) that \u201c there was no evidence of negligence of the defendant contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d The presiding judge refused to make the rulings requested. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-3\"><em>M. O. Garner, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-4\"><em>Gf. P. Beckford, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b32-5\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0T\">There was evidence warranting a finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. She was a traveller upon the highway with nothing in the apparent conditions of the sidewalk to call for anything more than ordinary care on her part, and it could be found and must have been found that she was exercising the degree of care required of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">There was also evidence which warranted a finding that the accident was caused by the negligent manner in which the defendant had refilled the excavation and in which he had relaid the brick. There was evidence warranting the jury in finding that if the excavation had been properly filled and the brick . properly laid the accident would not have happened. The case was especially one for the application of the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur. </em>For a statement, of the doctrine, see <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>193 Mass. 438, 440.</p>\n<p id=\"Adi\">\u25a0 Evidence of the \u201c slide \u201d or \u201c cave in \u201d which occurred in the summer was admissible as tending to show the nature of the soil and as bearing in that way upon the degree of care required in refilling the excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">We do not construe the declaration as alleging that the defendant was engaged in the work of excavation at the time of the accident, but as meaning that at some time he had been, so engaged and had so negligently carried on the work as to permit the sidewalk to drop and that the plaintiff fell into the hole thereby caused. So construed, there was no variance between the pleadings and the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
