Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated September 17, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-12\">The case was previously before this court, when it was held in a decision reported in 199 Mass. 52, that, upon the evidence introduced at a previous trial, a notice to W. A. Knowlton, Esquire, was not a notice to the plaintiffs of the withdrawal from the defendants\u2019 firm of the defendant Atwood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-13\">The case was tried again before Pierce, J. Besides the facts stated in the present opinion, it appeared that the sales of goods for which recovery was sought occurred at various times between February 21, 1900, and August, 1900, and that the two firms or their predecessors had had business relations since 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-14\">As to the notice referred to in the third question to the jury, the bill of exceptions states : \u201c The plaintiff firm on the first of January, 1898, took into copartnership two new members, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>wit: Thomas F. Vietor and Thomas Schmidt. The plaintiffs gave no notice to the defendant Atwood, to the public nor to C. E. Spalding &amp; Company of this admission of these two partners, nor had they any knowledge thereof except that a written notice was put in evidence given on January 2, 1900, that Schmidt and Thomas F. Vietor were admitted to the plaintiff firm on January 2, 1900, which contained their authorized firm signatures. This was a year after the retirement of Atwood from the defendant firm, and more than a month before the plaintiff began the sale and delivery of the goods sued for.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The following questions were submitted to the jury by the presiding judge, and answered by them:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">\u201c 1. Did Atwood retire from the firm of C. E. Spalding and Company on January 1,1899, or July 1, 1899 ? \u201d Ans. \u201c January 1,1899. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">\u201c 2. Did the plaintiffs rely upon the responsibility of Atwood with the other partners of C. E. Spalding and Company in giving credit to the firm of C. E. Spalding and Company ? \u201d Ans. \u201cYes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">\u201c3. Did Atwood or C. E. Spalding and Company ever receive any notice of the admission of Thomas Schmidt and Thomas F. Vietor to the firm of Vietor and Achelis prior to the written notice dated January 2, 1900?\u201d Ans. \u201cNo.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">\u201c4. Were Thomas F.

F. Kimball, </em>for the defendant Atwood.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-12\"><em>W. A. Knowlton g S. H. Tyng, </em>for the plaintiffs, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-13\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHQ\">The defendant Atwood, being a member of a mercantile partnership composed of himself and the other defendants, to which from time to time the plaintiff firm sold merchandise in the usual course of trade, withdrew therefrom without giving to them notice of his retirement. In ignorance of his withdrawal, the plaintiffs, having sold goods to Atwood\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>former associates by whom the business was continued without any external change, seek in this action to hold him liable for the price jointly with them. It may be assumed that, before the change the plaintiffs transacted business with the firm on the faith of having Atwood\u2019s credit to look to in payment of debts. If commercially bound by the firm name while a member, he remained bound under the same designation until the plaintiffs, who in good faith dealt with the apparent partnership, had been actually notified of his retirement. <em>Stimson </em>v. Whitney, 130 Mass. 591. <em>Elkinton </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>143 Mass. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In bar of this liability it is urged first that before the present indebtedness was contracted the constituency of the plaintiff firm had been changed by the admission of new members, and that, as Atwood was not then a member of the defendant firm, he could not be held, because credit could not have been extended on the strength of his membership. But the plaintiff firm had undergone no internal transformation which destroyed its rights as a creditor, for in contemplation of law this defendant still held himself out as associated with his former partners. Nor was he exonerated even if uninformed of this change. A partnership like any undisclosed principal may enforce in the name of its members the collection of bills receivable, even if the contract was made by one of their number. It is no defense that they were unknown to the debtor, or that he was ignorant of the firm title or existence, although where the business of the firm has been ostensibly conducted in the name of one of the partners, the debt or claim, for purposes of set-off, recoupment, and payment, may be treated as his sole property. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>O'Kelley, </em>8 Cush. 406. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>98 Mass. 344, 348. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>125 Mass. 154. Upon the evidence the defendants traded with the plaintiff partnership as it then was constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is urged next that the plaintiffs should be held chargeable with notice of the withdrawal, because of the knowledge of this fact by Mr. Knowlton, an attorney at law, who at the time was acting as their general counsel. But as to this issue a full examination of the record shows that the testimony in all essential particulars is the same as at the former trial where it was decided that the knowledge of the attorney was not binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>on the plaintiffs, as he was not their agent for this purpose. <em>Vietor </em>v. Spalding, 199 Mass. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">The defendant\u2019s liability having been established by the answers returned by the jury to the questions submitted to them, a verdict for the plaintiffs was ordered rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
