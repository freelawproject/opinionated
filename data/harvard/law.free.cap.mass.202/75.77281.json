L. c. 173, \u00a7 57, and the defendant\u2019s answers thereto, from which it appeared that the defendant had received from the deceased person both money and orders upon banks for money which he cashed during the lifetime of the deceased person, but the defendant did not state in his answers why or under what circumstances he received them. Without there being any evidence that the deceased person intended the money to be either a gift to the defendant or a payment to him in satisfaction of a debt, the defendant rested at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and the presiding judge ordered a verdict for him. <em>Held, </em>that the verdict should'not have been ordered, since there was evidence from which the jury might have found that the money was received by the defendant to the use of the deceased person.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-8\">The evidence at a trial tended to show that M., an unmarried woman, had lived with her brother until his death in June, 1902, in a three tenement house which she owned in the north end in Boston, that at that time she was seventy-one years of age and after that time until July, 1904, had lived alone, being bedridden with cancer of the breast after March, 1903, that she did not care for her relatives and that they had nothing to do with her, that in April, 1903, she made a will giving all her property to a certain church; that one H., a woman, constantly urged, \u201c had her tormented to death,\u201d to sell her house, that much against her will she sold her house in July, 1904, the transaction being carried through in H.\u2019s absence by H.\u2019s son in law and a person who might have been found to have been acting as H.\u2019s attorney both at that time and in subsequent litigation regarding the matter, that M. felt very badly at leaving the house and was moved to H.\u2019s house by H.\u2019s husband in an unkind manner two weeks after the sale, that at H.\u2019s house M. grew rapidly worse; that on September 7, 1904, H. procured from M. orders for $8,300 which M. had in certain banks and procured the money; that on September 29 H. took persons who were calling upon M. aside and inquired of them what M. was going to do with her money, and on being told the disposition provided for in the will, stated \u201cI do not think that is right. ...

V. Grabill, </em>(J. <em>J. Corbett </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-3\">G. <em>R. </em>Swasey, <em>(J. F. Sullivan &amp; W. P.

Thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated his willingness to amend. The court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover and directed a verdict for the defendant. The ruling was made without regard to the form of the declaration.\u201d The case comes before us on an exception to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The learned counsel for the defendant conceded at the argument that the ruling made was a ruling that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff in an action at law. The case therefore may be taken to stand where it would stand were the writ a writ in tort or contract and a count for money had and received were inserted in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">It was contended in support of the ruling made by the presiding judge that the plaintiff must make out a case of fraud or undue influence, for the law will assume at the outset that the defendant has the $8,300 rightfully.</p>\n<p id=\"ADj\">Doubtless the law puts on the plaintiff the burden of proving that the $8,300 was the money of the testatrix. But when that was proved, a case of money had and received was made out without proof of fraud or undue influence. The plaintiff proved that the $8,300 was the money of the testatrix when he proved that the defendant received it from her. That he proved by her answers to the interrogatories filed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">All that the plaintiff asked the defendant in the interrogatories filed by him was: \u201c What sum of money \u201d she received from the testatrix on or about September 7, 1904. The defendant answered : \u201c About $8,300.\u201d In answer to further interrogatories the defendant stated that on September 7 she received an order on the Suffolk Savings Bank, an order on the Provident Institution for Savings, and two checks on the United States Trust Company; and received about $6,800 from the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>States Trust Company, about $400 from the Provident Institution for Savings, about $1,100 from the Suffolk Savings Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\">It is to be noted that although the defendant had the right under B. L. c. 173, \u00a7 60, to introduce into her answer any matter relevant to the issue to which the interrogatory answered related, she did not state how she came to \u201c receive \u201d the $8,300 which she did \u201c receive.\u201d She did not state that it was received for value rendered to the testatrix, or that it was a gift from the testatrix to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">This made out a case of money had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use. On these answers the jury were warranted in finding that the $8,300 which the defendant obtained from the Institution for Savings and the trust company were handed by her to the testatrix and then handed by the testatrix to the defendant. But a case of money had and received was made out even if that is not so. Where property belonging to, the plaintiff has been reduced to money after it was received by the defendant but before the action is brought, money had and received lies. <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>182 Mass. 255. <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>188 Mass. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The case must go back for a new trial, and for that reason we think it proper to consider the question which has been fully argued, namely, whether the jury were warranted in finding that the defendant wrongfully obtained the $8,300, or the orders and checks by which she obtained the $8,300,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It appeared that the testatrix, being then seventy-three years of age, died on October 10, 1904, from exhaustion produced by cancer of the breast from which she had been suffering for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The testatrix was a spinster and had been a cook in early life. For many years before July, 1904, (the July next preceding the October in which she died,) she had lived at 11 Cooper Street in the north end of Boston. Until June, 1902, her brother had lived with her. Her brother died at that time, and since then, until July, 1904, when the house was sold, she had lived alone. The house Ho. 11 Cooper Street contained three tenements. The testatrix lived in the lower tenement and let the two upper ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Her nearest relatives were two grand nephews and a grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>niece. The jury would have been justified in finding that she did not care for them and that they had nothing to do with her. In March, 1903, she became bedridden. From March, 1903, to June of that year she was taken care of by Grace Sullivan; from June, 1903, to the middle of November, by Josephine Gilman; and from November, 1903, to July, 1904, by Densy Gaddis, all of whom testified for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">In April, 1903, she made a will leaving all her property to the pastor of St. Mary\u2019s Church, for masses for the repose of her soul and of those of the deceased members of her family. St. Mary\u2019s Church was the parish church for the district in which she lived, and the church where she had been in the habit of worshipping. The jury would have been warranted in finding that the testatrix always had intended that her property should go to the church, and that she continued to be of that mind until she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">For some time before July, 1904, the defendant, who seems to have been a friend of the testatrix, had been urging her to sell her house 11 Cooper Street. Grace Sullivan testified: \u201cThe defendant Mrs. Houghton called there once or twice a week while I was there. Mrs. Gilman \u2014 Josephine Houghton at that time \u2014 succeeded me in caring for Miss McLaughlin. While she was there my mother and I called two or three times a week and would run up on Saturdays. Mrs. Gilman was followed in the care of Miss McLaughlin by Mrs. Gaddis, and while she was there mother and I called as before. At the time Miss McLaughlin said she did not want to sell her house, that she wanted to stay there as long as she lived, that Mrs. Houghton, the defendant, was down there and asking her if she was going to sell her house and telling her she knew of different ones who were willing to buy it if she wanted to sell it, that Mrs. Houghton had her tormented to death to sell her house. Miss McLaughlin said this to me at different times when I called there before the house was sold. The house was sold in July, 1904.\u201d The same witness testified that one Budrow, the defendant\u2019s son in law, and one Sullivan, came in while she was calling on the testatrix in July, 1904, The defendant\u2019s answer in this case is signed by one Sullivan. When Budrow and Sullivan came in, Budrow \u201c told her [the testatrix] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>he had sold the house and got the deed for the sale of the house and wanted her signature; and Mr. Budrow said he had carried out her affairs just the same \u2018 as if Mamma Houghton was there and we have put the money in the bank and I brought $300 down <em>here; </em>I guess that will be money enough for you to have in the house to pay any little bills there may be.\u2019 \u201d The testatrix then signed the deed and the son in law and Sullivan left. Whereupon the testatrix said: \u201cHe is very smart, but when I get a little better I will fix my affairs to suit myself.\u201d The purchaser then notified the testatrix to leave in two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">The witness\u2019s testimony then continued as follows: \u201c Before leaving the house Miss McLaughlin sat on a chair and cried and said she did not want to leave the house. Mr. Houghton, the defendant\u2019s husband, said to my mother \u2018 Hurry up, Laura, get her up to the house and I will pay you well for it.\u2019 My mother said 1 What do you mean? I\u2019m not here for pay.\u2019 He then walked away and did not say anything more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On the 29th of September (twenty-two days after Mrs. Houghton received the $8,300), the same witness with her mother called on the testatrix at Mrs. Houghton\u2019s. This witness testified as follows: \u201cWhile we were calling there, my mother asked Miss McLaughlin if she had changed her will and she said, \u2018 No, no, no ; Why should I ? The money that I have worked hard for is going to St. Mary\u2019s Church.\u2019 Just then Mrs. Houghton came through the hall and Miss McLaughlin put her fingers on her mouth and shook her head \u2014 told her not to say any more. I was present half an hour later on that day when Mrs. Houghton had a conversation with my mother. As we were in the hall leaving the house, she asked mother to step in to the parlor and said, \u2018 Mrs. Sullivan, what do you think Ellen is going to do with her money ? \u2019 Mother said \u2018 She has made a will and left her money to St. Mary\u2019s Church.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 Mrs. Houghton said, \u2018 I don\u2019t think that is right. Do you ? \u2019 Mother said, \u2018 1 think she has a right to leave the money she has worked hard for wherever she wants to,\u2019 and then Mrs. Houghton said, \u2018 If that is the case, let her get a trained nurse.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The mother of the last witness called on the testatrix two days before she died. Her testimony as to this visit was as follows: \u201cI called and asked Mrs. Houghton if I could see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Miss McLaughlin, she said she was dosing, but I said I would like to see her because I was in a hurry. So she brought me into the room and I stood down at the foot of the bed. Miss McLaughlin asked for her pocketbook. Mrs. Houghton\u2019s sister, Bridget Houghton, was standing there. (This is not the Bridget Houghton whose testimony is later set forth in the bill of exceptions.) Mrs. Houghton said Do you know what she is saying ? \u2019 I said \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am.\u2019 She said \u2018Why ! she says to put the woman in black out of the room.\u2019 All three of us were dressed in black and I asked which one did she say. As a matter of fact, Miss McLaughlin did not say what Mrs. Houghton said she said, but asked for her pocketbook. Bridget Houghton (not the witness whose testimony is later set forth) handed it to her, and she put her hand on it right like that (illustrating).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">After the death of the testatrix but before the funeral, one Bridget Houghton (apparently no relation of the defendant) called, seemingly to see the body. She testified: \u201c Mrs. Houghton asked me how I thought she looked, and said Ellen McLaughlin made her a present of $1,000 and that she was a great care. I said she was deserving of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">We are of opinion that this evidence warranted a finding that the defendant conceived the idea of possessing herself of the property of the testatrix; that the defendant tormented the testatrix to sell her house when she did not wish to, because she (the defendant) could not secure for herself the house as easily as she could the purchase money for it. Her husband was not taking the testatrix to the defendant\u2019s house, and the defendant was not taking care of the testatrix out of kindness. The occurrences of September 28 and October 8 showed that the testatrix was afraid of the defendant; and in addition the defendant\u2019s actions and remarks on September 29 require explanation at least, if she did not have some ulterior motive in what she had done in the house and in the care she was taking of the testatrix. Lastly, the defendant made a statement about the matter which was not true ; for, whatever may be found to be the fact, it is certain that the testatrix did not make a present of $1,000 to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">If the defendant did obtain for herself these goods in this way, a conversion during the lifetime of the testatrix was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>out, and that right of action passed on her death to the plaintiff as administrator with the will annexed. <em>Edgar </em>v.
