That Ellen M. Ware of Washington in the District of Columbia, died on August 31, 1906, leaving a will which was proved in the county of Suffolk on November 22, 1906; that the plaintiff and Albion Parris of Washington were named as executors in this will, and were appointed and qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-11\">2.

Barnes, Jr., Esquire, guardian <em>ad litem, </em>to represent minor children and persons unborn. He filed a report as such guardian, and the case was heard in the Probate Court upon his report by <em>George, </em>J. He made a decree declaring, among other things, that by the will the plaintiff, \u201cRichard Ware, took a qualified fee in the one undivided half part of the real estate mentioned in the petition, being part of the residue determinable in the event of his death leaving no will or lineal descendants, with an executory devise over to the nieces of the testatrix, daughters of her late sister, Emily H. Pierce, and to the lawful, living children of either of them who shall then be dead, by right of representation.\u201d The plaintiff, as the sole child and heir at law of Ellen M. Ware, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">Upon the appeal the case was heard by <em>Sheldon, </em>J. He ruled as a matter of law that the will of Ellen M. Ware created an executory devise, and that the plaintiff did not take an absolute fee. He ordered that the appeal be dismissed and that the case be remitted to the Probate Court, without passing upon the question of the power of the court on this bill to act upon the removal of the trustee. At the request of the plaintiff, he reserved the case, upon the pleadings and the evidence, for determination by the full court, such decree to be entered as justice and equity might require. The evidence was reported by a commissioner appointed under Equity Rule 35. By a photograph of the will of Ellen M. Ware, which was put in evidence by agreement, it appeared that the will was in the handwriting of the testatrix.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-6\"><em>C.

Ware by her holographic will gave certain real estate in trust, one pecuniary bequest, and to her son Richard her household furniture and other personal effects, and then proceeded as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">\u201c All the rest, residue and remainder of my property of every description whatever, real, personal and mixed, of whatever the same may consist, wherever the same may be situated, and whenever the same may have been acquired, whether before, or. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>after the execution of this will, I bequeath to my said son, Richard</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-3\">\u201c If the said Richard shall not survive me, or if he shall die leaving no will duly executed by him, or if he shall die leaving no lineal descendants, then in that case it is my wish, and I so direct, that it, the property above mentioned, shall at my son\u2019s death pass in equal shares to my nieces, daughters of my late sister, Emily H. Pierce and to the lawful, living children of either of them who shall then be dead, if any, such last named to take the share which would have gone to their mother had she continued to live.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">This residuary clause disposed of both real and personal estate, but we are asked now to determine only the nature of the estate taken by Richard Ware in land in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The rule for the construction of wills followed by courts in recent times is to ascertain the intent of the testator from the whole instrument, attributing due weight to all its language, and then give effect to that intent unless prevented by some positive rule of law, rather than to try to make the interpretation of particular words or phrases in one instrument square with that before given to somewhat similar words used by some one else under other surroundings to accomplish a more or less different end. <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>McCallum, </em>186 Mass. 464. A few combinations of words have become so fixed in their meaning by long and unvarying use as to be rules of property. But ordinary canons for the interpretation of wills, having been established only as aids for determining testamentary intent, are to be followed only so far as they accomplish that purpose, and not when the result would be to defeat it. <em>Crapo </em>v. <em>Price, </em>190 Mass. 317, 319. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>200 Mass. 310, 317. It is permissible also to look at all the material circumstances in the light of which the will was executed in order to comprehend the sense and purpose of the language employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The present testatrix was the mother of the petitioner, who was her only prospective heir. The latter, at the time of the execution of the will, was past forty years of age, and had never married. It was in her mind that the son might predecease her, that, surviving her, he might also die intestate, and that, although it was possible that he might leave lineal descendants, he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>reached middle age without having married, and might never do so. Being legally untrained, she attempted to express her thoughts on paper. She gave the residue to the son and devised it in the event of the son dying before her. Then by plain inference she gave him the power, if he survived her, to dispose of it by will, and by clear intendment also she provided that his lineal descendants should take it, if he failed to exercise the power. She expressed these last two alternative dispositions by the same form of subjunctive construction. But the meaning is the same as if she had expressly conferred the power, or made a devise to his offspring in the event of his intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">If she had intended to give the son a fee, it was idle to confer upon him a power to appoint by will. The express gift of this power by implication, excludes the right to convey or dispose in any other way. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>153 Mass. 137. The devise over to lineal descendants is strong evidence that she did not intend the estate of the son to possess the incident of descent to his heirs, and that therefore it was not a fee. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>162 Mass. 40. The language of the gift to the son contains no technical words of inheritance, so that the estate given him is a question of construction. <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>170 Mass. 540. There are no words like \u201c rest \u201d or \u201c remaining estate \u201d sometimes indicative of a fee or an absolute power of disposal <em>(Kelley </em>v. <em>Meins, </em>135 Mass. 231, 233), for the gift over is of \u201c it, the property above mentioned,\u201d which means the entire residue and is language apt to create a technical remainder. Although the clause is not grammatically or logically perfect, its meaning is not hard to discover. The testatrix intended the property, in the event that the son did not survive her, to go to the nieces, but if he survived her she intended it to go to him, not with the right to convey it away during his life, but with power to dispose of it by will, a power which could operate on 'the property only after his decease ; and she further intended that, if he did not make a will, it should go not to his heirs generally but to his lineal descendants surviving him, and finally that, in default of a will and such descendants, it should go to her nieces. The language expressive of this intent can in no part be brushed aside nor overridden without doing violence to the designs of the testatrix as written by her. There is in the will no word or phrase, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of itself, by force of some positive rule of law, regardless of other language, creates a particular kind of estate in any of the donees. Therefore the numerous cases, of which <em>Bassett </em>v. Nickerson, 184 Mass. 169, 173, and <em>Galligan </em>v. McDonald, 200 Mass. 299, are illustrations, are not in point. Although the devise to the son is not technically phrased to create a life estate, it appears from what follows in the will that this is all that was intended. Hence R. L. c. 135, \u00a7 22, is not applicable. The legal consequence of the language employed, giving all of it due effect, is a life estate to the son, with remainder to such persons as he by will may appoint, or, in default of such appointment, to his lineal descendants (R. L. c. 134, \u00a7 5; c. 154, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8), or if there are no descendants living at his death, then to her nieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">By emphasizing some parts of the will to the exclusion of others, or by putting one part of the testators intent above another, a different conclusion might be reached. But we have no right to do that. All the words of the will are satisfied and given some weight only by holding that the son took an estate for his life with power of appointment and remainders over in default thereof, as have been stated. The decree of the Probate Court is reversed, and a decree is to be entered in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
