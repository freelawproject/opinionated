In the course of the abolition of a grade crossing of a railroad with a way, a new street was constructed upon an embankment between and from twenty-four to thirty-eight feet above the premises leased and the cart path, entirely extinguishing the private way given in the lease. This new street was parallel to the cart path, but came to a dead end on the lessor\u2019s land. At the trial of a petition by the lessee for an assessment of damages suffered by him in the construction of the work of abolition, the presiding judge charged the jury that they might take into consideration the possibility or probability of the town\u2019s continuing a public street to the dead end of the street so left, and thus connecting the new street with the streets to which the cart path ran. <em>Held, </em>that the instruction was incorrect since it failed to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that, unless the petitioner had some means of access to the new street, the extension of the new street to other streets of the town was of no benefit to him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-3\">By the provisions of a lease of land, the lessor granted to the lessee for a term of ten years a portion of a large tract owned by him and a right of way from the leased premises to a cart path on the premises which he retained, which led in both ways to public streets. In the course of the abolition of a grade crossing of a railroad with a way, a new street was constructed upon an embankment between and from twenty-four to thirty-eight feet above the premises leased and the cart path, entirely extinguishing the private way given in the lease. This new street was parallel to the cart path, but came to a dead end on the lessor\u2019s land. Evidence was admitted on behalf of the respondent at the trial of a petition by the lessee for an assessment of damages suffered by him in the construction of the work of abolition, tending to show that the lessee had made no attempt to secure from the lessor a new right of way through the lessor\u2019s land to connect with the new street at a different point than the place where the former right of way existed. Under the lease the lessor could not be compelled to assign such right of way. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence wrongly was admitted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-4\">A lessee of real estate, who has erected upon the leased premises a factory with machinery, some of which is fixed and some movable, and who, by the extinguishment, in the course of the abolition of a grade crossing of a railroad with a way, of a private way given him in his lease, is prevented from using his factory or moving the movable machinery, in a petition seeking the assessment of the damages suffered by such work, under R.

Watson against this defendant and the town. It appeared that the petitioner was the lessee of premises shown on the accompanying plan from Clarence L. Watson. The term of the lease was ten years from April 2,1900, and it was duly recorded. It contained a provision that the lessee or its successors or assigns should \u201c have the right and option at any time during the continuation of this lease, to purchase said tract of land together with said rights of way,\u201d the price either to be agreed upon by the parties or to be determined by referees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\">The provisions of the lease with regard to rights of way followed immediately after the description of the land leased and were as follows: \u201cTogether with a right of way of at least twelve feet in width from the northerly line of said lot to the cart path, which runs over said other land of said Watson about one hundred and fifty feet north of said northerly line of said tract, and to a point on said cart path within two hundred feet at least from said railroad land, and together with a right of way over said cart path or other equally convenient way to said river and across the same, and a right of way in continuation over land now or formerly of John W. and Oscar Wolfenden to County Street, the same as granted to said Watson and Fred A. Newell by deed from Richard D. Manchester, ... or as otherwise possessed by said Watson or as appurtenant to said lands of said Watson or any part thereof. And together with a right of way over said cart path or equally convenient way across said railroad land to Maple street, the same as granted by said deed from said Manchester or as otherwise possessed by said Watson or as appurtenant to said lands of said Watson or any .part thereof. Such rights of way to run with said land herein demised as appurtenant thereto, for use by travellers on foot, and with teams and vehicles of any description, but not to be exclusive, nor shall the rights of way herein demised prevent the said lessor, his heirs or assigns from demising or granting the same rights of way to the lessees or assigns of other parts of said lands of said Watson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The \u201c cart path,\u201d referred to in the above quoted portion of the lease and in the opinion, is marked \u201croadway\u201d on the accompanying plan. Such \u201croadway,\u201d and the \u201cprivate way discontinued \u201d and the \u201c private way,\u201d shown on the plan, formed Maple Street. The right of way provided for the petitioner in his lease is marked on the plan \u201c Location of Petitioner\u2019s Right of Way before Construction of Olive Street.\u201d About six hundred feet from where Maple Street crossed Ten Mile River it joined with County Street, a town way. About four hundred feet from where it crossed the railroad it ran into South Main Street. Both County Street and South Main Street were parallel to the railroad. The only connection that the large tract of land shown on the plan had with the streets of the town was by means of Maple Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\"

These petitions are maintained for damages to the real estate, not for damages that may have been incurred by the parties because some contract was interfered with or because the business was interfered with as business. The statute does not imply that business losses are to be considered by you so far as the interference with the use of personal property is concerned or so far as the interference with certain contracts is concerned. . . . The question here is, What was the injury to the use and occupation of that realty, or that property attached to the realty, because of interference with its rights of access ?

Was it the intention of both parties that it should be made a part of the realty ? An option attached to the lease may be of importance to show that there was an intention on the part of the lessee when he had put it there perhaps to buy at the end of the term upon an agreed sum and it would become a part of the realty, that the sum that he paid perhaps would be less because of the attachments that he had made to the realty. That may be considered by you as bearing upon the question of intention. Did it become a fixture because there was an intention on the part of the lessee to remain there for a long time, to use the property, perhaps to buy it? But so far as an option attached to the lease is concerned with reference to any interference with that as a matter of damages or a claim for damages, you have no right to consider that as bearing upon the amount of damages that ought to be recovered in this case, because the interference with contracts between the parties is not to be considered, the interference with the personal property is not to be considered; that is excluded from your consideration. It is only the question of the value of the use and occupation, and the impairment of the value of that use and occupation by reason of any interference with such use and occupation. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\">\u201c As I have already said, that decree of July 2,1904, abolishing the private crossing over the railroad location, did not extinguish the rights of the Cornell-Andrews Company to the private way that existed from the northern boundary of its land to the old way called Maple Street, called the cart path in the lease. It did not abolish it. Up to the time that there was an entry upon the land by the town for the purpose of constructing a new way, it had the same right to use that way that it had before. Now in establishing the way over the premises, over this private right of way, the company still had the right to approach the public street that way provided it could do so by adapting that way to the new grade of the street, and when its officers or agents ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>rived, upon the surface of the new way, it had the right to cross it and had the right to pass off the new way over the limits of the old way to the cart path or Maple Street. I rule that as a Matter of law, because I have already explained to you that where a public way is established over land, the fee still remains in the owner, and if there is a private right of way, the right of way still exists for the purpose of approach to the limits of the public way, and you have the right to consider in the light of that law what interference there was with the accessibility to the old cart path at that time and what could have been done in connection with the approach to the new way. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-3\">\u201cWe are dealing here with the contract, a contract in the form of a lease, and as I view that contract it appears to me the proper construction is that there was an alternative right here to be considered by the jury as well as by the parties themselves in connection with the right of way. That is, if there was an interference on the part of Mr. Watson in connection with that use of the way, if he desired to change it in the future, [he agreed in the lease] that he would afford an equally convenient right of way for the Cornell-Andrews Company to the outer world, the Wolfenden bridge; that he would afford it either way, that is, on the way to the crossing and on the way to the Wolfenden bridge; and it is my duty, I think, to instruct you as a matter of law that under this interference that may have existed here With the rights of access to the Cornell-Andrews Company, that the company would have the right to call upon Mr. Watson to afford an equally convenient way by which access could have been obtained to outside property, and it is for you to say as a question of fact what would be an equally convenient right of .way. If you find that there was no convenient right of way that could be obtained in accordance with my instructions, then that leaves the petitioner, the Cornell-Andrews Company, in a condition to approach you and ask you what would be the damages under those circumstances, what would be fair and reasonable compensation for the loss of the use and occupation because that way could not be obtained. ... Now if you find upon all the evidence in this case that that reasonably convenient way could be afforded the Cornell-Andrews Company, it is my duty to instruct you that Mr. Watson under the contract would be obliged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>to grant it, and under the contract it would be the duty of the petitioner, the Cornell-Andrews Company, to apply for it. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-3\">In one of the petitions by Watson against the Town of Attleborough, and in one of his petitions against the defendant in this case the jury found for the petitioner, and verdicts were directed for the respondents in the remaining four petitions brought by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-4\">In the petition of <em>Cornell-Andrews Smelting Company </em>v. <em>Town of Attleborough, </em>the jury returned a verdict for the petitioner for $5,842.72, which verdict was set aside by the presiding judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">In this case, the jury found for the petitioner in the sum of $583.47; and the petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b617-6\"><em>J.

The cart path, with the connecting way on the west, being in existence at the date of the lease, is referred to without further description, but the passageway providing the only roadway from the leased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>premises is described as starting from the northerly line of the lot with a width at least of twelve feet, and thence running over other land of the lessor to the cart path about one hundred and fifty feet distant, which it was to join at a point within two hundred feet from land of the railroad abutting on the east. The termini and maximum width having been fixed, with the choice conferred on the lessee of determining at what point within the two hundred feet the passageway should take its departure, the subsequent location by user, in which the jury could find the lessor had acquiesced, operated as a definite assignment from which without his consent there could be no deviation. <em>George </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>114 Mass. 382. <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>119 Mass. 266. <em>Lipsky </em>v.

The covenant to assign equally convenient ways refers to ways then in existence to which specific reference is made, and a way by necessity did not arise, even if the jury found that by the course of events the petitioner, having been left in a <em>cul de sac </em>with the opening closed, was for a period cut off from any available method of ingress and egress necessary for the commercial use of its estate. A way of this nature comes into existence at the time of a grant which has omitted to provide access to the estate conveyed. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Pitman, </em>98 Mass. 46. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>151 Mass. 440. And it is only when a way is obstructed, or closed by the acts of the owner of the servient estate, that the owner of the dominant estate may depart from the located way and pass over other portions of the land. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>2 Allen, 543. Upon the establishment of the passageway the petitioner obtained an uninterrupted line of communication, which as between itself, the lessor, and the railroad corporation formed an indivisible easement. The leasehold accordingly should be considered as abutting on a continuous way, whose location was clearly defined, and could not be changed without a reassignment. Ki<em>llion </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>120 Mass. 47, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The rulings requested and refused as to the scope of the petitioner\u2019s appurtenant rights and the effect of the decree, as well as the instructions to the jury to which the petitioner excepted, were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Inasmuch as there must be a new trial at which the questions may again arise, we take up the exceptions to the rulings and instructions as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The eviction not having been caused by the acts of the lessor, there had been no breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment, as the lessee\u2019s occupation of the premises was subject to the exercise of the right of eminent domain. <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>194 Mass. 296, 298. The lessee\u2019s remedy therefore is under the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 153, as amended by St. 1902, c. 440, \u00a7 2. The freehold and leasehold being incommensurate, and no part of the reversion having been taken, if as to this respondent damages in gross were awarded for injury to the entire tract caused by the closing of the cart path at the crossing, the apportionment to the lessee would not measure the damages suffered in the extinguishment of the passageway in which the lessor had no inherent interest. If to avoid this objection the course pursued at the trial is followed, and for the assessment of damages the freehold is treated as severable, even then the injury to the reversion does not differ in kind from the injury to the remaining land, as the lessor made no claim that the buildings and fixed machinery formed a part of his estate. The rule of apportionment under R. L. c.48, \u00a7 20, where there are leasehold interests, even if held applicable in <em>Providence, Fall River &amp; Newport Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Fall </em>River, 187 Mass. 45, 50, to proceedings for the abolition of grade crossings, does not deprive a lessee from recovering compensation independently of the lessor, if a settlement has been made with him, or where the damages to the leasehold are distinct and separate from those suffered by the landowner. <em>Pegler </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>176 Mass. 101, 103. <em>Galeano </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>195 Mass. 64. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Howes, </em>75 Maine, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">But while the damages to the leasehold should have been assessed separately, no exceptions were taken to the instructions which seem to have been in conformity with the tenth request. By the verdict in his favor, however, which apparently has not been set aside, the lessor, having received compensation for injury to the reversion, has ceased to have any pecuniary interest in the present action, and no question of apportionment will arise at the second trial. It will then be open under the allegations in the petition for the petitioner to recover the difference between the fair market value of the leasehold, including the improvements, as of the date of the decree, and its value as left after the building of the street to its westerly end, with the elevation of the bed of the railroad at the easterly end, cutting off the use of the spur track. It also can recover any special and peculiar damages which have been sustained, so far as the property was rendered inaccessible for the carrying on of business during the progress of the work, together with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>injury affecting the use of the machinery, arising from the deposition of dust coming from the street while in process of construction. <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Midland Railroad, 127 </em>Mass. 571. <em>Lawrence </em>v.

Both were bound by the terms of the lease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>which as we have said conferred no alternative rights as to the passageway.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">The petitioner undoubtedly was required to make use of every reasonable means to obtain access to the cart path or to the street, and damages could not be enhanced by its inactivity, but until some proof appeared that such an effort was practicable, a failure to make the attempt would not diminish damages actually suffered. The evidence that either of these methods could have been adopted, or that the lessor had not offered a way in substitution, was wrongly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The petitioner, while permitted to show the value of the fixed machinery, was not allowed to introduce evidence of the decreased value of the necessary movable tools and appliances used in its business. But under our decisions there could be no recovery for injury to this class of property, even if by closing the passageway its removal had been made practically impossible during the period of construction. Nor could this be accomplished indirectly by proof of its valuation in connection with the fixed machinery, to be used as an element of computation in determining the damage caused by loss of access. The exclusion of this evidence and the refusal to rule that its value in any form could be recovered was correct, and the instructions given were appropriate. <em>Edmands </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>108 Mass. 535. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>182 Mass. 245. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>Blacker, </em>178 Mass. 386, <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>182 Mass. 537. <em>Boston Belting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>183 Mass. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It remains to determine whether the respondent is liable in the first instance for the petitioner\u2019s entire damages, or whether the damages are separable, to be assessed partly against the town and partly against the railroad. The crossing was a private way for which the street was built strictly in substitution, and the statute on which the decree rests makes provision for but one public work, without any distinction as to the relative importance of one part over another, in the adjustment necessarily required for the separation of grades. <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>180 Mass. 433. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>153 Mass. 218, 227. The railroad is primarily to pay for all damages \u201c which may be sustained by any person in his property,\u201d where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the discontinuance is of a private way. R. L. c. 111, \u00a7 153. St. 1902, c. 440, \u00a7 3. St. 1905, c. 408, \u00a7 2. If the railroad is to be held responsible only for the discontinuance of the portion within its location, the injury is the same in kind, even if the damages must differ in amount, from those caused by the ex-tinguishment of that portion of the way within the limits of the street. It is obvious that, when the passageway affording the only available means of entrance and exit had been extinguished, the petitioner would not have suffered any larger injury if the street had been laid out wholly within the confines of the cart path, for the discontinuance of which the respondent would then have been answerable. But in estimating damages the same result follows for, upon the appropriation of a part at each end leaving the intervening portion inaccessible, a complete discontinuance of the whole of the way from the northerly line of the leasehold had been worked. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>142 Mass. 324, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We are of opinion that the instructions which in substance restricted the liability of the respondent to the discontinuance of the portion of the cart path at the crossing were incorrect, and the jury should have been instructed that the petitioner\u2019s entire damages were to be assessed against the railroad corporation, with interest from the time when possession was taken for the purposes of construction.
