If it was then in force, his removal was unlawful and invalid. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of </em>Lawrence, 201 Mass. 506. If it was not then in force the respondents had the right to remove him from his position. The St. of 1906, c. 210, \u00a7 1, amended by St. 1907, c. 272, applies only to members of the police force in cities and to members of the district police, and does not protect the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\">It was provided by \u00a7 4 of St. 1900, c. 133, as follows: \u201c This act shall take effect upon its acceptance by a majority of the legal voters of said town present and voting thereon at an annual town meeting or at any town meeting duly called for the purpose. If the vote thereon is taken at an annual town meeting it shall be by official ballot in answer to the ques- \u25a0 tian, \u2018Shall an act passed by the General Court in the year nineteen hundred, to extend the civil service law to the police and fire forces of Natick, be accepted ? \u2019 \u201d The only acceptance of this act by the legal voters of Natick was on March 1, 1909, when the vote was taken by precincts, under R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 353, now embodied in St. 1907, c. 560, \u00a7 381, the provisions of which had been accepted by the town of Natick on March 22, 1906. But by that act it was only voting for the election of town officers and upon the question of granting licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors that was authorized to be done by precincts, and all other matters were to be in order only at a town meeting to be held within a time there specified. Accordingly it was held by this court that under similar provisions in St. 1898, c. 548, \u00a7 349, afterwards codified into R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 353, and now contained in St. 1907, c. 560, \u00a7 381, the St. of 1901, c. 78, for the extension of the provisions of the civil service law to the police and fire forces of towns that should accept that act, could not be accepted by a town by precinct voting. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>DeButts, </em>180 Mass. 155. In our opinion, that case is decisive upon the question before us. The provision in St. 1900, c. 133, \u00a7 4, that the vote shall be by official ballot, does not warrant the inference that the vote could be taken by precincts. The \u201c official ballot \u201d seems to have been first provided for in our statutes by the St. of 1888, c. 436. It meant alike in 1900, when the act before us was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>passed, in 1906, when the town of Natick accepted the act for precinct voting, and in March, 1909, when the town attempted to accept the act of 1900, as it still means, \u201c a ballot prepared for any election, caucus or primary by public authority and at public expense.\u201d St. 1898, c. 548, \u00a7 1. R. L. c. 11, \u00a7 1. St. 1907, c. 560, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">We are obliged to conclude that there has been no valid acceptance by the legal voters of the town of Natick of St. 1900, c. 133. It follows that this petition cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
