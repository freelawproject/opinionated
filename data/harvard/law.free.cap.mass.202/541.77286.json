A commissioner was appointed to take the testimony. The justice filed the following memorandum of findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-12\">\u201c I find in this case that the administrator has been honest in the administration of this estate, and that he exercised due care in realizing the assets thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>\u201cI find that he exercised due care in defending the action which was brought against the estate by Mrs. Barnes, and I find as a fact that the verdict of the jury in that case established the fact that the $3,409.82 which he had previously paid to her was justly due to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\">\u201cI find that the jury also found that in addition to the $3,409.82, there was due to her a further sum, which amounted to $632.18 when he paid it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">\u201c In defending that action I find that he exercised due care, and those two sums should be allowed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">\u201c I find that he also exercised due care in ascertaining whether the mortgage on the land in China, in Maine, [the \u2018 Davis mortgage \u2019 mentioned in the opinion and in the second objection in the second case] was a valid mortgage; that he was advised that it was not, and that he properly under those circumstances did not push the matter further and put the estate to expense in a matter in which he could recover nothing, and therefore I find that he was properly allowed the $507, the amount of the China mortgage, as a loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">\u201c I find as a fact that he paid the $2,000 note before the death of the intestate, and that therefore he should not be charged with the amount of that mortgage note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">\u201c I therefore affirm the first decree [the second decree appealed from] which was appealed from.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">\u201c So far as the second decree [the first decree appealed from] is concerned, there has been no evidence before me that there has been any breach of the bond which has brought any damage to the estate, and I do not know that there has been a technical breach. Possibly there has been. This argument that he should account for interest on sums because there has been a delay, whether it is in part due to him or not, is not enough to put in suit his bond, and I find that there is no such breach of his bond as would justify the Probate Court in ordering an action to be commenced upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-9\"><em>H.

The first of these cases comes before us upon an appeal from a decree of the Probate Court dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for leave to sue the respondent upon his offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cial bond as administrator of the estate of Nathan Crane. At the hearing before a single justice of this court, he found no evidence of any breach of the bond which had brought any damage to the estate, and did not find that there had been even a technical breach. He ruled that the bond ought not to be put in suit merely on the ground that the administrator should account for interest because there had been delay, whether that delay was due to him or not; and found affirmatively that there was no such breach of the bond as would justify the Probate Court in ordering suit brought upon it. In our opinion these findings were well warranted by the evidence, and we could not reverse them unless they were plainly wrong. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>193 Mass. 200. <em>Regester\u2019s Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>185 Mass. 226. Plainly upon these findings leave to bring suit upon the bond ought not to be granted. As to the first reason assigned in the petition, it is enough to say that the administrator does not contest the correctness of his account as reformed by the Probate Court; and that account, so reformed, appears to be a true account. The second and third reasons likewise are not supported by the facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\">2. The second case is an appeal from the allowance by the Probate Court of the administrator\u2019s accounts as reformed by that court. Neither one of the four specific objections made by the appellant to these accounts has been maintained by the evidence. The final payment to Mrs. Barnes was made in good faith after her claims had been established by litigation which the administrator exercised due care in defending. The amount due on the Davis mortgage, it was found, was properly allowed as a loss. The mortgage note which had been due from the administrator to the intestate was shown to have been paid to the intestate in his lifetime, and accordingly the administrator should not be charged with the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In each case the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
