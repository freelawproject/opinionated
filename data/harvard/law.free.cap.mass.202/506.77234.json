L. c. 175, \u00a7 22, is not bound by his testimony, and has a right to ask the jury to believe certain facts testified to by him and to disbelieve his explanations of them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b528-12\">In an action under R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 146, against a man and a woman to recover double damages for being bitten by a dog of which the defendants were alleged to be the owners or keepers, the presiding judge refused to rule that there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the dog was kept by the two defendants jointly, and allowed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff against both defendants. The man defendant, called by the plaintiff as an adverse witness under R. L. c. 176, \u00a7 22, testified that two years before the bringing of the action he sold certain dog kennels, theretofore established on his land and owned by him, together with the good will of the business done there,-to the woman defendant, who was in the employ of his wife, that after the sale the dogs continued to be kept on his land, that he accompanied them to various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>dog shows where they were exhibited, that he had accepted the fee for the service of one of the dogs, and that the woman defendant also took the fee for service when she was about. He also testified that he bought food for the dogs. He explained that, in doing the acts to which he testified, he was acting in behalf of the woman defendant, and that he paid over to her the money he received. There also was evidence that the two defendants had been seen walking together accompanied by a group of dogs, including the dog that bit the plaintiff, and that the man defendant had been seen feeding that dog. It further appeared that the kennels had been carried on under the same name before and ever since the date of the bill of sale to the woman defendant. The woman defendant did not appear in court. Evidence was introduced by the defendants that the woman defendant was licensed to keep various dogs on the premises, and there was evidence from which it could have been inferred that the dog which bit the plaintiff was included in the licenses. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence warranted a finding that after the delivery of the bill of sale the dogs were kept by the defendants jointly, and that the ruling of the trial judge was right.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">Tort under E.

Writ in the Municipal Court of the city of Boston dated July 25, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">The declaration contained six counts, the first of which alleged that the two defendants were at the time of the injury the joint keepers of the dog which caused the injuries; the second count alleged that the two defendants were the joint owners of the dog at the time; the third count that the defendant Johnson was the keeper of the dog at the time; the fourth count that the defendant Johnson was the owner of the dog at the time; the fifth count that the defendant Middlebrook was the keeper of the dog at the time; and the sixth count that the defendant Middlebrook was the owner of the dog at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Orosby, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">At the close of all the evidence, the defendants asked the judge to give to the jury the following instructions, among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\"><em>\u201c </em>9.

He also testified that he had bought food for the dogs. It is true that Middlebrook testified that he never had received any benefit or profit from any dogs kept on the premises since the sale in 1905; that when he took the dogs to shows it was done as a favor to the defendant Johnson, and that the fee for service received by him was turned over to her and the food bought by him was bought for the defendant Johnson. But, the plaintiff having called the defendant as an \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>adverse witness under the statute (R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 22), was not bound <em>by </em>his testimony. <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Work, </em>185 Mass. 427, and so the jury could accept the facts testified to by him and disbelieve the explanations. <em>Hankinson </em>v. <em>Lynn Gas Electric Co. </em>175 Mass. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">There was also evidence that both defendants had been seen walking together accompanied by a group of dogs, including the dog that bit the plaintiff, and that the defendant Middlebrook had been seen feeding the dog in question. It was in evidence further that the kennels had been carried on under the same name, to wit, Revere Collie Kennels, since the date of the bill of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant Johnson, to whom Middlebrook made the bill of sale of the Revere Collie Kennels as testified to, who \u201c was in the employ of his, Middlebrook\u2019s, wife,\u201d did not appear in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u201c Evidence was introduced by the defendants that the defendant Johnson was duly licensed, in accordance with the provisions of law, to keep various dogs on the said premises ; and from the description contained in several of the licenses, which were introduced in evidence, the jury might have inferred that the dog which caused the injury was included in the number so licensed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">We are of opinion that this evidence warranted a finding that after the bill of sale the dogs were kept by the defendants jointly within the rule laid down in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Malden </em>&amp; <em>Melrose Rail</em>road, 8 Allen, 101; <em>Collingill </em>v. Haverhill, 128 Mass. 218; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. Kemp, 152 Mass. 7; <em>Whittemore </em>v.
