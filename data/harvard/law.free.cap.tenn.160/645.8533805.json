Neal and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">The granting clause of the deed conveys a tract of land to Lillian Simpson, daughter of the grantors, by the phrase, \u201cwe . . . do bargain, sell, transfer and give to our daughter, Lillian Simpson, the following described piece of land, \u2019 \u2019 etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">Following the description of the land conveyed is the <em>habendum </em>clause which, it is conceded, purports to limit the estate of Mrs. Simpson to a life estate, with specific provision for remainder to her surviving husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>children, and if none such should survive her, to those persons who should he her heirs at law at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">It is contended for Mrs. Simpson that the granting clause purports to vest in her a fee-simple title to the land conveyed by the deed, thus creating an irreconcilable conflict between the granting clause and the <em>habendum </em>clause, which renders it necessary and proper to reject the latter clause in favor of the former. For this, complainants cite: <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Sprankle, </em>149 Tenn., 314; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>143 Tenn., 161; <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Sowder, </em>121 Tenn., 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">This inconsistency or repugnancy between the two clauses which is the foundation of complainant\u2019s contention, is neither apparent nor real. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>142 Tenn., 242; <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>75 Tenn., 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">All the cases cited hereinabove recognize that when the conveying clause fails to state, limit or define the estate granted, it may be limited or defined in the <em>haben-dum </em>clause; and this was the original office of that clause in deeds at common law. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Farley, supra, </em>page 165, quoting from 4 Kent, Commentaries, page 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The language of the deed before us is substantially the same as in the deed construed in <em>Beecher </em>v. <em>Hicks, supra. </em>That case is expressly distinguished in <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Sowder, supra, </em>at page 166, and the court there quoted from the earlier case: \u201cThe <em>habendum </em>is clearly not repugnant to the premises, but determines the estate granted, and only adds new grantees by way of remainder.\u201d This language correctly describes the deed before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The conclusion of the chancellor, that the deed vests in Mrs. Simpson only an estate for life, is not only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>accord with, the technical rules of construction discussed in the cited cases,- but enforces the manifest intention of the grantors. The decree of the chancellor will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
