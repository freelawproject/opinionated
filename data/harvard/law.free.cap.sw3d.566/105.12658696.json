The State filed the appeal pursuant to Arkansas Rule of Appellate Procedure-Civil 2(f) after the circuit court denied its motion for protective order and motion to quash. Because of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Protect Fayetteville v. City of Fayetteville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658633\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/565/477/\">\n    2019 Ark. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658633\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/565/477/\">\n    565 S.W.3d 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to dismiss the underlying case, the discovery issues presented in this case are moot. Nevertheless, because we find that these first-impression issues are of substantial public interest, we conclude that the mootness exception applies, and we hold that legislative and executive privileges exist in Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2015, the General Assembly passed the Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act. Act of Feb. 24, 2015, No. 137,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Ark.%20Acts%20570\">\n    2015 Ark. Acts 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Act 137). Act 137's stated intent is \"to subject entities to 'uniform nondiscrimination laws and obligations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Protect Fayetteville v. City of Fayetteville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371520\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/258/\">\n    2017 Ark. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371520\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/258/\">\n    510 S.W.3d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263. Following the passage of Act 137, the City of Fayetteville passed Ordinance 5781, entitled \"An Ordinance to Ensure Uniform Nondiscrimination Protections Within the City of Fayetteville For Groups Already Protected to Varying Degrees Throughout State Law.\" Protect Fayetteville and several city residents sued to invalidate Fayetteville's ordinance because it conflicted with Act 137. Fayetteville filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that no conflict existed or, even if it did, Act 137 violated equal protection. The State intervened to defend the constitutionality of Act 137. The circuit court concluded that the ordinance did not conflict with state law. Protect Fayetteville and the residents appealed, and we reversed and remanded, holding that Fayetteville's ordinance conflicted with Act 137 and \"therefore it cannot stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371520\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/510/258/\">\n    510 S.W.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following remand, the circuit court permitted PFLAG of Northwest Arkansas, Anthony Clark, Noah Meeks, and Liz Petray (collectively, PFLAG) to intervene and to file a counterclaim that Act 137 violated the Equal Protection Clause. PFLAG then initiated discovery with the State. They sent the State requests for production of documents, which involved the legislative and executive branches. In addition, Fayetteville and PFLAG subpoenaed two state legislators, Senator Bart Hester and Representative Bob Ballinger, for deposition. The parties attempted but were unable to resolve the discovery disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State filed a motion to quash the subpoenas and for a protective order barring the discovery requests. It claimed that the legislative privilege protected the legislators from deposition and that the legislative and executive privileges protected the State from producing documents held by the legislative and executive branches. Following the submission of briefs and a hearing, the circuit court issued an order concluding that legislative privilege provides \"no additional protections\n   for legislators in relation to discovery requests beyond the protection from being questioned about any speech or debate in either house\" and that the \"executive privileges asserted by the State are not recognized in Arkansas.\" Therefore, the circuit court denied the State's motions to quash and for a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    In October 2017, the State filed a Rule 2(f) petition requesting permission to appeal to this court and sought a discovery stay pending our review. We granted the Rule 2(f) petition and stayed the discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Mootness\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    A case is moot when a decision would not have any practical legal effect upon a then existing legal controversy.\n    <em>\n     Dillon v.

Without question, our decision in this matter would have no effect on the now-resolved controversy as a result of our decision to reverse and dismiss in\n    <em>\n     Protect Fayetteville v.

For this reason, we conclude, like the Supreme Court, that the Speech and Debate Clause affords legislators privilege from certain discovery and testimony and that the privilege extends beyond statements and acts made on the literal floor of the House. We therefore do not read the Speech and Debate Clause as narrowly as the circuit court did in this case and reverse his interpretation. However, we refuse to further set the parameters of the privilege without more facts before us. This is the more prudent course. The development will occur in future cases based on specific facts before us.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Executive Privilege\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Next, we address a second issue of first impression-whether executive privilege exists in Arkansas. We conclude that the Arkansas Constitution provides for the privilege.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Our state constitution provides a specific separation-of-powers provision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00a7 1. The powers of the government of the State of Arkansas shall be divided into three distinct departments, each of them to be confided to a separate body of magistracy, to-wit: Those which are legislative, to one, those which are executive, to another, and those which are judicial, to another.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00a7 2. No person or collection of persons, being of one of these departments, shall exercise any power belonging to either of the others, except in the instances\n    hereinafter expressly directed or permitted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Ark. Const., art. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. The separation-of-powers doctrine is \"a basic principle upon which our government is founded and should not be violated or abridged.\"\n    <em>\n     Fed.

Our separation-of-powers jurisprudence closely guards the balance of powers between branches, with each branch being delegated specified powers. \"The legislative branch ... has the power and responsibility to proclaim the law through statutory enactments. The judicial branch has the power and responsibility to interpret the legislative enactments. The executive branch has the power and responsibility to enforce the laws as enacted and interpreted by the other two branches.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1664976\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/265/187/#p197\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The executive privilege was first and perhaps most notably exercised in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The majority opinion gives no direction to the bench or bar that would permit the privileges to be properly applied, thus requiring the scope of the privileges to be developed entirely in future litigation. Because we cannot delve into the scope of the applicable privileges in this case, I would wait to address this issue until we are presented with a case that permits us to address what materials are covered by the privileges. Accordingly, I would simply dismiss the appeal as moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Baker, J., joins.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
