The grantors of the right conveyed the mineral interest to a third party without notifying the holders. More than four years later, the rightholders learned of the conveyance and sued the third party for breach, seeking specific performance. The trial court rendered judgment for the holders, but the court of appeals reversed, holding that the statute of limitations bars the claim. Specifically, the court of appeals held that the rightholders' cause of action accrued when the grantors conveyed the property without notice and that the discovery rule does not apply to defer accrual. We agree with the court of appeals' first conclusion but disagree with the second. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment in part and reinstate the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 12, 2003, members of the Cook family executed a warranty deed conveying the surface estate of a tract of land in Hansford County, Texas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the trustees of the Carl M. Archer Trust No. Three and the Mary Frances G. Archer Trust No. 3 (Trustees).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sellers retained ownership of the mineral estate but separately granted Trustees a right of first refusal (ROFR) to purchase the minerals. The ROFR stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [The Cooks] ... have sold and granted, and by these presence do hereby SELL and GRANT unto [Trustees] the Right of First Refusal to purchase the following land described as follows, to-wit:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Tract 4: All of the oil, gas, and other minerals in, on or under W/2 of Section 85, Block 4-T, T &amp; NO Ry. Co. Survey, Ochiltree County, Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This right of first refusal shall be construed to mean that in the event that [the grantors], or their successors and/or assigns, desire to sell any or all of the above described property, [Trustees], their heirs or assigns, shall have the right to purchase the property, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as offered by any other\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   buyer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Trustees] shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of said offer to either accept or reject said offer. In the event that [Trustees] do[ ] not elect to accept said offer, and the property is purchased by the\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   buyer, set forth above, at the offered price, then this agreement shall be null and void and of no further\n   force and effect,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   as to the property so purchased ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The warranty deed and ROFR were filed in the Hansford County property records on June 16, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Trustees' attorney subsequently discovered that the ROFR erroneously described the property as being in Ochiltree County rather than Hansford County. The attorney drafted a Right of First Refusal Correction accurately describing the county. That document was signed by some of the original ROFR grantors and filed in the Hansford County property records in September 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 28, 2007, Sharon Sue Cook Farber and Rodney Farber-two of the ROFR grantors-executed a mineral deed conveying their interest in the Tract 4 minerals to Ronald Ralph Tregellas and Donnita Tregellas. The deed was recorded on March 30, 2007. Before conveying the interest, the Farbers did not notify Trustees of the Farbers' intent to sell or of the price, terms, and conditions of the Tregellases' offer. Nor were Trustees notified about the sale after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trustees learned of the conveyance over four years later, on May 4, 2011, when they were advised of it by a prospective oil and gas lessee. The next day, Trustees sued the Farbers and the Tregellases for breach of the ROFR and tortious interference, alleging that Trustees had the right to purchase the conveyed interest, that they had not been given notice of the sale, and that they \"desire to exercise their right to purchase the [conveyed] interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trustees sought damages as well as specific performance, asking the trial court to order the \"transfer of the property\" from the Tregellases to Trustees. They also requested attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants raised several affirmative defenses, including that the four-year statute of limitations barred the contract claims. Trustees ultimately amended their pleadings to nonsuit their claims against the Farbers and pursue relief against only the Tregellases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their amended pleadings, Trustees alleged that upon their receipt of notice in 2011 of the Farbers' conveyance to the Tregellases, Trustees' right of first refusal \"ripened into\" an option to purchase the conveyed interest at the same price and on the same terms and conditions, and that Trustees timely exercised that option by filing suit. They further alleged that the Tregellases purchased the interest with actual or constructive notice of the ROFR and thus \"st[oo]d in the shoes of the Farber[s].\" Trustees sought \"specific performance of the contract created by their exercise of the option to purchase.\" They also pled that the statute of limitations did not bar their contract claims because (1) the contract at issue was created when Trustees exercised their option to purchase the\n   mineral interest, which occurred less than four years before suit was filed, and alternatively (2) the discovery rule and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment tolled the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After a bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment for Trustees and granted specific performance, ordering the Tregellases to convey the pertinent mineral interest to Trustees upon their deposit of the purchase price-set at $9,000, the amount the Tregellases had paid-into the court's registry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also awarded Trustees their attorney's fees. In its findings of fact, the trial court concluded that by filing their original petition, Trustees \"exercised their right of first refusal under the ROFR to purchase the Farber interest from the [Tregellases].\" The trial court further found that the Farbers and the Tregellases did not disclose to Trustees that the Farbers were willing to sell their mineral interest, and that Trustees \"did not know, nor in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should they have known that the Farbers were willing to sell their mineral interests ... until they were notified of same by a third party on May 4, 2011.\" Finally, the court found that, had Trustees been notified earlier of that fact, \"they would have immediately filed suit to enforce their rights under the ROFR.\" In its conclusions of law, the court held that the Tregellases took the Farbers' mineral interest with notice of the ROFR and were not bona fide purchasers for value, that the statute of limitations did not bar Trustees' causes of action, and that Trustees were \"entitled to specific performance of the ROFR.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Tregellases appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the statute of limitations did not bar Trustees' claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court of appeals agreed and reversed, holding that Trustees' cause of action for breach of contract accrued when the minerals were conveyed without notice.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n    507 S.W.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2016). The court of appeals also held that the discovery rule does not apply to delay accrual because Trustees' injury is \"of the type that generally is discoverable by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n    at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, because the court's reversal on the merits impacted the propriety of the award of attorney's fees, the court severed the issue of entitlement to attorney's fees into a new cause, reversed the fee award, and remanded the severed cause to the trial court to redetermine that issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n    at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Trustees filed petitions for review of both judgments.

Rights of First Refusal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because Trustees' right of first refusal is central to this dispute, we begin with a discussion of the legal principles governing this interest. \"A right of first refusal, also known as a preemptive or preferential right, empowers its holder with a preferential right to purchase the\n   subject property on the same terms offered by or to a bona fide purchaser.\"\n   <em>\n    Tenneco Inc. v.

Generally, a right of first refusal requires the grantor to notify the holder of his intent to sell and to first offer the property to the holder on the same terms and conditions offered by a third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10018719\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/925/640/#p644\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Navasota Res., L.P. v.

More specifically, Trustees argue that the ROFR was not impaired or lost via the conveyance because the Tregellases took the property subject to that right, and Trustees retained the ability to exercise their option once they received notice. In addition, they argue that no legal injury could occur until they attempted to exercise their right because the ROFR did not bind Trustees; it merely provided them an opportunity to purchase upon notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We agree with the court of appeals that the rules governing the accrual of causes of action point to the date of conveyance as the accrual date for limitations purposes. Again, the ROFR was breached when the Farbers conveyed their mineral interest without notifying Trustees of the Tregellases' offer. At that point, Trustees' preemptive right was impaired despite the fact that the Tregellases took the property subject to that right. This is because even if Trustees retained the right to purchase the mineral interest (albeit from the Tregellases rather than the Farbers) once they learned of the conveyance, they lost their right to purchase the interest at the time contemplated by the ROFR:\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the property was sold to a third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9122911\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/105/667/#p673\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that a first-refusal right \"requires the owner, before selling the property to another, to offer it to the rightholder on the terms and conditions specified in the contract granting the right\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koch Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539869\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/1203/#p1214\">\n    918 F.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a rightholder who would not have exercised his option at the time of the grantor's breach has suffered no legal damage).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, a closer examination of Trustees' theory reveals its circular reasoning. As explained, Trustees argue that they were injured only when they attempted to exercise their option by seeking specific performance. Thus, according to Trustees, by suing for specific performance, they suffered an injury entitling them to sue for specific performance. At bottom, Trustees fail in their attempt to materially distinguish between an action to enforce the ROFR-which was breached by the Farbers in 2007-and an action to enforce a contract to purchase the mineral interest from the Tregellases, who acquired the interest subject to the ROFR.

That is, the Tregellases point to no evidence that purportedly would or should have put Trustees on notice before May 2011 that the Farbers had (or even may have) conveyed the burdened mineral interest.

We therefore reverse the court of appeals' judgment in part in Cause No. 17-0093, reverse the court's judgment in Cause No. 17-0094, and reinstate the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The sellers include Robert Lynn Cook, Sharon Sue Cook Farber, Brenda Jean Cook Smith, and Lacie Anne Baker Tidwell, individually and as co-trustees of the A.F. Cook Children's Trust, as well as those individuals' respective spouses, Sharon Kaye Cook, Rodney Farber, Ed Smith, and Trent Tidwell.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Trustees are Mary Archer Dixon and Carla Archer Johnson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Trustees initially named the Tidwells-two other ROFR grantors-as additional defendants, alleging they similarly breached the ROFR by selling their undivided interest in the Tract 4 minerals to the Tregellases without notifying Trustees. The Tidwells answered that their conveyance to the Tregellases was \"an oversight and unilateral mistake\" and that the conveyance had been rescinded, leaving the parties \"in the same position they were before the controversy was created.\" Trustees eventually nonsuited their claims involving the Tidwell interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    After filing suit, Trustees learned that the Tregellases had also acquired the mineral interest of the two remaining ROFR grantors-the Smiths-and Trustees amended their petition to seek specific performance as to that interest as well. The trial court rendered judgment for Trustees as to the Smith interest, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n     507 S.W.3d 423\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 437 (Tex.

The Tregellases do not seek relief here from that portion of the court of appeals' judgment, which is therefore final.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The trial court also found that Trustees were entitled to recover $25,666.00 from the Tregellases \"as the equitable adjustment required to put [Trustees] in the same position they would have been had the[y] been allowed to timely exercise their rights under the ROFR.\" Aside from their argument that Trustees' claims are time-barred, the Tregellases have not complained on appeal about this portion of the trial court's judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Tregellases also argued that the ROFR's incorrect description of the county rendered the ROFR \"ineffective\" under the statute of frauds. Both the trial court and the court of appeals rejected this argument,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184108\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/507/423/#p430\">\n     507 S.W.3d at 428-29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and the Tregellases do not reurge it here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Disputes often arise over whether a rightholder properly exercises the ripened option to purchase.

If Trustees were not injured until they sued for specific performance on May 5, 2011, surely they would not be entitled to any lease benefits the Tregellases received before that date.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    We limit our holding to this particular breach-conveyance with\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n    notice of the intent to sell or the existence of an offer-of this particular type of right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
