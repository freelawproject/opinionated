If the plaintiff does not do so, the trial court must dismiss the plaintiff's claims and award attorney's fees to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Lee Stinson and Anissa Stinson, the real parties in interest in this original proceeding, sued relators Timothy K. Wade; Robert Stephen Hawk; Gina Wade; Celia\n   Hawk; 407 Real Property Management, LLC; and 407 Gun Club, LLC, each of whom own or operate a sport shooting range. The Stinsons did not serve relators with a chapter 128 expert report. We therefore hold that the trial court clearly abused its discretion by denying relators' motion to dismiss the Stinsons' shooting-related claims. We also hold that relators have no adequate appellate remedy from the trial court's error. We conditionally grant mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Stinsons' pleadings, in 2006, they bought several acres of residential property in Denton County. In 2007, the Hawks and the Wades jointly bought property that adjoins the Stinsons' property. The Hawks and the Wades eventually formed 407 Real Property Management, LLC to hold their interests in the real property and 407 Gun Club, LLC to operate a shooting range at the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To build the shooting range, in 2014, relators placed two columns of shipping containers across their property. The Stinsons claim that relators' shipping containers divert the flow of rainwater so that it impounds upon and damages the Stinsons' property. Thus, the Stinsons assert a collection of claims (the Water Claims) against relators, including seeking declarations that relators violated a provision of the Texas Water Code and county flood plain regulations in constructing the shipping-container structure and pleading common-law claims of trespass, negligence, and private nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Stinsons also allege that relators' operation of the shooting range causes them fear, discomfort, annoyance, and inconvenience. They claim that they have \"lived ... in fear that stray bullets may shoot them, their guests, or their livestock,\" that the shooting scares their horses and hinders their ability to ride them, and that \"on multiple occasions, [they] have had to leave the [p]roperty to get away from the noise created by the shooting.\" From these facts and similar allegations, the Stinsons plead a second group of claims (the Shooting Claims) against relators, including negligence and private nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From both groups of claims, the Stinsons seek monetary relief, including damages caused by an alleged loss in the fair market value of their property. They also seek injunctive relief, a declaratory judgment, and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several months after the Stinsons filed their lawsuit, relators filed a motion for the trial court to dismiss the Shooting Claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They contended that chapter 128 of the civil practice and remedies code required the Stinsons to serve an expert report supporting those claims, that the Stinsons had failed to do so, and that the statute mandated dismissal of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   They acknowledged that the Stinsons had served a report by Randall Pogue, a licensed professional engineer, to support the Water Claims, but they argued that Pogue's report did not qualify as an expert report under chapter 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Stinsons responded to relators' motion to dismiss. They argued that Pogue's report satisfied chapter 128's requirements. Alternatively, they contended that relators waived any complaint about the sufficiency of Pogue's report by not timely objecting to it. They further asserted that section 128.053's expert-report requirement violated several state and federal constitutional provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relators filed a reply to the Stinsons' response. They argued that Pogue is not an \"expert\" as defined by chapter 128 and that he therefore could not submit an expert report complying with the chapter. They also asserted that relators' constitutional challenges to the expert-report requirement were frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court denied relators' motion to dismiss. Relators filed this original proceeding to challenge that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relators ask us to conditionally issue a writ of mandamus that directs the trial court to grant their motion to dismiss and to award them attorney's fees. Mandamus relief is proper only to correct a clear abuse of discretion when there is no adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Fain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12376755\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/917/#p918\">\n    514 S.W.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (Tex.

The Stinsons respond by contending that (1) service of Pogue's report satisfied section 128.053 's requirements; (2) section 128.053 required relators to complain about any insufficiency in Pogue's report within twenty-one days after receiving it, and they did not, resulting in waiver of any objections; and (3) on several grounds, section 128.053 's expert-report requirement violates state and federal constitutional provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Pogue's report is \"no report,\" and relators did not waive their objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pogue's report did not satisfy section 128.053 's requirements.

He did not provide opinion testimony about the standard of care for the operation of a sport shooting range or about the causation of harm from the activities of a sport shooting range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20128.051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 128.051(4). Rather, in his report, he provided opinion testimony about the engineering and developmental impacts of improvements made by relators to their property-impacts that may have been similarly attributed to a sport shooting range or any structure\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   -while discussing matters such as topography, drainage, and water flow. His report does not refer in any manner to the discharge of any type of firearm, i.e., to \"shooting,\" or to the alleged harms pleaded by the Stinsons with respect to the Shooting Claims, all of which\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the discharge of a firearm. Furthermore, in a discovery response that appears in the mandamus record, the Stinsons represented that they retained Pogue to testify about water-related matters and that relators' use of their property as a sport shooting range was \"irrelevant to determining\" the water code violations that Pogue would testify about. In a deposition, Pogue testified that none of his opinions depended upon relators' use of their land as a sport shooting range. Finally, Pogue signed a declaration in which he expressed that his opinions concerned the \"standards of care for designing water drainage plans so that water is not improperly diverted or impounded on adjoining properties.\" In the declaration, he stated that the \"standards of care relating to water diversion and impoundment apply equally regardless of the building's use (i.e., regardless of whether a structure is to be used as a shooting range or for some other purpose).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Pogue does not purport to have expertise about the appropriate standards of care for discharging a firearm, let alone for operating a sport shooting range, and because his report does not provide opinions about such standards, we hold that Pogue is not an \"expert\" under section 128.051 and that his report is neither an \"expert report\" under section 128.051 nor a good faith effort to constitute the same. The Stinsons therefore failed to serve an \"expert report\" under section 128.053.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20128.051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 128.051(3)(A), (4), .053(a), (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Consequently, there is also no merit to the Stinsons' argument that relators waived their objections to Pogue's report by not asserting them within twenty-one days after they received it. Section 128.053(a) requires only that objections to an expert report be filed and served within twenty-one days; because Pogue's report constituted no report at all under chapter 128, relators' obligation to object was never triggered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20128.051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 128.051(3)(A), (4), .053(a);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villarreal v.
