He claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when plea counsel repeatedly advised him that if he pleaded guilty to all of the charges, he would be sentenced to three and a half years at the most. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
