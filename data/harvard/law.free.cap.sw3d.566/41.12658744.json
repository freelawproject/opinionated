CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN . \u00a7\u00a7 27.001 -.011 (West 2015). Appellants Landry's, Inc. and Houston Aquarium, Inc. sued Cheryl Conley, Conley's reputed attorney Carney Ann Nasser, and Nasser's employer Animal Legal Defense Fund (\"ALDF\"), asserting a variety of claims in connection with the publication of Conley's notice of intent to sue under the Endangered Species Act for the appellants' allegedly inadequate care and housing of four white tigers, as well as the publication of other statements related to the planned suit. They also asserted claims for defamation, business disparagement,\n   tortious interference with prospective business relations, abuse of process, trespass, conspiracy to commit each of these torts, and conspiracy to commit theft. In connection with their defamation and business-disparagement claims, Landry's and Houston Aquarium additionally sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We conclude that the judicial-proceedings privilege applies to the allegedly defamatory or disparaging statements as a matter of law, and that Landry's and Houston Aquarium failed to meet their initial burden under the TCPA to establish by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of their claims of abuse of process, trespass, and conspiracy to commit theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Landry's and Houston Aquarium also contend that the TCPA violates the Texas Constitution's guarantee of the right to a jury trial and its open-courts provision. Most of their arguments are predicated on the existence of a material fact question or on the dismissal of only some of their claims. Because those circumstances are not present here, we do not reach those arguments. In their only remaining constitutional argument, we conclude that the TCPA's sanctions provision is not facially unconstitutional for allegedly vesting a trial court with too much discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Finally, Landry's and Houston Aquarium challenge the denial of their conditional motion for discovery and the trial court's awards of attorneys' fees and sanctions. We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the discovery motion, and the parties agree that the appellate attorneys' fees conditionally awarded for the work of a particular law firm on behalf of ALDF and Nasser are not recoverable because the firm withdrew from the case. As for the sanctions, we hold that the trial court's award of $450,000 in sanctions is excessive. We suggest remittitur to reduce the amount of sanctions to an amount equal to that of the trial attorneys' fees awarded. Specifically, we suggest remittitur of $146,814.74 from the $250,000.00 awarded to ALDF and $128,705.00 from the $200,000.00 awarded to Conley, bringing those awards respectively to $103,191.26 and $71,295.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Regarding Nasser, to whom no sanctions were awarded, we affirm the judgment as modified to eliminate the conditional award of appellate attorneys' fees to the law firm that withdrew from the case. As to ALDF, and conditioned upon ALDF's acceptance of our suggestion of remittitur, we affirm the judgment as modified to eliminate the same conditional award of appellate attorneys' fees and to reduce ALDF's sanctions award to $103,191.26. Regarding Conley, and conditioned upon her acceptance of our suggestion of remittitur, we affirm the judgment as modified to reduce her sanctions award to $71,295.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case centers on the disputed quality of the care provided to four white tigers exhibited at an aquarium and restaurant in downtown Houston. Houston Aquarium, Inc. owns and operates the physical facility known as the Downtown Aquarium, which is described as \"a high-profile six (6) acre entertainment complex\" that includes a restaurant built around a 500,000-gallon aquarium. Four white tigers also are housed at the Downtown Aquarium, and up to two of them can be viewed at a time in the exhibit known as \"Maharaja's Temple.\" The exhibit is designed to look like an ancient temple, and features steps, a statue, a swimming pool, an artificial tree, and a waterfall. Houston Aquarium is indirectly owned by Landry's, which identifies itself in its pleadings as \"one of America's leading dining, entertainment, gaming, and\n   hospitality groups,\" owning more than 500 properties, including restaurants, hotels, and other entertainment destinations. Landry's and Houston Aquarium generally do not distinguish between the two companies, instead referring to them both as \"Landry's.\" We follow the same convention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2015, radio-station owner Cheryl Conley considered producing a segment about wildlife and contacted Landry's to ask for a behind-the-scenes tour of the tiger's housing. Although Landry's charges the public an additional fee to access this part of the facility, it allowed Conley, as a member of the media, to see and photograph the tigers' holding pens for free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 19, 2016, attorney Carney Anne Nasser of the Animal Legal Defense Fund (\"ALDF\") and attorneys from the law firm of Irvine &amp; Conner PLLC sent Landry's notice of an intended suit against it under the Endangered Species Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201540\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The Endangered Species Act requires a person suing under the Act to first provide sixty days' written notice to the alleged violator and to the Secretary of the Interior.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1540(g)(2)(A)(i). The Notice Letter was written \"[o]n behalf of [ALDF] and Cheryl Conley, represented by Irvine &amp; Conner PLLC\" and informed Landry's \"of our intent to sue\" under the Endangered Species Act's citizen-suit provision. In the Notice Letter, it is alleged that the conditions of the tigers' exhibit and holding areas violate the Endangered Species Act and portions of the draft Tiger Care Manual produced by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (\"AZA\") for AZA-accredited organizations. Copies of the Notice Letter were sent to the Department of the Interior as required by federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Copies also were sent to the national and regional directors of the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the Endangered Species Act;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the registered agent for Landry's; to counsel for Landry's; and to Houston's mayor Sylvester Turner. On the same day, ALDF published a press release on its website about service of the Notice Letter. ALDF also sent a press release to Denver news station ABC-Denver7, where Landry's or an affiliated company owns another aquarium at which tigers are exhibited. The Denver news station wrote an article about the threatened suit, \"Downtown Aquarium owners, Landry's, facing possible lawsuit over tigers at Houston location.\" ALDF also provided a copy of the Notice Letter to the\n   <em>\n    Houston Chronicle\n   </em>\n   , which discussed the Notice Letter in its article, \"Animal rights group threatens to sue Landry's over tigers at Downtown Aquarium.\" A few days later, the internet website\n   <em>\n    The Dodo\n   </em>\n   published a similar article titled, \"White Tigers Stuck In Aquarium Haven't Felt The Sun In 12 Years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the ten days following the Notice Letter, ALDF made five Facebook posts about the tigers, and Nasser and ALDF executive director Stephen Wells each\n   \"tweeted\" about the tigers once. The law firm Irvine &amp; Conner wrote about the Notice Letter on the firm's \"news and blog\" page and maintained a link to ALDF's Press Release. The law firm also maintained a list of seven media outlets and links to articles related to the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fifty-nine days after ALDF sent Landry's the sixty-day Notice Letter, Landry's sued ALDF, Nasser, and Conley (collectively, \"the Conley Parties\") for defamation, business disparagement, tortious interference with prospective business relations, and abuse of process. Landry's also sued Conley for trespass. Finally, Landry's alleged that the Conley Parties conspired to commit each of the above torts, and additionally conspired to commit theft. Landry's sought actual damages of between $100,000.00-$200,000.00, exemplary damages, declaratory relief, an order that the Conley Parties retract the allegedly defamatory statements, and an injunction barring the Conley Parties from defaming or disparaging Landry's in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Conley Parties moved to dismiss the claims against them under the TCPA. They argued that Landry's asserted claims related to their exercise of the rights of free speech, petition, and association, and that Landry's was unable to make out a prima facie case for its claims. The Conley Parties also asserted that, in any event, the claims were barred by the judicial-proceedings privilege. ALDF and Nasser additionally argued that attorney immunity applied to the claims against them. Landry's maintained that it could make out a prima facie case for its claims, but asked that if the trial court disagreed, then the trial court should allow Landry's to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court granted the Conley Parties' motions to dismiss and denied the discovery motion. As sanctions for bringing the lawsuit and to deter similar actions in the future, the trial court ordered Landry's to pay $250,000 to ALDF and $200,000 to Conley. The trial court awarded ALDF $82,405.00 for the trial attorneys' fees of Ahmad, Zavitsanos, Anaipakos, Alavi, &amp; Mensing, P.C. and awarded $20,786.26 jointly to ALDF and Nasser for the trial attorneys' fees of Sprott Newsom Quattlebaum &amp; Messenger, P.C. (\"Sprott Newsom\"). Conley was awarded trial attorneys' fees of $71,295.00 for the work of law firm Mahendru, P.C. As to each of the three law firms, the Conley Parties also were conditionally awarded $50,000.00 for the firm's fees in the event Landry's were to file an unsuccessful intermediate appeal; $25,000.00 if Landry's were to unsuccessfully petition for review by the Texas Supreme Court; and $25,000.00 if Landry's were ultimately to be unsuccessful in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. Landry's superseded the judgment and moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration, modification of the judgment, or a new trial before bringing this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Landry's argues that the judgment must be reversed, in whole or in part, because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.

The Notice Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Landry's alleged that the Notice Letter is false and defamatory as a whole, and that it contains the following false and defamatory statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   For twelve years, Landry's has deprived these tigers access to sunlight, fresh air, natural surfaces, and species-appropriate environmental enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he tigers cannot jump or run and live entirely on unnatural and unyielding surfaces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The Tiger Exhibit lacks any naturalistic features or enrichment and does not offer the tigers any opportunities to mimic their natural behaviors, such as stalk or hunt, or hide from public view. For example, there are no tree trunks on which the tigers can sharpen their claws and no species-appropriate toys that would allow them to stalk, chase or pounce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Living on unnatural, unyielding concrete also increases the cats' risk of painful foot, joint, muscle, and circulatory problems and ulcerated or cracked footpads....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Indeed, the tigers have been observed pacing and lunging at the glass wall separating the tigers from the public-all common stress responses for tigers living in close confinement with no ability to seek privacy from the viewing public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Whether in the public Tiger Exhibit or Tiger Holding Area, [the tigers] do not receive adequate species-appropriate enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   As a result of these unnatural conditions, the four tigers experience pervasive stress and exhibit stereotypic behaviors not observed in the wild, such as incessant pacing.

ALDF's Press Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On the same date it sent the Notice Letter to Landry's, ALDF provided a Press Release to certain news outlets and published the Press Release on its website. Landry's alleged the Press Release is defamatory as a whole and that the following specific statements within it are defamatory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The [Notice Letter] alleges harm and harassment to a federally listed species: four tigers ... who are kept in deplorable conditions at the Aquarium....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   For the last 12 years, Landry's has deprived these four tigers ... of any access to sunlight, fresh air, or natural surfaces. These species-inappropriate living conditions violate the ESA....

Retiring the tigers to a sanctuary will guarantee that the tigers may spend the rest of their lives in the species-appropriate conditions that they need and deserve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Statements to the Media\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Landry's also alleged in its petition that the Conley Parties' statements to three news outlets were defamatory.

Conley declared that each of the allegedly defamatory statements that Landry's attributes to ALDF or to Nasser were made in connection their representation of her in the contemplated suit. Nasser additionally declared that she and ALDF were participating in the suit against Landry's solely as Conley's co-counsel with Irvine &amp; Conner and that it was not intended that ALDF would be a party to the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Landry's, on the other hand, argues that until it sued the Conley Parties, ALDF consistently held itself out as a party to the planned suit. This characterization is accurate, as is illustrated by some of the ALDF statements we have quoted. But because the judicial-proceedings privilege applies to parties as well as counsel, it makes no difference whether, at the time the statements were made, ALDF planned to participate in the suit as Conley's counsel or as her co-plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Objectively, the Notice Letter related to a contemplated judicial proceeding because it described the allegations that Conley and ALDF, whether on its own behalf or as counsel for Conley, intended to make in a suit against Landry's for violating the Endangered Species Act. The Conley Parties offered to forego the suit if Landry's would allow the ALDF to rehome the tigers. The Notice Letter is signed by an attorney with Irvine &amp; Conner and by Nasser, an attorney with the ALDF. The notice letter was in furtherance of Irvine &amp; Conner's representation of Conley and in furtherance of Nasser's representation of Conley or of ALDF, because the Notice Letter fulfills a statutory condition precedent to a citizen suit under the Endangered Species Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201540\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(A)(i). Because an attorney's conduct in drafting a mandatory notice letter on behalf of a client is absolutely privileged, the contents of a notice letter cannot serve as the basis of a defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krishnan v.

App.-Corpus Christi 2002, pet. denied) (privilege applies to notice letter required in a health care liability claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As for the subjective component, the evidence establishes that suit was seriously contemplated at the time the statements were made. Conley declared without contradiction that she retained counsel before September 1, 2016, to represent her in the suit against Landry's under the Endangered Species Act. Landry's itself produced evidence that its counsel and representatives attended a meeting with Nasser and Conley on August 2, 2016, at the office of Houston City Council Member Greg Travis, where the parties discussed both the future lawsuit and the offer to rehome the tigers in lieu of litigation. When Landry's refused ALDF's offer to rehome the tigers, Nasser tried to hand-deliver a notice of intent to sue, but Travis prevented her from doing so and told her to mail the documents. Nasser sent the Notice Letter to Landry's six weeks later. In addition to fulfilling a statutory prerequisite to suit, the Notice Letter elaborates on the Conley Parties' allegations by providing citations to federal statutes and regulations, case law, scholarly articles on tiger captivity and behavior, news articles, photographs of one of the tigers in the exhibit and in the holding pen, and a link to an uploaded video showing one of the tigers panting, lunging at a patron from behind the exhibit's glass wall, and walking back and forth along the glass wall. The evidence establishes that when the challenged statements were made in the latter half of September 2016, a lawsuit under the Endangered Species Act was not a mere possibility, and that the Conley Parties instead were taking affirmative steps toward litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Landry's argues that the Conley Parties had not been seriously contemplating suing Landry's because they did not do so prior to this appeal. But as previously mentioned, Landry's struck first, suing the Conley Parties fifty-nine days after Nasser sent them the mandatory sixty-day Notice Letter. The litigation of this case was intense from the beginning: ALDF and Nasser moved for dismissal under the TCPA on the same day that they answered the suit, and Conley filed a similar motion three days later. Although the case was dismissed just forty-eight days after the Conley Parties answered the suit, the record swelled to over three thousand pages in that time, and the Conley Parties incurred nearly $175,000 in legal fees. That the Conley Parties refrained from suing Landry's in federal court while simultaneously defending themselves against Landry's in state court does not give rise to an inference that they had not been seriously contemplating a federal suit before Landry's sued them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Turning to the Press Release, there is a split of authority about whether the judicial-proceedings privilege applies to press releases or statements to the press.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daystar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8893873\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/176/24/#p28\">\n    176 S.W.3d at 27-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (comments on result of autopsy report privileged where made to newspaper by attorney retained to file suit against same company based on a different but similar death)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dall.

Indeed, Landry's concedes in its reply brief, \"Attorneys have the right to publicize their cases,\" but Landry's errs in adding the caveat, \"but if they defame another in the process, they are held accountable just like anyone else.\" As the Texas Supreme Court has explained, it is the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of conduct that matters, and this is not changed by describing that conduct that \"wrongful.\"\n   <em>\n    Cantey Hanger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854054\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/477/#p485\">\n    467 S.W.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Landry's additionally contends that ALDF cannot claim attorney immunity-that is, the judicial-proceedings privilege as it applies to counsel-because it is not a law firm.

To the extent that these claims are based on statements for which the Exhibitors met their burden of proof, we must determine whether the Exhibitors produced clear and specific evidence of each essential element of the cause of action. We also must determine whether the Exhibitors satisfied their initial burden to produce evidence of each\n   essential element of their claims for abuse of process, trespass, civil conspiracy to commit theft, and their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Business Disparagement and Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   These two causes of action share a common element regarding damages. To prevail on a business-disparagement claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant published false and disparaging information about the plaintiff, (2) the defendant acted with malice, (3) the defendant's publication of the information was not privileged, and (4) the publication resulted in special damages to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p593\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Special damages\" are economic damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p593\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 592 n.11.

At the beginning of August 2016, USA Legal Support sought to book an event at the Downtown Aquarium but allegedly told a sales manager around September 20, 2016, that \"due to the recent tiger controversy, USDA Legal Support was concerned about the attention related to this and it no longer wanted to move forward with the event....\" Around October 27, 2016, the Danish Club of Houston inquired about booking an event to be held at the Downtown Aquarium a year later. On December 27, 2016, the Danish Club emailed Landry's that the members of the committee for the event decided to look at other venues and that the \"deciding factor\" in their decision \"was the recent publicity about the poor treatment of the tigers at the Aquarium.\" Landry's nevertheless failed to produce clear and specific evidence establishing a prima facie case that the Conley Parties' conduct caused actual damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p593\">\n    460 S.W.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (business-disparagement claim requires evidence of specific facts illustrating how the defendant's alleged business disparagement \"actually caused such losses\");\n   <em>\n    Burbage v.

There is no evidence that members of USDA Legal Support or the Danish Club of Houston had even read an allegedly defamatory statement by one\n   of the Conley Parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurlbut v.

Statements by the Conley Parties were not the only source of \"recent\" publicity and controversy regarding the way in which Landry's treated the tigers. The Aquarium's general manager from 2011 to 2017 admitted, \"There have been several protests at the Downtown Aquarium in 2015 and 2016 by animal [sic] activists....\" The\n   <em>\n    Houston Chronicle\n   </em>\n   also noted that a petition drive was launched by animal-rights activists in 2015. The Big Cat Rescue, the Texas Human Legislation Network, and Animal Defenders International all picketed the restaurant in December 2015, and \"Free Houston Tigers\" organized another picketing event for July 29-30, 2016. Landry's evidence also shows that on November 18, 2016, \"Free Houston Tigers\" posted a call for a boycott on the Downtown Aquarium's Facebook page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Second, even if it had been shown that a potential customer decided not to book the venue after reading one of the statements at issue in this case, Landry's still would have to show\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   statement the prospective customer read. Not all of the allegedly defamatory statements were false statements of fact published with actual malice, and not all statements are attributable to each of the Conley Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Landry's cannot rely on speculation to satisfy its burden of proof. Because Landry's failed to establish a prima facie case as to each element of business disparagement and tortious interference with prospective business relations, we affirm the dismissal of these claims. Dismissal of these claims additionally is required for the independent reason that the judicial-proceedings privilege defeats the defamation claims, and thus, the business-disparagement and tortious-interference claims, which are predicated on the defamation claims, must fail as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rehak Creative Servs., Inc. v.

Abuse of Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To prevail in an abuse-of-process claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) \"the defendant made an illegal, improper, or perverted use of the process, a use neither warranted nor authorized by the process\"; (2) the defendant \"had an ulterior motive or purpose\" in engaging in such misuse of process; and (3) the misuse of process resulted in damage to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

It is undisputed that Conley does own a radio station as represented, and there is no evidence that Conley was not then considering a wildlife segment as she stated. Landry's does not contend that Conley induced it to consent to the tour by representing that her coverage would be favorable, nor does Landry's allege that Conley knew Landry's consented based on such an assumption. Conley had consent to enter, to tour the property, and to take photographs, and she did not exceed the scope of the entry that was authorized.

For the right to a jury trial to attach, a party must demand a jury trial and timely pay the required fee. TEX. CONST . art. V, \u00a7 10 ; TEX. R. CIV. P . 216. Here, Landry's demanded a jury trial, and because motions to dismiss under the TCPA are addressed on an accelerated schedule, the jury fee was not due by the time the motions were decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Landry's argues that section 27.005(d) of the TCPA violates its right to a jury trial on its defamation-related claims because the statute requires a court to grant a motion to dismiss if the movant establishes a valid defense by a mere preponderance of the evidence. Landry's contends that there was conflicting evidence about whether ALDF and Nasser represented Conley, and thus, Landry's was entitled to have the jury resolve the factual dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Although this is indeed a question of fact, it is an immaterial one because it cannot alter the disposition of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP Am.

In particular, Landry's contends that it was denied the opportunity to cross-examine Nasser and Conley on the disputed facts regarding their claims of the judicial-proceedings privilege/attorney immunity. We disagree. The TCPA does allow limited discovery, which might have been permitted had it been properly requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section VII,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Landry's next contends that the TCPA violates the open-courts provision by failing to state how the trial court is to determine the amount of sanctions that are appropriate to achieve deterrence. But the TCPA is not unique in this. For example, Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code authorizes trial courts to impose sanctions for the signing of frivolous pleadings and motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN . \u00a7 10.001 (West 2017). A sanction under Chapter 10 \"must be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12372611\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/609/#p615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10.004(b). The statute does not state how this amount is to be determined, but the answer is found in case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nath v. Tex.

We conclude that these elements of the statute do not \"act as an impermissible pay-to-play barrier\" in violation of the open-courts provision because sanctions are imposed and litigation costs are shifted only after the claims are resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khalil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203389645\">\n    2017 WL 3389645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   We overrule each of Landry's challenges to the TCPA's constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. DENIAL OF CONDITIONAL MOTION FOR DISCOVERY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   According to Landry's, the trial court erred in denying its request for discovery. We review the denial of motion for discovery under the TCPA for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   At the same time that Landry's filed its response to the Conley Parties' motions to dismiss, Landry's separately filed a \"Motion, in the Alternative, to Conduct Limited Discovery.\" In the motion, Landry's stated that \"if the Court determines that [Landry's] pleadings and supporting affidavits do not satisfy [its] evidentiary burden under the TCPA, the Court should allow [Landry's] to conduct discovery under Section 27.006(b) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   This request for discovery was contingent upon the trial court's concluding that Landry's had failed to establish a prima facie case for each essential element of its claims; the TCPA, however, states that the trial court \"shall dismiss\" the action if the plaintiff fails to meet its evidentiary burden. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN . \u00a7 27.005. It does not authorize the trial court to permit discovery\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   concluding that the plaintiff's evidence falls short. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the conditional motion for discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Having now addressed each issue which could affect the dismissal of any of Landry's claims, we affirm that portion of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND SANCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   If a trial court dismisses a legal action under the TCPA, the statute requires the court to award the successful movant its reasonable attorneys' fees, other expenses as justice and equity may require, and sanctions \"sufficient to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7267021\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/420/454/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Regarding attorneys' fees, Landry's argues that if the dismissal of any claim is reversed, then attorneys' fees must be reassessed. Because we instead affirm the dismissal of each cause of action Landry's has asserted, this issue is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Landry's additionally points out that, regarding attorneys' fees for Sprott Newsom's representation of ALDF and Nasser, the trial court conditionally awarded these parties $50,000 in the event Landry's\n   were to unsuccessfully appeal to an intermediate appellate court; $25,000 in the event that Landry's were to file an unsuccessful petition for review; and a further $25,000 if Landry's were ultimately unsuccessful in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court after the petition for review was granted. Landry's asks that we vacate this portion of the judgment because Sprott Newsome does not represent ALDF and Nasser on appeal, and ALDF and Nasser state that they do not oppose this request. We accordingly sustain this part of Landry's fifth issue and modify the judgment to delete this award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finally, Landry's asserts that the trial court's assessment of $450,000 in sanctions is excessive. We review sanctions awards for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8421372\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/192/581/#p583\">\n    192 S.W.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam). A trial court abuses its discretion if the sanctions awarded are greater than necessary to promote compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Low v. Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311449\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/609/#p614\">\n    221 S.W.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (Tex. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   We begin with the acknowledgment that the TCPA mandates an award of sanctions in addition to the award of attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN . \u00a7 27.009(a). Attorneys' fees therefore do not appear to be awarded as a sanction. This makes sense, given that the TCPA's purpose is to prevent the bringing of meritless lawsuits that discourage the exercise of certain constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311449\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/609/#p614\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.002. Dismissal of such meritless claims is not itself sufficient to accomplish this because the party whose protected conduct is the subject of the claim is forced to bear the cost of vindicating those rights in court. An award of reasonable attorneys' fees and of just and equitable expenses is necessary not as a sanction, but simply to make that party whole. The award of fees and expenses therefore serves the same purpose as compensatory damages so that the party's future exercise of rights protected by the TCPA is not chilled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Sanctions awarded for a successful motion to dismiss serve a different purpose. They are awarded \"to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions\" in the future.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311449\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.009(a)(2). Although the TCPA does not expressly list the guideposts by which this amount is to be determined, an appellate court nevertheless must review the award to determine whether the trial court assessed that amount arbitrarily or without reference to guiding principles such that the award is greater than necessary to serve that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, ALDF and Nasser asked the trial court to impose a \"large fine\" and cited a TCPA case in which the trial court ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions of $250,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although sanctions are mandatory under the TCPA, Landry's did not address the request for sanctions in its 157-page response to the motion to dismiss or its 755 pages of exhibits. A week before the hearing, the Conley Parties filed a joint reply brief quantifying their sanction request and asking the trial court to impose sanctions of $500,000. They summarize their argument about Landry's conduct as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Nominally, \"Houston's most famous billionaire\" Tilman Fertitta has hired the world's third-largest law firm to sue for\n   less than $20,000. In reality, this suit aims to punish and deter lawyers and social activists who disagree with the way that Fertitta's company treats endangered animals. Plaintiffs' purpose for filing this suit is especially evident from their submissions of a 157-page response accompanied by written objections to each and every defense exhibit (including exhibits that Plaintiffs then try to introduce themselves). Despite a decade of news coverage of their tigers and the fact that all of the comments here are about a high-profile public [sic], Plaintiffs refuse to concede that free speech or public concerns are at stake. And rather than contesting only those issues on which there could be a good-faith dispute, Plaintiffs have again done what SLAPPs exist to achieve: slam disliked speakers with more than 500 pages of paper filled with baseless assertions that nonetheless require time and money to beat back. As one example among many, Plaintiffs will not even concede the elementary principle that there can be no such thing as a declaratory judgment proclaiming a statement to be defamatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The trial court heard the motion to dismiss at an oral hearing on the record, which appears to have lasted over two hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Landry's did not reply to the Conley Parties' request for sanctions of $500,000 until two days after the hearing.

The trial court reasonably could have considered the fact that Landry's filed this suit fifty-nine days after the Conley Parties served their sixty-day Notice Letter as some evidence of willfulness and an indication that Landry's sued first to pre-empt the federal claims. In fact, Landry's counsel argued in the trial court that it had to sue first rather than simply seeking dismissal of the Conley Parties' planned federal lawsuit because federal courts are reluctant to award attorneys' fees to successful defendants under the ESA. We also have evidence of frivolousness in that some of Landry's claims lacked any legal or factual basis.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

App.-Tyler 2014, no pet.) (defining \"frivolous\" as used in Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code as \"a thorough lack of factual or legal rigor in the party's position\"). For example, Landry's preemptively asserted an abuse-of-process claim against the Conley Parties before any process had issued-a frivolous claim. Landry's alleged that Conley trespassed on the facility even while acknowledging that Landry's consented to her visit-a frivolous claim. Landry's even alleged that the act of publishing the Notice Letter constituted conspiracy to commit theft as defined by the Texas Penal Code-a frivolous claim. As for Landry's requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, not only did Landry's ask for relief if it should prove only some of the elements of defamation, but Landry's also asked the trial court to both compel and restrain the Conley Parties' exercise of their right to freedom of speech-a request that Landry's itself acknowledged was foreclosed by binding precedent. Such claims are frivolous on their face, and predictably, Landry's failed to make a prima facie showing as to each essential element of these claims, as well as some others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Landry's produced no evidence of actual damages. Although some of the challenged statements might be considered defamatory per se, Landry's presented no evidence that those statements resulted in actual damages to its business reputation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section V.A.,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Regarding the effect of the sanctions on the offender, element (i), Landry's stated in its pleadings that it is \"one of America's leading dining, entertainment, gaming and hospitality groups,\" which \"owns and operates more than 500 properties, including more than 40 unique brands\" as well as \"numerous hotel properties and other entertainment destinations.\" From this, the trial court reasonably could infer that Landry's can afford to pay the sanctions imposed. And as for element (h) concerning the \"risk of chilling the specific type of litigation involved,\" TCPA sanctions are expressly intended to deter the type of claims that Landry's brought: meritless claims based on another's exercise of protected constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Although these considerations properly could influence the trial court to assess higher sanctions than it might in a different situation, the sanctions cannot be arbitrary. The trial court's discretion in assessing sanctions must terminate at some figure, beyond which the sanctions become excessive. That terminus is a specific number, and in determining whether the sanctions in this case exceed that number, we rely on two case-specific guideposts that are objectively quantifiable: we know the amount of the Conley Parties' reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses, and we know that the number of similar actions Landry's has filed is zero. As to the relevance of those facts, we find\n   <em>\n    Kinney v.

App.-Austin Apr. 11, 2014, pet. denied) (sub. mem. op.) to be instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   , BCG's claims were dismissed under the TCPA, and BCG argued on appeal that the $75,000 sanctions imposed bore no relation to the actual litigation costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we do, the\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   court analogized sanctions under the TCPA to sanctions under Chapter 10 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and therefore considered the losing party's litigation history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-12. In affirming the $75,000 sanctions award, the court noted that BCG had filed previous actions for the same alleged harm and had been ordered to pay $45,000 in attorneys' fees in one of those actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. The\n   <em>\n    Kinney\n   </em>\n   court therefore held that the trial court reasonably could have found that a sanction less than $75,000 was insufficient to deter BCG from filing a similar action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In contrast, Landry's has never filed a similar action, and there is no evidence that sanctions in the amount of the Conley Parties' reasonable attorneys' fees would be insufficient to deter Landry's from filing a similar action in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   We do not hold that an award in that amount was required, for it was well within the trial court's discretion to award less than that amount. But we do not review the award de novo. Because we review the sanctions award only for abuse of discretion, it is not for this court to determine anew what an appropriate sanction would be. We hold only that, on this record, the trial court lacked discretion to award an amount that is larger than the only monetary guidepost in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Because the trial court awarded ALDF sanctions in an amount 2.4 times greater than its attorneys' fees and awarded Conley sanctions of 2.8 times her attorneys' fees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that these awards are arbitrary, and to the extent that the awards exceeded the amount of the Conley Parties' respective attorneys' fees, they are excessive. We accordingly suggest remittitur\n   to reduce the sanctions to an amount equal to the attorneys' fees awarded to the Conley Parties for defending against the claims against them in the trial court. Specifically, we suggest remittitur of $146,814.74 from the $250,000.00 awarded to ALDF and $128,705.00 from the $200,000.00 awarded to Conley, bringing those awards respectively to $103,191.26 and $71,295.00. Thus, we sustain Landry's sixth issue in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   As a matter of law, the judicial-proceedings privilege applies to the factual statements at issue, and thus, the statements do not support claims of defamation, business disparagement, tortious interference with prospective business relations, or conspiracy to commit any of these torts. As for Landry's remaining claims for abuse of process, trespass, and conspiracy to commit theft, and its requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, Landry's failed to satisfy its evidentiary burden to establish a prima facie case for each essential element of the claim or request. Because there are no material fact questions in this case, Landry's was not entitled to a jury trial or an evidentiary hearing, and thus, the TCPA is not unconstitutional on those grounds as applied to Landry's. The TCPA also is not rendered unconstitutional by its failure to specify how sanctions are to be measured, and it does not violate the open-courts provision as alleged. We further hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Landry's conditional motion to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   We affirm the dismissal of Landry's claims, but modify the judgment to delete the conditional award of appellate attorneys' fees based on the representation of ALDF and Nasser by a law firm that in fact does not represent them on appeal. As modified, we affirm the judgment as to Nasser. As for ALDF and Conley, we conclude that, to the extent that the sanctions awarded to each of them exceeds the amount of that party's trial attorneys' fees, the sanctions are excessive. We therefore suggest remittitur to reduce the sanctions awarded to ALDF to $103,191.26 and to reduce the sanctions awarded to Conley to $71,295.00. Conditioned upon ALDF's and Conley's respective acceptance of remittitur, we further modify the judgment to reduce the sanctions awards as described, and as modified, affirm the judgment as to each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   ( Jewell, J., concurring and dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Kevin Jewell, Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   I concur in the court's judgment except for the sanctions issue. After careful review of the briefs and the record, I agree with the majority that the sanction imposed by the trial court is excessive. However, I disagree that this record supports any sanction above a nominal amount. I would reverse the portion of the trial court's order awarding sanctions against Landry's and render judgment against Landry's for sanctions in a nominal sum. Because the majority suggests remittitur to an amount I believe is unsupported by evidence, I respectfully dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The sanction's statutory basis is Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 27.009. It states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   (a) If the court orders dismissal of a legal action under this chapter, the court shall award to the moving party:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   (1) court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other expenses incurred in defending against the legal action as justice and equity may require; and\n   (2) sanctions against the party who brought the legal action as the court determines sufficient to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions described in this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 27.009(a). Based on section 27.009(a)(2), the trial court imposed $450,000 in sanctions against Landry's, finding that such an amount was necessary to \"deter Plaintiffs from filing similar actions in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   No other finding was made or requested.

According to Landry's, no evidence shows that it needs to be deterred from filing\n   similar claims. A review of the record reveals no evidence that Landry's has filed lawsuits similar to this one. Appellees presented no evidence that similar lawsuits are percolating and likely forthcoming in the future, such as evidence that Landry's has threatened future defamation lawsuits or that other instances of alleged defamatory statements against Landry's have occurred. Appellees also offered no evidence demonstrating that the amount of attorney's fees awarded (including conditional appellate fees) is insufficient in itself to deter Landry's from filing similar actions in the future. In my view, when, as here, a TCPA plaintiff has not asserted similar claims before, and is not shown likely to do so again, substantial sanctions based solely on section 27.009(a)(2) should be rarely appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Appellees contend the sanction is supported by (1) Landry's annual profitability, (2) Landry's \"shotgun\" allegations, and (3) the amount of attorney's fees incurred in defending those allegations.

Indeed, chapter 10 sanctions were at issue in\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   , and the supreme court later characterized the\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   factors as helpful in \"determining a\n   <em>\n    penalty\n   </em>\n   for sanctionable behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Assuming the\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   factors apply, appellees have not shown that they support the sanction. In reaching this conclusion, I constrain my analysis to those factors appellees asserted in the trial court and addressed in our court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Landry's alleged profitability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Appellees contend the sanction should be affirmed because Landry's is purportedly \"profitable.\" Assuming \"annual profitability\" is a relevant factor in assessing the amount of TCPA sanctions, appellees presented no evidence of Landry's current annual profit. In the trial court, appellees argued Landry's was a \"multi-billion dollar corporation\" owned by a billionaire, Tilman Fertitta. They attached multiple media publications discussing either Landry's alleged revenues or Fertitta's putative worth. Assuming the media publications regarding Landry's are admissible evidence, they purport to show nothing more than alleged gross revenue, not current profitability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Fertitta's alleged personal wealth is not probative because he is not a party, among other reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   According to the majority, the trial court could have inferred that \"Landry's can afford to pay the sanctions imposed.\" But the pleading allegations cited do not demonstrate profitability, and surmise or speculation will not suffice to withstand a due process challenge to sanctions, even assuming\n   analogy to chapter 10 sanctions is appropriate and the\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   factors apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unifund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7297578\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/299/92/#p97\">\n    299 S.W.3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the question is whether the amount is no more severe than necessary to satisfy the sanction's purpose, not whether a party can \"afford\" to pay it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Landry's \"shotgun\" allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Appellees also argue that the present lawsuit alone constitutes enough evidence of a need to deter because of the petition's \"shotgun\" character.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, generally, asserting multiple claims is not sanctionable. Asserting\n   <em>\n    frivolous\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    harassing\n   </em>\n   claims may be, but appellees did not argue in the trial court that sanctions should be awarded because Landry's claims were frivolous, factually groundless, or brought in bad faith. They did not cite Civil Practice and Remedies Code chapters 9 or 10, or Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 13. They did not invoke any basis for sanctions other than chapter 27. ALDF and Nasser asserted that the trial court could consider \"aggravating misconduct\" in assessing a sanction amount; however, they did not argue or cite evidence that Landry's engaged in any aggravating misconduct. Instead, they argued, superficially, that Landry's should either be sanctioned a \"large fine\" because it is a \"multi-billion dollar corporation,\" or \"relinquish\" the tigers in lieu of a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Appellees' failure to sufficiently develop this argument in the trial court as a basis for section 27.009 sanctions alone supports reversal. For example, appellees did not claim that Landry's filed this suit in bad faith. Therefore, to the extent a party's good or bad faith in filing an action is a factor in determining the just amount of section 27.009(a)(2) sanctions, Landry's is presumed to have filed this action in good faith and it was appellees' burden to allege and prove otherwise,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which they did not argue below and do not argue substantively in this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree with the majority that evidence of bad faith is lacking, but that observation warrants a more consequential one: the good faith presumption applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Given that Landry's is presumed to have filed its claims in good faith, I respectfully disagree with the majority's view that the decision\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   to file its claims constitutes evidence of a \"willful[ ] ... offense\" under element (b) of the\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311449\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/221/609/#p614\">\n    221 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   620 n.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first reason I disagree is because appellees have never advanced the argument. The second reason is because there exists no evidence of an \"offense\" that can be characterized as willful. The majority states that the trial judge could have inferred that Landry's filed its claims in state court fifty-nine days after appellees served their sixty-day notice letter as evidence of willfulness to \"pre-empt the federal claims.\" Landry's may have purposely asserted claims in state court to avoid a federal forum, but doing so is not an \"offense\" when the\n   claims themselves are presumptively motivated by good faith. The decision when or where to file suit is not sanctionable under these circumstances, so the degree of willfulness in that decision does not, in my view, support a sanction under\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   factor element (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Even if we consider the decision to \"pre-empt\" a potential federal suit as a \"willful offense,\" I am reluctant to justify the sanction on that ground when no evidentiary hearing has occurred to examine whether the decision is properly attributed to the client. Establishing \"willfulness\" under\n   <em>\n    Low\n   </em>\n   , would entail, I believe, raising the argument in the trial court, presenting evidence on the degree of willfulness of an identifiable offense, and possibly requesting additional findings under section 27.007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees did none of these things, which would have assisted the trial court in performing its duty to attempt to determine whether the offensive conduct (here, the timing of Landry's claims) is attributable to a party only, to counsel only, or to both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On the other hand, the majority presumes without deciding that Landry's presented clear and specific evidence to support the defamation claims, which are the crux of the suit. I would say further that the defamation claims grounded on appellees' charges that Landry's violated the Endangered Species Act were defamatory per se and not frivolous. Also, the majority notes a split in legal authority as to whether the alleged defamatory statements are subject to the judicial proceedings privilege, an affirmative defense. Thus, though we have today held that the privilege applies as a matter of law, Landry's legal position on the defense's inapplicability was not unfounded. Even assuming Landry's position on potentially applicable privileges had no basis in law, a court may not sanction a represented party for unfounded legal contentions.\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record reveals no proof that the sanction advances section 27.009(a)(2) 's deterrence interest or, assuming it does, that\n   a sanction in the amount imposed (or suggested as a remittitur) is of the minimum severity \"to deter [Landry's] from filing similar actions in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Though appellees did not advance a groundless pleading argument in the trial court, and the trial court made no such finding, sanctions for groundless pleadings have been moderate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904615\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/446/355/#p361\">\n    446 S.W.3d at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases), and even the remittitur amount the majority suggests is well above the median discussed in\n   <em>\n    Nath.\n   </em>\n   We should be especially cautious in upholding a much more substantial sanction, such as the one at issue, when a (partially) deficient pleading is not coupled with any proof bearing on the TCPA's explicit deterrence goal because the court cannot determine whether the sanction is \"sufficient to deter the party who brought the legal action from bringing similar actions described in this chapter.\" Tex.
