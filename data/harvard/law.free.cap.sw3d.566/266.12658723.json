Maurer argues the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on second-degree statutory sodomy as a lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy pursuant to Section 556.046.2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
