Hamidovic later filed a timely Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief arguing that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary because it failed to establish factually specific conduct for each element\n   of the charged crime. The Circuit Court denied Hamidovic's motion following an evidentiary hearing. Hamidovic appeals from that judgment. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
