The first question is whether the trial court properly dismissed certain claims against an administrative agency and its commissioner for lack of jurisdiction. We conclude that the trial court made the correct ruling, and we affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The second, and more substantive, question is whether Marta Diaz can recover death benefits on behalf of her late husband, Encarnacion, who died several weeks after suffering an on-the-job injury. Marta pursued her claim through the administrative process, but her claim was denied because she filed it thirteen months after her husband's death, and the insurance carrier objected that the claim was filed after a one-year statutory deadline. Marta sought judicial review of the administrative decision, and the trial court granted her relief after ruling on a set of cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court held that the carrier untimely raised the statutory bar, or in the alternative, that Marta established good cause for filing her claim after the one-year deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We conclude that the trial court erred by granting the summary judgment, and that neither Marta nor the carrier is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the trial court's judgment and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Encarnacion suffered a severe injury on April 16, 2010, when he was burned by hot oil while cleaning a fryer in the kitchen of a hotel. His employer promptly filed a first report of injury with Zurich American Insurance Company, its workers' compensation insurance carrier. Zurich notified the Division of Workers' Compensation and then paid compensation benefits to Encarnacion from April 17, 2010 to May 14, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Encarnacion died at his home on May 13, 2010. Zurich initially contested that Encarnacion's death was work-related and did not pay death benefits to Marta, his surviving spouse. Marta filed her claim for death benefits on June 21, 2011, more than one year after Encarnacion's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Zurich and Marta attended a benefit review conference (\"BRC\") in November 2011. Following the BRC, the Division issued a report stating that the parties had resolved one of their issues: they all agreed that Encarnacion had suffered a compensable injury that resulted in his death. The report further stated that the parties had two issues that were left unresolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Those issues were (1) \"Is [Zurich]'s defense on compensability limited to the existence of injury resulting in death defense listed on the\n   <em>\n    Notice of Denial of Compensability and Refusal to Pay Benefits\n   </em>\n   (PLN-[11] ), that was filed with the Division on 06/02/10?\"; and (2) \"If [Zurich]'s defense is not limited to the existence of injury resulting in death defense listed on the\n   <em>\n    Notice of Denial of Compensability and Refusal to Pay Benefits\n   </em>\n   (PLN-[11] ), is [Zurich] relieved from liability under TEX LABOR CODE ANN Section \u00a7 409.007 because of [Marta]'s failure to timely file a claim for death benefits with the Division?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Division conducted a contested case hearing (\"CCH\") in November 2012 to decide the disputed issues remaining after the BRC. Following the CCH, the Division issued a decision and order (the \"CCH Decision\"). The Division's hearing officer concluded that Marta was the proper legal beneficiary of Encarnacion, an issue which is undisputed in this appeal. The officer further concluded that (1) Zurich's right to dispute compensability of Marta's claim for death benefits was not limited to the basis identified in its June 2, 2010 notice; (2) Zurich was relieved of liability under section 409.007 of the Texas Workers' Compensation Act (the \"Act\") because Marta failed to file her claim within one year of Encarnacion's death; and (3) Marta did not have good cause for failing to file her claim timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Marta appealed to the appeals panel, but because the appeals panel did not issue its own decision, the CCH Decision became the final decision of the appeals panel by operation of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marta challenged that decision by filing a petition for judicial review in district court. She named as defendants Zurich, the Division, and the Division's Commissioner, Rod Bordelon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to Zurich, Marta requested the court to determine that she was entitled to death benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the Division and the Commissioner, Marta sought declarations that the Division and the Commissioner had \"committed\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts by failing to properly follow and enforce the Texas Workers' Compensation Act and [Division] rules.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Zurich answered and filed a plea to the jurisdiction seeking dismissal of all of Marta's claims, including her declaratory judgment claims, to the extent they exceeded the scope of issues decided during the administrative proceedings. The Division and the Commissioner answered with a general denial and filed a Rule 91a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity. The trial court denied the Division's and the Commissioner's Rule 91a motion, but dismissed all claims against the Division and the Commissioner by sua sponte granting a plea to the jurisdiction in their favor. The court also granted Zurich's plea to the jurisdiction as to Marta's declaratory judgment claim against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Marta and Zurich filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the remaining issues, and the trial court signed a final judgment that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) denied summary judgment for Marta on the issue of whether Marta's one-year deadline to file a death benefits claim was tolled because Zurich did not file a report of death separate from the initial report of injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) granted summary judgment to Marta on the grounds that (a) Zurich did not properly and timely raise the one-year limitations defense and Zurich was limited to the compensability defense raised in its June 6, 2010 notice disputing compensability, and (b) Marta alternatively had good cause for filing her claim after the one-year deadline because Zurich failed to notify her and the Division of the compensable death under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20132.17\">\n    28 Tex.

Marta also challenges the trial court's orders dismissing her claims against the Division and the Commissioner and granting Zurich's plea to the jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

If the movant produces evidence that conclusively establishes its right to summary judgment, then the burden of proof shifts to the nonmovant to present evidence sufficient to raise a fact issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centeq Realty, Inc. v.

We will sustain a no-evidence motion for summary judgment when (1) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller v.

Was the filing period tolled for Marta?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Marta moved for a partial summary judgment on the issue of tolling. She argued that her one-year period to file a claim for death benefits never began to run because Zurich filed a report of injury, but not a report of death. Without a report of death, Marta argued that her filing period was automatically tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Zurich argued in response that it was only required to file one report of injury because there are no provisions in the Act expressly mandating that any additional or supplemental reports be filed in the event that an injured employee subsequently dies. If a second report is not required, Zurich argued that its failure to file such a report would not toll Marta's one-year period to file a claim for death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court agreed with Zurich and denied Marta's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The issue was presented to the Division.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Before we address the merits of the parties' arguments, we first consider a jurisdictional argument that Zurich raises on appeal. Zurich contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over Marta's tolling argument because that issue was not raised or adjudicated before the Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The issues decided by the appeals panel are those decided in the CCH, as developed by the record of that hearing.

Not only do these cases relate to previous versions of the Act, they are distinguishable because the employer or carrier either did not file the requisite first report of injury or death at all, or filed the report after the claimant had filed his or her claim for benefits. These cases do not support Marta's position that an employer or carrier, despite having complied with section 409.005 in reporting an employee's injury, must also file a second report if the injured employee subsequently dies from the reported work-related injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Zurich complied with the clear and unambiguous language of section 409.005 by timely filing Encarnacion's report of injury with the Division. Further, section 409.008 does not trigger tolling when a timely reported injury results in death and a separate report of death is not filed. Thus, we conclude the one-year time period for filing a death benefits claim was not tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The trial court correctly denied Marta's motion for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In its motion for summary judgment, Zurich argued that it was relieved from liability because there was no dispute that Marta had filed her claim after the one-year anniversary of Encarnacion's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Zurich also addressed the two exceptions. Zurich argued that the first exception did not apply because there was no dispute that Marta was neither a minor nor incompetent. As for the second exception, Zurich framed its argument on both no-evidence and traditional grounds. Zurich asserted that Marta had no evidence of good cause. Zurich also argued that the good-cause arguments asserted by Marta in the administrative proceedings were invalid as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Marta filed a combined motion for summary judgment and response. Marta argued that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on either of two grounds: (1) that Zurich had waived its limitations defense by not asserting it within sixty days of the notice of Encarnacion's death; or (2) that \"good cause is established almost per se\" because Zurich failed to send her a plain language notice, as required by rule 132.17. In response to Zurich's motion, Marta argued that she raised a fact issue as to good cause for several reasons, including the following: (1) she did not realize that Encarnacion's death was work-related; (2) she does not read or speak English; (3) she has a limited education from El Salvador; (4) she was not provided any information from the Division or Zurich about filing a claim; (5) she only learned that Zurich no longer disputed that Encarnacion's death was work-related after she filed her claim; and (6) Zurich \"misled\" her by failing to inform her that she might be entitled to death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Zurich filed a reply, which reiterated its argument that Marta had not established good cause. And in response to Marta's waiver issue, Zurich argued that its burden to assert a limitations defense did not arise until after Marta had filed her claim for death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The trial court denied Zurich's motion and granted Marta's motion on both of the theories asserted in that motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We first\n   consider whether either of those theories is meritorious, beginning with the waiver issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Zurich was not required to assert a limitations defense within sixty days of the notice of death.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Marta's waiver argument largely depends on sections 409.021 and 409.022 of the Texas Labor Code. Citing these statutes, Marta contends that Zurich was required to assert its limitations defense within sixty days of receiving notice of Encarnacion's death, and that Zurich's failure to timely raise that defense resulted in waiver of the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Neither of these statutes expressly requires a carrier to assert the limitations defense within sixty days of the notice of death. If they did, then in most cases, a carrier would have to assert the defense preemptively because the carrier typically receives the notice of death more than sixty days before the one-year limitations period has even expired. Nothing in the Act or in our case law requires such a premature assertion of a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Act itself is silent as to when the carrier must assert the limitations defense.

Marta testified that she initially did not know why her husband died, but she believed that the death might have been the result of bad health care. She used a lawyer referral service and found a lawyer who agreed to represent her in a potential medical malpractice case. Through all of 2010, she did not receive a single letter or speak to a single person from Zurich or the Division.

The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment for Marta on that issue. I agree with the majority that the trial court erred in ruling that Zurich was required to assert section 409.007 within sixty days of the notice of death, but write separately to expand on the reasons why our holding is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Marta bases her argument on Labor Code sections 409.021 and 409.022, as well as rule 132.17(b). Section 409.021 provides in part that, if an insurance carrier does not contest the compensability of an injury on or before the sixtieth day after it is notified of the injury, it waives its right to contest compensability, absent evidence that could not reasonably have been discovered earlier. Tex. Lab. Code \u00a7 409.021(c), (d). Section 409.022 provides that the carrier's ground for refusal to pay benefits specified in the notice pursuant to section 409.021 constitutes the only basis for the carrier's defense on compensability, absent newly discovered evidence that could not have reasonably been discovered earlier.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434995\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/74/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 409.022(a), (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   My reading of the cited provisions in the context of the Act as a whole leads me to conclude, like the majority, that Zurich was not required to raise a section 409.007 defense within the sixty-day time period contemplated by section 409.021(c). First, whether section 409.021(c) applies to death\n   claims under the present circumstances is unclear because that section's sixty-day period runs from the date the carrier is \"notified of the\n   <em>\n    injury.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434995\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/74/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 409.021(c) (emphasis added). A work-related injury may cause an employee's death after the sixty-day period expires. In any event, assuming it applies, the sixty-day deadline relates to compensability issues of which the carrier would reasonably be expected to discover by sixty days after being notified of the injury. This conclusion finds support in related administrative rules. For instance, the deadline is reiterated in rule 124.3(b), which generally requires a carrier to, upon receipt of a written notice of injury, investigate the compensability of the injury, the carrier's liability for the injury, and the accrual of benefits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20124.3\">\n    28 Tex.

The issues of compensability or liability to which section 409.021(c) and rule 124.3 apply are those reasonably capable of determination within sixty days and, consequently, would generally focus upon whether the injury was work-related, an issue Zurich ultimately conceded.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tex.

By that time, the sixty-day time period of section 409.021(c) will have passed. Construing section 409.021(c) as Marta does would bar carriers from disputing a claim based on section 409.007 unless the issue is raised pre-emptively within sixty days of notice of injury-well before a beneficiary's one-year deadline to file a death claim has expired. This interpretation would largely nullify section 409.007 's one-year bar by compelling carriers to assert the defense before it has grounds to do so or else waive it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

If, upon completing its review, the carrier believes the claimant is not eligible to receive death benefits, then the carrier retains the right to dispute entitlement by filing within a specified time period a notice of dispute in the form required by rule 124.2, so that the matter can be resolved through the Division's dispute resolution process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20132.17\">\n    28 Tex.

The deadline for the carrier to dispute eligibility is fifteen days after the latest of three potential dates: (1) the date the carrier received the death benefits claim; (2) the date of final adjudication of the carrier's denial of compensability or liability under rule 124.2 and rule 132.17(b); or (3) the expiration of the carrier's right to deny compensability/liability under rule 132.17(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20132.17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 132.17(f)(1). Construing these enumerated deadlines in light of the entire rule, it is clear that if the date the carrier receives a death benefits claim is the latest of the three potential triggering dates, then the carrier has fifteen days to investigate and potentially dispute entitlement even if the sixty-day period under subsection (b) has passed. For example, if the carrier received a death benefits claim 180 days following a death notification and the documentation provided by the claimant showed that the claimant was not the decedent's legal beneficiary, the carrier has the right to dispute eligibility on that basis even though the sixty-day period under subsection (b) has expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, contrary to Marta's argument, neither rule 132.17(b) nor section 409.021 can be construed reasonably to require carriers to raise (or else waive) a section 409.007 defense within sixty days of receiving a death notification because facts supporting the defense will not arise until, at the earliest, a potential beneficiary files a claim after the one-year anniversary of the employee's death. The carrier generally has the right and duty to investigate entitlement to benefits upon receiving a death benefits claim no matter when the claim is filed. However, if the claim is filed after the one-year deadline expires, the carrier's failure to raise the defense within the sixty-day period in rule 132.17(b) or section 409.021(c) does not bar the defense because the grounds for asserting it would not have existed during the sixty-day period. And Marta's interpretation of rule 132.17(b) would render subsections (e) and (f) meaningless, again a result we avoid.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318580\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/343/213/#p221\">\n    343 S.W.3d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Relevant commission appeals decisions, though not controlling, support the court's holding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Similarly, the Third Court of Appeals has characterized section 409.007 as a \"limitations defense\" that can be waived.\n   <em>\n    Tex. Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Tex. Mun.

Although the Supreme Court of Texas affirmed the court of appeals' judgment in\n   <em>\n    TML Risk Pool\n   </em>\n   , it did so on different grounds than the court of appeals relied upon and without discussing whether section 409.007 is an affirmative defense and whether a carrier may raise it at any time. Those issues are not before us and to the extent the majority implies that a \"reasonable time\" deadline applies, that is a question we need not decide. The court need not express opinion as to when, if ever, it becomes too late for a carrier to dispute timeliness of a death benefits claim on section 409.007 grounds, as we are considering only whether Zurich's failure to assert the defense within sixty days of the notice of death waived the defense. The panel unanimously agrees it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Good Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The remaining basis for summary judgment in Marta's favor is the trial court's ruling that she conclusively established good cause for filing her claim after the one-year deadline, which Zurich challenges in its first issue. Zurich filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that Marta's claim was untimely and without good cause as a matter of law, or that Marta had no evidence of good cause. The majority concludes that neither side is entitled to summary judgment and remands the case for trial on good cause. I respectfully disagree and would render judgment for Zurich because the record contains no legally sufficient evidence of good cause and the reasons offered by Marta do not constitute good cause as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Additional Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To the familiar summary judgment standards of review cited by the majority, I add the following: evidence favoring a summary judgment movant's position will not be considered unless it is uncontroverted.\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

The employer timely provided a first report of injury to its workers' compensation insurance carrier, Zurich. Zurich promptly notified the Division. Zurich paid workers' compensation benefits to Encarnacion from April 17, 2010 to May 14, 2010. Encarnacion died on May 13, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Zurich initially disputed that Encarnacion's death was related to his job injury and filed a dispute of death benefits with the Division on June 2, 2010. Zurich sent a copy to Encarnacion's address in Pflugerville, Texas. Marta did not receive this notice. After further investigation, Zurich determined that Encarnacion's death in fact resulted from his work-related injury. That matter was resolved favorably to Marta at the BRC and is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Zurich began attempts to identify and locate Encarnacion's beneficiaries. Zurich understood that Encarnacion was married and believed his widow to be Marta. Initial attempts to confirm Marta's address or telephone number proved unsuccessful. In October 2010, Zurich sent an investigator to Encarnacion's Pflugerville address to verify whether Marta lived there, but the investigator was unable to confirm she shared this address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Meanwhile, Marta hired an attorney to investigate potential medical malpractice liability for Encarnacion's death. This attorney instructed Encarnacion's family not to speak with representatives from the \"insurance company.\" Zurich's investigator received a voicemail from an attorney claiming to represent Marta. The investigator contacted the attorney and confirmed that he represented Marta in connection with Encarnacion's death. Zurich's claim file indicates it was awaiting receipt of a representation letter, but the record does not show that Zurich received one or that the attorney otherwise contacted Zurich or the Division. The attorney's representation of Marta terminated, but the record does not show when the relationship ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Also in October 2010, Zurich's adjuster, Denise Limon, learned that Marta scheduled a meeting with James Prendeville at the DoubleTree Hotel to discuss Encarnacion's retirement benefits. Prendeville agreed to call Limon during the meeting so Limon could discuss Marta's potential claim for death benefits. Limon informed Prendeville that Encarnacion's death was compensable and sent him a death benefits claim form to provide to Marta at the\n   meeting. However, Marta did not attend the scheduled meeting, and it is undisputed that she never received a death benefit claim form from Zurich. Marta testified in her affidavit that she received no letters from Zurich or the Division during 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The employer provided Limon with a contact phone number for Marta's daughter, Nancy Diaz, on November 15. According to Limon, she called Nancy that day. Nancy testified in an affidavit that she recalled \"one phone call and one voicemail from a female person which [she] received in late 2010, and [she] told this person we had an attorney Michael Wash representing us and that she should contact him.\" It is undisputed that Marta's counsel and Limon never spoke. Limon left at least one other voicemail message with Nancy in February 2011 seeking contact information for the family's attorney, but received no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Limon sought a BRC with the Division on May 11, 2011 to determine \"entitlement to death benefits and/or burial benefits.\" Limon stated in a letter that Zurich attempted to contact Marta on November 15, 2010, February 4, 2011, April 11, 2011, and May 11, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Limon also designated Marta's contact information as the same Pflugerville address to which Zurich previously mailed information addressed to Encarnacion. Zurich's claim file notes indicate that Limon left a voicemail with \"the widow\" on May 11. The Division mailed a notice to Marta scheduling a BRC for June 14. Marta received this notice in May. Marta and Nancy went to the BRC on June 14 but were told they arrived late, so the conference was reset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Marta retained attorney Richard Pena, who filed a claim for death benefits on June 21, 2011. Marta filed an amended claim for death benefits on August 15, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Division conducted a BRC on November 17, 2011. Marta attended with counsel and provided copies of her claim and amended claim for death benefits to Zurich, which was the first time Zurich received notice of Marta's claim. The parties did not reach agreement at the BRC and twelve days later, on November 29, Zurich filed with the Division a \"Notice of Denial of Compensability/Liability and Refusal to Pay Benefits\" and mailed a copy to Encarnacion's address. Citing section 409.007, Zurich denied the claim for death benefits because Marta did not file the claim within one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Marta's factual contentions supporting her good cause argument condense to two reasons: (1) she was never provided any information about filing a claim from Zurich or the Division, citing several administrative rules or statutes with which she contends Zurich failed to comply; and (2) she was never notified, and did not believe, that Encarnacion's death was work-related. The trial court agreed with the first reason and ruled specifically that \"good cause exists for Marta Diaz's late filing of a claim due to Defendant Zurich's failure to notify the Plaintiff and the [Division] of the compensable death under [Division] Rule 132.17.\" Rule 132.17(d) requires a carrier that \"identifies or becomes aware of a potential beneficiary\" to \"notify the potential beneficiary of potential entitlement to benefits, using a plain language notice containing language and content prescribed by the Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20132.17\">\n    28 Tex.

Also, there is no evidence that Encarnacion's death certificate formed the basis of delay, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Davis.\n   </em>\n   Marta's proof on this point consists of her subjective belief that her husband's death was not work-related.

Encarnacion died merely one month after his still-unhealed burn injury, during which time the carrier paid workers' compensation benefits. Marta immediately hired an attorney to evaluate whether medical negligence was a contributing factor. Marta filed a copy of Encarnacion's death certificate, which indicated that a burn injury to Encarnacion's leg suffered at work was a condition leading to the immediate cause of death. Our record does not show when or how Marta first obtained a copy of the death certificate. Assuming she did not have a copy before May 13, 2011, a reasonable person in Marta's position would not wait over one year before obtaining a copy of her spouse's death certificate, particularly after hiring a lawyer to assess medical malpractice liability. A death certificate showing the cause of death is highly relevant to the lawyer's purpose. Alternatively, if Marta in fact obtained a copy of the death certificate within the one-year period, then she is charged with knowledge of its contents and the failure to assert her rights by May 13, 2011 likewise is not reasonable diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Assuming some evidence of good cause exists because Marta reasonably believed her husband's death was unrelated to his job injury, Marta's lack of knowledge of compensability must also be the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   for the delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harkey v.

Here, Marta's evidence does not support the proposition that she delayed filing her claim because she did not know her husband's death was work-related.

Marta waited over thirteen months before filing a claim and there is no evidence that Zurich, Encarnacion's employer, or a doctor, made any representations to Marta regarding the nature or cause of death, or the claim process, that would have reasonably led to such a delay, as Marta acknowledges in her affidavit.

The record documents efforts by Zurich in 2010 to confirm that Marta was Encarnacion's spouse, including sending an investigator to the Pflugerville address to confirm whether Marta lived there, seeking information and assistance from Encarnacion's employer to identify and contact Marta, and attempted communication with Marta's daughter and Marta's attorney. Marta's daughter, Nancy, informed Zurich that Marta had retained legal representation. Zurich contacted Marta's attorney and left a message with his office, but the record contains no evidence that he returned the call or otherwise contacted Zurich or the Division. Marta presented no affidavit from her counsel disputing Zurich's evidence in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Marta does not dispute that Zurich attempted to contact her during 2010, but she testified that she did not receive any letters addressed to her from Zurich or the Division in 2010, and she did not speak to anyone from Zurich or the Division during 2010.

This is irrelevant. Marta did not know that Zurich ever disputed compensation because she stated in her affidavit that she did not receive any communication from Zurich in 2010, which necessarily includes Zurich's June 2, 2010 notice. Thus, Zurich's dispute (or its withdrawal) could not have been a consideration that influenced Marta's decision to delay filing a claim or to file a claim when she did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10148466\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/444/602/#p605\">\n    444 S.W.2d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The court's decision today not only lowers the minimum showing required for good cause to a point beneath that set by any of the multitude of cases discussing the issue, the majority has divested the principle of diligence of its essential meaning.
