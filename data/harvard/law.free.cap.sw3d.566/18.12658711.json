Ramirez brought a premises liability action against the Texas Department of Transportation (\"TxDOT\") for injuries he sustained when his tractor-trailer tipped over after encountering an 8 \u00be inch drop-off on the edge of the roadway. After a jury found TxDOT's negligence caused the accident, the trial court entered an order awarding Ramirez $250,000 in damages. On appeal, TxDOT contends the trial court's judgment should be reversed because the drop-off was not a special defect\n   and because the drop-off was an open and obvious condition. Because we conclude the drop-off in this case was a special defect and was not open and obvious, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 20, 2014, Ramirez was driving a tractor-trailer and traveling southbound on U.S. Highway 83 (\"US 83\") carrying freight from Del Rio to Laredo. US 83 is a two-lane highway with paved nine-foot shoulders. As Ramirez neared a truck stop, he saw a tractor-trailer stopped in the same lane waiting to turn left into the truck stop. To avoid colliding with the stalled trailer, Ramirez slowed and downshifted. Because he was afraid he would not be able to come to a complete stop to avoid colliding with the stopped tractor-trailer, Ramirez maneuvered onto the shoulder of the roadway to go around the trailer. In the course of maneuvering around the stopped trailer via the shoulder, the front right tire of Ramirez's tractor trailer encountered an 8\u00be inch drop-off at the edge of the paved shoulder between the shoulder and the ground. When Ramirez attempted to bring the tire back onto the pavement, the tire popped, causing Ramirez's tractor trailer to tip over, landing on its side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the jury trial, the jury heard testimony from Ramirez, Texas Highway Patrol Trooper Juarez, TxDOT Maintenance Supervisor Anastacio Cantu, and accident reconstructionist James Locke. Trooper Juarez, one of the officers who responded to the scene, testified that based on the circumstances of the crash, it appeared Ramirez safely attempted to get around the stopped truck. Trooper Juarez further testified that Ramirez's action in attempting to pass the stalled trailer to the right by going onto the shoulder was legal. Cantu testified TxDOT's maintenance manual instructs TxDOT employees regarding how to address highway drop-offs. Cantu explained that the manual instructs that three inches is the maximum depth at which a drop-off is acceptable, because a three-inch drop-off is a hazard that could cause an accident. Cantu agreed the drop-off where the accident occurred was a hazardous condition that needed to be addressed. Cantu explained that the state has a scoring system for various aspects of the state's roads and highways, including the edges of the roadway. According to that scoring system, a \"failed\" roadway edge was one with a drop-off greater than four inches. Cantu explained that almost all drivers who encounter a drop-off of more than four inches can lose control of their vehicle and are at greater risk of having an accident. Cantu agreed that the drop-off encountered by Ramirez would be an unexpected condition on the shoulder of the roadway. Cantu testified that TxDOT crews conduct \"windshield drives\" wherein they inspect highway conditions, and that a TxDOT crew driving down US 83 could have seen the drop-off. Cantu further testified that ten days prior to the incident, a TxDOT crew was repairing potholes on the same stretch of the roadway where the drop-off was located; TxDOT personnel should have been able to see the drop-off while inspecting the roadway; and he as the TxDOT supervisor should have known about a drop-off of that size. Moreover, Cantu confirmed that as the TxDOT supervisor, he should have had policies and procedures in place so that he would have known about the drop-off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Locke testified, \"About every 21 minutes somebody runs off the roadway and they're either killed or very seriously injured. And oftentimes, it's because the pavement edge\" has a drop-off. Locke explained a drop-off like the one in this case is a \"defectively dangerous condition\" because when the right side of a vehicle goes\n   off the edge of a drop-off, drivers, in an effort to get back on the pavement, will steer too hard to the left, resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle. Although Locke testified that, had Ramirez applied maximum braking upon seeing the stalled trailer, he would have been able to stop behind the trailer, Locke explained that a tractor-trailer braking at maximum force in that situation could be dangerous and cause the trailer to jackknife. Locke explained that given the short amount of time Ramirez had to make the decision to brake, moving onto the shoulder to pass the truck on the right was a reasonable decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After receipt of evidence and testimony, the jury returned a verdict finding that TxDOT's negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, TxDOT was eighty percent responsible for the accident, and Ramirez had suffered damages in the amount of $402,500. Thereafter, the trial court entered a judgment awarding Ramirez $250,000 in damages, the maximum amount allowed under law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM.

Here, the drop-off at the edge of the shoulder was 8 \u00be inches-well in excess of what TxDOT considers the maximum acceptable height, and what Ramirez's accident reconstruction expert Locke labeled a \"defectively dangerous condition.\" Locke testified that it is common for drivers to be killed or seriously injured by running off the roadway and that oftentimes, the cause of the accident is a drop-off at the pavement edge. Locke explained that steep drop-offs such as the one in this case effectively prevent the tires of a vehicle from reentering the pavement, and that in an effort to re-enter the roadway, drivers will often steer too far to the left, causing them to lose control of their vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on this evidence, we conclude the drop-off at the edge of the paved shoulder posed an unexpected danger to ordinary users of the roadway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10012253\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/905/470/#p475\">\n    905 S.W.2d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding a six-to-twelve-inch drop-off between the travel lane and the roadway's shoulder was a special defect);\n   <em>\n    Dorman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20374167\">\n    1999 WL 374167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (holding a four-inch drop-off along the roadway's shoulder was a special defect). The drop-off in this case was located at the edge of the pavement, thus posing a threat to ordinary users of the roadway that approach the edge of the roadway. Moreover, the drop-off was located near a truck stop where vehicles may, as in this case, need to avail themselves of the shoulder in order to avoid colliding with vehicles that are turning into or pulling out of the truck stop. Ramirez, as an ordinary user of the roadway, used the paved shoulder to avoid colliding with a tractor-trailer that was stopped in the travel lane. Cantu's testimony confirms that an ordinary user of the roadway would not expect to encounter a steep drop-off at the edge of the pavement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The drop-off condition encountered by Ramirez was not located off and unconnected to the roadway, such as the floodgate arm in\n   <em>\n    Beynon\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beynon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301929\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/283/329/#p331\">\n    283 S.W.3d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the drop-off in this case was not an obvious condition intended to clearly mark the boundaries of the roadway as part of the roadway's original design, such as in\n   <em>\n    Perches\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095424\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/388/652/#p655\">\n    388 S.W.3d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, although TxDOT argues Ramirez was not an ordinary driver because he was out of control at the time of the accident, the record shows Ramirez was traveling under the speed limit and that if Ramirez had applied maximum braking in that situation, the tractor trailer could have jackknifed, which would have presented a danger to traveling motorists on the two-lane highway. Moreover, the record suggests Ramirez was in control of his vehicle and safely attempted to maneuver around the stopped truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, given the excessive depth of the drop-off, its potential to impair motorists' ability to travel, its unreasonably dangerous nature, and the threat it posed to ordinary users of the roadway, we conclude the drop-off in this case was a special defect.

Courts have held that no duty existed because the condition was open and obvious where the dangerous condition was one the plaintiff knew of and appreciated or that a reasonable person would have known and appreciated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nethery v.

(holding fact issue existed as to whether pothole was open and obvious where plaintiff did not see the pothole, the pothole was not obvious when a crowd was walking on the premises, and the evidence was disputed as to whether the premises was crowded at the time of the incident).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this case, the record does not support TxDOT's contention that the drop-off was either open and obvious or known to Ramirez. Ramirez testified he had never noticed the drop-off before the accident despite regularly traveling on this highway. Cantu testified that although a commercial driver driving past the drop-off should have noticed the drop-off, a driver would not notice it unless he were at the shoulder and had arrived at the location of the drop-off. Moreover, there was no sign warning of the drop-off. We conclude the drop-off was not an open and obvious condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, we overrule TxDOT's third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    TxDOT, as a state agency, is a governmental entity entitled to sovereign immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tex.
