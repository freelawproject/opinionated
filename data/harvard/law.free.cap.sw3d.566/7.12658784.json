At the time of the collision, two members of Houston Pilots were piloting the vessels in heavy fog near Morgan's Point. Appellants, homeowners living near the site, allege that the collision released 88,200 gallons of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), causing environmental damage to their property and sickening two of them. Appellants contend that Houston Pilots' alleged negligence was a cause of the collision because the association failed to train and supervise the pilots, and it undertook to implement navigation standards but failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Houston Pilots Licensing and Regulatory Act provides that a pilot is not liable, either directly or as a member of an organization of pilots, for any claim that (1) arises from an act or omission of another pilot or organization of pilots, and (2) relates directly or indirectly to pilot services.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066.082\">\n    Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 66.082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2011). We conclude that section 66.082, rather than federal maritime law, governs the claims asserted by appellants and provides Houston Pilots immunity from liability. We therefore affirm the trial court's summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Houston Ship Channel stretches approximately 55 nautical miles from the sea buoy offshore Galveston to the turning basin at the Port of Houston. The main channel is 530 feet wide. Maneuvering vessels in and out of the ship channel requires special expertise and knowledge due to the channel's size and the number of vessels\n   traversing its waterways. Houston Pilots\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is an association that provides compulsory pilots to guide vessels in and out of the ship channel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The job of a Houston pilot is to bring the vessel from the sea to the dock, or vice versa, as safely as possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 9, 2015, Captain Larry Evans piloted the M/T\n   <em>\n    Carla Maersk\n   </em>\n   outbound, while Captain George Reeser piloted the M/V\n   <em>\n    Conti Peridot\n   </em>\n   inbound up the ship channel. When heavy fog rolled in and reduced visibility significantly, Houston Pilots suspended pilot boardings of inbound ships. But vessels already under way, like the\n   <em>\n    Carla Maersk\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Conti Peridot\n   </em>\n   , continued on. As the\n   <em>\n    Carla Maersk\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Conti Peridot\n   </em>\n   neared each other just south of Morgan's Point, the\n   <em>\n    Conti Peridot\n   </em>\n   crossed the channel into the path of the\n   <em>\n    Carla Maersk\n   </em>\n   and the two collided. As a result of the collision, MTBE spilled from the cargo of the\n   <em>\n    Carla Maersk.\n   </em>\n   Appellants (the Homeowners) contend that the spill reached their properties, requiring a significant amount of remediation and causing personal injury to two of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Homeowners sued Houston Pilots and others, asserting claims under Texas law for negligence, gross negligence, negligent trespass, and private nuisance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to Houston Pilots, the Homeowners alleged that the association was negligent in multiple respects that caused the collision, including that it negligently failed to develop and promulgate navigational standards in the ship channel and failed to train and supervise the individual pilots navigating the vessels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Houston Pilots moved for traditional summary judgment on two grounds. First, it contended that under federal maritime law as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Guy v. Donald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8293266\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/203/399/\">\n    203 U.S. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8293266\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/203/399/\">\n    27 S.Ct. 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8293266\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/203/399/\">\n    51 L.Ed. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1906) and its progeny, pilot associations are immune from vicarious liability or direct liability related to the alleged negligence of its pilots. Second, Houston Pilots argued that as an unincorporated association of independent contractor pilots, it has no legal existence separate from its individual pilots. As a result, any judgment against it for its own negligence would in effect be a judgment against the individual pilots jointly and severally, triggering the immunity the Legislature provided to pilots in section 66.082 of the Transportation Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Homeowners responded to the motion, arguing that the rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Guy v. Donald\n   </em>\n   and its progeny did not insulate Houston Pilots from liability for its own direct negligence. The Homeowners further argued that section 66.082 did not provide immunity because a fact issue exists regarding whether Houston Pilots is an unincorporated association or a general partnership under Texas law. Each side raised objections to the other side's evidence, though the trial court did not rule on the objections. The trial court granted Houston Pilots' motion without stating the\n   grounds for its decision. The trial court then severed the claims against Houston Pilots, making the summary judgment final. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Homeowners raise two issues on appeal: (1) whether Texas law provides complete immunity to pilot associations for the direct negligence of the organization itself; and (2) whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to Houston Pilots' status as a partnership under Texas law and, if so, whether Houston Pilots may be held vicariously liable for the actions of its member pilots. We address these issues together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

We begin by explaining each source of immunity and then address which rule is relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Pilot associations have different immunities under federal maritime and Texas statutory law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Guy v. Donald\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of the United States established a general rule that pilot associations and member pilots are immune from vicarious liability under federal maritime law for negligent acts or omissions by other member pilots.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8293266\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/203/399/\">\n    203 U.S. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8293266\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/203/399/\">\n    27 S.Ct. 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dampskibsselskabet Atalanta A/S v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dampskibsselskabet Atalanta\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit explained the rationale for this rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The fundamental principle underlying the exemption of pilots' associations\n   from liability for negligence of their members in performing their duties as pilots is that the association exercises no control over the manner in which those duties are to be performed, and therefore a pilot cannot be said to be an agent of the association in that respect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1752831\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/31/961/#p962\">\n    31 F.2d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts have long applied the\n   <em>\n    Guy\n   </em>\n   rule to afford immunity from liability to pilot associations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if an association has the ability to select, discharge, and discipline its members, this general control over a pilot does not defeat the\n   <em>\n    Guy\n   </em>\n   rule. \"To be liable, the association must control the pilot's actions while [the pilot is] discharging his professional duties onboard the vessel.\"\n   <em>\n    In re J.W.

Mich. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Texas Legislature has likewise provided immunity for claims relating to pilot services along the Houston Ship Channel, though the contours of this immunity differ from the\n   <em>\n    Guy\n   </em>\n   rule. The Houston Pilots Licensing and Regulatory Act provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A pilot is not liable directly or as a member of an organization of pilots for any claim that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) arises from an act or omission of another pilot or organization of pilots; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) relates directly or indirectly to pilot services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 66.082.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act defines pilot services as \"acts of a pilot in conducting a vessel through the navigable water in this state and the ports in which the pilot is licensed or certified as a pilot.\" Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 66.002(6). The Legislature expressly stated that the purpose of the Act is to \"(1) in the public interest, stimulate and preserve maritime commerce on the pilotage grounds of this state by limiting and regulating the liability of pilots; and (2) maintain pilotage fees at reasonable amounts.\" Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 66.081.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Texas statutory law, rather than federal maritime law, provides the rule of immunity here.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Initially, we must decide whether to use federal maritime or Texas statutory law in determining whether Houston Pilots is immune from liability for the claims at issue. We begin with the premise that torts occurring on navigable waters of the United States fall generally within the law of admiralty; thus, \"[a]bsent a relevant statute, the general maritime law, as developed by the judiciary, applies.\"\n   <em>\n    East River S.S.

If Houston Pilots is a partnership, the Homeowners contend it may be sued in its own name and held liable separately from its partner pilots, and thus it is not protected by section 66.082. Given this factual dispute, the Homeowners assert that summary judgment is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We conclude that any factual dispute regarding partnership status is immaterial.

In support of\n   their argument that a fact issue exists, the Homeowners cite testimony from Houston Pilots' representative and the two individual pilots involved in the collision explaining how tariffs for pilot services are collected and distributed. Specifically, the representative explained that a company called \"Beatty Street\" collects the tariffs, the tariffs are pooled, expenses for employees and maintenance are paid, and then any remainder is distributed on an equal basis to each full member of Houston Pilots. The members are also allowed to participate on committees, and as such make business decisions for the organization. The representative denied that the members are partners, instead insisting that each pilot is simply an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Homeowners correctly point out that whether an arrangement is considered a partnership often presents a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7303380\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/288/886/#p895\">\n    288 S.W.3d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting difficulty in uniformly applying a \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" test for determining whether partnership exists).

As we have explained, a judgment against Houston Pilots as an unincorporated association or a general partnership would also impose liability on the pilots as members or partners. Accordingly, the summary-judgment evidence conclusively proved this element of the statutory defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Transp. Code \u00a7 66.082(1). The Homeowners pleaded claims of negligence, gross negligence, trespass, and private nuisance due to Houston Pilots' alleged failure to, among other things: (1) utilize reasonable care in undertaking and carrying out the development and promulgation of navigation standards in the Houston Ship Channel; (2) utilize reasonable care in training and supervising the individual pilots; (3) properly operate the Carla Maersk and the Conti Peridot; (4) properly operate the two vessels in a manner that the collision would not occur; and (5) properly inspect the vessel to assure equipment and personnel were fit. As pleaded, these claims seek to hold Houston Pilots vicariously liable for acts or omissions of its member pilots who operated the vessels as well as directly liable for its own acts or omissions as an organization of pilots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Homeowners contend that section 66.082 is best understood as a codification of\n   <em>\n    Guy v.

Transp. Code \u00a7 66.002(6). The Homeowners' petition shows that they seek to hold Houston Pilots liable for acts and omissions regarding vessel travel through the Houston Ship Channel. They argue that these alleged acts and omissions are not in fact pilot services because the \"act of a pilot in conducting a vessel through navigable waters is altogether separate and apart from formulating and implementing 'predetermined ship movement strategies.' \" We disagree. The statute applies to acts or omissions that relate \"directly or indirectly\" to pilot services. Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 66.082(2). Formulating and implementing ship movement strategies for pilots' use in the navigable waters of this State, including the Port of Houston, relates at least indirectly to \"the acts of a pilot in conducting a vessel through\" those waters.
