Mr. Thompson contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for permitting inadmissible hearsay evidence to be presented at his trial and that the admission of this evidence prejudiced him. After a thorough review of the record and existing case precedent, we conclude that there is no precedential value in publishing our opinion. Thus, we have instead provided a memorandum of law to the parties explaining our affirmance of the judgment. Affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
