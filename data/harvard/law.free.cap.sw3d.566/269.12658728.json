Bishop was represented by the Public Defender's Office. Bishop signed a petition to enter a guilty plea and appeared with counsel to plead guilty to the charge. The court accepted Bishop's guilty plea and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment, suspended execution of his sentence, and placed him on five years of probation. On January 20, 2018, the court suspended Bishop's probation after the filing of a probation revocation motion, and on February 7, 2018, the court revoked Bishop's probation and ordered his three-year sentence to be executed. Bishop was represented\n   by the Public Defender's Office in his probation revocation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2018, Bishop filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief, in which he alleged that he \"was misled by [his] defense attorney\" because his defense counsel \"led [him] to believe [he] would only have to serve a few months in prison ... 3-4 months\" and, instead \"[i]t is mandatory that [he] serve 80% of 3 years.\" Mr. Bishop further alleged he had been offered \"120 days in DOC by Judge Mason Gebhardt\" and \"[k]nowing the facts about the amount of time to be served, [he] clearly would have taken the 120 days offered[ ] from the Judge.\" Bishop answered \"yes\" to a question on the Form 40 asking whether he was \"seeking leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\" Thereafter, Bishop completed the Forma Pauperis Affidavit at the end of the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion court did not appoint counsel for Bishop; instead it entered an order on March 22, 2018, three days after Defendant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion was filed, dismissing Bishop's motion. The docket entry stated \"Dismiss by Ct w/o Prejudice.\" Immediately underneath this entry was an apparent ruling on one of Bishop's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   claims: \"Amount of time to be served is collateral consequence of conviction. Defendnat's [sic] attorney is under no obligation to advise Defendant as to the amount of time he will serve in DOC. Motion Overruled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion court granted Bishop leave to appeal \"as a poor person\" finding that Bishop was \"totally without means or resources of any nature to pay costs or filing fees for prosecuting his application for an appeal and is a poor person within the meaning of the law.\" Bishop's Notice of Appeal was prepared by the Public Defender's Office. On April 30, 2018, Mr. Bishop timely appealed the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellate review of the motion court's denial of a Rule 24.035 motion for post-conviction relief is limited to determining whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous. Rule 24.035(k). \"The motion court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous only if, after reviewing the entire record, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm impression that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

The State agrees that the motion court erred by failing to appoint counsel. We agree as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 24.035(e) requires that \"[w]ithin 30 days after an indigent movant files a pro se motion, the court shall cause counsel to be appointed for the movant.\" \"The use of the term 'shall' makes clear that, under Rule 24.035, appointment of counsel is mandatory, not discretionary.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

App. W.D. 2011). \"Unless the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion already contains all claims known to the movant\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   states all facts to support the claims, the appointed counsel's task is to file an amended Rule 24.035 motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319503\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/881/#p882\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because an amended motion is a final pleading requiring legal expertise, \"[c]ounsel\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be appointed for indigent movants in order to assure its proper drafting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319503\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/345/881/#p882\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[I]ndigency should be liberally assessed when pro se post-conviction motions are first filed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
