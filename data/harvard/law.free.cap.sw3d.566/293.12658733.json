According to Weems, this false report was used to criminally charge him for the attempted murder of Bradshaw. After concluding that Weems\n   was asserting a health care liability claim, the trial court dismissed it on the ground that Weems had failed to file an expert report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.351 (West 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Weems appeals,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that he was not required to file an expert report because he did not assert a healthcare liability claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weems' petition clearly demonstrated that his complaint was the knowing fabrication of an allegedly false medical report. Although there is a split among the courts of appeals, the Waco Court of Appeals has concluded that claims involving alteration and fabrication of medical records are not healthcare liability claims and, therefore, do not trigger the expert report requirement of Section 74.351.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Benson v.
