THE OFFENSES AND CONVICTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the course of one year, Estes repeatedly sexually assaulted his son's girlfriend Katie,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was younger than seventeen at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Katie eventually told her family about the assaults, leading to a police investigation. Estes was indicted with twenty-three sexual offenses, but was tried only for five counts of sexual assault and two counts of indecency with a child by contact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2021.11\">\n    Tex.

At trial, the State admitted evidence showing that Estes was married at the time he sexually assaulted Katie. Katie's mother testified that she allowed Katie to spend so much time at her boyfriend's house, including sleeping over, because she knew and trusted Estes, she knew Estes's wife would also be present in the home, and Estes assured her that he would supervise his son and Katie. Katie's mother further stated that she believed Estes shared her moral code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury found Estes guilty of each of the seven counts. In a special issue regarding\n   the sexual-assault counts, the jury affirmatively found that Katie was a person whom Estes \"was prohibited from marrying or purporting to marry or with whom [he] was prohibited from living under the appearance of being married as defined by the offense of bigamy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This affirmative finding enhanced the available punishment range from that of a second-degree felony-two to twenty years' confinement-to that of a first-degree felony-five to ninety-nine years' or life confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2021.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 22.011(f);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2021.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 12.32-.33 (West 2011). After a punishment hearing, the jury assessed his sentences at twelve years' confinement for each sexual-assault conviction and at ten years' confinement for each indecency conviction. The trial court imposed concurrent, twelve-year sentences for the sexual-assault convictions and, as recommended by the jury, suspended imposition of the confinement terms assessed for the indecency convictions and placed Estes on community supervision for ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE APPEALS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Estes appealed and, as relevant here, argued that the punishment enhancement found in section 22.011(f) was unconstitutional as applied to him, violating the federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and substantive due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We applied a rational-basis test to Estes's equal-protection claim and concluded that section 22.011(f) was unconstitutional as applied to him because it penalized Estes differently than a similarly situated defendant with no rational basis for the different treatment.\n   <em>\n    Estes v.

App.-Fort Worth 2016) (\n   <em>\n    Estes I\n   </em>\n   ). But the court of criminal appeals concluded that section 22.011(f) was \"rationally related to the compelling interest the State has in protecting children from sexual abuse\" and exploitation and therefore did not violate Estes's right to equal protection under a rational-basis analysis.\n   <em>\n    Estes II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656460\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/691/#p696\">\n    546 S.W.3d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court of criminal appeals reversed our\n   <em>\n    Estes I\n   </em>\n   judgment and remanded Estes's appeal to us to consider Estes's remaining constitutional issues: (1) whether a strict-scrutiny analysis applies to Estes's equal-protection claim and (2) whether section 22.011(f) violated Estes's substantive due-process rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656460\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/691/#p696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 706 &amp; n.114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EQUAL PROTECTION: STRICT SCRUTINY OR RATIONAL BASIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court of criminal appeals concluded that the enhanced punishment scheme as applied to Estes survived a rational-basis review and, therefore, did not violate Estes's rights to equal protection.\n   <em>\n    Estes II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656460\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/691/#p696\">\n    546 S.W.3d at 699-702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We now must decide if a strict-scrutiny analysis applies to\n   Estes's equal-protection claim and, if so, presumably determine if the enhanced punishment scheme found in section 22.011(f) meets that test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Estes argues that section 22.011(f) impinges on his fundamental right to marry, mandating application of the strict-scrutiny test. The State concedes that marriage is a fundamental personal right, but asserts that section 22.011(f) is not subject to strict scrutiny because it does not \"place a direct limit on entering marriage versus creating different consequences due to being married\"-it does not significantly interfere with a fundamental right. Our issue, as succinctly stated by Judge David Newell, is whether \"strict scrutiny appl[ies] because the distinction between married and unmarried offenders significantly interferes with the fundamental right to marry.\"\n   <em>\n    Estes II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656460\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/546/691/#p696\">\n    546 S.W.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Newell, J., concurring and dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the strict-scrutiny test, a statutory classification will pass constitutional muster only if it is suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne, Tex. v.

But the punishment-enhancement scheme found in section 22.011(f) does not directly limit or significantly interfere with that right.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 22.011(f) as applied to Estes is not subject to strict scrutiny because it did not directly limit or significantly interfere with his fundamental right to marry. Because this section is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, its application to Estes's punishment for sexual assault did not violate his rights to equal protection or substantive due process. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's sexual-assault judgments. We again affirm the trial court's indecency judgments for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    Estes I.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804646\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/737/#p750\">\n    487 S.W.3d at 750-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    This is an alias.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.
