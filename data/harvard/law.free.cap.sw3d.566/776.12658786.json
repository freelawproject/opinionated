They also argue that TMA did not prove that the VONT provision is invalid because TMA did not prove that VONT was intended to be used exclusively to diagnose diseases of the brain, ear, or eye, whereas appellees did offer uncontradicted evidence that VONT is useful in chiropractic practice. Finally, they argue both that the Rule's use of \"diagnosis\" was within the statutory scope of chiropractic practice and that the issue has already been decided and may not be relitigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In recently considering a similar challenge to an agency's rule, the supreme court reiterated that a state administrative agency only has powers expressly conferred by the Legislature or implied because they are reasonably necessary to carry out the agency's statutory duties.\n   <em>\n    Texas State Bd. of Exam'rs of Marriage &amp; Family Therapists v.

It is the Rule's references to \"nerves,\" \"neuromusculoskeletal,\" and \"neuro-physiological\" that were declared by the trial court to exceed the scope of chiropractic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants argue that the practice of chiropractic has always involved nerves because chiropractic treats subluxations, which are dysfunctions in the joints, usually the spine, that \"cause nerve interference.\" A chiropractor looks to all of a patient's symptoms, including pain-a signal carried by the nervous system-to determine whether the patient has a subluxation. And, in treating the subluxation, the nervous system is necessarily involved, both during treatment and in the \"benefits of treatment,\" when pain is reduced or eliminated. Appellants further note that because nerves are involved in the body's subconscious ability to locate and orient itself, a subluxation that distorts a patient's equilibrium signals can be treated through chiropractic, and thus chiropractic treatment seeks to influence \"neurophysiological function.\" Because nerves are associated with subluxation complexes and are an integral part of chiropractic treatment, appellants argue, it is proper for the Rule's definition of \"subluxation complex\" to include a \"nerve component\" and for the definition of \"musculoskeletal system\" to include nerves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   TMA, on the other hand, notes that the Legislature specified that chiropractors may analyze and treat \"the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system,\" which it argues impliedly excludes the nervous system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dallas Merchant's &amp; Concessionaire's Ass'n v.

The experts agreed that nerves are\n   <em>\n    associated with\n   </em>\n   the musculoskeletal system, causing the musculoskeletal system to move and transmitting pain signals when the system is damaged or a subluxation is present. As explained by several witnesses, the various systems of the body work together and impact each other. All of the experts agreed that the human body is made of integrated systems, which interact with and have effects on each other. The experts agreed that nerves \"innervate\" muscles and that pain signals sent through the nervous system indicate issues in other systems. The Board's witnesses emphasized a \"functional\" view of the body's systems, as opposed to the more formal\n   \"anatomical standpoint\" that TMA's witnesses seemed to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Professor Leonard Cleary explained in his deposition testimony, presented as an exhibit, that \"biomechanics\" are the \"intrinsic principles of the structures of the human body that relate to mechanical forces, so that would include intrinsic properties like stiffness or elasticity and the forces that are generated by those structures.\" In his opinion, the \"only way the nervous system affects the biomechanics is by signaling muscles to contract and thereby creating a force in those muscles.\" He also explained that various organs of the body can be \"associated\" with more than one system, using as an example a bone, which has components of both the skeletal system (the hard, mineral portion) and the system that generates blood cells (the bone marrow). Dr. Cleary testified that similarly, there are nerves in muscles, tendons, ligaments, and spinal discs and, thus, that on some level, certain nerve tissues are considered a \"part\" of tendons, ligaments, and muscles. However, he drew a distinction between a nerve being a\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of a muscle and considering such nerves to be part of the muscular or musculoskeletal\n   <em>\n    system.\n   </em>\n   He said, \"I've never heard people talk about the nervous system as being part of the musculoskeletal system in any context until this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. Cleary said the conventional view of the skeletal system was \"the vertebra, the spine, and the bones that are connected to that, directly or indirectly\" (the bones in the ear, called ossicles, and the hyoid bone, located in the neck between the jaw and the larynx, are not part of the conventional view of the skeletal system). Dr. Cleary believes that \" 'musculoskeletal' is a combination term-that is there is a skeletal system (comprised of bones) and a muscular system (comprised of skeletal i.e., striated muscle).\" He further testified that there are both \"functional\" and \"anatomical\" systems, depending on how the systems are being discussed or viewed, and said that the Board was taking the anatomical term \"musculoskeletal\" system and \"put[ting] it into a functional context,\" giving a new and \"idiosyncratic\" meaning to a long-standing term. He explained that the conventional view of \"musculoskeletal\" is the anatomical view used for hundreds of years, but that the Board's \"functional\" use might lead to confusion because only a specific group would perceive the term in the way the Board was using it. Asked whether several textbooks' references to nerves in their discussions of the muscular system amounted to their including nerves \"as part of the muscle system,\" Dr. Cleary said, \"I would disagree with you on that point. It includes [nerves] as an element of the muscle, ... but it does not expand that to say that nerves are part of the muscular system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Jim Kemper, an ear, nose and throat specialist, said he understood the term \"neuromusculoskeletal\" to mean \"pertaining to or affecting the nervous muscular and skeletal systems.\" He testified that in healthcare professions, the human body is divided into systems. He had never used the term \"neuromusculoskeletal\" and testified that \"[t]he way most people refer to it is musculoskeletal or nervous.\" He further testified that the nervous system is not part of the muscular system, although \"it has to be there for it, just like the cardiovascular system has to be there for it, just like the lymphoid system has to be there for it, but it's not a part of it.\" Nor, Dr. Kemper stated, was the nervous system part of the musculoskeletal system. Another witness testified similarly that the term \"neuromusculoskeletal\" is not a medical term of art, despite its being found in a common medical dictionary, explaining, \"It's defined, it's just not something that we use commonly. We have the musculoskeletal\n   system, the neurologic system.\" He agreed that nerves are affected by chiropractic care in that the treatment may give the patient some pain relief, but insisted that chiropractic treatment does not \"treat\" nerves. The physical therapist testified that she had seen the term \"neuromusculoskeletal\" used in chiropractic terminology but said that she did not \"see neuromuscular as much as I see musculoskeletal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dr. Kenneth Thomas testified that chiropractors need to understand the nervous system in order to treat back pain and that treatment of a subluxation and surrounding tissues also involves the nerves in the area. He said, \"[T]here's no way for me to deliver an adjustment, let's say, to a joint for the biomechanical problem without affecting the nerve.\" He testified that modern definitions of subluxation generally refer to \"associated nerves.\" He also read aloud the World Health Organization's definition of \"subluxation complex\" as the \"[t]heoretical model and description of the motion segment dysfunction which incorporates the interaction of pathological changes in nerve, muscle, ligamentous, vascular and connective tissue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The evidence is clear that in treating a subluxation causing pain, the chiropractor seeks to relieve pain, which necessarily has an effect on the nervous system. However, the fact that nerves are affected by disorders in or treatment of the musculoskeletal system does not mean that the nervous system or the nerves themselves fall within the scope of chiropractic. In other words, a chiropractor's consideration of pain signals in evaluation or treatment does not mean that the chiropractor is examining or treating nerves or the nervous system. Indeed, the experts agreed that the consideration of signals sent through the nervous system has always been a part of chiropractic practice. Further, this Court already noted in\n   <em>\n    Chiropractic Examiners II\n   </em>\n   that the Legislature did not intend to restrict chiropractic examinations solely to the musculoskeletal system and spine, explaining that a chiropractor may examine other parts or systems of the body if such examination \"will assist in analyzing or evaluating the biomechanical condition of the spine or musculoskeletal system.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205974063\">\n    2012 WL 5974063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Thus, the Rule as written before the addition of \"nerves\" and \"neuro\" comprehended and allowed for consideration of and affect on nerves, and we disagree with appellants' contention that elimination of those phrases will \"jeopardize[ ] patient care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Just as the evidence shows that \"musculoskeletal system\" is an informal combination of two more-precisely understood anatomical terms \"muscular system\" and \"skeletal system,\" the term \"neuromusculoskeletal system\" is a combination of the nervous system, the muscular system, and the skeletal system. Chiropractic, however, is statutorily limited to evaluation of the \"biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system\" and to nonsurgical procedures \"to improve the subluxation complex or the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system.\" Tex. Occ. Code \u00a7 201.002(b). Although consideration of other bodily systems may be necessary to evaluate the biomechanical condition of the spine and the musculoskeletal system,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiropractic Examiners II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205974063\">\n    2012 WL 5974063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5, that does not mean that the definition of \"musculoskeletal system\" should be expanded to include associated nerves or that \"subluxation complex\" should be defined as a condition extending beyond the musculoskeletal system. Based on our review of the evidence put forth before the trial court, we hold that sufficient evidence supports the court's findings related to the Rule's reference to\n   nerves and the \"neuromusculoskeletal system\" in its definition of \"musculoskeletal system\" or \"subluxation complex.\" We overrule appellants' issues related to the Rule's definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We next turn to whether the trial court properly struck as invalid the Rule's provisions related to VONT. The provision in question states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Technological Instrumented Vestibular-Ocular-Nystagmus Testing may be performed by a licensee with a diplomate in chiropractic neurology and that has successfully completed 150 hours of clinical and didactic training in the technical and professional components of the procedures as part of coursework in vestibular rehabilitation including the successful completion of a written and performance examination for vestibular specialty or certification. The professional component of these procedures may not be delegated to a technician and must be directly performed by a qualified licensee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2078.13\">\n    22 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 78.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court determined that the Rule's VONT provision \"exceeds the scope of chiropractic as defined in Tex. Occ. Code \u00a7 201.002(b) and is therefore void.\" In making that determination, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 VONT is a purely diagnostic neurological test intended to diagnose a problem of the brain, inner ears or eyes. It includes tests of vestibular function which are designed to evaluate the inner ear (vestibular apparatus) and the neural connections between the inner ear and the parts of the brain that control eye movement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 VONT includes both Electronystagmography (ENG) and Videostagmography (VNG) which are eye movement tests that look for signs of vestibular dysfunction or neurological problems by measuring \"nystagmus\" which is a type of involuntary side-to-side eye movement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 VONT also can include \"hi-thermal caloric testing\" in which cold and warm water is introduced into each ear and the nystagmus is measured to evaluate the relative vestibular weakness of each ear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 The eyes, ears and brain are not part of the spine or musculoskeletal system. No disorder of the biomechanical condition of the spine or the musculoskeletal system causes any vestibular system pathology.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Appellants assert that there are legitimate chiropractic uses for VONT, that it can be used to evaluate the spine and musculoskeletal system, and therefore, that it is proper for the Rule to allow chiropractors to perform VONT. Appellants assert that TMA did not provide evidence that VONT was intended solely to diagnose diseases of the brain, ears, or eyes while they offered \"uncontradicted evidence\" that VONT is useful to chiropractors in the proper scope of their practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   TMA provided as evidence comments to the 2010 Rule revisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20Tex.%20Reg.%209508\">\n    35 Tex. Reg. 9508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9508-10 (2010) (Tex. Bd. of Chiropractor Exam'rs, Rules of Practice). In the comments, the Board acknowledged that \"disorders affecting the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system do not cause vestibular system pathology\" but stated that such pathologies \"can affect the role or the musculoskeletal system in providing the body with balance and form.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Kemper testified that dizziness, balance problems, and vertigo rank \"third behind headaches and low back pain for primary care doctors.... It's very common.\" He said such issues can be the\n   result of a wide range of causes, including \"cardiovascular problems, low blood pressure, arrhythmias, and other things like that\"; \"labyrinthitis, an infection of the inner ear\"; Meniere's disease ; tumors; cysts; multiple sclerosis ; or certain other diseases. Dr. Kemper testified that if a patient presents with complaints about dizziness, he will perform a full physical examination and often VONT, which he described as \"a test where we're using eye movements and responses to the from [sic] the extra-ocular muscles to determine how the brain is interpreting head movement and other things.\" He explained that VONT is a \"starting point\" or \"an adjunct [or] helper in diagnosing the patient's problems\" and that it is \"[v]ery seldom\" the only test that is performed to find a definitive diagnosis of the patient's problems. He agreed that \"vestibular system pathologies can affect\" the body's balance and form and, thus, the role of the musculoskeletal system but disagreed that VONT can \"reveal anything about the biomechanical condition of the spine or musculoskeletal system.\" He further testified that he was not aware of any \"disorders of the biomechanical condition of the spine or musculoskeletal system\" that \"cause any vestibular system pathology.\" Finally, when asked whether chiropractic manipulation was a \"recognized treatment for any vestibular disorder,\" Dr. Kemper responded that manipulation or adjustment \"is not a recognized treatment within the medical field.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Although appellants produced evidence indicating that VONT may be a useful tool to chiropractors, the evidence establishes that VONT helps in the diagnosis of vestibular issues. The evidence further establishes that, although vestibular diseases might have an impact on the musculoskeletal system, disorders falling within the ambit of chiropractic do not cause vestibular pathologies. Simply because the test might under some circumstances be useful does not require that chiropractors be able to perform the test-the fact remains that the scope of chiropractic practice is limited under Texas law. On this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in its findings of fact or in concluding that the Rule's provision related to VONT exceeded the scope of chiropractic. We overrule appellants' issues related to VONT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, we consider appellants' issues related to the Rule's use of the word \"diagnosis\" in its provision that licensed chiropractors may make \"an analysis, diagnosis, or other opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2078.13\">\n    22 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 78.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although the parties disagree on whether this Court has already decided the issue against TMA, we need not reach that question. First, we note that effective September 1, 2017, section 201.002 of the occupations code was amended to provide that a person practices chiropractic if she, among other things, \"uses objective or subjective means to\n   <em>\n    diagnose\n   </em>\n   , analyze, examine, or evaluate the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system of the human body.\" Tex. Occ. Code \u00a7 201.002(b)(1) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Act of May 22, 2017, 85th Leg., R.S. ch. 294, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%20545\">\n    2017 Tex. Gen. Laws 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545, 551. Thus, as TMA acknowledges, the word \"diagnose\" is expressly included in the occupations code itself, limited to the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiropractic Examiners I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7125102\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/375/464/#p472\">\n    375 S.W.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he bottom line is that paragraph (d)(1)(A) limits chiropractors to diagnoses regarding 'the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system' as required by the statutory scope of chiropractic. Accordingly, the provision does not exceed the statutory scope of chiropractic.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, the supreme court recently addressed a similar issue when it considered an agency rule that allowed marriage and family therapists to provide \"diagnostic assessments\" relying on knowledge of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n   <em>\n    Texas State Bd. of Exam'rs of Marriage &amp; Family Therapists\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371105\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/28/#p33\">\n    511 S.W.3d at 30-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, TMA challenged the agency's rule, arguing that the Therapists Act expressly allowed marriage and family therapists to \"evaluate-but not diagnose-conditions\" and that the Act's language by implication \"excludes diagnosing from the practice of marriage and family therapy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371105\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/28/#p33\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371105\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/28/#p33\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court looked to the plain meaning of \"evaluate\" and \"diagnose\" and concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Considering the common, ordinary meanings of the terms within their statutory context, we conclude that by authorizing [marriage and family therapists] to \"evaluate and remediate\" their clients' dysfunctions, the Therapists Act authorizes [marriage and family therapists] to provide a \"diagnostic assessment\" as the Therapists Board's rule uses that phrase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371105\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/28/#p33\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371105\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/511/28/#p33\">\n    at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, the Code provides that chiropractic practice includes the use of \"objective or subjective means to analyze, examine, or evaluate the biomechanical condition of the spine and musculoskeletal system of the human body,\" without using the term diagnosis. [Tex. Occ. Code] \u00a7 201.002(b)(1).
