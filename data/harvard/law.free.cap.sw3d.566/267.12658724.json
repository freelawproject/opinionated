He contends the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. Upon review of the briefs and the\n   record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. We have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision, because a published opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED.
