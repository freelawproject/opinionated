Wilson, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue in these cases is whether a probationer must be discharged from probation as a result of Earned Compliance Credits (\"ECCs\") accrued under section 217.703,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   notwithstanding the prohibition in section 559.105.2\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   against such a discharge if the probationer has failed to pay the full amount of court-ordered restitution. Because section 559.105.2 takes precedence over section 217.703.7, the preliminary writ of prohibition in Mr. Hillman's case is made permanent and the preliminary writ of prohibition in Ms. Long's case is quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has consolidated, for purposes of this opinion only, two separate writ petitions. Even though the central legal issue presented in each of the cases is the same, the underlying facts and procedural postures are slightly different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, Ms. Nettie Pallai (\"Pallai\") pleaded guilty in August 2014 to first-degree property damage, agreeing to a suspended execution of sentence of four years in prison and a probation term of five years. The plea agreement provided Pallai would pay $5,104 in restitution in amounts of no less than $50 per month and stated: \"No earned compliance credits until restitution is paid in full.\" Pallai made sporadic payments on the restitution balance, but has not paid the full amount owed. In January 2018, the state filed a motion to revoke Pallai's probation due to her failure to pay the restitution ordered. In response, Pallai filed a motion for discharge from probation, alleging she had accrued sufficient ECCs at that time to be discharged under section 213.703.7. Respondent, the Honorable John D. Beger, sustained Pallai's motion but stayed the order discharging her from probation to provide the state time to seek a remedial writ in an appellate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The prosecutor (and Relator in this case), Mr. Kevin Hillman, having been denied relief in the court of appeals, petitioned this Court for a writ of prohibition. This Court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition preventing Judge Beger from discharging Pallai from probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the second case, Ms. Erica Long (\"Long\") pleaded guilty in September 2014 to first-degree property damage. As part of her plea agreement, the circuit court suspended the imposition of sentence; placed Long on probation for three years; and ordered her to pay court costs, $46 to the Crime Victim Compensation Fund, and $300 to the Pemiscot County Law Enforcement Restitution Fund. In May 2016, the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole (\"the Board\") filed an initial violation report alleging Long failed to comply with the conditions of her probation because she had fallen behind in restitution. Following a June 2016 probation revocation hearing, the circuit court extended Long's probation an additional year. In December 2017, the Board filed a second probation violation report, again citing Long's failure to pay restitution. Subsequently, in March 2018, Long moved to be discharged from probation, arguing she had accrued sufficient ECCs to be discharged from probation under section 213.703.7 and, therefore, the circuit court lacked authority to revoke her probation. Respondent, the Honorable Fred Copeland, overruled Long's motion. Having been denied relief by the court of appeals, Long (Relator in this case) petitioned this Court for a writ a prohibition preventing Judge Copeland from doing anything other than discharging her from probation. This Court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition staying further action to discharge or revoke Long's probation until further order from this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court has the authority to issue remedial writs pursuant to article V, section 4.1 of the Missouri Constitution. \"A writ of prohibition is available: (1) to prevent a usurpation of judicial power when the trial court lacks authority or jurisdiction; (2) to remedy an excess of authority, jurisdiction or abuse of discretion where the lower court lacks the power to act as intended; or (3) where a party may suffer irreparable harm if relief is not granted.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In the second case, Ms. Long asserts Judge Copeland lacked the authority to do anything other than to discharge her from probation pursuant to section 217.703.7 by applying the ECCs accrued to her under section 217.703.3, notwithstanding that she has not paid the ordered restitution in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ECC scheme is entirely a statutory creation. Section 217.703 provides the ECC framework, which (stated generally) provides that for every full calendar month a probationer is in compliance with the terms of her supervision, the term of probation shall be reduced by 30 days. \u00a7 217.703.3.

The central question in both cases now before the Court is whether this duty to discharge in section 217.703.7 conflicts with the prohibition against discharge found in section 559.105.2, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No person\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ordered by the court to pay restitution pursuant to this section\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be released\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from probation until such restitution is complete.

Accordingly, because neither section 217.703.7 nor section 559.105.2 is ambiguous on its own, the threshold question in this case is whether there is a direct conflict in the operation of those two statutes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8366539\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/236/630/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There is a conflict because section 217.703.7 provides that discharge from probation is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     mandatory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   any time a probationer serves the original term of probation as reduced by all ECCs accrued under section 217.703.3, but section 559.105.2 provides that discharge from probation is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     prohibited\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   before a probationer has fully paid all court-ordered restitution. In certain circumstances, including particularly the two cases now before the Court, these two statutes conflict. \"When two statutory provisions covering the same subject matter are unambiguous standing separately but are in conflict when examined together, a reviewing court must attempt to harmonize them and give them both effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Earth Island Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876451\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/27/#p33\">\n    456 S.W.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To resolve the conflict between sections 217.703 and 559.105, this Court now holds a probationer may accrue ECCs under section 217.703, but she may not be discharged from probation by applying those ECCs to reduce her original term of probation unless and until she has paid the full amount of any court-ordered restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this manner, the conflicting statutes are harmonized, and both are given effect to the fullest extent possible. In light of this holding, Judge Beger acted in excess of his authority by attempting to order Pallai discharged from probation, and Judge Copeland did not exceed his authority in overruling Long's motion to be discharged from probation. Accordingly, the preliminary writ in the former case is made permanent and in the latter case is quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court's conclusion is supported by a host of considerations, including - most importantly - the canons of construction pertaining to conflicting statutes. It is worth noting at the outset that, if applied \"haphazardly or indiscriminately,\" the canons\n   of statutory interpretation can lead to a problematic \"result-oriented jurisprudence.\"\n   <em>\n    Parktown Imps, Inc. v.

Instead, the canons of statutory interpretation must be applied in a genuine effort to determine what the legislature intended.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8160967\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/278/670/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8160967\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/278/670/#p672\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rarely will all canons align to counsel the same result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.

L. Rev. 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401-06 (1950) ). But, ordinarily, the preponderance of the guidance offered by these canons generally will point in one direction, and this Court is well-advised to heed it when it does. Here, the guidance offered by the applicable canons of statutory interpretation persuasively supports the Court's holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, \"the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   recognizes that statutes relating to the same subject matter should be read together, but where one statute deals with the subject in general terms and the other deals in a specific way, to the extent they conflict, the specific statute prevails over the general statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Taylor v. Russell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6900911\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/449/380/#p382\">\n    449 S.W.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382 (Mo. banc 2014) (alteration omitted). In these cases, it might be said that both the ECC regime and the restitution regime concern whether and when a probationer may be discharged from probation. But a closer examination is warranted. Section 217.703 provides the general framework for determining when a probationer accrues ECCs and when those credits can be applied to reduce the original probation term and discharge the probationer. Section 559.105.2, on the other hand, imposes a specific restriction - operative only when a probationer has been ordered to pay restitution - limiting a circuit court's authority to discharge a probationer when restitution has not been fully paid. As a result, section 217.703.7 is the more general statute because it applies to all probationers, and section 559.105.2 is the more specific statute because it applies only to the subset of probationers who have been ordered to pay restitution. Viewed in these terms, the conflict between section 217.703.7 and section 559.105.2 must be resolved in favor of the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, section 559.105 was enacted later in time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[A] chronologically later statute, which functions in a particular way will prevail over an earlier statute of a\n   more general nature, and the latter statute will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the earlier general statute.\"\n   <em>\n    S. Metro. Fire Prot. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , 278 S.W.3d at 666. In 2005, the legislature first enacted section 559.105. H.B. 353, 93d Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Mo. 2005). In 2012, the legislature first enacted section 217.703. H.B. 1525, 96th Gen. Assemb., 2d Sess. (Mo. 2012). Subsequently, in 2013, the legislature repealed and reenacted section 559.105 to add subsection 4, which gives a circuit court express authority to set the amount of restitution to be paid by a defendant and provides procedures to collect restitution from a defendant's inmate account at the department of corrections or, if a defendant is released from department of corrections on conditional release or parole but has yet to pay full restitution, for the prosecuting attorney to collect full restitution. H.B. 215, 97th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Mo. 2013). This amendment, in effect, bolstered the restitution imperative. Therefore, section 559.105 is the later statute and should be regarded as an exception to the general ECC provisions in section 217.703.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, section 559.105 is remedial in nature.

The statutory scheme for restitution promotes the general public welfare because it aims to remediate losses suffered by crime victims. Because remedial statutes should be interpreted \"in order to accomplish the greatest public good,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11831699\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/968/704/#p706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , this Court's construction should give effect to the evident purpose of section 559.105 - i.e., that probationers who are required to pay restitution must, in fact, do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The 2018 amendment to section 217.703.7 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   note 5) also confirms the legislature's intent that section 559.105.2 always has been meant to prevail over section 217.703.7 because that amendment expressly provides that the restitution obligation survives ECC accrual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But, because the Court holds she had no such right under section 559.105.2, it declines to decide her case on this ground.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Section 217.730.2 is not relevant to this proceeding because it grants the Board the authority to make a final order of discharge before the expiration of the sentenced term in certain circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Effective August 28, 2018, the legislature amended this subsection of the statute as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    Notwithstanding subsection 2 of section 217.730 to the contrary, once the combination of time served in custody, if applicable, time served on probation, parole, or conditional release, and earned compliance credits satisfy the total term of probation, parole, or conditional release, the board or sentencing court shall order final discharge of the offender,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      so long as the offender has completed restitution\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    and at least two years of his or her probation, parole, or conditional release, which shall include any time served in custody under section 217.718 and sections 559.036 and 559.115.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00a7 217.703.7, RSMo. Supp. 2018 (emphasis added). This amendment is further discussed in footnote 8, below. Effective December 18, 2018, the legislature amended section 217.703 to add subsection 12, which concerns how ECCs are applied to probationers entering treatment courts, but that amendment is not relevant to this proceeding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 217.703.12, RSMo. Supp. 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Section 559.016 sets the outer limits for a term of probation based upon the different classes of offenses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 559.016.1, RSMo. 2016. For felony cases, as here, the outer limit for probation is five years, and that term may be extended by one additional year if the probationer admits or the court finds the probationer violated the conditions of her probation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 559.016.3. But this cannot be what the legislature intended the phrase \"maximum term of probation\" to mean in the last sentence of section 559.105.2 because the condition precedent to ordering this \"maximum term of probation\" is set out in the beginning of that sentence, and it refers to the probationer having failed to pay restitution in full \"within the original term of probation.\" Accordingly, the phrase \"maximum term of probation\" must mean the entire \"original term of probation\" ordered by the sentencing court plus the only extension the sentencing court is authorized to make under section 559.016.3, i.e., a one-year extension. Nothing in this last sentence of section 559.105.2 requires (or prohibits) a sentencing court to revoke a suspended imposition of sentence and impose a suspended execution of sentence because that is an entirely new sentence, not an extension of the original term of probation. Applying this understanding, Pallai's \"maximum term of probation\" was the originally ordered five-year term plus a one-year extension ordered under section 559.016.3. For Long, her \"maximum term of probation\" is the originally ordered three-year term plus the one-year extension ordered under section 559.016.3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    A local court rule cannot change this result. To the extent local rules conflict with the Court's construction of sections 559.105.2 and 217.703.7, they are invalid and of no force or effect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    It has been suggested that this Court is bound to apply the version of section 217.703.7 that became effective August 28, 2018, in deciding this case and, therefore, that it is the statute that was enacted later in time. This misperceives the nature of these proceedings. The Court is not ruling directly on the motions for discharge filed by Pallai and Long. Instead, the Court is ruling on two petitions for writs of prohibition in which the only issue is whether one or both Respondents exceeded their authority. It would be improper for this Court to resolve a petition for extraordinary writ on a ground that was never presented to or passed on by the circuit court.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

That said, the Court may take notice of the 2018 amendment to section 217.703.7 insofar as it sheds light on the proper resolution of the conflict between sections 217.703.7 and 559.105.2, and that analysis is set forth below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Prior to these cases arising, section 217.703 was amended only as a housekeeping measure to reflect other amendments to the state's criminal code.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    H.B. 215, 97th Gen.

An offender has no constitutional right to probation,\n    <em>\n     Smith v.

Const. art. 1, \u00a7 32.1(4). The Constitution expressly gives the legislature the power to determine when and how the goal of restitution is pursued,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10121093\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/517/148/#p150\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 32.5, and, therefore, how the pursuit of that goal is to be balanced against the policies furthered by probation. The legislature's choice to permit probationers to accrue ECCs - but not to apply them to achieve an early discharge until court-ordered restitution is paid in full - may result in otherwise avoidable incarcerations. In the end, this will do little to advance the goal of restitution. But there are substantive constraints on the application of section 559.105.2 that will operate to check the worst effects of this choice.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
