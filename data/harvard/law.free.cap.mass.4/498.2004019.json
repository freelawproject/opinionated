The defendant also filed a motion in arrest of judgment, because the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant\u2019s return on the execution was false, fraudulent, or improper, nor that the cows mentioned were at any time the property of <em>Porter.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-8\">The motion for a new trial was spoken to at the last September term in this county, by <em>Upharn </em>for the defendant, and by <em>F. Blake. </em>and <em>A. Bigelow for the </em>plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-9\">\n<em>Upham</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aio\">contended that whatever evidence went to show that the plaintiff had sustained no damage, would destroy the plaintiff\u2019s action, and ought, therefore, to be received under the general issue of not guilty. Thus, in an action for beating the plaintiff\u2019s servant, <em>per quad servitium amisit, </em>the defendant may give in evidence, upon not guilty pleaded, that the plaintiff did not lose his ser- [ * 500 ] vice; for that is the injury * charged, and denied by the plea of not guilty. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> So, in the present case, if the property which the plaintiff had caused to be attached, upon hie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>original writ, did not in fact belong to his debtor, he could have derived no benefit to himself from levying his execution upon it, and he has consequently sustained no injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">But if it should be ruled that this evidence was incompetent to maintain the issue for the defendant, still it is contended that it was proper and pertinent evidence in mitigation of damages. In cases of rescue, the defendant may give in evidence, in mitigation of damages, the ability of the person rescued, and that he is still amenable to justice. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> So here the plaintiif has all the remedy against the estate of his debtor which he ever had; and it would be unreasonable that the defendant should be held to answer in damages for the amount of the debt, if he could not take those cows in execution without becoming a trespasser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\"><em>For the plaintiff, </em>it was argued that this matter ought to have been pleaded specially, or at least a brief statement filed of the defence intended to be set up, under the statute of 1792, c. 41. The declaration charged the defendant with neglect of his official duty. When the plaintiff had proved this, he had done all that could be expected from him in a trial upon the general issue. He could not be apprized of this special defence, nor prepared to rebuke it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">Under the general issue of <em>non cepit, </em>in replevin, property cannot be given in evidence, because it ought to be pleaded. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">The injury complained of in this action is special in its nature. The defendant returned that he had attached certain goods. The plaintiff, induced by this apparent security, was led to prosecute his action; and when he obtains his execution, the officer, who, he presumed, had them in custody, instead of levying it upon these goods, returns that they have been rescued out of his hands, and in one instance by a woman, although he had the whole physical power of the county at command.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\"> <em>Esp.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL2\">The plaintiff, in an action of the case, demands damages of the defendant, for the neglect of his duty, as a constable of the town of <em>Orange. </em>The substance of the plaintiff\u2019s demand is, that having sued out an original writ of attachment against <em>Benjamin Porter, </em>his debtor, the defendant, as a constable of <em>Orange, </em>by virtue thereof, attached two cows, shown to him, by the plaintiff, as <em>Porter\u2019s </em>property; that having recovered judgment, against <em>Porter </em>within thirty days, he delivered his execution to the defendant to execute; who, regardless of his duty as a constable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>and intending to wrong the plaintiff, and deprive him of the benefit of his attachment, neglected to levy the execution on the said cows, or on any other property of <em>Porter\u2019s, </em>but levied it on his body, and returned that the two cows had been rescued from him, and that for want of property he had arrested <em>Porter\u2019s </em>body, and had committed him in execution. And the plaintiff further complains that <em>Porter </em>was discharged upon taking the insolvent debtor\u2019s oath. \u25a0 By reason whereof, the plaintiff has lost the benefit of his attachment, and his debt and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and offered in his defence evidence to prove that the <em>cows,- when </em>attached, were <em>not, </em>and never were afterwards, the property of <em>Porter, </em>but. of one <em>Johnson </em>and one <em>Eddy. </em>This evidence the judge rejected. The defendant then offered the same evidence in mitigation of damages, and the judge again rejected it; for which cause the defendant has filed his exceptions, and moved for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u2022 It appears to us that the wrong complained of is the defendant\u2019s neglect to seize the cows on the execution, to the plaintiff\u2019s injury; and we are satisfied that, under the general issue, the defendant may prove that he was guilty of no neglect, and that the plaintiff has sustained no injury by bis nonfeasance.. And proof that the cows were not the property of <em>Porter </em>when attached, nor ever after, would be good evidence that the defendant is in no default, but would have been a trespasser, had he seized the cows. Under this impression, we think the evidence offered was improperly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"AR0\">[ * 502 ] * If it had been urged for the plaintiff that he has not alleged the property of the cows to be in <em>Porter, </em>and therefore the property of them was not in issue, it might have been answered that the plaintiff has suffered no damage whatever by the defendant\u2019s conduct, if the cows were not the property of <em>Porter, </em>and that the evidence could not injure him. And it may be added that, after a verdict for the plaintiff, the insufficiency of the declaration may be considered as cured by it; for it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s title to damages is not in itself defective, but only defectively stated, and that the jury would not have given a verdict for him, unless it had been proved that the property of the cows was in <em>Porter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the verdict ought to be set aside, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\"><em>The Chief Justice </em>then observed that, at a conference of the judges, his brother <em>Sedgwick </em>had expressed his full concurrence in the opinion that the evidence had been improperly rejected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
