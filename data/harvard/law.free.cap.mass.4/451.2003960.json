K. K., to pay Him or bearer seventy-five dollars, payable, on, &amp;.c. And the plaintiff is the bearer of said note; yet, though often requested, the said <em>Weeks </em>has not paid said sum, but refuses to do it; to the damage,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">To this declaration the defendant demurred generally, and the plaintiff joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-9\"><em>Wilde </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQo\">Here is no privity shown between the parties. It ought at least to appear that the plaintiff came lawfully to the possession of the note. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> When a negotiable note is transferred, a valuable consideration for the transfer is always alleged, and such allegation is an essential part of the declaration, and is the ground on which the law raises the promise to pay to the endorsee. In declarations upon notes payable to bearer, the practice has been uniform, to allege a promise directly to the plaintiff, and such allegation seems necessary upon common principles. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-10\">\n<em>Stebbins, e contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmN\">held the declaration good enough ; and he contended that what was not necessary to be proved on trial could not be matter of substance, and no advantage could be taken of the defect of such allegations upon general demurrer. The title of the plaintiff to bring the action as bearer is matter of legal inference <em>Stebbins </em>said he had met with no. form of declaration, in which, after an averment * that the plaintiff was' the [ * 452 ] bearer, an express promise to pay him was alleged.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> 2 <em>Show. </em>23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AMzU\"> <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>115, 200, 201. \u2014 1 <em>Esp.

When there is sufficient matter substantially alleged to entitle the plaintiff to his action, the declaration will be good on a general demurrer. On this ground we shall support this declaration ; but we wish practitioners would make it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>rule to adhere to established forms in their declarations and pleadings. They would save much trouble to themselves and the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Declaration adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
