Some time after, the pauper lived in <em>Boston, Dorchester, </em>and <em>Braintree, </em>until he was fifteen years of age, when he entered as a soldier in the provincial service against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ihe <em>French. </em>In 1763, he was discharged from the service, returned * from <em>Nova Scotia </em>to <em>Boston, </em>resided [*313] there two or three days, and from thence went to <em>Barn-stable, </em>in the county of <em>Barnstable, </em>where he engaged in the business of a mariner, in the whale fishery, in <em>West India </em>and coasting voyages. He continued in <em>Barnstable </em>about two years, boarding with a Mr. <em>Fuller, </em>a selectman of that place, when on shore, which did not exceed six weeks or two months at any one time. He then removed from <em>Barnstable </em>to <em>Sandwich, </em>where he continued following the same business as at <em>Barnstable. He made his home at </em>Sandwich <em>until some time after the year </em>1767, during which time he once resided on shore at <em>Sandwich </em>six months at one time, being confined with a wound in his leg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The said pauper was not warned to depart from either of the towns of <em>Barnstable </em>or <em>Sandwich, </em>during his residence in those towns respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">Upon these facts, the Court of Common Pleas adjudged that the legal settlement of the pauper and his wife was not in the town of <em>Boston.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">To reverse this judgment, and to obtain a judgment of this Court that the settlement of the said pauper is in <em>Boston, </em>this writ of error s brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\"><em>G. Blake, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao0\">argued that the pauper, havng originally had a legal settlement in <em>Boston, </em>could not lose that settlement but by gaining a new one in another town. He could not lose it by going into his country\u2019s service as a soldier. His removal to <em>Barnstable </em>and <em>Sandwich </em>was only for the more convenient exercise of his business as a mariner, and the case finds that he never resided at either of those places for more than six weeks at any one time. As to the expression that <em>he made his home at Sandwich, </em>it must be taken in connection with the other facts, which show that he was all the time a transient, seafaring man. His confinement by lameness for six months at one period, being a providential misfortune, cannot affect the legal rights of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-9\">By the law <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> then in force in this government, no stranger coming into a town could gain a settlement, so as to charge * such town with his support in case he became [ * 314 ] a pauper, but by twelve months\u2019 residence without warning, or the approbation of the selectmen, or of the town. It is true this man was never warned from <em>Barnstable </em>or Sandwich; but then lite transient desultory residence of a sailor constantly employed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sea voyages is not such a residence as must have been contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>Thatcher, </em>for the defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOgF\">acknowledged that it was incumbent on them to show that the pauper had gained a new settlement, or the town of <em>Boston </em>must be chargeable. And he thought the facts disclosed in this case abundantly showed a settlement gained either at <em>Barnstable </em>or <em>Sandioich </em>; and for the decision of the present case, it was entirely immaterial at which of those places the settlement was gained. He <em>made his home </em>for several years in one and the other of those places, and two years in each of them. The construction which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel put upon the statute, <em>viz,, </em>that the residence, to gain a settlement, must be continuous, and without any interruption, or even an excursion for business or pleasure, is too narrow and inconvenient to receive the countenance of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">That this person\u2019s residence was not secret or clandestine while at <em>Barnstable, </em>appears from his living with one of the selectmen of the town, whose office it was to warn such strangers as they wished to protect the town against. This person was then young and vigorous, and his settlement there was probably considered rather as an acquisition than a burden. The statutes of 10 <em>G. </em>2, <em>c. </em>3, and 13 <em>G. </em>2, c. 1, show that the legislature contemplated that some towns might be clandestinely and unexpectedly burdened by strangers gaining a settlement, and provision is made for their indemnity by an action against those who harbored them. This indemnity is open to <em>Barnstable </em>and <em>Sandwich, </em>but <em>Boston </em>cannot claim it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-7\"><em>Blake, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqAO\">cited the case of <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Walpole. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> 12 and 13 <em>W. </em>3, c 10</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> 1 <em>W.
