On the 8th day of January, 1806, a verdict was given for <em>Clap </em>in that suit, and judgment rendered thereon for costs against the then plaintiffs. On the 13th of February following, * <em>Brazier </em>and <em>Davis </em>sued a writ [ * 100 ] of review of that judgment, which Was duly served on <em>Clap </em>on the 21st of the same February, and was still pending. On the 15th of October, 1806, <em>Clap </em>sued this writ of replevin, having previously demanded the goods of <em>Bell, </em>who refused to deliver them, by the direction of <em>Brazier </em>and <em>Davis, </em>they claiming a right to hold them under the attachment, until the determination of the said review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-9\"><em>Blake, </em>of counsel for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGz_\">was called on by the Court; and he contended that under the existing statutes a review must be considered as a continuation of the original suit, being confined to the same pleadings, &amp;c. The provision in this respect was very different from the old statutes on the subject, under which a review is considered as an original suit. By the statute of 1784, <em>c. </em>28, &lt;\u00a7&gt;11, \u201cAll goods and estate attached upon mesne process for the security of the debt or damages sued for, shall be held for the space of thirty days after <em>final </em>judgment, to be taken in execution.'\u201d Now, it seems to be absurd to call that a final judgment, which the party against whom it is rendered may cause to be reviewed, and of which he may suspend the execution. It resembles more the judgment of an inferior court, from which there lies an appeal, in which case goods attached are still held to respond the judgment of the court having the appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR-\"><em>Bell, </em>the deputy sheriff, contends that, on the facts in this case, the attachment continued in force, and that it was his duty to retain the goods notwithstanding <em>Clap\u2019s </em>demand. But we are all of opinion that, when goods or estate are attached by virtue of an original writ to secure the judgment, which the plaintiff may recover, if on the appeal judgment be rendered for the defendant, the attachment is <em>ipso facto </em>dissolved ; and the sheriff can no longer retain the property attached against the demand of the defendant. If the plaintiff should recover judgment, and should delay delivering his execution to the sheriff for thirty days, then the attachment is also dissolved. According to the agreement of the parties in this case, the defendant must be called.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
