Where the intention was to make a bill of exchange, that intention gives the character to the instrument. It is not even necessary, to constitute a bill of exchange, that any payee be named, for [ * 260 ] in that case it shall be held payable to him of whom * the value was received. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The words \u201cor order\u201d are not necessary, nor is it essential to the character of this species of instrument, that it should be transferable from one person to another. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-9\">This bill may then be considered, in the first place, as a bill payable to bearer or to <em>Blandow Sf Co. </em>and bearer. In support of this position may be cited the <em>English </em>cases of bills payable to fic titious payees. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-10\">If, secondly, this be considered as a bill drawn by <em>Blandow fy Co. </em>in favor of the plaintiffs, there can be no doubt of the responsibility of the defendant, upon his acceptance. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> It is not necessary that the whole of a bill be on the same side of the paper on which it is written. If, on the whole, there was a valuable consideration paid, and an intention to create a bill of exchange, it will be construed as such, if possible. The paper, in this case, comes precisely within <em>Chitty\u2019s </em>definition of a bill of exchange. In <em>Heylin </em>vs. <em>Adamson, </em>it is said by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>that every endorsement creates a new bill of exchange. And in the case of <em>Gibson 8f Al. </em>vs. <em>Minot 8f Al. in error, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> Lord <em>C. B. Eyer, </em>who differed from the other judges as to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover in that action, agrees that if they had declared upon a bill drawn by the endorsers, payable to the plaintiffs, or their order, they might have recovered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-11\">\n<em>Channing</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABS\">went on to support this instrument as a bill drawn by <em>('alder </em>on <em>Pearce, </em>payable to the plaintiffs, and as drawn by <em>Calde* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>on <em>Pearce, </em>payable <em>to Blandow &amp;f Co. </em>or bearer; but as the Court confined their opinion to the third count, it is considered as unnecessary to recite the arguments used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">As evidence of the defendant\u2019s acceptance, <em>Channing </em>relied on his previous orders to <em>Colder </em>to draw on him, on his subsequent letters to the plaintiffs, undertaking to take up the bill, and on the partial payments, which the case finds to have been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">* The words \u201c value in account,\u201d used in the endorse- [ * 261 J ment of this bill, show the property in the plaintiffs. But whether the holder of the bill paid a consideration or not, is immaterial, unless third persons are injured. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>Jackson</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgHj\">said the cause had appeared to him to lie in a very narrow compass. He contended that this paper was not, in its original form, a negotiable instrument. It was no more than a certificate from <em>Calder, </em>the agent of the defendant, showing the amount due from the latter to <em>Blandow fy Co. </em>No bill is negotiable unless originally containing words empowering the proprietor to assign it. The cases respecting bills payable to fictitious payees, and determining them payable to bearer, arose out of the necessity of the thing. But no such necessity arises in this case. Nor will any equitable claims be infringed by a decision against the plaintiffs, in this action, it being very plain, from the facts, that the real parties in interest are <em>Blandow fy Co., </em>and that the plaintiffs are merely agents or servants of theirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">Taking it for granted that this bill, as it is called, is not negotiable, upon the face of it, can the plaintiffs recover upon the facts disclosed in this case ? To answer this question, it is not necessary to recur to ancient principles respecting the assignment of <em>choses in action. </em>The most liberal decisions of modern times require evidence of an adequate consideration for the assignment. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> But nothing of that appears here. So to make an assignment valid, so far as to enable the assignee to maintain the action in his own name, there must be notice to the debtor, and his assent. But there is nothing in the case, which shows notice to <em>Pearce </em>of a transfer of this debt, or an assent on his part to hold the present plaintiffs as his creditors. He considered himself the debtor of <em>Blandow &amp;f Co., </em>and the plaintiffs uniformly treat the business in that light, in their letters to him. These letters were the only notice to the defendant, and they do not once suggest any interest in the plaintiffs; so that no assent of the defendant, or implied promise to pay them for their own use, can be presumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-9\">* It is indeed immaterial to the defendant to whom he [ * 262 ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>pays a balance which he does not dispute. Nor does he question the authority of the plaintiffs to receive this money, and to give him a good discharge as against <em>Blandow if Co., </em>their principals. The defence in this action is substantially made in behalf of those creditors of <em>Blandow if Co. </em>who have summoned the defendant as thpir trustee, and who must lose their debts, unless they can save them out of this fund.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-5\">\n<em>Prescott</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFx\">enforced the observations made by <em>Jackson, </em>and urged particularly that this paper was not originally assignable, and if it was, that it had never been assigned. The cases cited for the plaintiffs were all of notes originally made negotiable, or, from the necessity of the thing, so construed by the Court, as in the case of the fictitious payees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>Otis</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AApV\">would have replied for the plaintiffs, but was stopped by the Court, whose opinion was afterwards delivered as follows bv</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\"> <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>46. \u2014 <em>Pothier, </em>24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\"> <em>Chitty, </em>48. \u2014 <em>Pothier, </em>200, 206</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b232-14\"> <em>Vere </em>vs. <em>Lewis, </em>3 <em>Term Rep. </em>182. \u2014 <em>Minet &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Gibson Al., </em>3 <em>Term Rep </em>481. \u20141 <em>H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">It appears from the case as stated, that on the 19th of June, 1803, <em>Calder, </em>a master of the defendant\u2019s ship <em>Martha Washington, </em>was with the ship at <em>St. Petersburg, </em>and there purchased of <em>Blandow &amp; Co. </em>a cargo for his owner, agreeably to whose orders to pay the balance due to <em>Blandow &amp; Co., </em>he drew a bill for 25,000 rubles on the defendant, payable in six months at <em>Amsterdam,, </em>at the plaintiffs\u2019, without mentioning the name of any payee. This bill was delivered to <em>Blandow &amp; Co., </em>who, on the 23d of June, sent the bill to the plaintiffs, with an endorsement, di reefing the defendant to pay the contents to the order of the plain tiffs, value in account. The plaintiffs, at the request of <em>Blandou &amp; Co., </em>sent the bill to the defendant, who accepted it; and it not having been paid, the plaintiffs have brought this action, in which they have declared in several different ways, that these facts might support some one of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The third count states the contract as a bill drawn by <em>Blandow &amp; Co. </em>on <em>Pearce, </em>in favor of the plaintiffs, and accepted. And we are all satisfied that the plaintiffs may recover on this count; because every endorsement of a bill may be considered as a new bill drawn by the endorser on the acceptor in favor of the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"AXT\">[ * 263 ] * The defendant\u2019s counsel have not contested the truth of this position as generally true; but they argue that this case must be considered as an exception for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">1. Because, from the letters of the plaintiffs, it appears that they hold the bill on account of the endorsers, and therefore the action shou.d have been sued in their names. This reason does not appear to have much force; for upon an express promise to pay to the factor of any one for the use of the principal, the factor may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>maintain an action in his own name; and as the endorsement expresses value in account, if the endorsee holds it for the use of the endorser, he is his factor, as to this bill. If <em>Pearce </em>had, after his acceptance, paid the bill to the principal, he might be allowed to avail himself of such payment against the factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">2. The second reason is, that the creditors of <em>Blandow &amp; Co </em>have sued <em>Pearce </em>as their trustee, and therefore the money due on the bill is attached in his hands. This reason cannot prevail, for in this action we cannot consider the rights of any persons, who are not parties to the bill. And admitting that <em>Blandow &amp; Co. </em>might have given notice to <em>Pearce </em>not to pay the bill to their factors, the plaintiffs, yet the creditors of <em>Blandow &amp; Co. </em>have no authority to discharge <em>Pearce </em>from his express promise made to the factors of their debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Let the defendant be defaulted, and let the plaintiffs enter their judgment on the third count for the sum agreed to be due on the bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
