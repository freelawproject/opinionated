This the plaintiff agreed to, and on proposing it to the defendant, he consented, and verbally promised the plaintiff that he should be paid in that manner for <em>Beals\u2019s </em>board ; that he then boarded with the plaintiff, and was considered by him as likewise answerable for the payment of his board. On this examination, the judge rejected <em>Beals </em>as interested, and therefore incompetent to charge <em>Andrews </em>in this action. The other charges being admitted by the defendant, a verdict was taken for the amount of them only, subject to the opinion of the Court, whether <em>Beals </em>was a competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>witness, and whether the facts thus disclosed by him on the <em>voir dire, </em>if proved by paroi testimony only, would support this action.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">The cause stood continued to this term ; and now <em>Story, </em>for the plaintiff, contended that the witness ought only to have been inquired of generally on his <em>voir dire, </em>whether he was interested in the suit, and expected to gain or lose by the event of it; and if he answered this inquiry satisfactorily, should have been sworn in chief, in which case his testimony would have gone to the jury, and might have been sufficient to support the plaintiff\u2019s demand. If it be said that the witness disclosed all the facts that could have come out, if he had been sworn in chief, the objection remains that the jury were not permitted to decide upon his testimony.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\"><em>Putnam, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b573-6\">* <em>By the Court.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZR\">We are satisfied that the rejection [ *654 ] of the witness in this case was right. If the plaintiff, who produced <em>Beals, </em>prevailed, then <em>Beals </em>would be discharged from any demand for his board by the plaintiff; and in an action brought against him by the plaintiff for his board, he might give in evidence the judgment on the verdict in this cause, and satisfaction of it, to defeat the action. But if <em>Beals </em>was not interested, it would have been useless to the plaintiff to have sworn him; for, laying the statute of frauds out of the question, his testimony would have proved, if any thing, a special contract made by the defendant with the plaintiff to pay for the witness\u2019s board in goods, which testimony would have disproved the contract on which the action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Judgment must be entered on the verdict</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
