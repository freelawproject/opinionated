The plaintiffs received accounts of the loss by letters from the supercargo on the 21st of January, 1806, and further particulars of it on the 9th and 10th of February following, and on the 24th of the same February they received a full and distinct account of the nature and extent of it, with the necessary documents to prove it. The plaintiffs lived in the town of Newburyport, where the office of the defendants is kept, and the offer to abandon was made on the 10th of April following, which the defendants refused to accept; and the only question made was, whether the offer to abandon was made in such season as to bind the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-7\"><em>Prescott, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQs\">said he was not aware that any precise period had been fixed, within which the insured was bound to abandon. In the present case, the plaintiffs had no stronger inducement to abandon when they did it, than when they received the accounts of the loss. In the case of <em>Livermore </em>against these same defendants, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where the party had waited more than a month after notice of the loss before he abandoned, intelligence of a peace in <em>Europe </em>was received, a circumstance which appeared to have considerable weight with the Court in determining that he had lain by too long. The cases of <em>Mitchell </em>vs. <em>Edie </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> and <em>Allwood </em>vs. <em>Henkell </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>were also referred to, as showing that no definite period was fixed by the law within which the assured was bound to make his election to abandon.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-5\">* Jackson, of counsel for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvtA\">was stopped [ * 670 ] by the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>vol. i. 264</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b586-10\"> <em>Marsh. </em>509</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\"><em>Ibid. </em>512</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b587-6\">Parsons, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APV\">observed, after stating the facts agreed, that the question reserved was simply whether the plaintiffs had, or had not, seasonably abandoned after the knowledge of the peril, so as to entitle them to recover a total loss. They had notice of the loss, and of the nature and extent of it, on the 24th of February ; they lived in the town where the defendants kept their office, but did not offer to abandon until forty-five days after notice of the loss was received ; and no reason is assigned for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The owner must abandon within a reasonable time after notice He shall not delay for the purposes of speculation, or wait for further intelligence to guide him in his speculations. What is a reasonable time must depend on facts. When the facts are agreed or found, it is a question of law. In the case at bar, the offer to abandon was delayed until the 10th of April. This delay, unaccounted for, is unreasonable ; and the Court are all of opinion that, in not offering to abandon sooner, the plaintiffs lost their right to abandon, and can recover for a partial loss only.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Let commissioners be appointed to liquidate the damages, and let t he cause stand over for their report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
