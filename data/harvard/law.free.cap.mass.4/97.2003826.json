The writ was thus endorsed: \u201c This suit is commenced for the benefit of <em>Samuel Treat, Maria Treat, Ann Treat, Mary Treat, </em>and <em>Lucius Junius Treat, </em>children of <em>Samuel Treat, </em>deceased, and heirs of <em>Lemuel C. May, </em>deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">The defendants confessed the forfeiture, and prayed to be heard in chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-11\">The Court appointed two commissioners to hear the parties, and to receive and state the account of said <em>Treat, </em>exhibited by the defendants, (consisting of charges for the * main- [ * 98 ] tenance of the said children,) which the defendants prayed to be allowed in mitigation of damages claimed by the plaintiff in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-12\">The commissioners reported that the deceased guardian had received sundry sums of money for his minor children, as they were legatees named in the last will of <em>Lemuel C. May, </em>deceased, amounting in the whole to 2452 dollars 70 cents; that, as to the account exhibited by the defendants, they found no charges made by the late guardian in his lifetime, nor any vouchers among his papers in support of said account, which, they say, was wholly assumed by the defendants, his sureties, as what they suppose he would have been entitled to exhibit and claim, had he seen fit so to do ; that the charges were all reasonable that he did in fact sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>port his said children, during the time the said account charges; and that he had little or no property of his own.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\"><em>Heard, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADn\">argued that the deceased father of these minors was bound to provide for their maintenance. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">In <em>England, </em>when a parent is poor, and unable to support his children, the chancellor may direct the interest of their funds to go in aid of the parent, but not the principal, except for the advancement of the minor, as the apprenticing him out, which is only changing the principal, not diminishing it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">It appears that the account offered by the defendants is wholly assumed by them. No charge was made by the father in his lifetime against the children, and as the father was under a natural obligation to support his children, no implied promise could be raised.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\">\n<em>Thurston, e contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alh\">contended that the practice had been to go behind the interest, if that proved insufficient. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> <em>Comyns </em>says, \u201c The Court may make a liberal allowance out of the infant\u2019s estate to a mother, a guardian, who is in distressed circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> And our law makes no distinction in this respect between fathers and mothers. [ <em>Chief Justice. </em>That is true in the case [ * 99 ] of pauper children, but * where minor children have property of their own, the father is, notwithstanding, bound to support them, if of ability ; but it is otherwise with the mother.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>Heard, in </em>reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avbq\">If a stranger had been guardian, and the father died, could his administrator- recover against the guardian the amount of the board of the children, while living with the father, he having never made any charge thereof, and there being no evidence that he intended to do so ? If the administrator in such a case could not recover, the present defendants stand on no better ground as to obtaining relief.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\"> 1 <em>Black.
