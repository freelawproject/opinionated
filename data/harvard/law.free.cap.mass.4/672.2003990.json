The plaintiff demanded his half of the profits on the coffee which was saved, or of the difference in the costs and the proceeds of that part of the defendant\u2019s adventure.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-11\">The cause stood continued to this term, when it was briefly spoken to by <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Story </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Jackson </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-12\"><em>For the plaintiff, </em>it was said that the sole question in the cause arises on the construction of the agreement endorsed on the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>lading; and it was contended that as the half profits, to be received by the plaintiff, were in the nature of freight, and in lieu of it, so they ought to be governed bv the same rules. The parties, it should seem, at the time of the shipment, had but one event in contemplation, <em>viz., </em>the safe return of the ship and cargo ; and the special contract provides only for that event. If there remained a profit, after deducting the whole sum shipped from the net proceeds thereof, that profit was to be divided. As the case which has happened was not considered, it is now open, and it is for the <em>law </em>to allow a reasonable freight on the property saved, after deducting from the proceeds a proportional part of the sum shipped. In case of a loss of a part of property carried on freight, a <em>pro rata </em>freight is due by law on that part which is saved ; and no reason appears why this rule of law should not be applied in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\"><em>For the defendant, </em>the case of <em>Putnam, </em>vs. <em>Wood </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> was relied upon as deciding this question. <em>Putnam, </em>had shipped specie on board <em>Wood\u2019s </em>vessel to the <em>East Indies, </em>for a certain proportion, of the profits, in lieu of freight, &amp;c. There was a loss on the goods. Two questions were made : the one was, whether the vessel was sea-worthy, and if she was so, the other question was, whether the property saved was to be considered as a new capital, and the share of the profits made on the capital be allowed. The principal argument was on the first question ; but the Court would [ * 674 ] not * hear an argument as to the rule estimating the profits. They said there was no doubt but that the original amount of the adventure was first to be deducted from the proceeds, and the remainder, if any, was to be divided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\"><em>The Court </em>said they could see no difference between the case at bar and the point settled in the case cited by the defendant\u2019s counsel; that the decision in that case had been correctly stated, and unless a distinction could be shown between the two cases, it would be useless to hear any further argument; and they ordered judgment to be entered upon the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">Afterwards, while <em>Sedgwick, </em>J., was sitting over for the trial of issues, he stated that he had received a letter from <em>Parker, </em>J., informing him that he had since the decision, perceived a distinction between this cause and that of <em>Putnam </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>and regretting that judgment had been entered. And <em>Sedgwick, </em>J., thereupon ordered the entry to be cancelled, and the action was continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>vol. iii. 484</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">And at the succeeding March term in <em>Suffolk, </em>the unanimous opinion of the Court <em>[the Chief Justice </em>not sitting in the cause] was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjZ\">[After stating briefly the facts in the cause.] The plaintiff\u2019s claim of a part of the profits on the coffee which was saved is, in our opinion, contrary to the manifest intention of the contract, by which the plaintiff was entitled only, in case there should be, in fact, a profit arising upon the whole adventure ; if there should be such a loss that no profit should accrue, the plaintiff would have no right to claim any thing. In this case, therefore, there being no profit, there is nothing to which the plaintiff can form <em>a just </em>claim. The same principle was assumed as correct in the case of <em>Putnam </em>vs. <em>Wood, </em>which was cited at the bar by the judgment of the whole Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We are all of opinion that judgment must be entered according to the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
