The judge refused to admit the plan, because a plan, including the lands in question, had been taken by order of Court, and with the consent of the parties in this action, which was proved to be accurate; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>because the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, when he offered the first-mentioned plan, acknowledged that it was not of itself legal evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">It appearing in evidence that <em>Shepard, </em>the defendant\u2019s intestate, entered on the land in question about the year 1779, claiming to hold the same under a grant from the commonwealth, and that the plaintiff has quietly possessed the same lands from the date of <em>Shepard\u2019s </em>deed to him, the judge directed the jury that, if they believed the said evidence, it was sufficient in law to support the covenant of seism made by <em>Shepard, </em>and that neither that covenant, nor the covenant to warrant and defend, were broken, as no eviction of the plaintiff had been proved, and the jury accordingly rendered their verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed exceptions to the said opinions of the judge, upon which the cause stood continued to this term, upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial for the misdirection of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-7\">And now, <em>Whitman, </em>of counsel for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alk\">contended that, if one conveys land of which he is not lawfully seised, and he covenants that he is so seised, the covenant is broken the instant it is made, and the grantee may have his action [*409 ] * presently, and need not wait for an actual eviction to take place, by which time the circumstances of the grantor may make the remedy upon the covenant of no value. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Whitman </em>thought that the plan offered at the trial, which contained lines not in that taken by order of Court, when verified by the oath of the surveyor, should have been suffered to be shown to the jury. But he did not much press this exception.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-8\"><em>Mellen, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anvq\">observed that the case did not show that the plan offered and refused contained any lines not laid down on the other. But this exception, he thought, could not have much weight, since the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had acknowledged at the trial that the plan was not legal evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\">As to the principal exception, <em>Mellen </em>insisted that, without showing an eviction, the plaintiff could not maintain his action. <em>Shepard </em>did not covenant that he was seised by an <em>indefeasible </em>title, but only that he was <em>seised. </em>The case finds this to be true. And this observation is a sufficient answer to the <em>dictum </em>from <em>Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone. </em>If, in fact, the grantor had not been so seised as to entitle him to make this covenant, the defendant, it is acknowledged, would have no defence in this action. But the seisin was sufficient to support the covenant when it was made, and it will be early enough for the plaintiff to bring his action, when he shall be dis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>turbed in his possession by one showing a title paramount to that of his grantor.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> <em>Shep. </em>Touchstone, 170.\u2014 <em>Cro.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">We are satisfied that the judge was correct in rejecting the plan. Anciently, the land was not described in the declaration; but the plaintiff was bound to give the defendant a view. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The practice here has been to describe the land in the declaration, and, if necessary, to send the jury to view it. But to supersede the necessity of either of those views, a very convenient practice has arisen, \u2014 to have a plan taken under a rule of the Court by a surveyor, appointed by the Court, or agreed upon by the parties, who is sworn to the faithful execution of the trust, as are *a!so the chain-bearers. And his duty is to give [ *410 ] notice to the parties, and to mark on the plan any monuments or lines, which either of the parties shall request. A plan taken <em>ex parte </em>can never be used but as chalk, unless by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">As to the other exception, it is very clear that the defendant\u2019s intestate, being in possession, claiming a fee simple in the land, was able to convey. So the covenant of seisin was not broken. And, to entitle the plaintiff to recover on the covenant of warranty, he must show an actual eviction, or ouster, by a paramount title. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\"><em>Memorandum. </em>\u2014 May term, 1806, at <em>Portland, Ezekiel Whitman, </em>Esquire, and June term, 1806, at <em>Wiscasset, James D.
