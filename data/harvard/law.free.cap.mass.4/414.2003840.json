The defendant also offered to read to the jury a paper, in the following words, <em>viz.: \u201c Cornville, </em>February 15, 1804. These lines may certify that I, the subscriber, agree with <em>James Tuttle </em>to wait on him for the money due me, \u2019till he turns his property to the best advantage. <em>Benjamin Dow; </em>\u201d and to prove by witnesses that the said writing was made and signed at the same time with the note declared on, though bearing different dates, and constituted part of the same contract; and, further, to prove that said <em>Tuttle </em>should be allowed five years to turn his property, as mentioned in said writing ; that the plaintiff was present, and had full knowledge * of all the agreements aforesaid; and that the [ *415 ] defendant refused to sign the note, until the above condition and agreement were made. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of this evidence, and the judge refused to admit it, and directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-9\"><em>Bridge, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeZ\">contended that, from the privity of the plaintiff to the agreement stated, and from the note\u2019s being dishonored before its negotiation, the' defendant was entitled to every advantage of the agreement, in the same manner as if the action had been brought by the promisee; and the different agreements consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tute but several parts of one entire contract. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Suppose a covenant to pay money in a year, and, in the same instrument, a covenant of the payee not to compel payment under five years ; this would be a condition not repugnant to, but consistent with, the first covenant</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AP5E\"><em>Rice, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9u\">insisted that this agreement made no part of the original contract, which was a plain, explicit, and unconditional promise to pay the money at a day certain; and to show that paroi evidence cannot be received to contradict an agreement in writing, he cited the case of <em>Meres &amp;f Al. </em>vs. <em>Ansell 8f Al. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> <em>Gold </em>vs. <em>Eddy, </em>1 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUv\">We are satisfied that the agreement, proposed by the def\u00e9ndant to be given in evidence at the trial, is not to be considered as a part of the contract with the note. That is a promise to pay to the promisee, or his order, a sum of money in one year If the agreement was a part of this contract, it would be repugnant to the note, and destroy its effect. The agreement, although made at the same time, must be considered as a collateral promise of the promisee\u2019s, for the breach of which, if there be a legal consideration, an action would lie. In chancery, it would be a sufficient ground for an injunction against the plaintiff, proving his knowledge of it' before he purchased the note. And at law, perhaps, it may support a motion to stay proceedings, by granting imparlances, [*416] until the plaintiff could put *it in suit consistent with the agreement. But, on this last point, it is not now necessary to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As we consider the agreement as collateral to the note, the evidence was properly rejected, and a new trial cannot be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\n<em>Judgment according to verdict, </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>(a)</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> [From the evidence, it seems that the two paper writings should, between the original parties, and between the maker and an assignee with notice, have been treated as parts of one entire transaction. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
