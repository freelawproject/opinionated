\u201d <em>Babb </em>then told his name; \u201cWho is with you?\u201d asked <em>Quinby; </em>upon <em>Babb\u2019s </em>answering, \u201c No one,\u201d he was admitted into the [ * 393 ] shop, and the * door was again fastened; and <em>Babb </em>delivered his message from the deceased, advised <em>Quinby </em>to settle the execution, and told him that <em>Conant </em>was ready to settle it for him if he would consent; but <em>Quinby </em>refused, and said it should not be settled that night; that the deceased then came to the shop with <em>Bichard King, Samuel Cox, </em>and some others, to assist him, and knocked at the door ; <em>Drew </em>was drawing nails from a rod then in his hand, and <em>Quinby </em>was blowing the bellows, one hand being on the bellows pole, and the other resting on the bludgeon, with which the mortal wound was afterwards given; that when the deceased had knocked, <em>Drew </em>inquired who was there ? \u201c <em>Parker,\u201d </em>answered the deceased ; that <em>Drew </em>then threw some burning cinders towards the door from the nail rod in his hand; that <em>Parker </em>then asked for admission, and <em>Drew </em>asked him if he was well; \u201cYes,\u201d answered <em>Parker; </em>\u201cthen I advise you,\u201d said <em>Drew, </em>\u201c to stay where you are; \u201d that the deceased then told <em>Drew, </em>that he did not want <em>him, </em>that he wanted <em>Quinby, </em>who was his prisoner, and that he would have him ; that the deceased then put his hands under the door, which was about four feet w'do, and which opened outwards on a lane leading to <em>Conant\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>house, and to his mills, and, without much apparent difficulty, pulled it open ; that <em>Drew </em>immediately threw down the nail rod, caught up a sledge, and came to the door; that he went out in a great passion, saying, <em>\u201c </em>What are you breaking open my shop for ? stand by, or I will throw the sledge through you ; \u201d that he then, with the sledge, struck at the deceased, who was without any weapon, and who dodged behind the door ; that he then struck at <em>King, </em>who re treated from the sledge, and <em>Drew </em>threw it at him, and it glanced against his breast, and fell without hurting him ; that <em>Quinby, </em>when <em>Drew </em>had left the shop with the sledge in his hand, threw down the bludgeon he had held, towards the door, and it fell about two feet distant from it; that <em>Drew, </em>after throwing the sledge at <em>King, </em>returned to the shop door, and saw the bludgeon lying there ; that he reached in his hand, and took the bludgeon, and turned to the deceased, who had pushed the door partly forward, had come from behind it, and was standing against the edge of it, and struck at * him three times with the bludgeon, holding [ * 394 ] it in both his hands, and striking with great violence; that the first blow fell on the edge of the door, and forcibly shut it, the second blow was on the head of the deceased, and inflicted the mortal wound ; and the deceased, when falling under the weight of it, received the third blow on his back or shoulders, it not being clearly ascertained on which ; and one witness also testified that the first blow struck the head of the deceased ; that <em>Drew </em>then turned to <em>King, </em>and with the bludgeon knocked him down, and immediately went into the shop, carrying the bludgeon with him, and there told <em>Babb </em>that he had better take <em>Parker </em>up, as he had got enough of it; that <em>Babb </em>left the shop to take up the deceased, and <em>Drew </em>and <em>Quinby </em>again fastened the door, and, opening the window, defied the people who were outside; <em>Drew </em>saying that as many might come as had a mind to, and he would give them all sore heads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">Upon this evidence, the counsel for the prisoner argued, that the offence was manslaughter, and not murder. That <em>Parker </em>having before arrested <em>Quinby </em>on the execution, and his servant having permitted him voluntarily to escape, he could not again lawfully arrest <em>Quinby </em>on the same execution; and therefore the deceased was a trespasser in breaking open the shop door, and his entry might lawfully be resisted by <em>Drew, </em>who was in possession of the shop. And they argued further that the deceased was killed in attempting unlawfully to arrest <em>Quinby, </em>by color of a legal warrant; that the attempt was an unlawful act; that not on'y <em>Quinby, </em>but any stranger, might lawfully oppose the officer in his unlawful attempt, and <em>a fortiori </em>might <em>Drew, </em>as he could not be considered as a stranger, being a fellow-servant with <em>Quinby, </em>working with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for <em>Conant, </em>who had hired them to labor in his service; and if the officer was killed in pursuing his unlawful attempt, the killing was at most but manslaughter. And upon this point they cited, and relied on as authorities, <em>Sir Henry Ferrer\u2019s case, Cro. Car. </em>371.\u2014 <em>Hopkin Hugget\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Hale, </em>465. and <em>Kel. </em>59.\u2014 <em>Rex. </em>vs. <em>Tooley &amp; Al. </em>2 <em>L. Raym. </em>1296. \u2014 <em>Mary Adey\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Leach, C. C. </em>245. 1 <em>Fast, C. L. </em>329, <em>in the note.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aqkb\">* <em>The Solicitor-General </em>for the commonwealth</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvzP\">argued that when the mortal wound was received, the deceased had not given to <em>Drew </em>any provocation, sufficient, in law, to reduce the homicide below the crime of murder. And he cited <em>Foster\u2019s C. L. Disc. </em>2, <em>ch. </em>8, \u00a7 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 1 <em>Fast\u2019s C. L. </em>325, <em>ch. </em>5, \u00a7 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\"><em>The Chief Justice </em>charged the jury. After stating to them the evidence, he observed that, if they believed the witnesses, the deceased, when he received the mortal wound, was not in the execution of his office, as a deputy sheriff; that having arrested <em>Quinby </em>fourteen days before, and committed him to the custody of <em>King, </em>who had voluntarily permitted his prisoner to go at large, this permission must also be considered as the act of the deceased, whose servant <em>King </em>was; and that a voluntary escape of <em>Quinby </em>having been suffered, the deceased could not lawfully arrest him again on the same execution ; and therefore that the prisoner ought to be acquitted of the felony and murder charged in the first count of the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">In the second count, the prisoner was charged with murdering the deceased, then in the peace of GOD, and of the commonwealth, without any allegation that he was in the execution of his office as a deputy sheriff; and the jury were instructed that it was their duty to consider the evidence, as it applied to this second count. If they believed the witnesses, there was no question but that the deceased was killed by the prisoner at the bar. If they were satisfied of this fact, the implication of malice would arise, unless the circumstances of the killing were such as would reduce the crime below murder. If the act of killing was in itself attended with probable dangerous consequences to the deceased, and was committed deliberately, the malice will be presumed, unless some sufficient excuse or provocation should be shown ; for the law infers that the natural or probable effects of any act, deliberately done, were intended by the agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">It had been argued that there were two causes of provocation, which would reduce the killing below the crime of murder. One was, tnal the prisoner was in the peaceable possession of his shop, engaged in his lawful business, when the deceased unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>forced open the door, with an intent to enter, * against [*396] the prisoner\u2019s consent. The other provocation was, that the deceased forced the door, with the intent unlawfully to enter, and to arrest <em>Quinby, </em>who was the prisoner\u2019s fellow-servant, and at work with him, the deceased having no legal warrant therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\"><em>The Chief Justice </em>then observed that it was necessary for the jury, before they considered the nature and sufficiency of these provocations, to determine whether the bludgeon used by the prisoner, in killing the deceased, was, or was not, a deadly weapon, which would necessarily kill, or do great bodily harm; that this was a question of fact for the jury exclusively to decide. If the jury were satisfied that the weapon used was not likely to kill, or to do great bodily harm, he was of opinion that either of the provocations was sufficient to free the prisoner from the guilt of murder. For by using a weapon which would not probably do great injury to the deceased, it was a reasonable inference that the prisoner did not intend to kill the deceased, but accidentally killed him, against his intention, and the presumption of malice would be sufficiently rebutted; and without malice, the killing could not be murder. But if the jury were sat isfied that the instrument of death was a deadly weapon, which would probably kill the deceased, or do him great bodily injury these grounds of excuse or provocation would deserve a difieren consideration. That the provocation arising from the trespass committed by the deceased in breaking open the shop door, for the purpose of unlawfully entering, was not a provocation sufficient to reduce the killing below the crime of murder, if the prisoner killed the deceased with a deadly weapon; because the trespass was no* a sufficient excuse for such a barbarous act, admitting the prisoner and not <em>Conaif, </em>his master, to have had possession of the shop. For it is a rule of law, that where the trespass is barely against the property of another, not his dwelling-house, it is not a provocation sufficient to warrant the owner in using a deadly weapon; and if he do, and with it kill the trespasser, this will be murder, because it is an act of violence beyond the degree of the provocation ; but if the beating be with an instrument, and in a manner not likely to kill, and the trespasser should, notwithstanding, * hap- [ * 397 ] pen to be killed, it will be no more than manslaughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">The other provocation, which, it was argued, would reduce the killing below murder, was the forcibly breaking of the shop door by the deceased, with the intent unlawfully to enter, and to arrest <em>Quinby. </em>It was a principle of the law that, if any man, under color or claim of legal authority, unlawfully arrest, or actually attempt or offer to arrest another, and if he resist, and in the resistance kill the aggressor, it will be manslaughter; and that any person aiding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>injured party by endeavoring to rescue him, or to prevent an unlawful arrest when actually attempted, is guilty only of manslaughter, if he kill the aggressor in opposing him, unless, perhaps, the party aiding be a stranger to him, whom he shall endeavor to assist. \u2014 That whether the principle will, or will not, comprehend a stranger, it was not necessary then to decide, for it was the opinion of the judges then present, that in this case the prisoner was not to be considered as a stranger to <em>Quinby, </em>as they were fellow-servants, hired by the same master, and were at that time laboring together in his service.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">Although, from the testimony of the witness, (if the jury credited him,) it appeared that, on the door being broken open, the prisoner rushed out with his sledge, saying, \u201c What are you breaking open my shop for? stand by, or I will throw the sledge through you,\u201d whence it may be inferred that the fatal blow was given to chastise the deceased for the violence done to his shop ; yet the jury would decide, whether it must not be reasonably presumed that the intent of the prisoner was also to prevent the deceased from entering the shop to arrest <em>Quinby, </em>as the door had been fastened for his protection, and as the deceased had just before declared that he was his prisoner, and that he would have him. That in this view of the evidence the jury would apply the facts to the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">In three of the cases relied on for the prisoner, the unlawful arrest had been made before there was any resistance or quarrel. And in the last case, the officer and his assistant, before the latter was assaulted, were in the room with the party to be arrested, had him in their power, and had ordered him to go with them [ * 398 ] In the case of the prisoner, <em>Quinby </em>* had remained all the time in the shop, and the deceased ha,d not entered it, but, when the prisoner went out, had retreated behind the door, to avoid a blow from the sledge. That before the mortal blow was given, a stroke with the bludgeon had forcibly shut the door; and that the deceased and the prisoner were out of the shop, with the door closed, when the mortal wound was inflicted. If the jury were satisfied that the evidence established these facts, they would con elude that, although the deceased had forced open the door, with the intent to enter the shop, to arrest, or to attempt the arrest of <em>Quinby, </em>yet when he received his death wound, he had not arrested Quinby, nor had he, in fact, attempted or offered to arrest him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\"><em>The Chief Justice </em>concluded by observing that he had considered the evidence in a light as favorable to the prisoner as was consistent with the testimony of the witnesses ; and it was with regret that he was obliged to declare that, if the facts were as he had stated them, of which the jury were the judges, the killing of the deceased bv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the prisoner, if the instrument was a deadly weapon, amounted to the crime of murder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-5\">The jury acquitted the prisoner on the first count, and found him guilty of the felony and murder charged in the second count.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Quinby</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATD\">was afterwards put upon his trial, and the same evidence was given against him, which had been produced against <em>Drew. </em>It was further proved, in behalf of the commonwealth, that <em>Quinby </em>before <em>Parker </em>had arrested him on the execution, had armed himself with a club, and had declared to one witness, that if <em>Parker </em>attempted to take him, he would break his head; and to another witness, that if <em>Parker </em>came to take him, and he bid him stand off, if <em>Parker </em>persisted, he would split him down ; that after the mortal wound had been given, and <em>Drew </em>had again fastened himself in the shop, and let down the window, <em>Quinby </em>came to the window with a club, brandishing it in defiance; that he called one of the people a rascal, for pretending to be his friend, when he came to assist in taking him; and that <em>Quinby </em>or <em>Drew </em>said, Carry oft\" your dead officer.\u201d And the same <em>William Babb, </em>Jun., who was in the shop, when the * deceased forced open [ * 399 ] the door, testified that when the door was opened for himself, <em>Quinby </em>was standing within two feet of the door, with the bludgeon in his hand; that after he entered, the door was hasped, and <em>Quinby </em>went to the bellows, and shifting the bludgeon to his other hand, began blowing the bellows ; but he further swore, that when <em>Drew </em>went out of the shop with the sledge, <em>Quinby </em>did not \u2022emove from his place ; that while standing by the bellows, he threw down the bludgeon, which fell between the anvil and the door, and about two feet from the door; that when he threw it down, he said nothing ; and that after <em>Drew </em>went out of the shop, <em>Quinby </em>could not see him, neither when he threw the sledge, nor when <em>Quinby </em>threw down the bludgeon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-7\">Upon this evidence, <em>the Chief Justice </em>left it to the jury, whether they would presume that <em>Quinby </em>threw the bludgeon towards the door, with the intent to furnish <em>Drew </em>with a deadly weapon, to assault the deceased outside of the shop. If they were satisfied that he threw the bludgeon with that intent, he was equally guilty with <em>Drew, </em>who used it. But if they were not satisfied that the bludgeon was thrown with that intent, <em>Quinby </em>ought to be acquitted. And the jury found him not guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-8\">On the last day of the term, <em>Drew </em>was brought up to receive his sentence, when his counsel moved the Court to delay giving judgment, because they had evidence that <em>Richard King, </em>who was a material witness for the government, had declared before the trial, that he would hang the prisoner by his testimony if he could, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>which declaration he had no knowledge until after the trial; and because a Mr. <em>Ingalls, </em>one of the jury, did not agree to find the prisoner guilty of murder, but only of manslaughter; and through mistake of his duty, he believed that he must assent to the verdict of the major part of the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-7\"><em>Holmes </em>and <em>Emery </em>for the prisoner <em>Drew.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-8\"><em>Mellen </em>and <em>Longfellow </em>for <em>Quinby.</em></attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b343-12\"> The reporter was favored by <em>the Chief Justice </em>with the report of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\"> It was remarked by <em>the Chief Justice </em>that there seemed no occasion for two counts in this case, as murder was charged in both, and with a similar instrument and that, on the last count, <em>the Solicitor-General </em>might have given evidence that the deceased was a deputy sheriff in the due execution of his office, to prove that the killing was malicious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">did not inquire into the truth of these allegations ; observing that if they were proved, they could not avail the prisoner .on any legal principles, by which alone the Court must be bound; and if they supported any equitable claims to favor for the prisoner, he might apply to the supreme executive, who had power [*400] to cause the sentence to be * executed, or who could pardon it absolutely, or on condition, at its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Judgment of </em>death <em>was then pronounced against the prisoner</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
