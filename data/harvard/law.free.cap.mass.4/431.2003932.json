Yet though requested, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">The defendant pleads, in bar of the action, .that at the Court of Common Pleas in this county in December- last, the plaintiff impleaded one <em>Jedidiah Morrill, </em>in a plea of debt, &amp;c., [the declaration being exactly similar to that in the present action,] and recovered judgment against the said <em>Morrill </em>for the sum of fifteen dollars and twenty-five cents debt and costs of suit, which judgment remains in full force and unreversed, and which the said <em>Morrill </em>has fully paid and satisfied; and then avers that the taking of the fish described and mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration against the said <em>Morrill, </em>is the same taking of the fish described and mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration in this action, and that the defendant was jointly concerned with the said <em>Morrill </em>in the said taking of the said fish, and not otherwise, and this he is ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-12\">The plaintiff demurs generally, and the defendant joins in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-13\"><em>Todd, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adhe\">read the fourth section of the act of 1797, <em>c. </em>70, for the preservation of the fish in the counties of <em>Cumberland </em>and <em>Lincoh, </em>which provides \u201c that if any person or persons shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>take or catch any salmon, shad, or alewives, in any of the waters within the said counties, between the 20th day of April and the 5th day of July annually ; at any other time than between sunrise on Monday and sunrise on Saturday in each week, <em>he or they </em>so offending shall forfeit and pay as a fine for each and every * salmon so taken,\u201d &amp;c. And he contended that by [*432] this section every offender was severally liable to the penalty inflicted, each person\u2019s offence being distinct, and that a recovery against one is no bar to a like recovery against another.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\"><em>Rice, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9c\">insisted that one satisfaction is all that the statute requires, and is a good bar to a recovery of a second for one joint offence, as he contended this to be; and he cited the case of <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where it was decided that when an offence created, or made penal by statute, is in its nature single, one single penalty only can be recovered, though <em>several </em>join in committing it; but if the offence is in its <em>nature several, each </em>offender is <em>separately </em>liable to the penalty. And the case put by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>under the statute for the preservation of the game, agrees precisely, in its principle, with the case at bar. The case of <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Bleasdale &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> is to the same effect.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\"><em> Comp. </em>610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>809.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b379-7\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">This action is debt <em>qui tam </em>on the fourth section of the statute of 1797, <em>c. </em>70, against the defendant for taking, in <em>Sebasticook </em>River, 7200 alewives. The defendant pleads that he is not guilty, but with one <em>Jedidiah Morrill; </em>and that the plaintiff* had formerly impleaded the said <em>Morrill </em>for the same offence, had recovered judgment, and that judgment has been satisfied. To this bar there is a demurrer and joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">As the statute imposes a penalty for every alewive taken, to be paid by the offender, we are satisfied that but one penalty can be recovered for taking the same fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Although debt <em>qui tam </em>lies to recover the penalty, yet the debt arises from a trespass which in its nature is several, as well as joint. The action may therefore be sued against one or more of the joint offenders. But the plaintiff* can have but one satisfaction. It appears from the bar, which is confessed by the demurrer, that the plaintiff* has already received from <em>Morrill </em>a satisfaction for the penalty incurred by taking the same fish mentioned in his declaration. He cannot, therefore, recover a double satisfaction by maintaining the present action against <em>Nourse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">* If several persons were fishing at the same time, each [ * 433 ] with his own net, and on his own separate account, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>would be separately liable to the penalty, each one for the fish he caught, although they might afterwards agree to throw all the fish into one stock. But that is not the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The plea in bar appears to us to be good, and the defendant must have judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
