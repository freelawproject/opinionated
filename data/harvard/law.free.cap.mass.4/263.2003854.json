B. Adams </em>for the defendant, and <em>T. Williams </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-12\">In support of the motion, <em>Adams </em>argued that the rule is, if the plaintiff' will himself discover to the Court any thing, whereby it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>may appear that he had no cause of action when he commenced his suit, his writ shall abate. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\">Thus, where the <em>teste </em>of the original was before the day of payment in the condition of the bond, on which the action was brought it was adjudged error, although after verdict. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">So in <em>assumpsit, </em>where it appeared by the declaration that the action was brought before the cause of action accrued. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> And by Lord <em>Mansfield: </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> No proof at the trial can make good a declaration which contains no ground of action on the face of it. By <em>Bidler, </em>J.: <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> After verdict, nothing is to be presumed but what is expressly stated in the declaration, and is necessarily implied from those facts which are stated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Williams</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-g\">contended that though this declaration must have been acknowledged bad on demurrer, yet that the verdict had cured it. The statute of 1782, c. 11, $ 6, requiring demurrers to declarations tobe filed before the jury is impannelled will be evaded, if advantage can be taken of such defects after verdict. The verdict shows that the facts must have taken place before that time, and this action must therefore be a good bar to another action for the same cause. The declaration alleges the request to have been made before the date of the writ, which is inconsistent with the time al- [ * 265 ] Ieged for the <em>* </em>promise ; and the Court will reject the first, in order to support a verdict.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b236-12\"> 5 <em>Gwil.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9N\">Had this objection been made on special demurrer, the declaration must have been quashed ; but the plaintiff insists that the fault, which was a mere slip of the pen, is cured by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">If we take the whole declaration together, it seems impossible that the defendant could doubt as to the specific nature of the complaint against him, or that the jury could have been misled. It is true that the promise is alleged to be made at a day to come; but the breach is alleged to be committed afterwards, on a day then past. We therefore feel a disposition to support this verdict, if it can be done without violating any correct principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">It is not easy to reconcile all the cases on this subject; but the case of <em>Sorrel </em>vs. <em>Lewin, </em>reported in 1 <em>Keb. </em>354, is in point. In that case, <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>was brought, and the <em>assumpsit </em>laid on a day not then come. Infancy was pleaded in bar, to which the plaintiff replied that it was for necessaries ; and on issue being joined, the verdict was for the plaintiff. Upon motion to arrest the judg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ment for this fault in the declaration, the court observed that there should have been a special demurrer, that it was well enough after verdict, which could not have been found for the plaintiff, but on evidence of a promise made before the action, and a duty before the promise. And the plaintiff had judgment. The principle of this case is very reasonable, and, as it is an authority in point, the plaintiff in the principal case must have judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
