In another letter, written shortly after, <em>Hill </em>mentions <em>Thun &amp;f Newman, </em>as his agents, and directs <em>Munson </em>to address the proceeds of the adventure to them on his, <em>Hill\u2019s, </em>account. Some time after, another letter from <em>Hill </em>to <em>Munson </em>directed him to ship the proceeds of the adventure, with an account of the sales of the molasses, to Mr. <em>J. F. Echar\u00e1. Munson </em>never received any other letter on the subject from <em>Thun Sp Newman, </em>but corresponded wholly with <em>Echar\u00e1 </em>and <em>Hill, </em>engaging on his part to comply with the directions of the latter as far as in his power, having always regarded him as the original owner of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">The plaintiff then produced a paper, purporting to be a letter from <em>Hill, </em>dated at <em>Phila\u00e1elphia, </em>October 4th, 1805, to the defendant <em>Newman, </em>then in <em>Boston, </em>[in which he says, * \u201c <em>Jjust write these few lines to guar\u00e1 you against any evils </em>[ * 86 J <em>that may happen from the molasses consigne\u00e1 to </em>Mr. Munson, <em>which are in my name, though actually belonging to your house,\u201d </em>and in another part of the same letter, he adds, <em>\u201cI have \u00e1one this to serve you, an\u00e1 shoul\u00e1 be sorry to have myself expose\u00e1,\u201d] </em>and inquired of <em>Munson </em>if the said letter was in the hand-writing of <em>Hill. Munson. </em>answered, that he believed it to be so, from its resemblance to the other writing of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>in his possession, but that he had never seen him write his name, nor had he ever seen the paper until it was shown him in Court, and that he knew nothing further of it or its contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">In January, 1806, <em>Hill </em>writes to <em>Munson, </em>expressing regret that the proceeds of the molasses had not been received by <em>Echar\u00e1, </em>whom he mentions as his friend, and as having made him considerable advances on account of that consignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\"><em>Munson, </em>when informed of the assignment from <em>Hill </em>to <em>Echar\u00e1, </em>which he believes to be <em>bon\u00e1 fi\u00e1e, </em>and for a good consideration, agreed to pay over the proceeds to the latter when they should be received. And he acknowledges to be now in cash, on account of them, 571 dollars 52 cents.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHQp\">And now <em>Morton, </em>of counsel for the plaintiff, contended that from the whole of the transactions disclosed, it was apparent that this adventure was, and always had been, the property of <em>Thun Sp Newman. </em>Although <em>Munson </em>considers himself to be the trustee of <em>Echar\u00e1, </em>the assignee of <em>Hill, </em>yet we have <em>Hill's </em>own confession that he is not so. And there is the same evidence of the genuine ness of the letter containing this confession, as there is to the other letters produced by the trustee, <em>viz., </em>his oath that he believes it to be written by <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\n<em>Channing, e contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9s\">The letter from <em>Hill </em>to <em>Newman, </em>in which the supposed confession is contained, was improperly introduced into the cause, and in truth, though here, it makes no part of the answer of the trustee to the interrogatories. If it were properly before the Court, yet, being collateral to the answer of the [ <em>* 87 </em>] trustee, it cannot be considered. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>*Hill </em>ought not to be permitted to show his own fraud. Though <em>Munson </em>believes that letter to be <em>Hill\u2019s, </em>yet he knows nothing as to the truth of the facts asserted or insinuated therein ; and if he is adjudged trustee of the present defendants, he is still liable to the action of <em>Echar\u00e1 </em>upon his express engagement to him ; or, if he is not, the rights of third persons are to be bound by a judgment in this action, to which they are strangers.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"Av\"> <em>Comstock </em>vs. <em>Farnum and Trustee, ante, </em>vol. ii. 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b82-6\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arl\">[After a brief statement of the answers given to the interrogatories put by the plaintiff.] The statute, on which this process is founded, confines the Court, in giving judgment, to the answers of the trustee on oath, and it has been frequently determined that no other evidence can be admitted. We have, therefore, to consider whether the contents of the exhibit, the supposed letter from <em>Hill </em>to <em>Newman, </em>are to stand as facts disclosed by the answer of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">It appears from the answer, that the trustee - claims to hold the proceeds of the molasses for the use of <em>Echar\u00e1, </em>who is not a party to this suit; and the plaintiff claims to recover them as the property of the defendants. The judgment in this cause will not be any bar to an action by <em>Echard </em>against <em>Munson. </em>The facts, therefore, disclosed by <em>Munson </em>must be of that nature that he can defend himself against <em>Echard </em>by giving them in evidence. Now, <em>Munson </em>does not know the letter to be genuine, or that the contents are true, or that the letter might not have been recently written by <em>Hill, </em>to defeat his assignment to <em>Echard. </em>All these facts must be the subject of inquiry in another suit, and may be found against <em>Munson, </em>who swears that he knows nothing about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">It is, therefore, our opinion that the exhibiting of a letter of one not a party to the suit, nor claiming the property, and authenticating its signature, without authenticating the contents of the letter, is not enough to introduce the contents of such letter as facts disclosed by ' the trustee; because <em>Hill </em>might have written the letter, and the contents may be wholly untrue ; and we cannot presume them to be true, against the claims of third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"AFk\">[ * 88 ] * Hill's letter, therefore, can have no other effect in this cause, than it would have had, if the signature had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>proved by any other person, as a witness in the cause. And laying out of the case the contents of that letter, it is clear that <em>Munson </em>has discharged himself by his answers. If we were to give a different opinion, we should charge him on the presumption of the truth of the contents of <em>Hill\u2019s </em>letter, and not on the answers of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Let <em>Munson </em>be discharged, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em> [United States </em>vs <em>Langton, </em>5 <em>Mason, </em>280. \u2014 <em>Hawes </em>vs. <em>Langton, </em>8 <em>Pick. </em>67. <em>Howell </em>vs. <em>Freeman, </em>3 <em>Mass. </em>121. \u2014 <em>Comstock </em>vs. <em>Farnum, </em>2 <em>Mass. </em>96, <em>and note.
