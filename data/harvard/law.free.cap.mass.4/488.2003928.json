The defendant, concealing his transaction with <em>Gernon, </em>applied to the plaintiffs to purchase their share, under the pretence that nothing could be obtained from the original purchase, but by immediately proceeding to Kentucky. and saving some part of the purchase money by selling the land for the most it would bring; that <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>warranty was worth nothing, as he was unable to pay any thing, and that he was intending to proceed to the south of <em>France, </em>whence he had emigrated. The plaintiffs were then lg-, norant of <em>Austin\u2019s </em>connection with the defendant, and of [ * 489 ] his concern in the contract * with <em>Gernon. </em>The information given by the defendant, and written by his agent, <em>Austin, was </em>wholly <em>false, </em>and by them known <em>to </em>be so, and was communicated by them with the intention of deceiving the plaintiffs, who, giving credit to the representations and information given them by the defendant, sold to him their interest in the purchase, secured by <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>warranty, for a sum of money much less than their proportion of the money paid by <em>Gernon, </em>to procure a release of his warranty. The said <em>Ely </em>was treated in the same manner by the defendant; and under the same impression, and with the same confidence that the defendant had given the plaintiffs, being present during the negotiation, he likewise sold his share to the defendant for the same price, and the plaintiffs and <em>Ely </em>conveyed their shares to the defendant by the same indenture. These facts were principally proved by the deposition of Mr. <em>Ely, </em>the admission of which was objected to at the trial by the defendant, and because that objection was overruled, the defendant moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">In support of this motion, it was argued that Mr. <em>Ely, </em>holding under the same deed with the plaintiffs, and having a similar action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>pending against the defendant on the same grounds, was too closely united in interest with the plaintiffs to be received as a competent witness. It was true their estates in the land were several, but the receipt of the money from the defendant was joint, as was the release to <em>Gernon. </em>If they had joined in the action, as it was insisted they might and ought to have done, they could not thus have been witnesses for each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">It was further contended that this action was not maintainable upon the evidence in the case, for that <em>Gemon\u2019s </em>warranty was a covenant real running with the land, and the plaintiffs\u2019 demand is thus within the statute of frauds, as being on a contract concerning lands, and so ought to be supported' by some written memorandum signed by the party to be charged therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">It was also said that the plaintiffs, having by their deed acknowledged full satisfaction for their release, were estopped to say that no sufficient consideration was paid, or that fraud was used in the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">*But it was more strongly insisted that the facts dis- [*490] closed no moral or even legal fraud. If the defendant was better informed of the quality of the land, and of the goodness of the title to it, and of <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>ability, than the plaintiffs were, he had a right to avail himself of such superior knowledge. He received the money from <em>Gernon </em>to procure a release to him from the several claimants under his covenant of warranty, and he had a right to make the best bargain he could with each of them. He was bound by no rule of honesty or fairness to give to the plaintiffs information which would enhance their demand, and which they were equally able and obliged to procure for themselves. A circumstance in the case absolutely protects the defendant against the imputation of fraud; he offered to sell his claim to the plaintiffs for the same sum which he offered them for theirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">Before the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made any observations on the motion, a suggestion dropped from the Court that they need not labor to show that a gross fraud had been committed, but how far the plaintiffs could be relieved in this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>Ashmun, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdEN\">observed that it had lately been much the practice to extend the benefit of this action to every case where one held money, which in equity and good conscience he was bound to pay over to another. In this case, the plaintiffs were deprived of their money by a gross fraud. Not only was there a false affirmation, but <em>Austin\u2019s </em>letter was in nature of a false token. They respected facts which were peculiarly within the defendant\u2019s knowledge, and which, on every principle of good faith, he was bound to disclose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>But, even agreeing there was no fraud in this case, yet it is contended that this money was received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiffs, whenever they should by their act and deed confirm the release to Gernon, or enable the defendant to do it for them, which their deed to the latter certainly did.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b428-6\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auo\">[After stating the facts from the evidence reported.] It appears that <em>Ely, </em>though objected to, was admitted as a witness, and that, agreeably to the direction of the judge, a verdict was found for the plaintiffs for the difference be-[*491] tween the money paid them by the defendant *for the release, and the money received by him of <em>Gernon, </em>to extinguish his warranty on the shares belonging to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The admission of <em>Ely </em>is now objected to as a sufficient cause for setting aside the verdict. <em>Ely\u2019s </em>testimony was certainly very ma terial for the plaintiffs; and if it was improperly admitted, the verdict ought to be set aside. The objection to him is founded on his connection with the plaintiffs in the same transaction; that, for the same supposed fraud, he has commenced his action; and if he can be a witness for the plaintiffs, they will be witnesses for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">An objection of this nature may very properly be made to a jury, to the credit of a witness, who will decide what weight is due to his testimony; but no objection, on account of interest, can exclude a witness, unless he be interested in the event of the suit. In this action, <em>Ely </em>had no such interest; and the verdict cannot be given in evidence for or against him, in any action in which he may be a party. And although his demand may arise out of the same transaction, this case cannot be stronger than that of an action against one underwriter on a policy of insurance, in which another underwriter on the same policy may be a witness for the defendant. We therefore think that <em>Ely </em>was a competent witness, and that the judge did right in permitting his testimony to be laid before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Several objections have been made to the verdict. It has been urged that the assignment of <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>warranty, which ran with the land, must be considered as an assignment of land, and, therefore, that the plaintiffs\u2019 demand is within the statute of frauds, and so could not be supported by paroi evidence, but only on a written memorandum made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Without controverting the position that a contract to release a covenant of warranty annexed to land, is a contract concerning some interest in land, yet, in this case, the objection cannot prevail. For the action is not brought on any agreement made by the defendant with the plaintiffs, concerning the sale of any interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>land, but for money he had in equity received from <em>Gernon </em>for their use, by reason of their having extinguished the interest they had in <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">* Another objection is, that the release to the defend- [ * 492 ] ant oy the plaintiffs being by deed, they cannot aver that it was obtained by fraud against their own deed, which expresses a sufficient and fair consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">It is generally true that a man shall not be received to aver against his own deed. But the case of fraud is always excepted, which vitiates every transaction; and a deed obtained by fraud is to be considered as a void contract as to the fraudulent party.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">But the great objection, and the one most relied on, is, that the transaction, considered in all its parts, is not in law fraudulent; that the defendant had a legal right to make his bargain for his own benefit with <em>Gernon, </em>to procure a release of his warranty, and that he might lawfully conceal it from his partners in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. Not only good morals, but the common law, requires good faith, and that every man in his contracts should act with common honesty, without overreaching his neighbor by false allegations, or fraud ulent concealments.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Let us now look at this transaction. From the evidence reported, it was competent for the jury to infer that the defendant was a partner in interest, with the plaintiffs and others, in <em>Gernon\u2019s </em>warranty ; that, <em>as a partner, </em>he proposed terms to <em>Gernon </em>to discharge his warranty; that he was to receive 8000 dollars on procuring the discharge; that he concealed this negotiation, and falsely affirmed that the warranty was worth nothing, and fraudulently produced <em>Austin\u2019s </em>letter, written for this purpose, to give credit to his affirmation ; and that the plaintiffs, imposed on in this manner, executed this release, by which the defendant was enabled to fulfil his contract with <em>Gernon, </em>by extinguishing the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">As the jury might make these inferences from the evidence, we must presume that they did make them, as they have found a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">On this view of the case, we are satisfied that the transaction be tween the parties is vitiated by fraud on the part of the defendant, and will not protect him in holding the money he received from <em>Gernon, </em>in consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 having released their interest in the warranty. Here is not * only the [ * 493 ] suppression of the truth, but also an allegation of falsehood, to deprive the plaintiffs of their interest in the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">It appears that the jury deducted, from the plaintiffs\u2019 proportion of the money paid by <em>Gernon </em>to the defendant, the, sum he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>paid the plaintiffs for their release. This deduction, we think, was right, as the effect is to give to the plaintiffs so much of the money received from <em>Gernon </em>by the defendant, as he, against equity and good conscience, detained from the plaintiffs. Upon the whole, we do not find any good reason to set aside the verdict; and judgment must be entered upon it for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b430-5\"><em>Hooker </em>and <em>J.
