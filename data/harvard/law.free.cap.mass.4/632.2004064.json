All the executors accepted the trust, and'procured \u2666he will to be proved before the Supreme Court of Probate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">After several transactions in the Supreme Court of Probate, such as returning an inventory, settling accounts, obtaining leave to sell land, &amp; c., which are not necessary to be particularly detailed, at the Court holden in April, 1801, upon an adjustment of the accounts of the executors, it appeared that there was a balance in their hands of 896 dollars and 87 cents. And thereupon the Court, after reciting that there was such a balance, and that as it appeared, from the said will, that the money legacies due from the said estate amounted to 3533 dollars 31 cents, the real estate not specifically devised, and certainly known to be his, being already sold and accounted for, it was ordered that the executors should pay to the persons named in the order the several sums affixed to their names respectively, they being all the persons mentioned in the said will who have claims for <em>money </em>legacies ; the payment being in the proportion of 25 cents for every dollar of their respective legacies. This left in [ *633 ] the hands of the executors a balance *of 13 dollars 54 cents only for future charges of administration. The legacy to the testator\u2019s widow was one mentioned in the order of Court, and the average awarded therefor was 555 dollars 55 cents. Af'er her death, and after her will, of which the plaintiff was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>executor, was proved, the executors of <em>Josiah Sawtell </em>paid to the plaintiff the average above mentioned, and it was received by him as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">Mrs. Sawtell, in her lifetime, was always ready to receive the amount of the legacy in the bonds and notes due to her husband\u2019s estate, and which were sufficient for that purpose; and she requested the executors to expose the bonds and notes in their hands, that she might make her election according to the bequest, which they neglected to do.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\">Upon these facts, the cause was argued at the last October term, at considerable length, by <em>Ward </em>for the plaintiff, and <em>Bigelow </em>for the defendant, chiefly on the question whether this legacy was a specific one. <em>Ward </em>contended that it was a specific bequest of bonds and notes to the amount mentioned, and so not subject to reduction as other legacies. <em>Bigelow </em>argued that the testator\u2019s intention was merely to point out the fund out of which this legacy was to be paid ; and he said that, in this country, a bequest of a bond to any one but the obligor himself would be futile; it would give the legatee nothing but the paper and the wax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">But whether the legacy were or were not specific, <em>Bigelow </em>insisted that the plaintiff, by receiving the average ordered by the Supreme Court of Probate, was barred of any further claim, \u201c until\u201d in the words of the order of distribution, \u201cfurther estate is discovered.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b555-8\">\n<em>Ward</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4Pq\">argued that our statute having given the party entitled to a legacy an action at the common law for its recovery, the Probate Court had no jurisdiction in the case, and the order of distribution among the legatees being merely void, the defendant might recover back the money paid under it, and thus enable himself to pay to the plaintiff the balance of the legacy bequeathed to his testatrix.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The cause stood continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, and at the succeeding March term at <em>Boston, </em>the opinion of the Court * (except <em>the Chief Justice, </em>who did not sit in the [*634] cause) was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b555-10\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">This case presents two points for consideration ; the <em>first </em>depending on the question, Was the legacy given to Mrs. <em>Sawtell </em>specific ? If it was, then the executors, on a request for that purpose, ought to have exposed the notes and bonds of their testator, that Mrs. <em>Sawtell </em>might select from them to the amount of the legacy given to her; and the plaintiff in this case must recover, unless he is concluded by a decision of the <em>second </em>point in the case, that is, by having received the average awarded upon the legacy by the order of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">But as to the nature of the legacy, whether it be general or spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>cific, it is unnecessary in this case to determine ; because we are all of opinion on the second point,\u2014that the receipt by the plaintiff\" of the average awarded by the order of the Supreme Court of Probate is conclusive against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This was an order of the Supreme Court, estimating the whole amount of the plaintiff\u2019s demand ; all the circumstances were known to him ; and he acquiesced in the decision which was made. Such an adjustment made of a demand, where there is no imposition or misrepresentation on one side, nor any mistake on the other, it is of importance should be considered as conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
