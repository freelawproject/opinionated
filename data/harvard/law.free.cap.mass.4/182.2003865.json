I contend that <em>Seraphina, </em>the feme plaintiff, has never ceased, since her title to her writ of error ac crued to her, to be within one or the. other of the disabilities de scribed in the proviso. So that the statute has never begun to run.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">In the case of <em>Strithorst </em>vs. <em>Graeme, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it is said by the court that, <em>\u201c </em>while any of the disabilities mentioned in the statute of limitations continue, the party may, but is not obliged to, commence his action: the statute doth not run while any of those disabilities continue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">It is true that in the case of <em>Duroure </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the court consider it as a rule of law not then to be disturbed, that when any of the statutes of limitations had begun to run, a subsequent disability would not stop their running. But in this case the statute had not begun to run before the subsequent disability attached. If, before coming of age, the feme plaintiff in error had become <em>non compos, </em>and so continued to the time of bringing this writ, shall the statute be construed to deprive her of her title to the writ? Shall it be said that in that case a subsequent disability shall not attach ? would not this be contrary to the humanity of the law which declares that the act of God injures no one ? Having never been free to exercise her will in the prosecution of this writ since her title to it accrued, she is neither in the words nor the equity of the statute, but is clearly within the meaning and intent of the legislature in the proviso.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-10\">\n<em>Bidwell.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGl\">There is no case that I ;an find expressly in point. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the statute is peremptory and universal, and unless a party can bring himself within the intent of the proviso, he is concluded. And to bring himself within the proviso, he * must show [ * 187 ] that the <em>same </em>cause, wnich existed at the time his title to the writ first accrued, continued to exist until within five years before the writ brought. Under the <em>English </em>statutes of limitation, if the party is within the realm at the time the judgment is rendered, although he goes out of it the next day, and continues thenceforth absent, yet it is held that the statutes attach.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">The second disability was voluntary in the feme plaintiff; she had a right to contract it, and she brought it upon herself, and has no reason to complain of its legal consequences; and this essentially differs her case from that of one becoming <em>non compos. </em>It seems hardly correct to call this a disability, since she might, during its existence, have brought her writ, as in fact she has now brought it before it has ceased. There is no ground to admit equitable considerations in the construction of this statute ; and if there were, the great good produced by its general operation will more than countervail any particular inconveniences</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-7\"><em>Bigelow, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXW\">The Attorney-General has argued upon the supposition that the statute had begun to run before the second disability attached. But I contend that the five years had not then begun, nor have they yet begun ; since she has never been at liberty to bring this writ at her own will. The law allows a minor to contract marriage; for that purpose she had a legal discretion. But '.&lt;ie iaw never considers an infant to have such discretion, as voluntarily to deprive himself of his legal rights, so as to be bound when he come to full age.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\"> 3 <em>Wils. </em>145.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b168-13\"> 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards given by</p>\n<author id=\"b169-9\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al8\"><em>Error </em>to reverse a judgment in favor of the commonwealth, vesting, by way of escheat, certain lands claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s wife, as heir to <em>Michael Martin </em>and his wife, against whom the judgment was rendered in December, 1780.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The commonwealth pleads, in bar of the writ, the statute of 1805, <em>c. </em>35, limiting the bringing of writs of error to the term of twenty years from the rendition of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The plaintiffs in error, to bring themselves within the proviso of the statute, reply that the wife\u2019s right first accrued *when she was an infant, and that the plaintiff inter- [ * 188 ] married with her during her infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">The defendants, in their rejoinder, agreeing the infancy of the plaintiff\u2019s wife at the time her title accrued, and also their intermarriage during her infancy, say that, after her title to the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>error accrued, and after she became of full age, five years had elapsed before suing out the writ in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">To this rejoinder there is a demurrer and joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In the proviso of the statute before referred to, it is declared that if any person, entitled to his writ of error, shall, at the time the title accrued, be an infant, feme covert, or <em>non com/pas mentis, </em>he may sue his writ of error after twenty years, so that it be sued within five years after the disabilities are removed, or the death of the person disabled, whichever first shall happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">It is therefore very clear that the infancy of the wife, at the time her title accrued, cannot bring her within the exception, because the writ was not sued out within five years after her coming of age. But the plaintiffs contend that, as another disability of coverture occurred before the termination of her infancy, which disability existed when her right accrued, they are within the proviso ; because there has been no moment of time, since her right accrued, in which she has not been disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As tlie plaintiffs are barred by the enacting clause, unless they are within the proviso, the effect of their replication must depend upon the construction of the proviso. And we are all satisfied that ,.e disability, to be sufficient to bring the plaintiffs within it, must oe existing at the time their right first accrued. This opinion is supported by the express words of the proviso, and we have no power, by an equitable construction, to defeat the operation of the enacting clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Statutes of limitation are beneficial statutes, made to quiet people in their possessions, and to prevent suits at law, after an unreasonable delay in commencing them. In the case of <em>Lloyd </em>vs. <em>Vaughan, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> the reversioner brought error to reverse a common recovery, after twenty years from its being [*189 ] * suffered, but within twenty years after his title accrued ; and he was barred, because he was not a person within the proviso made to relieve against the disabilities there mentioned ; and it was holden that he had no remedy, unless the reversion had fallen within twenty years after the recovery. And in <em>Prideaux </em>vs. <em>Webber, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> where the statute of limitation was pleaded to an action of assault and battery, and the plaintiff replied that the courts were shut up by a rebellion, the plea was holder, good, because the exception replied was not within the statute. Both these cases may be considered as hard cases, but hey were barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">In the present case, the husband might have sued his writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>within the twenty years. He was not under any disability, and ought to have prosecuted the rights of his wife. If we were once to admit a disability not existing when the right accrued, as within the proviso, it would be difficult to decide how far we must go. In the limitation of personal actions, the plaintiff, a female infant, may marry after her right has accrued: or an infant just before he is of age, and after the cause of action accrued, may go abroad; and, however long absent, he would prevent the effect of the statute until his return. We must, therefore, adhere to the express words, and natural and clear import, of the proviso; and the rejoinder must be holden good and sufficient in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>Let the plaintiffs take nothing by their writ.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"AG\"> Str. 1257.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"ALF\"> 1 <em>Lev </em>31</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
