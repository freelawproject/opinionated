(Certified Record (C.R.) at 1.) Barnes was originally sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 to 19 years. (C.R. at 1-2.) Barnes' maximum sentence date was January 16, 2025, and his minimum sentence date was January 16, 2015. (C.R. at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 22, 2014, the Board granted Barnes parole, on or after January 16, 2015. (C.R. at 6.) On January 16, 2015, two days before Barnes' actual release date of January 18, 2015, Barnes signed a \"conditions of parole\" form, which advised, in relevant part, as follows: \"If you are convicted of a crime committed while on parole/reparole, the Board has the authority, after an appropriate hearing, to recommit you to serve the balance of the sentence which you were serving when paroled/reparoled, with no credit for time at liberty on parole.\" (C.R. at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While on parole, Barnes was arrested by the Philadelphia Police Department on September 2, 2015. (C.R. at 21.) That same day the Board issued a warrant to commit and detain Barnes. (C.R. at 18.) On September 3, 2015, Barnes was charged with new criminal charges stemming from the September 2, 2015 arrest including, multiple counts of possession with intent to deliver controlled substances (PWID), conspiracy to commit PWID, simple possession of controlled substances, former felon not to possess a firearm, possession of a firearm with an altered serial number, and possession of instruments of a crime. (C.R. at 19, 43, 49-50.) For Barnes' new criminal charges, bail was set at $450,000 or 10% cash bail; however, Barnes did not post bail. (C.R. at 49.) On October 20, 2015, the Board issued a decision to detain Barnes pending the disposition of the new criminal charges. (C.R. at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After an April 28, 2017 hung jury mistrial, (C.R. at 62), Barnes entered a negotiated guilty plea on May 25, 2017, to one count of PWID and was sentenced to one to two years at a state correctional institution, with the sentence to \"run concurrent with any other sentence\" Barnes was serving, to be followed by three years of probation. (C.R. at 34-35.) On May 31, 2017, Barnes was physically returned to the Department of Corrections' (Department) custody, pending resolution of his status as a CPV. (Supplemental Certified Record (S.C.R.) at 7a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board provided Barnes with a notice of charges and hearing regarding the revocation of his parole for having a new criminal conviction. (C.R. at 38.) On September 27, 2017, the Board conducted a parole revocation hearing. (C.R. at 26.) On September 27, 2017, the Board voted to recommit Barnes as a CPV to serve 30 months of backtime with no credit for the time spent at liberty on parole. (C.R. at 26-33.) In its hearing report, the Board noted the presumptive range for the new conviction, as follows: \"PWID (Heroin)/F[elony]: 24-36 M[onths].\" (C.R. at 28.) The Board issued a decision on October 6, 2017, which was mailed on October 17, 2017, recommitting Barnes \"to a state correctional institution as a [CPV] to serve 30 months of backtime\" for the PWID offense. (C.R. at 87-88.) The same Board decision set Barnes' eligibility for reparole at March 26, 2020.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of his recommitment as a CPV, Barnes' maximum sentence date was recalculated to September 25, 2027. (C.R. at 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Barnes submitted an administrative remedies form to the Board on November 13, 2017, challenging the timeliness of the parole revocation hearing; the authority of the Board to recalculate and the accuracy of the recalculation of the new CPV maximum sentence; the 30-month term of backtime recommitment; the Board's failure to articulate its basis for not granting him credit for the time he spent at liberty on parole; and the lack of acknowledgement by the Board of the terms of Barnes' negotiated guilty plea, which stated that Barnes' new sentence would run concurrently with any other sentences. (C.R. at 107-112.) Thereafter, by decision dated February 20, 2018, and mailed February 23, 2018, the Board notified Barnes that he was not awarded credit for the time spent at liberty on parole because he had received a new conviction that was the same/similar to his original offense and for \"early failure, [eight] months on the street.\" (C.R. at 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 22, 2018, the Board mailed its response to Barnes' administrative appeal, affirming its decision. (C.R. at 113.) The Board explained that its parole revocation hearing had been timely because Barnes was returned to the Department's custody on May 31, 2017, and a hearing was held within 120 days on September 27, 2017. (Board Decision at 1.) The Board also explained that the 30-month backtime imposed on Barnes was within the presumptive range for a PWID-Heroin conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board determined that the decision on whether to grant or deny a CPV credit for time at liberty on parole was purely a matter of discretion and that the Board had adequately articulated a reason for denying credit,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Barnes' new conviction was similar to his original offense and he had an early failure on supervision. (Board Decision at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Board also explained its calculation of Barnes' backtime. The Board noted that when Barnes was paroled on January 18, 2015, he had a maximum sentence date of January 16, 2025, meaning he had 3,651 total days remaining on his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board explained that it awarded Barnes one day of credit for September 2, 2015, after he was detained following his new criminal charges, pursuant to the Board's warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since Barnes never posted bail for the new charges and was, therefore, not incarcerated\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   because of the Board's detainer during the period from September 3, 2015, until September 27, 2017, the Board did not award him credit for the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board also concluded that Barnes had not been eligible to commence service of his original sentence until September 27, 2017, the date when the Board voted to recommit him as a parole violator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After subtracting the one day of credit that it awarded\n   Barnes, the Board held that Barnes had 3,650 days remaining on his original sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Barnes raises the following issues: (1) whether the Board erred by not conducting a parole revocation hearing within 120 days of Barnes' new conviction; (2) whether the Board erred in not applying the presumptive range of 9 to 15 months when it recommitted Barnes to 30 months backtime as a CPV; (3) whether the Board erred in not crediting Barnes for the time when he was at liberty on parole when calculating his new maximum sentence date; (4) whether the Board erred in not awarding Barnes time served for the period between when Barnes was arrested for the new charges and his parole was revoked when calculating his new maximum sentence date; and (5) whether the Board erred by not recommitting Barnes to serve his old sentence concurrently with his new sentence, in accordance with his negotiated plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Timeliness of the Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Barnes first argues that the Board erred by not conducting his parole revocation hearing within 120 days of when he entered a plea to PWID. Barnes entered his plea on May 25, 2017, and the revocation hearing was held on September 27, 2017, which was 125 days later. Because section 71.4 of the Board's regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2071.4\">\n    37 Pa. Code \u00a7 71.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , requires that a hearing be held within 120 days of a new conviction, Barnes contends his hearing was untimely. Further, while the hearing examiner found that the Board received official verification of Barnes' sentence on May 30, 2017, and that the hearing was required to take place within 120 days of this date, Barnes maintains that said finding was made based on facts not in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"When the timeliness of a hearing is challenged, the Board bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearing was timely.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramos v.

Cmwlth. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, although Barnes argues he was entitled to a revocation hearing within 120 days of his May 25, 2017 conviction, he misapplies section 71.4 of the Board's regulations. Following his September 2, 2015 arrest and up until the date of his date of conviction, Barnes was confined to the Philadelphia County Prison, (C.R. at 43), and Barnes does not dispute the fact that he was confined to said prison during this time period. Because Barnes was confined in a county correctional institution and there is no indication that Barnes waived his right to a revocation hearing, the Board was required to conduct a revocation hearing within 120 days of receiving official verification of Barnes'\n   <em>\n    return\n   </em>\n   to a State correctional facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2071.4\">\n    37 Pa. Code \u00a7 71.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(i). Thus, Barnes is incorrect that the Board had to conduct a hearing within 120 days of his May 25, 2017 conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, Barnes does not appear to dispute that he was returned to a State correctional institution on May 31, 2017. Additionally, the Department's \"Moves Report\" indicates that Barnes was returned to a State correctional institution,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   State Correctional Institution at Graterford, on May 31, 2017. (S.C.R. at 7a.) Therefore, because Barnes' parole revocation hearing was held on September 27, 2017, which was 119 days after he returned to a State correctional institution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the hearing was timely under the Board's regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Presumptive Range for Barnes' PWID Conviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We next address whether the Board erred in not applying a presumptive range of 9 to 15 months when it recommitted Barnes to 30 months' backtime as a CPV. Barnes contends that the conviction for which he pled guilty has a maximum sentence of five years and a maximum fine of $15,000. Barnes argues that pursuant to the Board's regulations, a drug violation conviction with a maximum statutory sentence of five years or less results in a recommitment as a CPV for a period of 9 to 15 months and that, therefore, the Board erred by recommitting him to 30 months' backtime as a CPV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Upon recommitment as a CPV, the parolee must serve the remainder of the term which he would have been compelled to serve had he not been paroled ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Armbruster v.

Cmwlth. 2007). Further, pursuant to section 75.1 of the Board's regulations, the Board applies \"presumptive ranges\" to CPVs convicted of new criminal offenses while on parole, in order to determine backtime, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) Presumptive ranges of parole backtime to be served will be utilized if a parolee is convicted of a new criminal offense while on parole and the Board orders recommitment as a convicted parole violator after the appropriate revocation hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (b) The presumptive ranges of parole backtime are intended to structure the discretion of the Board while allowing for individual circumstances in terms of mitigation and aggravation to be considered in the final decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (c) The Board may deviate from the presumptive range or determine that recommitment should not occur, provided written justification is given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (d) The presumptive ranges are intended to directly relate to the severity of the crime for which the parolee has been convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (e) The severity ranking of crimes listed in \u00a7 75.2 (relating to presumptive ranges for convicted parole violations) is not intended to be exhaustive, and the most closely related crime category in terms of severity and the presumptive range will be followed if the specific crime which resulted in conviction is not contained within the listing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.1\">\n    37 Pa.

Under section 6138(a)(2.1) of the Code, the Board has \"discretion to award credit to a CPV recommitted to serve the remainder of his sentence, except when the CPV is recommitted for the reasons stated in subsection 6138(a)(2.1)(i) and(ii).\"\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323540,12278111\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/466/\">\n    159 A.3d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, because Barnes was not convicted of a crime of violence, did not commit a crime requiring sex offender registration, and was not subject to a federal removal order, the Board had discretion to deny Barnes credit for the time he spent at liberty on parole, but was required to articulate a reason for its denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the \"additional information\" section of the parole revocation hearing report, the Board wrote that \"[t]his hearing examiner does not recommend that the inmate be given credit for time spent on liberty due to the inmate's brief period of supervision.\" (C.R. at 33.) Thereafter, in its October 6, 2017 order, the Board stated that it was not awarding credit for the time Barnes \"spent at liberty on parole for the following reason: (1) brief period of supervision.\" (C.R. at 87-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Subsequently, in a January 22, 2018 memorandum, Board member Everett Gillison wrote that the Board decided not to award Barnes credit for the time he spent at liberty on parole because the \"new conviction was same/similar to the original offense.\" (C.R. at 95.) The memo further advised that the Board did not award credit to Barnes because Barnes \"was paroled on Jan. 16, 2015 (9-19 yr. sentence involving [a]ssaults, [d]rugs, [burglary] and guns\" and that the \"new case involved [d]rugs [and] guns. He pled to the drugs. Still hasn't adjusted his criminal thinking.

Our review of the record reveals that because Barnes was paroled on January 18, 2015, and arrested on September 2, 2015, he was at liberty on parole for less than eight months before being arrested for the new offenses. (C.R. at 12-14, 21.) Further, given that Barnes' initial conviction included a \"violation of probation for possession of a controlled substance,\" (C.R. at 1), the Board was correct that Barnes' subsequent PWID conviction was somewhat similar to his original conviction because both convictions involved drugs. Accordingly, based on the reasons provided in its February 20, 2018 order, we conclude that the Board provided a sufficient explanation for denying Barnes credit for the time when he was at liberty on parole and, thus, properly exercised its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Credit for Time Served Following Barnes' Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We next address whether the Board erred by not awarding Barnes credit for time served following his arrest. While Barnes' argument is difficult to understand, he appears to argue that he should have received credit on his original sentence for the period from September 2, 2015, until May 25, 2017, when he was incarcerated following his September 2, 2015 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Pursuant to section 6138(a)(4) of the Code, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(4), \"[t]he period of time for which the parole violator is required to serve shall be computed from and begin on the date that the parole violator is taken into custody to be returned to the institution as a parole violator.\" Further, under section 6138(a)(5) of the Code,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If a new sentence is imposed on the parolee, the service of the balance of the term originally imposed by a Pennsylvania court shall precede the commencement of the new term imposed in the following cases: (i) If a person is paroled from a State correctional institution and the new sentence imposed on the person is to be served in the State correctional institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   However, it is well established that the requirement that a CPV serve the balance of his original sentence is only operative once \"parole has been revoked and the remainder of the original sentence becomes due and owing.\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Barnes' guilty plea to the PWID charge stated that he would \"be confined for a minimum period of 1 Year(s) and a maximum period of 2 Year(s) at [a] State Correctional Institution,\" followed by a maximum period of three years' probation. (C.R. at 34.) The guilty plea also stated that Barnes would be given \"[c]redit for time served\" and that the sentence would commence on May 25, 2017. (C.R. at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   By the time the Board recommitted Barnes as a CPV on September 27, 2017, Barnes had already been incarcerated for a period in excess of the two-year maximum sentence he received for the PWID conviction. Although the Board stated that the period from September 3, 2015, until September 27, 2017, would apply to Barnes' new sentence, this did not take into account the fact that when Barnes was recommitted as a CPV on September 27, 2017, he had been confined for 24 days longer than the two-year maximum sentence for his PWID conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board erred to the extent it did not credit Barnes' original sentence with the 24-day period of time that he was detained, prior to having his parole revoked, which exceeded his two-year maximum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   hold that a parolee is not eligible to begin serving backtime on his original sentence until his parole is revoked, this rule must give way to the \"just and equitable\" consideration that \"all time spent in confinement must be credited to either the new sentence or the original sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9290632,16674\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/840/299/\">\n    840 A.2d at 308-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Barnes was only sentenced to a two-year maximum sentence for his PWID conviction, if the Board's order were to remain unchanged then Barnes would receive\n   <strong>\n    no credit\n   </strong>\n   for the period from September 3, 2017, until September 27, 2017, that exceeded his maximum sentence. However, as we made clear in\n   <em>\n    Armbruster\n   </em>\n   , where a parole violator is detained \"on both the Board's warrant and the new criminal charges and it is not possible to award all of the credit on the new sentence\" because the incarceration period \"\n   <strong>\n    exceeds\n   </strong>\n   the maximum term of the new sentence, the credit must be applied to the offender's original sentence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326104\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/348/#p351\">\n    919 A.2d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 4 (same). Here, Barnes remained detained on both the Board's detainer and his new charges from September 3, 2015, until September 27, 2017, but effectively did not receive any credit for the 24-day period that he was detained that exceeded the two-year maximum sentence for his new conviction. Thus, because Barnes is entitled to receive credit for this 24-day period, the Board's decision is reversed to the extent that it did not credit Barnes' original sentence with said period when calculating his new maximum date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Board Did Not Permit Barnes to Serve his New Sentence Concurrently with his Original Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, Barnes argues that the Board erred by not permitting him to serve his new sentence concurrently with his original sentence. Barnes' guilty plea to the PWID conviction states that \"the sentence is to run concurrent with any other sentence defendant is serving.\" (C.R. at 34.) Barnes argues that the guilty plea amounted to a contract between him and the Commonwealth and that he is entitled to the benefit of the bargain he negotiated. Accordingly, Barnes argues that he should be able to serve the new sentence concurrently with the original sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This same issue was addressed by this Court in our\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Kerak v.

Because section 6138(a)(5) mandates that new sentences be served consecutive to serving backtime on original sentences, we held that the Board did not err in not permitting the CPV to serve his new sentence concurrently with his original sentence, despite the sentencing court's order to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320559\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/1134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320559\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/1134/\">\n    at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
