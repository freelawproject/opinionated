Delaney, denying the plaintiff's motion to preclude the defendant, R. W. Thompson Co., Inc., from contesting\n   the extent of the plaintiff's injury. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly (1) found there was no error when the commissioner rejected an alleged stipulation that the case be decided on the original record and (2) affirmed the denial of the plaintiff's motion to preclude despite the defendant's failure to file a form 43. We affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On March 16, 2010, during the course of his employment with the defendant, the plaintiff sustained compensable injuries when the deck of a road paving machine fell on him. He began to receive workers' compensation benefits on March 23, 2010. Although the plaintiff timely filed a form 30C\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming benefits on October 25, 2010, he refiled a form 30C on February 10, 2011, because he lost the return receipts from the postal service related to his first filing. The defendant did not contest the plaintiff's claim by filing a form 43\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and began paying the plaintiff weekly indemnity payments in the amount of $328.58 from March 23, 2010, until November 8, 2011. On October 17, 2011, the defendant, however, sought to discontinue the benefits it was paying the plaintiff by filing a form 36,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that the plaintiff was able\n   to return to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The form 36 was approved without objection on November 2, 2011. Consequently, the plaintiff received no more compensation benefit payments after November 8, 2011. On February 29, 2012, the plaintiff filed a motion to preclude the defendant from denying him further compensation benefits. Commissioner Clifton Thompson conducted a formal hearing on April 18, 2012. After the hearing, but before the parties submitted posttrial briefs, Commissioner Thompson died, and the case was assigned to Commissioner Delaney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the Workers' Compensation Commission (commission) contacted the parties regarding the former commissioner's death, the parties were told that they could have a hearing de novo or request\n   the commission to assign a substitute commissioner to decide the case on the basis of a review of the transcript, exhibits, and as of yet unfiled briefs. The plaintiff objected to a trial de novo in a letter dated May 24, 2012, and stated that a decision should be rendered upon review of the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, in a letter dated May 24, 2012, stated that it \"[had] no objection to [the] matter [being] reassigned to a new commissioner for a finding on the\n   papers based on the April 18, 2012 formal hearing transcript and the briefs submitted by the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 31, 2012, the commissioner scheduled a formal hearing to open the record for articulation of the parties' positions and arguments. On September 7, 2012, the plaintiff filed an objection to the commissioner's order to open the formal hearing. At a formal hearing on October 1, 2012, the commissioner heard the plaintiff's objection, and ruled that he had the authority to open the record and was recalling the plaintiff for further questioning. The plaintiff thereafter filed an appeal to the board on October 19, 2012, challenging the right of the commissioner to open the record and take further evidence. The board issued a decision on January 16, 2014, concluding that the matter was not ripe for review. On May 15, 2014, the commissioner held a formal hearing. On July 11, 2014, he issued his decision denying the plaintiff's motion to preclude. The plaintiff appealed to the board, arguing that the commissioner improperly opened the record in contravention of the parties' stipulation and denied his motion to preclude. On July 29, 2015, the board found that there was no stipulation between the parties, and even if there was a stipulation, the commissioner had the authority to open the record. The board affirmed his denial of the motion to preclude. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review. \"It is well established that [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers' compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the board]....

Specifically, he argues that he and the defendant stipulated that the case would be decided on the record before the former commissioner, and that the commissioner improperly ignored that stipulation and conducted a hearing de novo. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an initial matter, we reject the plaintiff's characterization that the commissioner's opening of the record was a hearing de novo. After the matter was assigned to him, the commissioner reviewed the record and concluded that there was not enough evidence for him to make a decision. He stated that the record consisted of \"a very short transcript [of the April 18, 2012 formal hearing], very short direct and [cross-examination] of the [plaintiff], and [that he had] a lot of questions [for]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   the [plaintiff].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result,\n   he opened the record in order to question the plaintiff. At the hearing on May 15, 2014, the commissioner questioned the plaintiff solely about the payments he received. The plaintiff was unable to answer the commissioner's questions, even when shown his testimony from the October 1, 2012 hearing. The commissioner then asked counsel whether they could provide the information he requested concerning what payments the plaintiff received. Surprisingly, the plaintiff's counsel did not respond. The defendant's counsel offered a history of the benefits the defendant had paid the plaintiff. The commissioner accepted the history into evidence, which indicated that the plaintiff received weekly payments in the amount of $328.58, for a total of $28,257.88, as well as payment of medical bills totaling $66,996.09, for an overall total of $95,253.97.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We also reject the plaintiff's characterization of the May 24, 2012 letters the parties sent separately to the commission as a stipulation. \"[A stipulation] may be defined as a contract of the parties acknowledged in open court and ordered to be recorded by a court of\n   competent jurisdiction.... [It is] the result of a contract and its embodiment in a form which places it and the matters covered by it beyond further controversy....

[N]either of these documents rises to a level of a 'stipulation,' and the evidentiary record contains no other document which even remotely resembles\n   a stipulation.\" The board also concluded that even if there had been a stipulation, the commissioner would not have been bound by its terms in light of the powers entrusted to him by statute.\n   Upon review of the evidence, we conclude that the board did not clearly err in finding that the May 24, 2012 letters did not constitute a contract between the parties that could be considered a stipulation. There was no firm understanding between the parties nor a quid pro quo, just a statement by the parties of their respective positions at that time. We also agree with the board that, even if a stipulation existed between the parties, such a stipulation would not prohibit the commissioner from opening the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[U]pon the death, disability or resignation of a judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... during the pendency of a trial or hearing to the court, a successor judge should take the following steps pursuant to the authority granted by [General Statutes] \u00a7 51-183f : (1) become familiar with the entire existing record, including, but not necessarily limited to, transcripts of all testimony and all documentary evidence previously admitted; (2) determine, on the basis of such record and any further proceedings as the court deems necessary, whether the matter may be completed without prejudice to the parties; (3) if the court finds that the matter may not be completed without prejudice to the parties it should declare a mistrial, but if the court finds that the matter may be completed without prejudice to the parties then; (4) upon request of any party, or\n   <em>\n    upon the court's own request, recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify without due burden\n   </em>\n   ; (5) take any other steps reasonably necessary to complete the proceedings; and (6) render a decision based on the successor judge's own findings of fact and conclusions of law.\" (Emphasis added; footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"718738\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/29/378/#p386\">\n    29 Conn.

Finally, the fifth sentence sets forth the consequences to an employer who neither timely pays nor timely contests liability: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, an employer who fails to contest liability for an alleged injury or death on or before the twenty-eighth day after receiving a written notice of claim and who fails to commence payment for the alleged injury or death on or before such twenty-eighth day, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of the alleged injury or death.\" ' \" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dubrosky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boehringer Ingelheim Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415519\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/261/#p269\">\n    145 Conn.
