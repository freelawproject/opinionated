After the plaintiff was injured while working for the city, he filed a claim, pursuant to the act, seeking compensation based on the earnings that he received from both the city and Intervale. The city accepted the compensability of the injury and paid its indemnity obligations to the plaintiff but, pursuant to \u00a7 31-310, transferred the concurrent compensation obligation to the fund. The fund denied the claim for benefits on the ground that the plaintiff was not Intervale's employee. The plaintiff sought review of this ruling by the Workers' Compensation Commission (commission). After a hearing, the Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Seventh District (commissioner) determined that the plaintiff was not an employee of Intervale for purposes of the act and, therefore, did not qualify for compensation benefits based on his allegedly concurrent employment. The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the Compensation Review Board (board), which affirmed that decision. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the plaintiff qualifies as Intervale's employee for purposes of the act and, therefore, is eligible for concurrent employment benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-310. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that were found by the commissioner or that are undisputed. In 2000, the plaintiff formed Intervale, a limited liability company of which he is the sole member. Intervale provided various video production services to corporations. Intervale occasionally hired\n   independent contractors, but the plaintiff was otherwise solely responsible for completing the company's projects, which included field production work. He reported to no one other than Intervale's clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Intervale did not pay the plaintiff a fixed salary. Rather, when Intervale received a payment from a customer, the plaintiff would deposit the payment in Intervale's bank account and then withdraw funds as needed. In 2012 and 2013, the plaintiff reported his income from Intervale for\n   federal tax purposes on schedule C of Internal Revenue Service Form 1040, which is the form used to report \"Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, a shopping mall in Massachusetts hired Intervale to shoot a video at the mall. As a condition of the engagement, the mall required Intervale to obtain workers' compensation insurance. The premium for the policy that Intervale purchased was based on an estimated annual employee remuneration of $ 12,750, which was the figure that the insurance company recommended for small businesses with an undetermined payroll. The plaintiff's gross earnings from Intervale were $ 43,600 in 2012 and $ 97,496 in 2013. Thereafter, Intervale purchased a workers' compensation insurance policy for the period from April 4, 2013, to April 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, in addition to his work in connection with Intervale, the plaintiff worked part-time for the city as a park police officer. On July 28, 2013, the plaintiff injured his back and legs during the course of his employment with the city. Thereafter, he filed a claim for compensation under the act based on both his earnings from the city and his earnings from Intervale. The city paid its indemnity obligation to the plaintiff and transferred the claim for compensation to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-310 based on the plaintiff's allegedly concurrent employment with Intervale. The fund denied\n   the plaintiff's claim for concurrent employment benefits on the grounds that (1) there was no employer-employee relationship between the plaintiff and Intervale, and (2) members of single-member limited liability companies are presumptively excluded from the act pursuant to a memorandum issued by the chairman of the commission in 2003. See John A. Mastropietro, Chairman, Workers' Compensation Commission, State of Connecticut, Memorandum No. 2003-02, \"WCC Limited Liability Companies &amp; Revised Forms Memorandum-April 17, 2003\" (2003 memorandum), available at https://wcc.state.ct.us/memos/2003/2003-02.htm (last visited March 26, 2019). The 2003 memorandum provides in relevant part: \"After carefully considering this matter, we have determined that members of [limited liability companies (LLCs) ] that contain only one member (single-member LLCs) should be presumed to be\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   from the [a]ct unless they have elected to be covered, [whereas] members of multiple-member LLCs should be presumed to be\n   <em>\n    covered\n   </em>\n   under the [a]ct unless they have elected to be excluded. In order to clarify this policy, we have amended our Form 6B and ... Form 75\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   accordingly, and direct all members of LLCs to use such forms in the future.\" (Emphasis in original.) The 2003 memorandum thus analogized single-member limited liability companies to sole proprietors, who are excluded from the provisions of the act pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   unless they elect to\n   accept its provisions, and analogized members of multiple-member limited liability companies to the partners of a partnership, who, under the same statute, are deemed to have accepted the provisions of the act with respect to themselves unless they elect to be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter sought the commission's review of the fund's denial of his claim for concurrent employment benefits. In his proposed finding and award, the plaintiff contended that there was \"no serious dispute that [he was] an employee of [Intervale]\" and that the rule promulgated by the 2003 memorandum, namely, that the member of a single-member limited liability company is presumed not to be an employee of the company, is inconsistent with the definition of \"employer\" set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (10), which includes limited liability companies. In its proposed finding and dismissal, the fund contended that, because the plaintiff was the sole member of Intervale, he was a sole proprietor. Accordingly, the fund argued, under both the provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) requiring sole proprietorships to elect to accept the provisions of the act and the 2003 memorandum, the plaintiff was required to elect coverage by filing a Form 75 before he would be entitled to compensation based on his work for Intervale. The fund also summarily stated that \"[t]here is no employer-employee relationship between the [plaintiff] and [Intervale].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiff was not an employee\n   of Intervale because he controlled \"the means and method[s] of the services [that] he performed on behalf of [Intervale],\" he lacked a fixed salary, he reported to no one, he treated Intervale as a sole proprietorship for tax purposes, and it was \"questionable ... whether the [plaintiff] intended to cover himself as an employee when [Intervale] procured [workers' compensation coverage] ....\" The commissioner also observed that Intervale had not elected to accept the provisions of the act pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (10) by filing a Form 75 with the commission, as required by the 2003 memorandum. The commissioner concluded, however, that, irrespective of whether Intervale had filed Form 75, he was not Intervale's employee and, therefore, was not entitled to concurrent employment benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff then appealed from the commissioner's decision to the board. In his brief to the board, the plaintiff asserted that, because the definition of \"employer\" set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (10) expressly includes limited liability companies, the commission chairman had no authority to require single-member limited liability companies to elect to accept the provisions of the act pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (10) before the single member would be covered, as the chairman had done in the 2003 memorandum. The fund maintained in its brief to the board that the commissioner had correctly determined that, because the plaintiff controlled the means and methods of the services that he performed for Intervale, had no fixed salary but, rather, withdrew money from Intervale's bank account as needed, and reported his earnings\n   from Intervale as earnings from self-employment, the plaintiff was not Intervale's employee. The fund also claimed that the commissioner correctly had determined that, because the plaintiff's gross earnings from Intervale were far in excess of the $ 12,750 reflected in the workers' compensation insurance policy that the plaintiff had purchased, it was doubtful that\n   he intended to be covered by the policy. Finally, the fund argued that, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the 2003 memorandum did not require single-member limited liability companies to elect to accept the provisions of the act before their members would be covered but, instead, merely created a rebuttable presumption that such members are not covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The board concluded that, regardless of whether Intervale elected to accept the provisions of the act by filing Form 75, as provided by the 2003 memorandum, and regardless of whether the commission chairman correctly determined that such an election is required, the plaintiff could not prevail because the commissioner had found as a factual matter that he was not Intervale's employee, and this factual finding was supported by the evidence. Specifically, the board concluded that, because the plaintiff was not paid on the basis of the number of hours he worked for Intervale but \"compensated himself for his activities ... solely as a business owner obtaining profits from the firm,\" the plaintiff had commingled his personal activities with the company's activities. Thus, the board concluded, \"Intervale was the alter ego of the [plaintiff] and did not maintain the appropriate corporate formalities to establish an employer-employee relationship with its principal.\" In addition, the board explained that the fact that the plaintiff did not receive a W-2 federal income tax form from Intervale, which is the Internal Revenue Service form for reporting wages but, instead, reported his income from Intervale as a self-employed individual, supported the determination that he was self-employed. On the basis of these considerations, the board affirmed the commissioner's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff then filed this appeal. The plaintiff claims that, because the underlying facts are undisputed, the board should have applied plenary review to the commissioner's decision that he was not Intervale's\n   employee instead of deferring to the commissioner's factual finding on that issue. The plaintiff also contends that, under the plain language of \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which defines \"employee\" for purposes of the act, he was Intervale's employee and, therefore, was eligible for concurrent employment benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-310. Accordingly, the plaintiff contends, the commission chairman had no authority to alter the statutory provisions of the act by promulgating the rule set forth in the 2003 memorandum, which was premised on the assumption that the members of single-member limited liability companies are not employees of those companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The fund responds that, under the act, there is no meaningful distinction between a sole proprietor and a member of a single-member limited liability company, and, therefore, the presumption created by the 2003 memorandum that such members are not employees-which presumption the fund contends is rebuttable-is consistent with the provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) requiring\n   sole proprietors to elect to accept the provisions of the act before they are covered. The fund further maintains that the commissioner's finding that the plaintiff was not Intervale's employee pursuant to the traditional \"right to control\" test is supported by the record. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yale University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546891\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/641/#p680\">\n    252 Conn. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680-81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=748%20A.2d%20834\">\n    748 A.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (\"[t]he right to control test determines the [relationship between a worker and a putative employer] by asking whether the putative employer has the right to control the means and methods used by the worker in the performance of his or her job\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   Before addressing the merits of these claims, we pause to clarify what is and what is not at issue in this appeal. As we indicated, in its brief to the board, the fund argued that, for a variety of reasons, the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   was not an\n   <em>\n    employee\n   </em>\n   of Intervale. The fund did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   make the very different claim that\n   <em>\n    Intervale\n   </em>\n   has effectively been converted into a\n   <em>\n    sole proprietorship\n   </em>\n   because the plaintiff failed to observe the rules governing limited liability companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the board's affirmance of the commissioner's decision was based on its determination that, because Intervale distributed its profits to the plaintiff instead of paying him\n   an hourly rate, it \"did not maintain the appropriate corporate formalities.\" Accordingly, the board concluded, Intervale was the plaintiff's \"alter ego,\" and, therefore, its status as a limited liability company must be disregarded. The board cited no persuasive authority, however, for the proposition that it is somehow improper for a single-member limited liability company to distribute profits to the member rather than paying the member wages or, relatedly, that it is improper for the member to report earnings from the company as self-employment earnings rather than wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the\n   governing law appears to be to the contrary. See, e.g., General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 34-152 (\"[t]he\n   profits and losses of a limited liability company shall be allocated among the members, and among classes of members, in the manner agreed to in the operating agreement\"); General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 34-158 (\"distributions of cash or other assets of a limited liability company shall be allocated among the members ... in the manner provided in the operating agreement\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Riether\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306277\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/1140/#p1159\">\n    919 F.Supp.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159 (D.N.M. 2012) (when business entity with single owner does not elect corporate style taxation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.7701-3\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [a], earnings of owner are subject to taxation as self-employment earnings);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20301.7701-3\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2013) (business entity that is not classified as corporation and that has single owner can elect either to be classified as association or to be disregarded as entity separate from its owner for federal tax purposes); General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 34-113 (for purposes of state tax law, limited liability company is treated in accordance with classification for federal tax purposes). Because the fund has never made any claim that Intervale's corporate status as a limited liability company must be disregarded due to the method by which the plaintiff was paid, and because the board's conclusion to that effect is not supported by any authority, we cannot accept the board's rationale for affirming the decision of the commissioner. For present purposes, therefore, we treat Intervale as a properly constituted limited liability company that operated as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, the first issue that we must address is whether a single-member limited liability company must elect to accept the provisions of the act before the member is covered, as the commission chairman determined in the 2003 memorandum, or, instead, the member may be covered automatically as an employee of the company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, if we agree with the plaintiff that the member of a single-member limited liability company may be the company's employee, we also must determine whether the plaintiff was an employee of Intervale for purposes of the act. We conclude that a single-member limited liability company is not required to elect to accept the provisions of the act in order for its member to be covered; rather, the member may be covered automatically as an employee. We further conclude that an employer-employee relationship existed between Intervale and the plaintiff because the plaintiff provided services to Intervale and was subject to the hazards of Intervale's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers' compensation appeals.

We begin our analysis of this claim with the language of the applicable\n   statutory provisions. Section 31-275 (9) (A) defines \"employee\" in relevant part as any person who \"(i) [h]as entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether\n   the contract contemplated the performance of duties within or without the state,\" or \"(ii) [i]s a sole proprietor or business partner who accepts the provisions of [the act] in accordance with subdivision (10) of this section ....\" Section 31-275 (10) defines an \"employer\" as \"any person, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, voluntary association, joint stock association, the state and any public corporation within the state using the services of one or more employees for pay, or the legal representative of any such employer ....\" Section 31-275 (10) also provides in relevant part that \"[a] person who is the sole proprietor of a business may accept the provisions of [the act] by notifying the commissioner, in writing, of his intent to do so. If such person accepts the provisions of [the act] he shall be considered to be an employer and shall insure his full liability in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 31-284. Such person may withdraw his acceptance by giving notice of his withdrawal, in writing, to the commissioner. Any person who is a partner in a business shall be deemed to have accepted the provisions of [the act] and shall insure his full liability in accordance with subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of section 31-284, unless the partnership elects to be excluded from the provisions of [the act] by notice, in writing and by signed agreement of each partner, to the commissioner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff contends that, because the first sentence of \u00a7 31-275 (10) includes limited liability companies in the definition of \"employer,\" and because the election provision of subdivision (10) applies exclusively to sole proprietors, the legislature clearly did not intend that the election provision would apply to single-member limited liability companies. Consequently, he contends, the commission chairman lacked the authority to promulgate the rule set forth in the 2003 memorandum requiring single-member limited liability companies to\n   elect coverage for their members. The plaintiff further maintains that, because there is no presumption that single-member limited liability companies are not the employers of their members, to qualify as Intervale's employee for purposes of the act, he was required to satisfy only the statutory definition of \"employee\" set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The fund does not seriously dispute the plaintiff's claim that the election provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) does not, by its terms, apply to single-member limited liability companies. Nor does the fund claim that, if we agree with it that single-member limited liability companies are not employers of their members, the commission chairman had the authority to promulgate the rule set forth in the 2003 memorandum requiring single-member limited liability companies to elect to accept the provisions of the act in order to obtain coverage for their members in the absence of any statutory basis for that rule. The fund does contend, however, that the presumption that underlies the rule contained in the 2003 memorandum-that single-member limited liability companies are not the employers of their members-is correct, because single-member limited liability companies are not meaningfully distinguishable from sole proprietorships in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We agree with the plaintiff that nothing in \u00a7 31-275 (10) requires single-member limited liability companies to elect to accept the provisions of the act before their members are covered, and, therefore, the commission chairman had no authority to adopt that rule. Indeed, as we indicated, the fund does not seriously contend otherwise. For the reasons that follow, we further conclude that the legislature's choice not to include single-member limited liability companies in the election provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) indicates that the legislature intended that single-member limited liability companies may be employers of their members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature adopted the provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) allowing sole proprietors to elect to adopt the provisions of the act because it otherwise might appear that, in the absence of such a provision, a sole proprietorship would not be considered the employer of the sole proprietor under \u00a7 31-275 (10), even though that provision defines \"employer\" to include \"any person ....\" In turn, it is\n   reasonable to believe that the legislature maintained this view because a sole proprietor and a sole proprietorship are, for all intents and purposes, one and the same entity, and it would be anomalous to conclude that an individual can work under a contract of service with himself.

Specifically, the decision to treat single-member limited liability companies as distinct entities from their members for purposes of the act\n   means that a single-member limited liability company will be statutorily required to obtain coverage for its member even if the member would prefer not to be covered.

We have already rejected this conclusion because the fund made no such claim and the board cited no authority to support it. The board did not address the commissioner's finding that the plaintiff was not Intervale's employee in view of the fact that the plaintiff controlled the means and methods of his own work, which is the fund's position on appeal. Nevertheless, because we are in as good a position as the board to review the commissioner's factual finding concerning this issue, and because neither party objects to our review of the issue, which has been fully briefed, we may address it.

The fund, however, does not appear to claim-at least not expressly-that electing this method of reporting earnings for federal tax purposes somehow prevents Intervale from claiming the status of a limited liability company for any state law purpose. To the extent that the fund implicitly makes this claim, we reject it.

In\n    <em>\n     Diaz\n    </em>\n    , the principal of a limited liability company apparently paid an employee with personal checks, and the employee, in turn, paid himself and three other employees, including the claimant, in cash. In addition, the principal's \"personal expenses and bills were paid from the [limited liability company's] checking account ....\"\n    <em>\n     Diaz\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Capital Improvements &amp; Management, LLC\n    </em>\n    , supra. The board concluded that, because the principal had \"commingled firm assets for personal use and failed to maintain corporate formalities,\" he was personally liable for the benefits owed to the claimant. Id. In\n    <em>\n     Caus\n    </em>\n    , the employer, Paul Hug, operated a number of businesses, one of which was apparently a sole proprietorship and others of which were limited liability companies, and failed to establish which of the businesses had employed the claimant. See\n    <em>\n     Caus\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hug\n    </em>\n    , supra. The board concluded that the commissioner reasonably could have concluded that Hug had \"commingled the activities of his various businesses and that each firm acted as an alter ego of ... Hug personally.\" Id. In\n    <em>\n     Dupree\n    </em>\n    , the respondent did not withhold social security or federal income tax from the claimant's wages; rather, the claimant paid his own income taxes and social security taxes at self-employment rates.

Thus, none of these cases directly supports the proposition that, if a single-member limited liability company distributes profits to the member or if the member reports earnings from the company in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, the company must be treated as the member's alter ego.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We recognize that neither the commissioner nor the board addressed this issue because each of them determined that, even if Intervale was not required to elect to accept the provisions of the act in order for the plaintiff to be covered, the plaintiff did not meet the definition of \"employee\" for purposes of the act. Because the question of whether Intervale was required to elect to accept the provisions of the act before the plaintiff could be covered is inextricably intertwined with the question of whether the plaintiff was Intervale's employee, however, and, because the question presents a pure question of law and has been fully briefed by both parties, we are free to address it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The fund also contends that the presumption underlying the 2003 memorandum is rebuttable. Nothing in the 2003 memorandum suggests, however, that, when a single-member limited liability company does not elect to accept the provisions of the act, the member nevertheless may be covered if the member presents evidence that he or she was an employee of the company. To the contrary, the 2003 memorandum provides that \"members of [limited liability companies (LLCs) ] that contain only one member (single-member LLCs) should be presumed to be\n    <em>\n     excluded\n    </em>\n    from the [a]ct unless they have elected to be covered\"; (emphasis in original); and Form 75, which implements the 2003 memorandum, expressly provides that \"[t]he [s]ole [p]roprietor or [s]ingle-[m]ember [limited liability company] is NOT covered by the [act],\n    <em>\n     unless coverage is elected through the use of this form\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, if the 2003 memorandum merely created a presumption that may be rebutted by evidence that the member satisfied the definition of \"employee\" set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i), the 2003 memorandum effectively would be superfluous, inasmuch as the burden of proof is always on a claimant to prove that he or she was an employee. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Gamez-Reyes\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Biagi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778873\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/258/#p270\">\n     136 Conn.

Finally, it is unclear what evidence, in the fund's view, would be sufficient to rebut the presumption created by the 2003 memorandum. The fund contends that, because the plaintiff necessarily controlled Intervale, Intervale had no right to control him and, therefore, that he cannot be Intervale's employee. That invariably will be the case, however, with single-member limited liability companies. It is therefore apparent that the 2003 memorandum sets forth a conclusive presumption that single-member limited liability companies are not employers of their members, and that that presumption cannot be rebutted by additional evidence.

In other words, the 2003 memorandum sets forth a substantive rule of law.

See 6 L. Larson &amp; T. Robinson, supra, \u00a7 76.05 [2], p. 76-13. The authors assert that, for purposes of workers' compensation law, a partnership generally \"is not ... an entity separate from its members,\" and, therefore, the members are not employees of the partnership. (Footnote omitted.) Id. As we noted, however, under the act, partners are deemed to be covered unless the partnership elects to opt out. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In other words, the election provision of \u00a7 31-275 (10) does not\n    <em>\n     create a presumption\n    </em>\n    that sole proprietors are not covered by the act. If sole proprietors would have been eligible for coverage in the absence of the election provision, the legislature presumably would have provided that they could opt\n    <em>\n     out\n    </em>\n    of coverage if it wished to provide them with that choice. Rather, the election provision appears to reflect the fact that, as a matter of substantive law, sole proprietors are not employees of their sole proprietorships and, therefore, would be ineligible for coverage in the absence of a provision allowing them to opt in.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The plaintiff contends, to the contrary, that the board held in\n    <em>\n     Verrinder\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Matthew's Tru Colors Painting &amp; Restoration\n    </em>\n    , No. 4936, CRB 4-05-4 (December 6, 2006), that an individual can be his own employer and employee. In that case, however, the board merely recognized that, when a sole proprietor has elected to accept the provisions of the act pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (10), the sole proprietorship is\n    <em>\n     treated as\n    </em>\n    the sole proprietor's employer and, pursuant to \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (ii), the sole proprietor is\n    <em>\n     treated\n    </em>\n    as an employee under the act. See id. (\"[T]he situation [in which] a self-employed individual in the compensation system is acting as both employee and employer is unlikely to result in an adversarial investigation of the claim. However, [in \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (ii) and (10) ] the General Assembly specifically permitted sole proprietors to be defined as 'employers' and to have the concurrent status of both 'employers' and 'employees' ....\" [Citations omitted.] ). The case did not hold that, even in the absence of these statutory provisions, one individual could be treated as both an employer and an employee with respect to himself.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    As the fund observes, there is authority for the proposition that a person who works for a business entity that he or she owns or controls is not the entity's employee. See Restatement, supra, \u00a7 1.03, comment (a) p. 32 (\"[a]n individual who renders services to an enterprise that the individual controls through ownership is not as a general matter treated as an employee of that enterprise for purposes of the laws providing protections or benefits to or imposing obligations on employees\"); id., comment (b), p. 33 (\"[O]wners of a [limited liability] company that have entrepreneurial control over their own remuneration and activities on the company's behalf are not employees of the company,\" and, \"[i]n partnerships, too, each partner [who] exercises control approximating that of a sole proprietor over his or her remuneration and activities within the partnership is a controlling owner excluded from employee status\"). These provisions, however, are not specific to workers' compensation law. The fact that owners of a business entity are not its employees for some purposes, such as determining the owner's tax liability, does not necessarily mean that they are not employees for purposes of the act. We note, for example, that, whereas the Restatement of Employment Law provides that partners do not have employment status, \u00a7 31-275 (10) reflects a conclusive presumption that partners\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n    employees of the partnership unless the partnership elects to be excluded from the provisions of the act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    We recognize that, when the commission chairman drafted the 2003 memorandum, he attempted to mitigate this policy concern by providing that single-member limited liability companies could elect to accept the provisions of the act if the member wanted to be covered. As the fund essentially concedes on appeal, however, if such members were not employees under the act, and the legislature chose not to allow them to elect to accept the provisions of the act, neither the commission chairman nor this court would have the authority to mitigate that arguably harsh result by effectively changing the plain terms of the act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As we discuss more fully hereinafter, a corporate officer who provides no services to the corporation, and is not subject to the hazards of the corporation's business, is not the corporation's employee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Presumably, this provision would allow any independent contractor to elect to accept the provisions of the act.
