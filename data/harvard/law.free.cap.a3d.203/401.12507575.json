In this decision, the Board revoked, or at least failed to honor, sentencing credit that Penjuke received for days he spent in good standing at liberty on parole, also known as \"street time,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during a prior period of parole that resulted in his recommitment as a technical parole violator (TPV).

In connection with three separate criminal incidents occurring in 2012, Penjuke pleaded guilty to two charges of driving under the influence and was convicted of simple assault. A trial court sentenced Penjuke to an aggregate term of imprisonment of one year and nine months to nine years, and his minimum and maximum sentence dates were March 28, 2013, and June 28, 2020, respectively. Penjuke is incarcerated at the State Correctional\n   Institution at Coal Township. (Certified Record (C.R.) at 1, 24-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By decision recorded April 20, 2013, the Board granted Penjuke parole. Prior to his release, Penjuke signed conditions governing his parole advising that, \"[i]f you are convicted of a crime committed while on parole/reparole, the Board has the authority, after an appropriate hearing, to recommit you to serve the balance of the sentence or sentences which you were serving when paroled/reparoled, with no credit for time at liberty on parole.\" (C.R. at 32.) On June 26, 2013, Penjuke was released, and he spent 793 days (or approximately 2 years and 3 months) on parole in good standing, until August 28, 2015, when the Board declared him delinquent. Thereafter, Penjuke waived his rights to a revocation hearing and the assistance of counsel, and admitted that he violated the conditions of his parole for changing his residence without permission and failing to maintain regular contact with parole supervisors. On March 28, 2016, the Board recommitted Penjuke as a TPV and extended his maximum sentence date from June 28, 2020, to December 12, 2021, to account for 167 days that he spent in delinquency. Consistent with the applicable statutory provision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Board did not add the 793 days that Penjuke spent in good standing to his maximum sentence date. (C.R. at 42, 47-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 20, 2016, the Board reparoled Penjuke, and he again signed conditions governing his parole including the advisement concerning credit for street time mentioned above. On July 20, 2016, the Board released Penjuke. Shortly thereafter, on July 28, 2016, the police arrested Penjuke and he was charged with simple possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, loitering and prowling at night, public drunkenness, and disorderly conduct. On February 6, 2017, Penjuke pleaded guilty to simple possession, and a trial court sentenced him to one year of probation on February 28, 2017. The Board then provided Penjuke with a notice of charges and, on March 13, 2017, Penjuke waived his rights to a revocation hearing and the assistance of counsel, and admitted that he was convicted of a crime. In a hearing report dated March 13, 2017, the Board accepted Penjuke's waivers and admission to being a CPV. (C.R. at 94-100, 109-117). In the \"dispositional\" section located on page two of the hearing report, the Board provided a notation: \"The offender's adjustment was poor. He incurred a new criminal arrest a week after his release.\" (C.R. at 110.) On page three of the hearing report, the Board checked the box labeled \"No\" and declined to award Penjuke credit for time spent at liberty on parole. (C.R. at 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 27, 2017, the Board recommitted Penjuke as a CPV, and recalculated his maximum sentence date, extending it to February 22, 2023. In making this computation, the Board credited Penjuke with 214 days that he spent in confinement on the criminal charges but, due to his status as a CPV, the Board did not provide him with credit for any of the days that he spent on reparole. Further, and at issue here, the Board effectively rescinded the 793 days of street time that Penjuke spent in good standing when he served his prior parole and added that amount in increasing the maximum sentence date. (C.R. at 66-78, 82-103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 22, 2017, Penjuke submitted a request for administrative relief, challenging, among other things, the Board's authority to forfeit or revoke the 793 days of\n   credit that he acquired for the street time that he spent in good standing during the parole period that led to his recommitment as a TPV. Penjuke also questioned the accuracy of and statutory basis for the Board's recalculation of his maximum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the Board denied the request. Citing dispositive case law from this Court, the Board concluded that when Penjuke was recommitted as a CPV, he automatically forfeited all of his street time, including credit for the days that he previously accumulated during the original parole period. (Board's decision at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Penjuke then filed a petition for review. During the pendency of the appeal, this Court rendered its decision in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   . By\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   order dated July 9, 2018, we entered an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the effect, if any, that\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   may have on the issues presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have complied, and, on October 10, 2018, we entered an order listing the case for oral argument before the Court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Statutory and Legal Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2009, our General Assembly codified and essentially reenacted former section 21.1 of the Parole Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in nearly identical language in what became section 6138 of the Prisons and Parole Code (Parole Code). 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under both versions of the statute, collectively referred to as the Parole Statutes, the Board could recommit a parolee to prison in two distinct situations: where the parolee violated the terms and conditions of parole, legally termed a TPV, or where the parolee committed and was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment, legally termed a CPV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the event the parolee was recommitted as a TPV, the Parole Statutes dictated that the parolee \"shall be given credit for the time served on parole in good standing ... and may be reentered to serve the remainder of the original sentence or sentences.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(c)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   61 P.S. \u00a7 331.21a(b). On the other hand, if a parolee was recommitted as a CPV, the Parole Statutes mandated, without exception, that the parolee \"shall be reentered to serve the remainder of the term which the parolee would have been compelled to serve had the parole not been granted and shall be given no credit for the time at liberty on parole.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   61 P.S. \u00a7 331.21a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As documented in our case law, and by the facts of this case, there have been instances where a parolee was released on parole and recommitted as a TPV, and the Board provided the parolee with credit for days spent in good standing in accordance with the plain language of section 6138(c)(2) of the Parole Code or its prior version, former section 21.1(b) of the Parole Act. Subsequently, the parolee was reparoled and was later recommitted as a CPV, and the Board did not provide the\n   parolee with credit for the time spent on reparole, due to the parolee's status as a CPV, pursuant to the verbiage of section 6138(a)(2) of the Parole Code or its predecessor, former section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act. In this situation, a legal issue emerged concerning the Board's statutory authority: could the Board, in recommitting a parolee as a CPV, also take away the credit that the parolee previously accumulated during the parole period where the parolee was recommitted as a TPV?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1984 and 1986, this Court issued two foundational opinions that answered the question in the affirmative,\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole\n   </em>\n   , 80 Pa.Cmwlth. 574,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    472 A.2d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Since then,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   have been followed and relied upon by this Court in numerous cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

Upon recommitment as a [CPV], the parolee must serve the remainder of the term which he would have been compelled to serve had he not been paroled with no credit given for street time. While Section 21.1(b) ... provides that a [TPV] will be given credit for street time served in good standing, time spent in good standing prior to recommitment for technical violations is not shielded from forfeiture where the parolee subsequently commits a new crime and is recommitted as a [CPV]. Thus, upon recommitment as a [CPV], in addition to losing all time spent at liberty during the current parole, a parolee will also forfeit all credit received for time spent in good standing while on parole prior to his previous recommitment as a [TPV].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326104\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/348/\">\n    919 A.2d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In our decisional law, this Court has generally emphasized that as a matter of legislative intent and, to a lesser extent, statutory language, former section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act and/or section 6138(a)(2) of the Parole Code necessitated the conclusion that a CPV forfeit credit for\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   the time spent on parole, even time that was credited for a prior parole period where the parolee was recommitted as a TPV. In notable measure, we have supported our conclusion with the fact that the Board did not have any discretion to grant or otherwise award sentencing credit to a CPV, and loss of all street time was, therefore, of an automatic and mandatory nature.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    189 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   20-21 ;\n   <em>\n    Melendez v.

Cmwlth. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For example, in the genesis case of\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the parolee was recommitted as a CPV, and the Board recalculated his maximum sentence date to include the preceding periods that he spent at liberty on parole and was recommitted as a TPV. The parolee argued that former section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act required a CPV to forfeit only that time on parole he accumulated since the date of the most recent release on parole. The parolee further argued that\n   the Board had no power to revoke street time that he spent in good standing and acquired during previous instances of parole that led to recommitment as a TPV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Unable to locate any precedent that was on point, this Court considered and focused upon the legislative intent behind former section 21.1, noting that \"the General Assembly intended [s]ection 21.1(a) to be a strong deterrent to prevent parolees from returning to criminal behavior while enjoying the conditional liberty on parole.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    472 A.2d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected the parolee's proposed construction of former section 21.1(a) because, \"[u]nder this interpretation, a parolee with one or more prior recommitments as a TPV faces a substantially reduced period of confinement should he subsequently be recommitted as a CPV and the intended deterrent effect would be weakened accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so determining, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   agreed with the Board that if the parolee's position were adopted, an absurd result could possibly occur in the application of the statute, namely where two identical parolees are released on parole on the same date; one parolee sustains an intermittent recommitment as a TPV years into the future and is then released on reparole one month later; and, shortly thereafter, both parolees are recommitted as CPVs on the same date. In these circumstances, we determined, \"the individual with the better parole record would receive the harsher treatment\" and concluded that the General Assembly could not have intended such a result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ultimately, this Court based our holding on perceived legislative intent, underscoring the differential treatment between a TPV, who loses no street time for the parole period at issue, and a CPV, who automatically forfeits all street time for the parole period at issue. According to the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   Court, a grave inequity would transpire if a parolee recommitted as a CPV served a comparatively lengthy period of parole, and another parolee served the same amount of time on parole but is recommitted as a TPV and then as a CPV. On this basis, we determined that the policy of deterrence would be best served if a parolee who is recommitted as a CPV, aside from not receiving credit for any days during that parole period, also forfeited all credit earned for days spent in good standing during the prior parole period(s) where the parolee was recommitted as a TPV. This Court ended up affirming the Board on the ground that its action \"was consonant with the legislative intent of [s]ection 21.1(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    472 A.2d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   , we faced a state of facts similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   . While the Court in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   clutched onto legislative intent, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   offered a critique of the plain language of section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act to validate the same conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Where the Board determines that a parolee who has been convicted of a crime committed while on parole should be recommitted to prison,\n   <strong>\n    the General Assembly has given the Board no discretion with respect to the credits to which a [CPV] is entitled against the sentence's maximum term\n   </strong>\n   . Section 21.1(a) clearly mandates that a [CPV] shall serve the \"remainder of the term\" originally imposed that the parolee would have been required to serve \"had he not been paroled\" with the parolee receiving \"\n   <strong>\n    no credit for the time at liberty on parole\n   </strong>\n   .\" ... The language of the statute clearly shows the General Assembly intended to deny [CPVs] credit against their sentences' maximum terms for\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   street time accumulated while on parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354258\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/101/468/\">\n    516 A.2d at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   , decided by the Court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   in 2011, the parolee argued that under\n   section 6138 of the Parole Code, he was entitled to retain credit for time served in good standing during the period of parole prior to his recommitment as a TPV, and that he did not forfeit this time when he was later recommitted as a CPV.

Citing the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   line of cases that came to fruition over the years, we reiterated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    It is clear from a plain reading of the statute\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    that while [TPVs] are entitled to credit for time served while on parole in good standing, such that they may only be recommitted for the remainder of their original sentences, [CPVs], on the other hand, are not entitled to any credit for street[ ]time\n   </strong>\n   .

First, the General Assembly intended the loss of all street time for a CPV to be a deterrent effect and this goal would be undermined if a CPV with prior recommitment(s) as a TPV was able to retain credit for time spent in good standing. Second, an absurd result may occur because it was conceivable that a parolee with a better parole record would be the recipient of harsher treatment, for example, when a parolee remains on a lengthy stretch of parole and is later recommitted as a CPV, in comparison to a parolee who is recommitted as a TPV and also as a CPV during that same amount of time. Third, the language of the Parole Statutes indicated that the General Assembly intended to deny a CPV any credit for street time accumulated during any period of parole as reflected predominately by the fact that the Board had no discretion to award a parolee with credit following recommitment as a CPV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On a fundamental level, a legal rule can only go so far as the reason that carries it; hence, \"[w]here stops the reason, there stops the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. National Bank Association v. United Hands Community Land Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767484\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/627/6767484/#p636\">\n    129 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015) (citation omitted). Here, the concerns, justifications, and underlying analysis that comprised the scaffold of this Court's previous interpretation and construction of the Parole Statutes have all been severely eroded by the 2012 Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At the outset, a distinction can be made regarding the severity of the infraction that gives rise to the status of a TPV-violation of the terms and conditions of parole-when compared to a CPV-commission and conviction of a crime. For this reason, it makes complete sense that in devising the Parole Statutes, the General Assembly would not place a CPV on par with a TPV or deem the two as one and the same. With the 2012 Amendment, though, the General Assembly, in clear and unmistakable language, decided to give a CPV a chance to receive credit for street time, while, at the same time, preserving the grant of full credit it had always bestowed upon a TPV. In apparent recognition of the dissimilarity intrinsic to the CPV vis-\u00e0-vis the TPV, the General Assembly readjusted the level, so to speak, when it enacted the 2012 Amendment, attempting to alleviate the harsh results that occur when a CPV has served a relatively long and successful period of parole but cannot obtain any street time credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Now that the 2012 Amendment provides the Board with discretion to grant a CPV with credit for time he spent at liberty during the parole period that resulted in recommitment as a CPV, the apprehension that encouraged this Court in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   and other cases to resort to legislative intent and depend heavily on the concept of a deterrent effect is unwarranted. This is because the parolee recommitted\n   as a CPV, despite having committed and been convicted of a crime while on parole, unlike in the past, is presently able to obtain credit for street time at the discretion of the Board. Since the decision to grant or award credit to a CPV will be made on a case-by-case basis by the Board, utilizing its expertise in the area,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Consequently, the fear expressed in our case law that a policy of deterrence would be eviscerated and an absurd or inequitable result promoted, based upon the difference in treatment the General Assembly previously afforded to the CPV (the grant of no credit) and the TPV (the grant of total credit), is no longer founded or defensible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Currently, by virtue of the 2012 Amendment, the Board can provide a CPV with partial and, conceivably, even full credit, for the days spent at liberty on the parole. A CPV will be eligible to receive credit during the period of parole in which the crime was committed, regardless of whether there have been any prior recommitments as a TPV. Succinctly stated, because the CPV has attained the right and possibility to acquire credit for street time, there is no cause for the Court to retain the concern in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   that \"the individual with the better parole record would receive the harsher treatment,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    472 A.2d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we need not fret over whether or not a CPV could theoretically receive a \"windfall\" based upon the fact that the parolee has a history of recommitment(s) as a TPV. Relatedly, because the CPV, at present, does not forfeit all credit in an unconditional and automatic fashion, the Court has no occasion to base or preserve its interpretation of section 6138 of the Parole Code upon consideration of whether or not a CPV should, as an added form of retribution, forfeit time accumulated as a TPV as well.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20A.2d%201168\">\n    472 A.2d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] parolee with one or more prior recommitments as a TPV faces a substantially reduced period of confinement should he subsequently be recommitted as a CPV and the intended deterrent effect would be weakened accordingly.\");\n   <em>\n    cf. also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280309\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/20/596/#p599\">\n    20 A.3d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While [CPVs] with no prior recommitments as [TPVs] would forfeit all street[ ]time from their original parole date, those [CPVs] who do have prior recommitments as [TPVs] would only forfeit street[ ]time from their most recent reparole date.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As a final matter, this Court, in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   , has discussed the \"plain language\" of the Parole Statutes to support our disposition by primarily highlighting the mandatory language of former section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act and former section 6138(a)(2) of the Parole Code, which states, \"shall be given no credit for the time at liberty on parole,\" and stressing the Board's lack of discretion to award credit to a CPV.

Since the 2012 Amendment has undermined the rationale reinforcing the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   line of cases, we start anew and take a fresh review of the language and organizational composition of section 6138 of the Parole Code as it currently exists with the 2012 Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   By its very structure, the statute creates two classes of parole violators, and the General Assembly clearly delineated a separate sphere between a CPV and a TPV. This is evidenced, among other ways, in the particular statutory subheadings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6138(a) (Convicted violators); 6138(c) (Technical violators),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in section 6138(c) with the express designation of a TPV in terms of being a parolee who is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   a CPV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(c)(1). Within this dual classification system, our General Assembly created a clear-cut, distinctive framework for each group with respect to credit for street time following recommitment. For a parolee who is recommitted as a TPV, that \"parolee shall be given credit for the time served on parole in good standing.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(c)(2). With this credit added to the sentence, the parolee recommitted as a TPV then serves the remainder of the time that is left on the original sentence,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the original sentence minus the credit for the days in good standing and the days actually served in confinement. By contrast, the parolee who is recommitted as a CPV \"shall be given no credit for the time at liberty on parole,\"\n   <strong>\n    unless\n   </strong>\n   the Board, \"in its discretion,\" decides to \"award credit to [the] parolee ... for the time spent at liberty on parole.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2)-(2.1). Regardless of how the Board exercises its discretion for a CPV, the amount of days that are not credited for the parole period will be added to the maximum sentence date, but the parolee recommitted as a CPV will only serve \"the remainder of\n   the term\" of his sentence,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the original sentence plus the days that the Board did not grant credit and minus the days actually served in confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This interpretation of section 6138(a) and (c) is simple enough. The issue then becomes whether a legitimate basis exists to collapse the statutory dichotomy of a TPV and a CPV, intermingle the two conceptually in the circumstances of reparole, and construe section 6138(a)(2) as authorizing the Board, in recommitting a CPV, to revoke street time that was previously awarded to a TPV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As this Court has recognized, former section 21.1(a) of the Parole Act, former section 6138(a)(2) of the Parole Code, and current section 6138(a) of the Parole Code \"do[ ] not specifically address the sanction for new criminal actions committed while on\n   <strong>\n    re\n   </strong>\n   -parole.\"\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   , 854 A.2d at 998 (emphasis in original). Based upon our evaluation, the clauses \"had the parole not been granted\" and \"at liberty on parole\" in section 6138(a)(2) cannot reasonably be interpreted to permit the Board to go beyond the \"parole period\" mentioned in that section, which is couched solely in relation and reference to the \"parolee's recommitment\" as a CPV. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(1). Similarly, these same clauses in section 6138(a)(2) are incapable of generating a modifying or expounding effect onto the associative phrase \"shall be given no credit\" in a manner that would authorize the Board to apply a precept of forfeiture to all prior instances of parole that led to recommitment as a TPV. This is especially true considering that section 6138(c)(2) unequivocally states that the parolee will receive credit for time spent in good standing \"[i]f the parolee is recommitted under this subsection,\" and the principle enunciated therein pertains exclusively and specifically to a TPV and without regard or connection to a CPV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As such, we find that the language \"shall be given no credit\" is circumscribed and intended to apply only to the single and specific period of parole that led to recommitment as a CPV. After all, under section 6138(c)(2), the TPV who has spent time in good standing \"shall be given credit,\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(c)(2), while, pursuant to section 6138(a)(2), the CPV who was at liberty on parole \"shall be given no credit.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2). Significantly, in both instances, the concept of \"credit\" is described by the verb \"give,\" which means \"to grant or bestow by formal action\" or \"to convey to another.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1192 (1986). Whereas the TPV situation requires the affirmative act of \"giving,\" the CPV situation involves the refraining of such action by \"not giving\"; comparing the two side by side, they do not operate to cancel each other out and section (a)(2) does not negate section (c)(2). Put differently, although the CPV is \"given no credit,\" the withholding of credit is passive conduct and cannot create a foundation to imply a confirmatory power to engage in active conduct and take away credit that was previously \"given\" to the TPV. Moreover, considering section 6138(a)(2) in conjunction with its counterpart provision, the 2012 Amendment, section 6138(a)(2.1), a harmonious relationship is created and internal consistency achieved within the CPV scheme: the CPV \"shall be given no credit\" except when the Board, in its discretion, decides to \"award credit\" to the CPV. In this regard, the 2012 Amendment is meaningful in that it tends to confirm that the concept of \"credit\" in section 6138(a) is confined to the CPV scenario only and strongly suggests that the notion of \"credit\" for a CPV is sealed off from the\n   idea of \"credit\" for a TPV, with there being no correlation between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This said, to uphold the Board's position, it would be necessary for section 6138(a) to contain language that invests the Board with the positive and affirmative power to \"take away\" the credit that was already given to the TPV. Although our General Assembly has used words that would suffice to accomplish such a result, terms like \"revoke,\" \"rescind,\" and \"forfeit\" in a replete manner elsewhere in the Parole Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   it did not employ terminology to this effect in section 6138(a). Under Pennsylvania law, the Board \"can exercise only those powers conferred upon it by the General Assembly in clear and unmistakable language.\"\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    189 A.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Viewing section 6138(a) and section 6138(c) in a cohesive manner, we are unable to locate, much less vindicate, an express power in the Board to divest credit from a TPV for street time spent in good standing when recommitting a parolee as a CPV. And, absent such express authority, we lack the tools necessary to infer such an authority. As instructed in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , this Court cannot \"add words to [the Parole Code] that the legislature chose to omit\" in order to provide the Board with \"authorization to revoke sentence credit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    189 A.3d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Our plain language interpretation and understanding of section 6138 of the Parole Code is concordant with, and draws inspiration from, our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   . Whether or not foreshadowed by the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   Court, the rationale espoused in that case applies here with compelling force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , section 6138(c)(2) positively states that a TPV \"\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be given credit for the time served on parole in good standing.\" 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(c)(2) (emphasis added). Through this directive of the General Assembly, the Board has no choice over the matter and must grant credit to the parolee who is recommitted as a TPV. While in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   the case involved a CPV who was later recommitted as a CPV, the Board exercised its discretion under the 2012 Amendment, awarded credit to the parolee, and thereafter sought to take it away relying on its authority under section 6138(a). Here, the Board previously granted Penjuke credit per section 6138(c)(2) and is presently attempting to take that credit away based upon its authority under section 6138(a). No material distinction can be made from the situation where the credit is granted by the Board through the exercise of discretion, as in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , to the situation where credit is granted through statutory mandate, as with Penjuke. Indeed, the two are analogous-actually duplicative and transposable-because the bottom line is that, in both events, credit has been granted, and once credited is awarded, \"the street time is gone.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    189 A.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , we admonished that the grant of credit is \"not a decision to defer the forfeiture of street time to a later\n   time,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Board cannot place sentencing credit \"into an escrow account for later forfeiture.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498633\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/16/\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record does not disclose the process through which the Board exercises its discretionary decision pursuant to the 2012 Amendment. But wherever or however the Board postulates and renders that determination, the decision is not preceded by a hearing that is conferred by statute or regulation-one that is specifically committed to the issue of whether the parolee should be \"re-awarded,\" or able to keep, the credit that the parolee previously accumulated as a TPV.

If this Court were to preserve the interpretation from our precedent, we would most likely sanction a reading of section 6138 that would authorize the Board to deprive a parolee of his or her accumulated and entitled credits for time spent in good standing under section 6138(c)(2), without affording that parolee the procedural requisites that the constitution requires. Because we presume the General Assembly did not intend to violate the constitution, we conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   line of cases must yield out of constitutional necessity.

As such, the Board erred when it revoked the 793 days of good standing street time that Penjuke acquired in the parole period that led to his recommitment as a TPV and we reverse this portion of the Board's order.
