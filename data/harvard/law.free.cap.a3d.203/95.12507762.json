Kocanowski applied for and was denied temporary disability benefits because she did not have outside employment. In this appeal, we consider whether volunteer firefighters must be employed to be eligible for temporary disability benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Appellate Division affirmed the denial of temporary disability benefits by the Division of Workers' Compensation, finding Kocanowski's unemployment at the time of injury precluded her from receiving coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We now reverse the Appellate Division's judgment. While N.J.S.A. 34:15-75's language is unclear, we find its legislative history indicates a strong intent to provide temporary disability coverage to volunteer firefighters at the maximum compensation provided for in the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We elicit the following facts from the testimony before the Division of Compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kocanowski was a volunteer firefighter for approximately seventeen years; she served fifteen of those years at the Finderne Fire Department in the Township of Bridgewater. During her fifteen years working for the Finderne Fire Department, Kocanowski several times received \"Top 10\" and \"Top 5\" responder recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to her volunteer work, Kocanowski usually had outside paid employment, including working as a nanny and home health care aide. In October 2013, Kocanowski left her outside employment to provide care for her ill father. Kocanowski's father died in November 2013, and she lost her brother shortly thereafter. Her home health aide license lapsed while she was coping with family issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kocanowski took a six-month leave from volunteer firefighting after her father's death to care for her ill mother and settle her father's estate. She returned to volunteer\n   firefighting around July 2014, but did not resume outside employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 6, 2015, Kocanowski and other volunteer firefighters from Bridgewater responded to a multi-alarm fire in Franklin Township. While carrying equipment, Kocanowski slipped on ice. She broke the upper shaft of her right fibula, severely damaged her ankle, and tore several ligaments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kocanowski underwent surgery and received numerous medical treatments for her injuries, but she began to experience back pain and knee pain in addition to her ankle pain in the weeks after the accident. Her doctors discovered two fractures in her foot, a torn meniscus in her acutely arthritic left knee, damage to the peroneal nerve on her right leg, and impairment to her back -- all sustained as a result of the fall. Kocanowski underwent another surgery, further treatments, and intensive physical therapy. Yet, she continues to experience issues with her back, legs, and feet, all of which impede her ability to return to volunteer firefighting and her previous outside employment as a nanny or home health care aide. Kocanowski has also been unable to continue caring for her\n   mother since the accident. Her injuries and the accompanying pain limit her ability to drive more than very short distances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Kocanowski received $125 per week in benefits from the Finderne Fire Department for one year following the accident. She has no other source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 14, 2015, Kocanowski filed a Notice of Motion for Temporary and/or Medical Benefits, including a request for a 25% additional penalty for failure to pay timely temporary disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Division of Workers' Compensation judge heard and denied Kocanowski's application for temporary benefits on March 9, 2016. The judge acknowledged that N.J.S.A. 34:15-75 awards \"maximum compensation\" to volunteer firefighters injured in the course of their volunteer work but found that temporary disability benefits were intended as a wage-replacement. The judge therefore concluded Kocanowski was not entitled to temporary disability benefits because she had not been employed at the time of her accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kocanowski appealed, arguing the compensation judge had erred in finding an outside employment requirement before volunteer firefighters were eligible to receive temporary disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Appellate Division affirmed the compensation judge's determination that pre-injury outside employment is a necessary predicate to awarding temporary disability benefits to volunteer firefighters.\n   <em>\n    Kocanowski v.

It would be incongruous and inconsistent, after years of expanding protections and exemptions for volunteer firefighters, for the Legislature to abruptly limit the class of volunteer firefighters who qualify for temporary disability from any volunteer firefighter who had ever been employed to only volunteer firefighters employed at the time of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the extrinsic evidence and legislative history decidedly indicate the Legislature intended to increase temporary disability coverage for volunteer firefighters injured in the course of performing their duties when it enacted the current form of N.J.S.A. 34:15-75, and not create new barriers to coverage. As such, we find N.J.S.A. 34:15-75 authorizes all volunteer firefighters injured in the course of performing their duties to receive the\n   maximum compensation permitted, regardless of their outside employment status at the time of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant urges us to find N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 sets an eligibility standard, requiring temporary disability claimants to provide proof of outside employment to be eligible for temporary disability benefits. Notably, this statute is a general, all-purpose statute, not specific to firefighters. N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 provides a \"method of calculating compensation for temporary disability\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   To calculate the number of weeks and fraction thereof that compensation is payable for temporary disability, determine the number of calendar days of disability from and including as a full day the day that the employee is\n   <em>\n    first unable to continue at work\n   </em>\n   by reason of\n   the accident, including also Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, up to the first working day that the employee is\n   <em>\n    able to resume work\n   </em>\n   and continue permanently thereat; subtract from this number the waiting period and any days and fraction thereof the employee was able to work during this time, and divide the remainder by 7. If, however, the total period of disability extends beyond 7 days, the waiting period shall not be subtracted from the number indicated above. The resulting whole number and sevenths will be the required period for which compensation is payable on account of temporary disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [ (emphases added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant argues language like \"first unable to continue at work,\" and \"able to resume work\" demonstrates temporary disability only applies when the claimant was working at the onset of his or her disability. We find nothing in either the plain language of the statutes or their legislative histories to indicate such an intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Indeed, N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 existed alongside the pre-1952 version of N.J.S.A. 34:15-75, which as noted earlier allowed volunteer firefighters who were\n   <em>\n    unemployed\n   </em>\n   at the time of their injury to receive benefits. N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 did not bar benefits then. There is no reason to think it does now, after the amendment to N.J.S.A. 34:15-75 which loosened restrictions and provided greater protections to volunteer firefighters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Also, it is not a reach to find that volunteer firefighters injured in the course of their firefighting duties were at work, unable to continue at work and, in Kocanowski's case, unable to resume work. While the statute generally calls for a \"waiting period\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   before the temporary disability payment may be paid, the Legislature clearly exempted volunteer firefighters from that waiting period. So, we decline to adopt defendant's \"square peg into a round hole\" theory that N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 precludes coverage for volunteer firefighters injured in the course of performing their firefighting duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Moreover, to require prior outside employment as suggested by N.J.S.A. 34:15-38 in order to qualify for N.J.S.A. 34:15-75's presumption of entitlement of the maximum compensation would lead to absurd results. Defendant's interpretation would allow a volunteer firefighter who completes work for a nominal salary, say $5 weekly to deliver newspapers, to automatically receive the maximum compensation authorized while a volunteer firefighter like Kocanowski, who had no outside compensation at the time of her injury, would receive no temporary disability benefits. Both firefighters take the same risks in their duties for the fire departments. It is an illogical result that the former firefighter would receive $855 weekly in benefits (based upon the maximum available at the time Kocanowski was injured), while the latter would receive nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the Legislature's amendment in 1952 creating the current version of N.J.S.A. 34:15-75 was intended to grant all volunteer firefighters the maximum compensation allowed, regardless of current or previous income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand the matter to the Division of Workers' Compensation for the award of benefits consistent with the principles outlined in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and JUSTICES LaVECCHIA, ALBIN, PATTERSON, FERNANDEZ-VINA, and SOLOMON join in JUSTICE TIMPONE'S opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
