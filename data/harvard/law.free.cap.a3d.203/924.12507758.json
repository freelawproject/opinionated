After reviewing the record in light of the contentions advanced on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An involuntary civil commitment can follow service of a sentence, or other criminal disposition, when the offender \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\" N.J.S.A. 30:4-27.26 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 30:4-27.25.

A.Y. is now thirty-nine years old. In February 2006, he pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(c). His conviction was predicated on the following facts. On April 11, 2005, A.Y. went to the house of his former girlfriend, N.B., who was home with her two-year-old son. A.Y. wanted to stay the night and said he would leave at 5:00 a.m. the next morning. N.B. allowed him to stay, and he slept on the couch. When the alarm went off the next morning, N.B. told A.Y. it was time to leave. A.Y. began touching her, ordered her to remove her clothes, and refused to allow her to leave the apartment. A.Y. demanded she hug and kiss him and became violent when she resisted, stating he intended to make her suffer the way she made him suffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When N.B. picked up her son, A.Y. told her to put him down and threatened to break the child's neck if she did not do so. A.Y. forced N.B.'s legs open and performed\n   oral sex on her. He then forced N.B. to perform fellatio on him, threatening to harm her if she refused and to break her neck if she bit him. He then vaginally and anally penetrated her despite her complaints of pain and demanded she suck the fecal matter off his penis. While her son cried in another room, A.Y. anally penetrated N.B. a second time. A.Y. then told N.B. to stand at the foot of her son's bed and vaginally penetrated her from behind. A.Y. told her he was going to do this to her for the next forty-eight hours and that he would hurt her son if she left or answered the door. When A.Y. left to buy cigarettes, N.B. ran upstairs to a friend's apartment and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to sentencing, A.Y. underwent a psychological evaluation at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center in Avenel to determine his eligibility for sentencing under the purview of the New Jersey Sex Offender Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:47-1 to -10. In her report, psychologist Donna LoBiondo, Ph.D., stated A.Y.'s responses to the sexuality\n   questionnaire included: \"Something I enjoy about being a male is ... my dominance over God's creation\" and, \"[t]he hard thing about being a male is ... the ultimate responsibility of being the dominant member.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. LoBiondo described A.Y.'s demeanor as \"arrogant and detached.\" He reported being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder with posttraumatic stress and depression. A.Y. admitted he could be overly aggressive when upset, and that there is \"no limit\" to his aggression when properly provoked. He stated, \"really most women are prostitutes.\" A.Y. denied sexually assaulting N.B., claiming he \"didn't do anything\" and that the sex \"was consensual.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. LoBiondo opined A.Y.'s \"[o]verall clinical impression is of a psychopathic and sadistic individual who engages in aggression for his own gratification as well as the humiliation of those he perceives as vulnerable.\" Despite these findings, she concluded there was \"insufficient evidence that [A.Y.'s] criminal behavior qualifies as repetitive and compulsive under the statute. It is more likely that antisocial, sadistic and narcissistic motivations drove his criminal sexual behavior.\" He was found not eligible for sentencing under the purview of the Sex Offender Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.Y. was sentenced to a five-year prison term, subject to an eighty-five-percent period of parole ineligibility under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2, community supervision for life, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4, and the requirements imposed by Megan's Law, N.J.S.A. 2C:7-1 to -23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 15, 2006, while being detained on the sexual assault charge, A.Y. forcibly sodomized a fellow inmate, penetrating him repeatedly. He pleaded guilty to an accusation of third-degree criminal restraint in circumstances exposing the victim to risk of serious bodily injury, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-2(a), and was sentenced to a concurrent three-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.Y. did not file a direct appeal from either conviction or sentence. His subsequent petition for post-conviction relief (PCR)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   from the sexual assault conviction was denied. In an unpublished opinion, we affirmed the denial of PCR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2009, a psychological evaluation and risk assessment of A.Y. was performed by Alicia Caputo, Ph.D., a psychologist. Her report states A.Y. reported beginning counseling at age four or five after witnessing the murder of his brother. He was prescribed medication at age eight for hyperactivity and because he \"started exhibiting signs of violence toward other kids.\" A.Y. was in and out of psychiatric treatment as a teenager and was prescribed\n   Paxil, Risperdal, and other medications but refused to take them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prior to his convictions in New Jersey, A.Y. was convicted of arson, cruelty to animals, theft by unlawful taking, and simple assault in Georgia. As to the arson and cruelty to animals convictions, A.Y. reported to Dr. Caputo that he had moved in with his girlfriend and invested much time and money into the relationship, including buying all their furniture. The relationship deteriorated and during a physical altercation he had \"probably choked her.\" His girlfriend called the police and he was removed from the residence. A.Y. came up with the idea to go over to her residence \"and burn it all up\" because she had all the furniture and would not give it back. He set his girlfriend's residence on fire while she was not home. Her dog and cat perished in the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.Y. was treated for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Bipolar Disorder and was prescribed Geodon, Vistaril, and Zoloft while serving a prison term in Georgia from 2001 to 2004. While in prison he cut his wrist several times, stating he was depressed but denied true suicidal intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Upon his release from prison, A.Y. returned to New Jersey and briefly participated in outpatient treatment and was prescribed Paxil and Risperdal until his sexual assault arrest. While incarcerated in jail, A.Y. participated in mental health treatment and was prescribed Benadryl, Depakote, and Risperdal but stopped taking these medications in May 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.Y. entered the State prison system in April 2007. After reporting symptoms including sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, irritability, and mood swings, he was prescribed Depakote, Risperdal, and Vistaril but was noted as being erratically compliant with medication. At one point he verbalized suicidal ideation. In April 2009, he returned to outpatient treatment, and was diagnosed with Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) and Personality Disorder NOS. He was prescribed Benadryl, Depakote, and Zoloft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Caputo's report states A.Y.'s \"presentation throughout his incarceration has been described as angry, antisocial, and sarcastic.\" He repeatedly disclosed thoughts of violence, stabbing people, or otherwise assaulting them if his demands were not met. \"He also described a constant state of underlying anger and a view that relationships with people were 'only to get what I want from them.' \" During her interview of A.Y., he described the criminal restraint offense, admitting he anally penetrated his cell mate with a broomstick because his cell mate was a child molester. When asked about the appropriateness of his behavior, he responded, \"[t]hat's what he should get.\" This version conflicts with A.Y.'s contention that he engaged in consensual sex with his cell mate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Caputo noted A.Y. underwent a parole evaluation by David Gomberg, Ph.D., in January 2009, which included the use of the Static-99\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and MnSOST-R\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   actuarial instruments to assess his future sex offender\n   risk. Dr. Gomberg's scoring of the MnSOST-R and Static-99 placed A.Y. in the high risk category on both\n   instruments. Dr. Gomberg recommended A.Y. be referred for civil commitment as a sexually violent predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Caputo also administered the MnSOST-R and Static-99 actuarial instruments. She scored A.Y. a +10 on the MnSOST-R, placing him in the high risk category for sexual reoffending, and a 5 on the Static-99, placing him in the moderate-high risk category for sexual reoffending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Caputo concluded both of A.Y.'s offenses \"involved significant elements of violence.\" His sexual assault of N.B. \"involved elements of sadism and humiliation,\" as well as using threats of violence against her two-year-old son. \"More generally, [A.Y.] exhibited a significant tendency to denigrate and objectify women.\" With regard to his criminal restraint conviction, A.Y. \"exhibited no remorse and framed his sexual assault of the victim as 'just desserts' for the victim's alleged pedophilia.\" Dr. Caputo stated A.Y. \"exhibited no empathy for either of his sexual victims.\" She found A.Y. appropriate for referral for SVPA commitment upon his release from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Caputo concluded A.Y. \"has exhibited a significant penchant for violence\" and \"[h]is violent tendencies are the results of significant antisocial traits.\" She opined \"[a]lthough it is highly likely that [A.Y.] will engage in violent behavior in the future, this increased risk is not considered a function of psychopathology outside the realm of severe antisocial characterological disorder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In October 2009, the State filed a petition seeking A.Y.'s involuntary commitment under the SVPA. The clinical certificates of psychiatrists Marina Moshkovich, M.D., and Anasya Salem, M.D., identifying A.Y. as a sexually violent predator, were submitted in support of the application. A.Y. was examined by Dr. Moshkovich on October 26, 2009, and by Dr. Salem the next day. Both of their clinical certificates stated A.Y. scored a 9 on the Static-99R and a 12 on the MnSOST-R risk assessment instruments, placing him at high risk for sexual reoffending. They each diagnosed A.Y. as suffering from Polysubstance Dependence in remission due to controlled environment, Mood Disorder NOS, and Antisocial Personality\n   Disorder (ASPD), and opined A.Y. \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care, and treatment.\" A.Y. was temporarily committed to the STU pending an initial hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For several years, A.Y. waived his initial commitment hearing while he unsuccessfully pursued PCR in State court, and a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. A.Y. engaged in treatment at the STU during his temporary commitment but spent much of that period in the Modified Activities Program (MAP)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to violating institutional rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The hearing on the State's petition was held on June 21, 2017. The State presented the testimony of Dean M. De Crisce, M.D., an expert psychiatrist, and Laura Carmignani, Ph.D., an expert psychologist. Appellant presented the testimony of Barry Zakireh, Ph.D., an expert psychologist. A.Y. elected not to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. De Crisce performed a forensic psychiatric evaluation and issued a report in 2017. As part of the evaluation, Dr. De Crisce utilized the Static-99R and Stable 2007 actuarial instruments. A.Y. scored a 9 on the Static-99R, placing him at a \"well above average\" risk to sexually recidivate. He scored A.Y. at 17 on the Stable 2007, \"placing him within a group of individuals with similar dynamic factors that require a high level of dynamic supervision needs.\" Dr. De Crisce noted A.Y. scored a 28 on the PCL-R in 2009, \"which approximates the threshold of psychopathy.\" He also noted A.Y. \"incurred a number of institutional infractions, had not participated in programming, [and] voiced multiple violent thoughts and denigrating thoughts about women.\" He further noted A.Y. tested positive for opiates and cannabis in 2012, and was placed on MAP in 2013 \"for making threats towards medical\n   personnel and spitting at them.\" He also incurred MAP placements in 2015 for multiple infractions including threatening behavior and possession of marijuana and alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dr. De Crisce concluded A.Y. suffered from ASPD as evidenced by his repeated behaviors. Noting he \"has been described as an angry, irritable, aggressive and controlling individual,\" A.Y. stated he liked to take risks, and described himself as the type of person who \"wants what he wants\" and will \"go all in.\" A.Y. \"expressed a core belief that violence was necessary to get results and to exert dominance.\" A.Y. stated: \"Once I make my mind up about something man I'm like a bull.\" Dr. De Crisce considered A.Y.'s rape behaviors as a function of his ASPD, viewing \"these rapes as a function of revenge, rage, antisocial entitlement, and dysfunctional thoughts about women and others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. De Crisce opined A.Y. also suffered from various substance abuse disorders and Bipolar II Disorder. He noted substance use is a known risk factor for recidivism in individuals with a history of sexual offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. De Crisce found A.Y. has a number of factors that contribute to a high risk of sexual reoffense. He concluded A.Y. still requires therapeutic work to address his risk taking behaviors despite making positive strides in his treatment in the last year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Dr. De Crisce opined A.Y. \"suffers from a mental abnormality and personality disorder that affects his cognitive, volitional, or emotional capacity such that he is highly likely to sexually reoffend if not kept under the care, control and treatment of a secure facility such as the STU.\" His testimony largely expressed the same findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Carmignani prepared a comprehensive annual review report for the Treatment Progress Review Committee (TPRC) in December 2016. The report reviewed A.Y.'s sexual offense history, nonsexual offense history, course of treatment at the STU, institutional infractions, clinical interview, psychological testing results, diagnoses, and clinical formulation and treatment recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The report states A.Y. is diagnosed with ASPD (with borderline features), Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder (nonconsent) (provisional), Sexual Sadism Disorder (provisional), Cannabis Use Disorder (in a controlled environment), Phencyclidine (PCP) Use Disorder (in a controlled environment), Opioid Use Disorder (in a controlled environment), Alcohol Use Disorder (in a controlled environment), Bipolar Disorder (by history), and PTSD (by history).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The report states A.Y.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   demonstrates an enduring, pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others that began in adolescence or early adulthood, which is characterized by a failure to conform\n   to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability and aggressiveness, reckless disregard for safety of self or others, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Carmignani opined A.Y. \"is highly likely to sexually reoffend at this time if not confined to the STU.\" Her opinion was \"based on his high actuarial estimate, antisocial and psychopathic personality structure, history of sexual preoccupation, and history of violence within intimate relationships, as well as his ongoing negative emotionality, impulsivity, poor judgment, and poor problem solving skills.\" She also noted A.Y.'s extensive substance abuse. Dr. Carmignani also noted A.Y.'s Static-99R and STABLE-2007 scores placed in the high risk range to sexually recidivate. The report recommended A.Y. remain in Phase 2 of treatment. Her testimony largely expressed the same findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Barry Zakireh performed a forensic psychosexual evaluation of A.Y. in May 2017. His report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   the evidence overwhelmingly supports the presence of features or symptoms associated ... with bipolar or severe mood disorder, substance abuse, and antisocial characteristics leading to general criminality, particularly evident in his late adolescence to early adulthood, and no evidence of any significant correlation with paraphilic urges or sexual dynamics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dr. Zakireh diagnosed A.Y. with ASPD, Bipolar Disorder, and Substance Abuse Disorders in a controlled environment (alcohol, cannabis, and opiates). Dr. Zakireh opined a person with ASPD:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   manifests a long-term maladaptive pattern of behavior involving disregard for and violations of the rights of others. The features of this disorder are expressed in [A.Y.'s] history (since adolescence) of repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest; multiple rule violations or arrests for sexual and nonsexual offenses (criminal versatility); irritability; anger or aggression; impulsivity or poor impulse control (repeated criminal acts despite arrests, sanctions, or supervision); irresponsibility and/or failure to plan in a socially constructive or adaptive manner (e.g., criminal behavior leading or exacerbating interpersonal and social difficulties[) ]; reckless disregard for the safety of self or others (placing a victim at significant risk of harm or maladaptive outcome; sexual offending against a vulnerable female with presence of a child in the residence); and poor empathy. [A.Y.] has showed the above pattern occasionally in significant or extreme ways, and it has been expressed through sexual and nonsexual aggression on multiple occasions over a prolonged period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Zakireh found significant evidence of a confounding or corollary mental condition of Bipolar Disorder, which had been treated with \"an effective mood stabilizing psychotropic.\" He concluded the primary motivations or pattern of offending appear to correlate primarily with an antisocial but not paraphilic pathway to sexual offending. He also noted ASPD \"involves a diminishing of the intensity or frequency of negative outcomes through aging,\" particularly in the fourth decade of life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Zakireh utilized the Static-2002R to assess actuarial risk of sex offense recidivism, scoring A.Y. at 6, placing him in the above-average risk category. \"Beyond the predisposing element of [ASPD],\" Dr. Zakireh found insufficient evidence of a mental disorder that results in a serious difficulty controlling harmful sexual behavior such that it is highly likely A.Y. will not control his sexually violent behavior and will reoffend. He concluded A.Y. presents an overall moderate level of risk to sexually\n   reoffend, considering the static, actuarial, and dynamic factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Zakireh testified the Static-2002R had \"greater predictive accuracy\" than the Static-99R. He said A.Y.'s score of 6 correlated with only a nineteen percent rate over a five-year period. Dr. Zakireh also administered the Static-99 and scored A.Y. at 7. His testimony otherwise largely expressed the findings and conclusions expressed in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Judge Philip M. Freedman rendered a comprehensive oral decision on June 27, 2017, in which he reviewed the testimony, entire documentary record, prior criminal record, prior evaluations, mental health treatment, history of infractions, and controlling case law. The judge recounted A.Y.'s statements during treatment in late 2016 that rejection by women took him to a place of rage and retaliation against them. The judge provided detailed findings regarding the testimony and opinions of Drs. De Crisce and Carmignani, which he credited, and the testimony of Dr. Zakireh, whose theory that A.Y. had reduced his anti-sociality through medications for his Bipolar Disorder he rejected, finding it had \"no basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Judge Freedman reviewed the records relied upon by the State's experts in reaching their opinions, and found the records to be of the type relied upon by experts in their field. The judge also found the records supported their opinions. In contrast, Judge Freedman concluded A.Y. and his expert substantially overstated the effect of his use of medication for his Bipolar Disorder on his likelihood to reoffend. While recognizing Abilify renders A.Y. capable of engaging in treatment, Judge Freedman concluded the Abilify\"hasn't in any way, shape or form eliminated his need for treatment to deal with his [ASPD] and his ... problems.\" He determined A.Y.'s antisocial behavior and predisposition to engage in sexual offending were not caused by his Bipolar Disorder. The judge found A.Y. \"clearly needs continued treatment\" despite the improvement in his Bipolar Disorder through medication, agreeing with Dr. DeCrisce's opinion that A.Y.'s Bipolar Disorder\"is incidental to his presentation and not the basis of it.\" The judge noted Dr. Zakireh acknowledged that Bipolar Disorder does not predispose a bipolar individual to commit sexually violent offenses. He further noted Dr. Zakireh conceded A.Y.'s Bipolar Disorder was peripheral to his sexual offending, A.Y. was still predisposed to engage in acts of sexual violence by his ASPD, and A.Y. would have far more maladaptive behaviors if he did not take his medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Judge Freedman concluded A.Y. had \"not made that much treatment progress,\" was still in Phase 2, still needed to develop relapse prevention by completing relapse prevention 2 and 3, and still needed extensive substance abuse treatment. He viewed A.Y. as \"far from being ready for a conditional discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The judge found the State clearly and convincingly proved its case for civil commitment. Based on the expert testimony of the State's witnesses, Judge Freedman found by clear and convincing evidence that A.Y. suffers from a mental abnormality in the form of substance abuse disorders and a personality disorder involving antisocial traits, which \"predisposes him to engage in acts of sexual violence.\" The judge further found A.Y. \"would have serious difficulty controlling his sexually violent behavior in the community.\" He also found A.Y. \"would be highly likely to return to drug use, which would disinhibit him\" and make his anti-sociality \"even worse.\" Judge Freedman concluded A.Y. would not be highly likely to comply with conditions of a conditional discharge, noting\n   even A.Y.'s expert \"could not testify to that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Judge Freedman determined A.Y. \"continues to be a sexually violent predator in need of civil commitment in a secure facility for control, care, and treatment,\" who is \"highly likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\" for \"the foreseeable future.\" Judgment was entered committing A.Y. to the STU. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A.Y. raises the following issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE TRIAL JUDGE CLEARLY ERRED WHEN HE ASSESSED A.Y.'S RISK OF REOFFENDING WITHOUT ADDRESSING THAT HE NOW HAS VOLITIONAL CONTROL OVER HIS SEXUALLY ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR THROUGH HIS SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT AT THE STU.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A.Y.'S COMMITMENT IS IMPROPERLY BASED ON STATE EXPERTS' INADMISSABLE NET OPINION TESTIMONY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A.

Even though A.Y. was not diagnosed with a form of paraphilia, the State's experts diagnosed him with severe ASPD that affected him emotionally, cognitively, or volitionally so as to predispose him to engage in acts of sexual violence. Judge Freedman found the State's experts opined, credibly, that as a result of his personality disorder, it was highly likely that A.Y. would sexually reoffend if not confined to the STU for control, care, and treatment. We discern no basis to overturn his determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A.Y. argues the State's experts' testimony amounted to inadmissible net opinions because they gave no empirical basis for their conclusion that A.Y. was highly likely to reoffend. Pointing to the results of one actuarial instrument, A.Y. claims the State's experts provided no evidence he has more than a fifty-one percent risk of sexually reoffending. A.Y. asserts the State's experts failed to address the base rate of sexual recidivism among individuals similar to A.Y., noting one study found the overall sexual recidivism rate was only 13.5 percent. He also contends neither State expert described their methodology or showed any reliability in their findings.
