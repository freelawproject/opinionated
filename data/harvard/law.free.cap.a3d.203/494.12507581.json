(Feeley) on all claims by IRBA and reflecting the previous grant of summary judgment in favor of Feeley by that court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   IRBA avers that the hearing justice erred in holding that Feeley did not owe a duty of care to IRBA as a third-party with respect to what IRBA alleges was a negligently prepared report by Feeley, an accounting firm, on which IRBA posits it relied. Initially, IRBA argues that this Court should adopt the \"Restatement\n   Rule\" for assessing whether or not a duty exists \"between an accountant-auditor and an aggrieved third party * * *.\" It proceeds to contend that the hearing justice misapplied the Restatement Rule and thus erred in granting summary judgment in Feeley's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts in this case are largely undisputed. In setting forth those facts, we draw upon the bench decision of the hearing justice as well as other documents contained in the record. We shall summarize in chronological order the transactions which form the factual basis of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Feeley is an accounting firm that prepared audited annual financial statements for Capco Steel, LLC and Capco Endurance, LLC (collectively Capco). The report at issue in this case is the report prepared by Feeley for Capco for the year 2009 (the 2009 Audit Report). It is that report which IRBA contends it relied on and which it further contends was negligently prepared by Feeley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February of 2010, Webster Bank (Webster) agreed to provide Capco with a twenty million dollar revolving line of credit. As part of that agreement, Webster also agreed to make a six million dollar term loan to Capco by purchasing six million dollars of bonds from the Rhode Island Industrial Facilities Corporation. IRBA agreed to insure those bonds up to the amount of five million dollars. Accordingly, two separate transactions ensued-one for the line of credit and one for the bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March of 2010, the twenty million dollar line of credit involving Capco and Webster closed (the original line of credit transaction). Webster's \"Summary of Committed Terms and Conditions,\" which was given to Capco before the closing on that loan, included the requirement that Capco provide the bank over the course of the term of the loan \"annual CPA-prepared, audited consolidated financial statements * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April of 2010, after the original line of credit transaction closed but before the bond transaction involving IRBA closed, Feeley issued the 2009 Audit Report to Capco, wherein it indicated that Capco had earned a profit of $ 552,000 in 2009. Subsequently, on June 15, 2010, the bond transaction closed (the original bond transaction). Significantly, Capco did not provide IRBA with a copy of the 2009 Audit Report either at or before the closing on the original bond transaction, although a copy of the 2009 Audit Report was provided to IRBA sometime thereafter. Given that the basis of IRBA's case against Feeley is IRBA's alleged reliance on the purportedly negligently prepared 2009 Audit Report, it is undisputed that we are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   concerned in this action with IRBA's reliance on the 2009 Audit Report with respect to either the original line of credit transaction or the original bond transaction; IRBA could not have relied on a document it did not have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early 2011, Capco sought to extend its revolving line of credit to twenty-three and a half million dollars for a period of six months (the first \"overline\" request). In March of 2011, Capco and Webster requested IRBA's consent to the temporary extension, and IRBA did consent (the first credit increase). At that time, IRBA had been provided with the 2009 Audit Report. IRBA contends that it relied on the 2009 Audit Report in approving the first credit increase. Feeley's counsel agreed at oral argument before this Court that, for the purpose of the instant appeal, we need be\n   concerned only with IRBA's alleged reliance on the 2009 Audit Report with respect to the first credit increase; it is that transaction, and only that transaction, that is at issue in this case. Specifically, we must determine whether or not Feeley owed a duty of care to IRBA with respect to IRBA's alleged reliance on the 2009 Audit Report in consenting to the first credit increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June of 2011, Capco's relationship with Feeley had been terminated, and Capco eventually hired a different auditing firm. IRBA contends that the auditing firm that succeeded Feeley indicated that the 2009 Audit Report was erroneous and that Capco had actually lost approximately one and a half million dollars in 2009. Feeley does not concede that the 2009 Audit Report was erroneous or negligently prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August of 2011, a request was again made to IRBA to consent to a further extension of Capco's line of credit to over twenty-eight million dollars (the second \"overline\" request), and IRBA was also asked to subordinate its security interest to that of Webster. IRBA agreed to both requests (the second credit increase).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ultimately, in March of 2012, Capco failed to make required payments on the bonds, thus triggering IRBA's obligation as the insurer of five million dollars worth of the bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 1, 2013, IRBA filed the instant action against Capco, Feeley, and numerous other defendants. For the purposes of the instant appeal, we are concerned with IRBA's allegations of negligence only as they relate to Feeley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August of 2015, Feeley moved for summary judgment. In a January 15, 2016 order, the hearing justice granted the parties additional time for discovery until February 29, 2016, and he permitted Feeley to file a revised motion for summary judgment after February 29, 2016. In accordance with that order, on October 20, 2016, Feeley renewed its motion for summary judgment, which was predicated on its contention that it did not owe a duty to IRBA with respect to the 2009 Audit Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 3, 2017, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision granting Feeley's renewed motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice limited his decision to addressing the issue of whether or not Feeley owed a duty to IRBA as a matter of law. The hearing justice acknowledged that this Court had not as of then opined on what test should be applied to determine whether or not a duty exists between an accountant/auditor and a third party (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a person or entity that was not at the relevant point in time a client of the accountant/auditor). After referencing the three different tests employed by various other courts, the hearing justice chose to apply the one which he characterized as \"the Restatement approach\" (the Restatement rule), determining that it \"struck a proper balance * * *.\" The hearing justice detailed the Restatement rule as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 522 limits an accountant's liability for negligently prepared financial statements to loss incurred:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(a) [B]y the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance acts to supply the information * * * and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"(b) [T]hrough reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence * * * or in a substantially similar transaction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The hearing justice then concluded that the first credit increase and the second credit increase were \"non-substantially\n   similar\" to the original bond transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He noted that it was the original bond transaction that Feeley \"might have known of when it issued the 2009 audited financials.\" Thus, he then held that, under the Restatement rule, Feeley owed no duty to IRBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 10, 2017, an order entered granting Feeley's renewed motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, on April 27, 2017, judgment entered in Feeley's favor on all of IRBA's claims against it. IRBA filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A grant of a motion for summary judgment will be reviewed by this Court in a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   manner.\n   <em>\n    Newstone Development, LLC v.

The issue is whether or not, under the Restatement rule, when Feeley produced the 2009 Audit Report, it owed a duty to IRBA with respect to IRBA's use of that report in assessing and approving the first credit increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IRBA represents on appeal that it is undisputed that, pursuant to the language contained in \u00a7 (2)(a) of the Restatement rule, IRBA qualifies as a \"person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance\" Feeley intended to supply the 2009 Audit Report. Restatement (Second)\n   <em>\n    Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552 at 126-27 (1977). IRBA thus restricts the focus of its appellate argument to the language contained in \u00a7 (2)(b) of the Restatement rule. As such, it frames the issue on appeal as being the question of whether or not IRBA relied on the 2009 Audit Report \"in a transaction that [Feeley] intend[ed] the information to influence or [knew] that [Capco] so intend[ed] or in a substantially similar transaction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Specifically, with respect to satisfying that standard, IRBA posits that: (1) the hearing justice \"erroneously overlooked IRBA's claim that, because [Feeley] knew and intended that the 2009 audit report would be used by IRBA in making decisions during the term of the Transaction [at issue], [Feeley] may be held liable to IRBA;\" (2) the hearing justice \"erroneously concluded that [Feeley] had no duty to IRBA under * * * the Restatement Rule based on his finding that the [original line of credit and bond transactions] and the [first credit increase] were not 'substantially similar;' \" and (3) the hearing justice \"erroneously overlooked IRBA's claim that [Feeley] owed a duty to IRBA because [Feeley], intending to influence the [first credit increase], authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report for that purpose.\" We shall address each of IRBA's three contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Alleged Expected Use of the 2009 Audit Report during the \"[T]erm of the Transaction\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   IRBA's first contention on appeal is that the Restatement rule is satisfied in this case because Feeley \"knew and intended that the 2009 audit report would be used by IRBA in making decisions during the term of the Transaction,\" the latter five words referring to the duration of the original line of credit and bond transactions. IRBA stresses the \"wide-ranging\" business relationship between Feeley and Capco, and it asserts that \"it is reasonable to infer that [Feeley] knew when it issued the 2009 audit report that, by requiring Capco to provide Webster and IRBA with the most recent and annual audited financial statements during the term of the Transaction, Webster and IRBA would be relying on Capco's audited financial statements\n   (including the 2009 audit report) during the Transaction for the purpose of making business decisions concerning their respective interests in the Transaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In our opinion, IRBA's contention is unavailing. IRBA is, in essence, requesting that we apply the reasonable foreseeability rule in this case, which rule we have now rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . It was certainly reasonably foreseeable that IRBA might rely on the 2009 Audit Report for another transaction at some point during the life of the original line of credit and bond transactions. However, that is in our judgment not the proper standard to be applied in a case such as this one. Under the Restatement rule, we are concerned with whether the 2009 Audit Report was relied upon in a transaction which Feeley, at the time it released the report, \"intend[ed]\" the information to influence or \"kn[e]w[ ]\" the recipient so intended.

Accordingly, it is our role, as we review the hearing justice's grant of summary judgment in a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   manner, to discern whether there is evidence tending to show a genuine issue of material fact relative to whether or not the first credit increase was\n   <em>\n    substantially similar\n   </em>\n   to the original line of credit and bond transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In reviewing the issue of whether or not the transactions at issue in this case were substantially similar, we have been enlightened by the opinion of Judge Bruce Selya writing for the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Lapalme\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080221\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/35/#p40\">\n    258 F.3d at 40-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With respect to the first step in the analytical process, the record indicates that Feeley, in producing the 2009 Audit Report, would have reasonably perceived that it was undertaking a risk that IRBA would rely on the 2009 Audit Report in the bond transaction; the risk involved to IRBA in that transaction was the fact that it was assuming potential liability in the amount of five million dollars. In contrast, there is no basis in the record for concluding that Feeley could have reasonably perceived a risk that IRBA would thereafter agree to extend the line of credit, even temporarily. While it is true that the monetary amount of IRBA's risk as an insurer was not affected by the first credit increase, it is clear that increasing the line of credit increased the risk that IRBA would be called upon to make payment on the insured bonds (which appears to have been the reason why IRBA was called upon to approve the first credit increase).

However, IRBA has not succeeded in demonstrating that the variances in this case were not more than modest. It is true that the transactions in this case all involved a\n   line of credit and the same three parties-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , Capco, Webster, and IRBA-but \"[s]imply because transactions are of the same general nature (e.g., 'bonds') is not enough to render them substantially similar for purposes of the Restatement rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Lapalme\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11080221\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/35/#p40\">\n    258 F.3d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Feeley's Alleged \"Authorization\" of the Use of the 2009 Audit Report for the First Credit Increase Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IRBA further contends on appeal that \"[t]he motion justice erroneously overlooked IRBA's claim that [Feeley] owed a duty to IRBA because [Feeley], intending to influence the [first credit increase], authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report for that purpose.\" In other words, IRBA posits that, even if the first credit increase is viewed as a separate and not substantially similar transaction, a duty of care was nevertheless owed to IRBA because Feeley had \"authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report to the parties to the [first credit increase], knowing that it would be used to influence [the first credit increase transaction].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IRBA avers that the record reveals that Capco shared its request for the first credit increase with Feeley before submitting that request to Webster and IRBA and that Capco included in that request information from the 2009 Audit Report. IRBA states in its brief before this Court that Capco was required to provide a copy of the request for the first credit increase to Feeley in advance of submitting it to Webster and IRBA because of the terms of the \"Professional Services Agreement\" between Feeley and Capco. That agreement reads in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"If our report on the financial statements being audited is to be published in any manner or if you intend to make reference to [Feeley] in a publication of any type, you agree to submit proofs of the publication to us for review prior to such publication and cooperate with us in our performance of any additional audit procedures we deem necessary in the circumstances, the nature and extent of which will be at our sole discretion.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   IRBA then argues that the just-quoted language and other record evidence \"provide[ ] support for the liability-inducing inference and conclusion that [Feeley] authorized Capco to use the information contained in the 2009 audit report for the purpose of persuading Webster and IRBA to agree to Capco's * * * request [for the first credit increase].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We are once again unconvinced by IRBA's argument, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to it as the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newstone Development, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792200\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/100/#p103\">\n    140 A.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While we have taken into account the language in the \"Professional Services Agreement\" and the fact that Feeley was provided by Capco with an advance copy of the request for the first credit increase, those facts do\n   not provide a basis for the conclusion that there was an \"authorization\" by Feeley for Capco to use 2009 Audit Report data in its request for the first credit increase. Indeed, even if one accepted that every fact being represented by IRBA in its brief before this Court in support of this argument is accurate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Feeley's mere failure to notice that information from the 2009 Audit Report was contained in Capco's request for the first credit increase and/or to specifically object to the use of that information by Capco is not convincing. IRBA has not exhibited why such a chain of events even remotely rises to a level of \"authorization\" that should lead to Feeley being exposed to possible liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We note that IRBA relies on the case of\n   <em>\n    Reisman v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250607\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/100/\">\n    57 Mass.App.Ct. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=787%20N.E.2d%201060\">\n    787 N.E.2d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). In the course of holding that a claim for negligent misrepresentation could be maintained by a third party against the auditor in that case, the court emphasized the facts that the auditor \"actively participated in the transaction at issue,\" had a \"history of actively participating in such transactions,\" and had signed a written \"statement consenting to the incorporation in [a form for the Securities and Exchange Commission] of its earlier audited financial statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Reisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=787%20N.E.2d%201060\">\n    787 N.E.2d at 1076, 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the facts of the instant case are readily distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Reisman\n   </em>\n   since Feeley did not actively participate in the first credit increase transaction, and the record contains no written consent to the use of the information in the 2009 Audit Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Morever, the Restatement rule focuses on what Feeley knew at the time it produced the report, not on what it may have had knowledge of at some later date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nycal Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=688%20N.E.2d%201368\">\n    688 N.E.2d at 1372-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We would also emphasize the point that, as other courts have recognized, once a report is given to a client, the accountant/auditor may in actuality have little to no control over to whom that client actually chooses to disseminate the report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raritan River Steel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20S.E.2d%20609\">\n    367 S.E.2d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Auditors * * * have no control over the distribution of their reports, and hence lack control over their exposure to liability.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nycal Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=688%20N.E.2d%201368\">\n    688 N.E.2d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It should further be noted that the \"Professional Services Agreement\" upon which IRBA relies in support of its \"authorization\" argument in this case speaks only to the\n   <em>\n    publication\n   </em>\n   of any \"report [by Feeley] on the financial statements being audited;\" it certainly does not contain any sweeping statement with respect to Capco's being required to seek Feeley's approval for\n   <em>\n    any possible future use\n   </em>\n   of such a report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, in our opinion, IRBA's contention that Feeley owed it a duty of care in this case because Feeley \"authorized\" the use of the 2009 Audit Report to support\n   the request for the first credit increase is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We have carefully reviewed the record, and we have given due consideration to the well-presented arguments of the parties. In the final analysis, however, when the Restatement rule is applied to the case before us, it is our unhesitating judgment that the hearing justice did not err in holding that Feeley did not owe a duty of care to IRBA. For that reason, IRBA's negligence claim against Feeley cannot proceed, and summary judgment in Feeley's favor was appropriately granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. We remand the record to that tribunal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The instant appeal addresses only the plaintiff's contentions against defendant Feeley &amp; Driscoll, P.C. The other named defendants are not parties to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    We note that IRBA points to the fact that the hearing justice referenced both credit increases in making his determination as to substantial similarity pursuant to the Restatement rule, whereas, as IRBA notes, the second credit increase is not and was not at issue with respect to IRBA's negligence claim against Feeley. Even accepting IRBA's contention, that fact, in and of itself, does not constitute reversible error since we may affirm on grounds other than those relied upon by the hearing justice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller v.
