Hansley argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that the trial court erred by (1) denying his requested jury instruction on eyewitness identification and otherwise giving an inadequate instruction on the topic, and (2) instructing the jury in a way that overemphasized the definition of accomplice liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

Almost immediately after they arrived, one or both of them shot and killed Robert Kennedy and gravely injured Barry Jenkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kennedy suffered seven gunshot wounds ; one bullet perforated his aorta, killing him. Jenkins suffered six gunshot wounds, but survived after being rushed to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] On December 30, 2015, the Penobscot County grand jury returned two indictments arising from these events. The first indictment charged Hansley with one count of murder, 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 201(1)(A), and one count of elevated aggravated assault (Class A), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 208-B(1)(A). The second indictment charged Ferguson with the same crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hansley pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] The court conducted a seven-day jury trial in November and December of 2017. Jenkins was among the witnesses called by the State. He testified that both Hansley and Ferguson had \"pulled out\" guns, that he \"figured both of them [were] shooting,\" but that he did not know \"who shot who,\" and that he did not see Hansley shoot at him. At the conclusion of the testimonial portion of the trial, Hansley asked that the jurors be given a specific instruction on eyewitness identification so that they could appropriately weigh and consider Jenkins's testimony in light of the \"extremely high stress situation\" of the shooting. Although the court did not give the jury the precise instruction requested by Hansley, it did instruct the jurors that, in reviewing the testimony of all witnesses, they should consider-among other things-\"whether the witness was under stress, including the stress of the event being witnessed while observing the person or persons committing a crime ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] Hansley also argued that the evidence presented at trial did not generate an instruction on accomplice liability. When the court correctly responded that such an instruction\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   been generated by the evidence presented, Hansley then asked for some additional instructions on that issue. Although the court denied Hansley's specifically-requested instruction, it did instruct the jurors on the law concerning accomplice liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] The jury found Hansley guilty of both murder and elevated aggravated assault. The court entered a judgment on the verdict, imposing a forty-year term of imprisonment for the murder and a concurrent twenty-five-year term for the elevated aggravated assault. Hansley timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2018) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.

Additionally, Hansley's proposed instruction contained segments that would have amounted to the court commenting on the evidence: \"Even if you are convinced that the witness believes his or her identification is correct, you still must consider the possibility that the witness made a mistake in the identification.\" Although defense counsel may wish to so argue in closing statements, a court may not give such an instruction, as it could be seen as a comment on specific evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299436\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/38/1278/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is not a case involving an eyewitness who identifies a stranger: Jenkins knew Hansley and Ferguson before the shooting occurred, as did other eyewitnesses. Instead, this case, and Jenkins's testimony in particular, revolved around the issue of who shot Jenkins and Ferguson. Because of this, the court gave a more than adequate instruction on eyewitness identification; in fact, the court was not required to give such an instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahmoud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12194494\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/833/\">\n    2016 ME 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12194494\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/833/\">\n    147 A.3d 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We do not, however, conclude that the use of an eyewitness identification instruction is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   in every case involving an eyewitness identification.

Overall, the trial court's instructions to the jury were thorough, fair, and accurate.

Accomplice Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b615] Hansley also asserts that the trial court overemphasized accomplice liability in its instruction to the jury and that this had the effect of misleading the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b616] Pursuant to Maine law, \"[a] person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if ...

We disagree.

In its instruction to the jury, the court explained, on more than one occasion, that Hansley must have acted \"with the intent of promoting or facilitating\" the crime in order to be guilty under an accomplice theory.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b618] Lastly, Hansley contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for murder and elevated aggravated assault.
