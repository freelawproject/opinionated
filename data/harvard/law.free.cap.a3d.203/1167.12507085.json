Although we affirm the entry of summary judgment in this case, we hasten to add that, no matter the age of the child nor the severity of the injury, in light of the protections afforded by the Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32 (the RUS), there is no recourse in our courts, because users of most public parks are treated as trespassers under the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case came before the Supreme Court on December 6, 2018, on appeal by the plaintiff, Austin Yattaw (Yattaw or plaintiff), from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants (collectively the city or defendants).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff brought suit to recover damages for injuries he suffered while riding his bicycle in Glenlyon Park,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   located in East Providence (the park). For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 8, 2010, plaintiff, who was seventeen years old, was injured while riding his bicycle through the park. Presuming that he was riding down a grassy slope on the side of a stairway, plaintiff was unaware of a series of concrete retaining walls located on the slope. The plaintiff alleged he was thrown from his bicycle after his tire became wedged in a crack in one of the concrete retaining walls. As a result, plaintiff sustained a double compound fracture to his left arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 18, 2013, plaintiff filed suit, asserting that defendants were negligent in maintaining the park. Pretrial discovery proceeded; in its interrogatory answers, the city stated that there had been no previously reported injuries in that area of the park. During his deposition, John Arrighi (Arrighi), a city employee who performed routine maintenance work in the park, testified that at the end of each shift, city employees are required to prepare paper logs, which they call \"trip tickets,\" identifying the location and type of work performed during the shift. When shown a photograph of the area where plaintiff alleged that he had been injured, Arrighi confirmed that he did not observe the condition that was depicted in the photograph, and stated: \"If I saw this, I would have documented it on my trip ticket. * * * [S]o it would have [gone] to the correct channel so it would have been repaired.\" Arrighi testified that the trip tickets he personally filled out were \"a lot more extensive\" than a document, identified as an expenditure log, that he was shown during his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Also during discovery, the city produced \"Work Order Detail Reports\" (work orders) and \"Detailed Location Expenditures\" (expenditure reports), documenting the maintenance work performed at the park. The plaintiff subsequently made a discovery request for \"any and all daily work logs and trip tickets regarding any\n   work to be done, or that was done\" at the park, to which the city responded: \"Upon information and belief, none known.\" According to the city, it was not in possession of these logs, which are routinely destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 27, 2015, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the city was immune from liability under the RUS\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the park was open to the public for recreational purposes and the city did not act in a willful or malicious manner in failing to guard or warn against a known danger. The plaintiff filed an objection in which he contended that, under the doctrine of spoliation of evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the city's destruction of the trip tickets gave rise to an adverse inference-namely, that the city knew about the defective condition of the retaining wall. According to plaintiff, this negative inference was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an exception to the RUS applied in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 4, 2015, the motion for summary judgment was argued; and, in a bench ruling, a justice of the Superior Court determined that the only evidence before the court was \"speculation that there may have been trip-tickets that would have documented the hazard.\" Specifically, the hearing justice found that there was \"no evidence that these tickets were destroyed in an attempt to conceal something from the plaintiff\" and that there was \"no other evidence that anyone had any knowledge of this defect[.]\" Accordingly, the hearing justice concluded that \"the plaintiff has not put forward sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that would defeat the recreational use's strong standard and show that the town was aware there was a strong likelihood of injury in that park.\" The city's motion for summary judgment was therefore granted, and final judgment subsequently entered in favor of defendants. The plaintiff appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"This Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a trial justice's decision granting summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Rohena v.

To accomplish this purpose, the RUS as originally enacted provided that those who come upon the private land of another for recreational purposes are considered to be trespassers, \"thus greatly reducing the duty of care that owners owe to recreational users.\"\n   <em>\n    Symonds ex rel.

Thus, the city is immune from liability under the RUS. Before this Court, plaintiff contends that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the exception set forth in \u00a7 32-6-5(a)(1) applies in this case. The fragile premise upon which this appeal rests is the alleged spoliation of the trip tickets. The plaintiff asserts that, because the trip tickets may have contained detailed notes regarding the condition of the area where plaintiff had sustained injury, the city's alleged destruction of the trip tickets raised the adverse inference that the city knew about the defective condition of the wall and failed to guard or warn against it.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Mead I\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that the city routinely retained trip tickets in the regular course, nor is there any evidence that defendants tactically discarded only those trip tickets pertaining to plaintiff's accident. As noted by the hearing justice, \"[t]here's no evidence that these tickets were destroyed in an attempt to conceal something from the plaintiff.\" Rather, the record suggests that the information on the handwritten trip tickets was manually transcribed into computer-generated forms, such as the work orders and expenditure reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, defendants aptly note that the use of trip tickets as a means of gathering information that is then transcribed into the computer-generated work orders and expenditure reports \"provides more than a satisfactory explanation as to why the hand-written notes are not routinely kept by the [c]ity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because there is no evidence that the city acted deliberately, negligently, or in bad faith with regard to the trip tickets, the spoliation doctrine is inapplicable in this case. Accordingly, the hearing justice did not err in finding that the spoliation doctrine did not apply to the circumstances presented by this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    The \u00a7 32-6-5(a)(1) Exception to the RUS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even if the alleged destruction of the trip tickets warranted an application of the spoliation doctrine, this only permits the drawing of an inference that the city was on notice that the retaining wall had a defect and was in need of repair. However, notice of a defective condition alone is not enough to bring plaintiff's claim within the exception to the RUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff contends that the city's implied knowledge of a defect in the wall is sufficient to prove \"willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition * * * after discovering the user's peril[.]\" Section 32-6-5(a)(1). To support his argument, plaintiff asserts that, according to\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   , notice of a defective condition is sufficient to show willful and malicious conduct.

Furthermore, the record before us lacks any indication that defendants had actual knowledge of the condition, had received complaints about the surrounding area, or had notice of any past incidents resulting from the defective condition of the retaining wall.

In essence, the plaintiff asserts that the defective condition of the retaining wall placed him in a \"position of peril\" because it exposed him to a risk of harm. Nonetheless, because the plaintiff failed to raise this argument in the Superior Court, our raise-or-waive rule precludes us from addressing that contention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waterman v.
