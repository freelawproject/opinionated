The CRDA sought to condemn the Birnbaum property in furtherance of its mandate to promote tourism in Atlantic City. The property is located in the Atlantic City Tourism District, within the boundaries of the CRDA's South Inlet Mixed Use Development Project (Project), where the CRDA proposes private, economic redevelopment, including the construction of tourism-focused residential, retail, and commercial uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the decision under review, the CRDA had no specific redevelopment plans under consideration for the Project; it had not issued a request for proposals (RFP) to prospective developers, and no developer had committed to redeveloping within the Project area. Nevertheless, the CRDA maintains it had a right to \"bank\" the Birnbaum property for redevelopment at some unspecified time in the future. Atlantic County Assignment Judge Julio Mendez dismissed the condemnation complaint as a manifest abuse of power because the CRDA did not provide reasonable assurances that the proposed redevelopment would\n   come to fruition in the foreseeable future. The CRDA appeals from that judgment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Birnbaums cross-appeal from an earlier, November 17, 2014 determination that the condemnation was for a sufficiently specific public use and the Birnbaum property was reasonably included in the Project area. At that time the judge also held that the CRDA was taking the property to promote tourism and therefore was not required to comply with the Blighted Areas Clause of the New Jersey Constitution,\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. VIII, \u00a7 3, \u00b6 1. But, Judge Mendez found, in any event, the taking did comply with those requirements.

The CRDA described the Project as being \"constructed in phases that complement the new Revel Casino and assist with the demands created by the resort.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The CRDA also stated that \"[p]rior to implementation of the project,\" certain privately owned properties would have to be acquired, and addressed funding for the Project, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Prior to implementation of the project, land acquisition of sixty two (62) low rise units, and certain privately owned adjoining parcels including vacant and improved properties on Blocks 68, 70, and 72, acquisition of certain properties within Blocks 128 through 131, relocation, demolition and site remediation must\n   take place. The estimated real estate costs ... are ... up to $25 million.... Upon completion of acquisition and relocation, the CRDA staff will work with potential partners to develop the land for restaurant, residential and retail use. The source of funds will be the CRDA's Tourism District and Community Development Fund for initial professional fees ....\n   <em>\n    The balance of the needed funds will be derived from use of Revel investment obligations\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [ (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In June 2012, the CRDA formally approved the Project, by Resolution 12-82, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The [Project] serves the public interest, furthers the public purposes of the CRDA set forth in [ N.J.S.A. 5:12-160 ], and promotes the health or social or economic well-being of the people of the State and, in particular, of the residents of the local government unit affected by the project, and is therefore an approved project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By the same resolution, the CRDA authorized the Executive Director to acquire properties in the Project area through purchase or eminent domain, and approved a fund reservation for\n   pre-acquisition costs and fees in furtherance of the Project. On the same date, the CRDA adopted Resolution 12-83, permitting it to negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, related to funding of the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In various meeting notes and resolutions from May and June 2012, the CRDA acknowledged the Revel Casino's deep involvement in the Project: the CRDA anticipated entering into a public-private partnership agreement with the Revel Casino; the casino had \"presented to the CRDA and other Atlantic City stakeholders certain conceptual plans for improvement of the Atlantic City Inlet Neighborhood Strategy Area, which plans may serve as a possible template for potential future development of the Inlet District\"; and funds for the Project were to be generated by receipts from the Revel Casino, with the Revel Economic Redevelopment and Growth Grant incentive viewed as \"an innovative use of anticipated future tax revenues from a casino project to complete an otherwise stranded development project and to fund needed infrastructure and community enhancements in the South Inlet area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Birnbaum Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Birnbaum property is a three-story building located at Block 72, Lot 3 in Atlantic City, within the Project area, between the Revel Casino and the Absecon Lighthouse. On CRDA maps, the Birnbaum property is located in a \"land bank area\" slated for \"future development.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Abe Birnbaum and Dora Rotstein purchased the property in 1969. Upon Abe's death in 1987, Dora transferred ownership of the property to their son, Charles Birnbaum, and his wife Lucinda. Dora continued to reside on the first floor of the home with a live-in companion, and Charles rented out the two upper floors. Dora lived there until November 1998, when she and her companion were killed during a home invasion. Since his mother's death, Charles has continued to rent out the upper floors of the property. He uses the first floor as a base of operations for his piano tuning business, a piano studio, and a memorial to his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Birnbaum property is one of the last buildings left on its block. The land across the street has been primarily vacant for the past fifteen-to-eighteen years. In June 2013, the CRDA attempted to acquire the Birnbaum property through negotiation, offering $238,500. The Birnbaums\n   disputed the CRDA's authority to take their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In February 2014, the CRDA filed a verified complaint in condemnation, seeking a judgment that the CRDA had duly exercised its power of eminent domain, and asking the judge to appoint condemnation commissioners to make a just and equitable appraisal of the Birnbaum property. The judge ordered the CRDA to deposit the $238,500 anticipated just compensation into the court. The Birnbaums moved for a plenary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In opposing the motion, the CRDA advised the judge that properties, including the Birnbaum property, were being acquired for the Project \"to assemble a development-ready parcel of land ... to spark the statutorily required investment in the Tourism District.\" The CRDA had a redevelopment concept, but no specific plans, nor any agreements with developers. Rather, at an unspecified time, after a \"massing plan\" had been approved by the CRDA's Board, the CRDA would put the Project out for public bid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Counsel for the Birnbaums filed a supplemental certification, advising of a bankruptcy filing by the Revel Casino. Counsel argued that the bankruptcy placed in doubt the CRDA's plans for the Project and undermined its justification for condemning the Birnbaum property. In a June 2014 order, the judge denied the Birnbaums' motion for a plenary hearing and allowed the case to proceed in a summary fashion. In a November 17, 2014 order, the judge granted the CRDA's application to exercise its power of eminent domain, and denied the Birnbaums' motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Birnbaums filed a motion for reconsideration, advising the judge that on November 12, 2014, the Governor's Advisory Commission on New Jersey Gaming, Sports, and Entertainment had issued a report proposing major changes to the Atlantic City Tourism District and to the CRDA's funding and authority. The report recommended: redirecting and reallocating certain funds away from the CRDA in order to meet the city's pressing needs; funding a new not-for-profit development company, the Atlantic City Development Corp., with a mission that would include serving as a land bank, acquiring blighted properties and demolishing existing structures, as well as planning, financing, and developing mixed-use redevelopment projects; having the CRDA assume responsibility for zoning, planning, and code enforcement in Atlantic City; concentrating revitalization efforts into five key areas of Atlantic City, which did not appear to include the Birnbaum property; and expanding the Tourism District to include the entire city of Atlantic City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The judge in part granted the motion for reconsideration. He maintained his rulings that a valid public purpose existed for taking the Birnbaum property (\"promoting tourism and assisting the ailing gaming industry\"), and the CRDA had provided sufficient specificity regarding the proposed use for the Birnbaum property through its Tourism District Master Plan and description of the Project. But, Judge Mendez found that \"there must be a reasonable assurance that the proposed plans will be implemented.\" He reasoned: \"[O]ur Legislature did not intend, and the Constitution does not permit, property to be acquired and to remain idle indefinitely, without a reasonable assurance that the proposed plan to justify the taking will be implemented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Given the proposed legislation that would reduce the CRDA's revenue, as well as the dire economic situation in Atlantic City, the Revel Casino bankruptcy, and\n   several unsuccessful past efforts to revitalize the South Inlet area in which the Birnbaum property is located, the judge was concerned that the CRDA was unprepared to proceed with the Project, and it was no longer viable. In August\n   2015, the judge gave the CRDA six months to submit a certification after reevaluating \"the feasibility of the proposed project\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [T]he CRDA is not authorized to condemn the Birnbaum property until the [c]ourt has reasonable assurances that the proposed use, justifying the taking of the Birnbaum property, will be implemented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In April 2016, at the request of the CRDA, the judge held a hearing, taking testimony from John Palmieri, Executive Director of the CRDA, Mary Rixey, the CRDA's Director of Real Estate and Development, Paul Weiss, Chief Legal Officer for the CRDA, Lance Landgraf, the Director of Planning at the CRDA, and Charles Birnbaum, who testified regarding his ownership and use of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Palmieri and Rixey testified that the CRDA works within the Tourism District boundaries \"to focus on traditional redevelopment activities, acquisition, remediation, installation of infrastructure, assemblage of parcels for private sector development, supporting programming having to do with public relations and events, and in maintaining a clean and safe environment for the District ....\" The CRDA also owns and manages the Convention Center and Boardwalk Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding the Project, Palmieri, Rixey and Weiss testified that the CRDA installed parks and roadway improvements, but primarily assembled property for later disposition through public-private partnership activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 5:12-233 (authorizing CRDA to enter into public-private partnerships). Once the property is assembled, the CRDA plans to \"encourage mixed use development,\" including retail, restaurants, and housing, with the goal of \"reclaim[ing] a District that hasn't seen any investment, very little, over the past 40 or 50 years, and to create a new neighborhood with those kinds of mixed uses that would make it vibrant and create jobs, and improve property values.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   According to Palmieri, Rixey and Weiss, the CRDA already had dedicated funding for the land assemblage phase of the Project. Therefore, any future changes in the CRDA's funding sources would not affect its ability to complete that phase, and the sole\n   remaining parcel to be acquired and demolished was the Birnbaum property. On cross-examination, Palmieri admitted that initially the Project had been intended to complement the Revel Casino, with the casino providing a revenue source. The Revel Casino, however, ceased operations in September 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Palmieri and Weiss further admitted that the CRDA's expenditures of funds for redevelopment was not limited to the acquisition and massing of land. The CRDA also used funds to \"incentivize\" development, which would be relevant to the next stage of the Project, when the CRDA would solicit developers' proposals and work on a disposition program, using its draft massing plan. The CRDA Board had not yet approved the draft massing plan, which had not been altered since May 2014, when the Revel Casino was still operating. The CRDA had engaged in discussions with potential developers and prepared a draft RFP. However, the \"RFP process was essentially put on hold given the pendency of this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In August 2016, Judge Mendez denied the CRDA's application to condemn the Birnbaums' property, and dismissed the complaint. The judge found that the CRDA's statutory condemnation authority is not unlimited. He found the CRDA is\n   not authorized under N.J.S.A. 5:12-182\"to bank land in the hopes that it will be used in a future undefined project,\" and \"the CRDA is not empowered to condemn a property only to have it sit idly, potentially for years on end, as they wait for [the] right project to present itself.\" While the judge acknowledged the CRDA's \"good intentions\" for redevelopment, he found that the CRDA had \"only an idea\" and a \"conceptual plan\" for the Project. It had no viable plan that was \"likely to occur within the foreseeable future.\" Rather, the CRDA was \"banking land in the hopes of attracting a developer at some future point in time,\" but no such project currently existed. On the record presented, there was no reasonable assurance that the Birnbaum property would be \"put to a public use within the next year or the next ten years.\" Thus, the judge found that the proposed taking was unjustified.\n   The judge's opinion was informed by the location of the Birnbaum property, Atlantic City's unprecedented financial downturn, and the CRDA's past failures to develop Inlet properties it had taken in condemnation. The judge found the Birnbaum property was located in an area of the city particularly hard hit by the economic downturn, near two shuttered casinos. It had been the site of \"many failed revitalization attempts,\" such that \"many of the surrounding properties ... sit vacant waiting for a project to come forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The judge also noted that the CRDA's statutory authority to bank land under N.J.S.A. 5:12-182 had been driven by the Legislature's concern over land speculation and inflated property values. Those issues were not present with property values in Atlantic City decreasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the judge noted recently passed legislation, which added to the uncertainty surrounding the Project. In particular, the CRDA had lost a portion of its funding, with the investment alternative tax diverted away from the CRDA to the city.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 52:27BBBB-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The money available for the CRDA to proceed with the Project, which \"may still require additional funds\" to incentivize development, was now limited, which would make \"it more difficult to attract developers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ultimately, the judge concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [T]he [c]ourt holds that the CRDA has not provided reasonable assurances to justify the taking of the Birnbaums' property. The [c]ourt finds that based on the current unprecedented financial crisis in Atlantic City, the unique location of the Birnbaums' property, the history of unsuccessful economic development projects in this area of Atlantic City, [and] the lack of any specific and viable plans of the use of this property ... the CRDA's decision to condemn the Birnbaums' property is a manifest abuse of the eminent domain power and ... is not consistent with the statutory condemnation authority of the CRDA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Condemnation issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The CRDA argues that it satisfied its burden of proof on its right to condemnation by establishing a public purpose for the taking and providing due process and just compensation to the Birnbaums. It argues the judge erred by requiring assurances that the Birnbaum property would be put to public use within a reasonable period of time. Under the CRDA's reading of N.J.S.A. 5:12-182, it is empowered to condemn property for future public use\n   unfettered by court consideration of whether or when the proposed redevelopment will occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Alternatively, the CRDA contests the judge's factual finding that the Project is unlikely to proceed in the foreseeable future.

In addition, in the interim between the CRDA's filing of the condemnation complaint and the judge's decision, statutory changes altered the financing of the CRDA, and reduced or eliminated key funding sources the CRDA relied on to \"incentivize\" private investors to commit to the redevelopment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Under these highly unusual circumstances, it was reasonable for the judge to question whether the Project would proceed in the foreseeable future when determining whether the proposed condemnation constituted a manifest abuse of the CRDA's condemnation authority.
