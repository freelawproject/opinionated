The Commission May Not Depart From the Allocation Structure in the Amended ECIIFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   AOBA contends that, ECIIFA notwithstanding, the Commission had discretion to address subsidization issues when allocating undergrounding costs and that it should have done so in this instance. However, the Commission recognized in Order Nos. 19167 and 19237 that the allocation of costs had been fixed in the \"unequivocal statutory directive\" of the amended ECIIFA. It had \"no authority to alter the statutorily mandated allocation structure in the context of this proceeding\"-the allocation of costs \"must be in accordance with the allocation approved in Pepco's most recent base rate case.\" Because the proposed charges complied with the allocation structure in the amended ECIIFA, the Commission found that they were \"just and reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   AOBA disputes the Commission's view that it has no discretion to alter the allocation structure approved in Pepco's most recent base rate case. But this issue has already been litigated and decided. As explained above, this court ruled in the prior appeal that the statute \"[did] not leave room for the Commission in the undergrounding proceedings to independently address issues of subsidization.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768749\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/925/#p929\">\n    129 A.3d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That assertion is mistaken. In the prior case, AOBA asked us to remand so the Commission could determine the impact of the amended statute's definition of \"distribution service customer class cost allocations.\" This court explained that remand was \"pointless\" because \"the amendment unambiguously adopted what the Commission had already done in the orders under review [and] [i]t is highly implausible that the Commission would do anything on remand other than reaffirm the conclusion it had already reached.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768749\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/925/#p929\">\n    129 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   933 (citing\n   <em>\n    Le Chic Taxicab Co. v.

To make such an amendment, an act passed by the Council must be ratified by a majority of voters through a referendum.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-203.03\">\n    D.C.

The core of Petitioner's argument is that the independence of the Public Service Commission is protected by the Charter and that the amended 2017 ECIIFA is invalid because it purports to change the authority of the Commission to allocate costs. Petitioner asserts that the Council has in effect amended the Charter without submitting that question to the voters in a referendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Commission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Congress created the Public Utilities Commission in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 1913, which assigned various responsibilities and functions to the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Stat.%20974\">\n    37 Stat. 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. 150, \u00a7 8, par. 1, 97 (1913).

While erecting the structure of Home Rule government for the District, the Charter preserved the Commission and briefly described its function.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   There shall be a Public Service Commission whose function shall be to insure that every public utility doing business within the District of Columbia is required to furnish service and facilities reasonably safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable.

Code \u00a7 1-204.93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012 Repl.). The second and third sentences of Section 493 were taken from the second paragraph of the Public Utilities Act of 1913.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Stat.%20974\">\n    37 Stat. 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. 150, \u00a7 8, par. 2 (1913).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The enactment of Section 493 did more than simply continue the Commission in existence, however. By placing this provision in the Charter, Congress insulated Section 493 from repeal or amendment by ordinary legislation of the Council. In the Charter, Congress also designated the Commission as one of five Independent Agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Stat.%20774\">\n    87 Stat. 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 491-95 (1973). AOBA asserts that the Council's \"allocation of Undergrounding Charges conflicts with the Commission's independent and exclusive obligation to 'insure' that 'every' charge levied by Pepco is just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.\" In other words, AOBA says, \"the Council has fundamentally altered the function of the Commission and this fundamental alteration, in turn, has violated the Charter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although the brief of the District of Columbia takes an expansive view of the Council's power in the field of utility regulation, it acknowledges that, by placing Section 493 in the Charter, Congress \"preclude[d] the Council, by ordinary legislation ..., from abolishing the Commission or altering its basic functions of ensuring that public utilities 'furnish service and facilities reasonably safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable.' \" Pepco agrees that \"the Council might run afoul of [\u00a7 493] if it eliminated the PSC or vested the PSC's 'function' of regulating utilities in some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But ECIIFA did not change a single word of Section 493, so the question presented here is whether there has been a \"constructive\" amendment of this Charter provision. AOBA's arguments in favor of that conclusion depend in large part on a misguided view of what it means to be an \"independent\" agency. Congress and state legislatures routinely specify how independent agencies must go about their work. Focusing on the local scene, the three sentences of Section 493 have never been deemed sufficient to govern the complex field of utility regulation. Even a brief review of the D.C. Code demonstrates that the Commission does not work in isolation, without direction or assistance from the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Public Utilities Act of 1913 granted the Commission its ratemaking authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Stat.%20974\">\n    37 Stat. 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. 150, \u00a7 8, par. 24, 38-45 (1913).

While this opinion is not binding on us, the District Court's analysis is helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Impact of ECIIFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the legislation at issue here. In a \"base rate case\" the Commission identifies how much revenue Pepco requires and decides how to allocate that requirement between Pepco's customer classes, commercial and residential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768749\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/925/#p929\">\n    129 A.3d at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case is about a surcharge, not the base rate itself, but the process is similar, addressing both cost and allocation. We do not attach any significance to the term \"surcharge\" because Section 493 requires the \"charge\" made by a public utility to be \"reasonable, just, and nondiscriminatory,\" seemingly encompassing both rates and surcharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although the Undergrounding Project carries a hefty price tag, AOBA asserts that \"[w]hether Pepco facilities will or will not be relocated underground is not at issue in this appeal.\" Moreover, we are told, \"[t]his appeal ... is not about the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the Undergrounding Charges,\n   but about the\n   <em>\n    allocation\n   </em>\n   of [those charges].\" But Petitioner admits that its long-range concern is more comprehensive. AOBA clarifies that its challenge to the 2017 ECIIFA is targeted at \"the impact of the cost allocation provisions on the Commission's\n   <em>\n    ratemaking\n   </em>\n   authority.\" It fears that if we approve the legislation at issue here, \"the elected Council, in the name of expediency, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, - or more disturbing[,] for purely political reasons - will now be able to enact legislation mandating not only cost allocations, but the establishment of specific rates to be charged for utility services.\" Nothing we say today is intended to endorse that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nevertheless, resolving this case does not require us to explore the outer limits of the Council's authority to regulate public utilities. We focus, instead, on the immediate, practical effect of the legislative directive. By statute, and for good reason, decisions in undergrounding cases are to be expedited.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2034-1313.09\">\n    D.C.

The modest effect of the ECIIFA amendments is to streamline procedure by precluding constant relitigation of allocation issues in both base rate cases (which may occur every year) and undergrounding proceedings (every two years). In the Commission's own view, the purpose of ECIIFA's requirements \"is not to undermine the Commission's independent ratemaking authority, but to build in the administrative efficiencies needed to facilitate timely implementation of a project of this scale and importance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is important to recognize that the Council has not dictated an allocation of its own design, but rather has instructed the Commission to apply the allocation that\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   adopted in the most recent base rate proceeding. Furthermore, that allocation is transitory. The Commission is free to change the allocation of those costs in subsequent base rate cases. As we noted in the previous appeal, the Commission's allocation of costs in future base rate cases \"could well affect the allocation of costs in future orders issued in connection with the undergrounding project.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768749\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/129/925/#p929\">\n    129 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   934 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-1313.01\">\n    D.C.

Nor, for the reasons explained, does it usurp the function of the Commission. We therefore hold that the cost allocation provisions of ECIIFA do not violate the Home Rule Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. AOBA's Due Process Rights Were Not Violated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   AOBA asserts that its due process rights were violated when the Commission denied an evidentiary hearing. As a general matter, the Commission is required to hold a hearing if there is a dispute concerning a material fact, but not if the only dispute involves issues of law or policy.\n   <em>\n    Watergate East, Inc. v. District of Columbia Public Serv. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7865383\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/662/881/#p890\">\n    662 A.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890 (D.C. 1995). More specifically, when it considers an undergrounding plan or a related application for financing, a \"formal evidentiary hearing shall be required only if contested issues of material fact are present and those issues cannot be resolved by the Commission based on the pleadings and discovery responses filed, if\n   any, in the matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-1313.03\">\n    D.C.

In addition, the Commission noted that these issues had already been litigated in\n   <em>\n    Formal Case Nos. 1139\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    1116\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   AOBA also contends it was a due process violation to deny an evidentiary hearing to address a directive in which the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") initially told federal agencies not to pay the undergrounding charges. This turned out to be a false alarm. GSA pointed out in its amicus brief to this court that \"federal agencies are paying those charges, subject to GSA's objection to the DDOT Surcharge and a reservation of rights to further contest the surcharge.\" Whatever the effect of that \"objection\" and \"reservation\" may be, it seems that federal agencies were paying the charges and that they continue to do so. There was no \"shortfall\" in collections that would have to be made up by commercial customers. Furthermore, the statute makes clear what should happen in such circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-1313.14\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 34-1313.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) (2018 Supp.). There was no need for an evidentiary hearing on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   AOBA's argument that the Commission applied an incorrect standard in determining that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing is misguided. The Commission's decision was not a \"summary dismissal,\" and the standards for granting summary judgment in a civil case did not apply. Indeed, the ECIIFA provides its own standard for determining whether the Commission should hold a hearing before deciding the issues on their merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-1313.03\">\n    D.C.

When it did address the merits, the Commission gave reasoned consideration to each of the issues\n   raised by AOBA and explained its decision in its Order. The record thus refutes AOBA's claim that it was denied due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Additional Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Two additional issues deserve only brief mention. GSA, as\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   , argues that the Commission's decision to incorporate records from the previous undergrounding proceedings violated due process rights. However, GSA is not a party to this appeal and AOBA did not raise this claim in its statement of issues presented or the argument section of its initial brief to this court. \"[A]n amicus curiae must take the case as he finds it, with the issues made by the principal parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Givens v.

In any event, neither GSA nor AOBA has identified a single document that was incorporated into the record of\n   <em>\n    Formal Case No. 1145\n   </em>\n   and relied upon by the Commission in violation of their due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   AOBA complains that the Commission's public interest finding is not supported by substantial evidence, but it did not present this complaint to the Commission in its Applications for Reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-604\">\n    D.C.
