We dismiss as moot the defendant's jurisdictional challenge with respect to the standing of LaFountain. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal concerns activities conducted on real property known as 61 Arrow Road in Wethersfield (property) that at all relevant times was owned by the defendant. The property is located in the \"Business Park (BP)\" zoning district and is approved for office and industrial use. Principal and accessory uses permitted in the BP zone are specified in \u00a7\u00a7 5.2 and 5.3, respectively, of the Wethersfield Zoning Regulations (regulations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At all relevant times, LaFountain served as the town's zoning enforcement officer. In that capacity, he acted as the agent of the town's Planning and Zoning Commission (commission). See\n   <em>\n    Piquet\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20173\">\n    306 Conn. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20977\">\n    49 A.3d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"[t]he zoning enforcement officer acts as the agent of the local planning and zoning commission\"); Wethersfield Zoning Regs., art. X, \u00a7 10.3.A.1 (\"[t]hese Regulations shall be enforced by the Zoning Enforcement Official as the Commission's duly authorized agent for enforcement of these Regulations\"). By letter dated November\n   18, 2015, LaFountain issued a cease and desist order (order) to the defendant regarding certain activities on the property. That order\n   stated in relevant part: \"This letter is to inform you that [the property] is in violation of the [regulations]. Section 5.2.H.5 ... states that 'trucking or freight operations with complete visual screening of equipment and materials' requires a Special Permit from the [commission]. Other commercial vehicles on the property must be accessory to uses within the offices and industrial bays. You are hereby ordered to\n   <em>\n    Cease and Desist\n   </em>\n   allowing trucking or freight operations to be permitted on the property. You may either appeal this order to the Zoning Board of Appeals or comply within [fifteen] days of receipt.... If you wish to maintain the trucking or freight operations, a Special Permit would be required from the [commission]. Failure to comply with this order will leave this Department no alternative but to begin issuing [$ 100] Citations for every day the property is in violation.... In addition to any fines or penalties imposed therein, the applicable section(s) of the [regulations] may be enforced by injunctive procedure in the Superior Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 2, 2015, the defendant filed an appeal of that order with the town's Zoning Board of Appeals (board). The \"appeal application\" form completed by the defendant asks applicants to \"[p]lease describe your appeal (please include your documentation backing up your appeal).\" In response to that query, the defendant attached a document that enumerated nine distinct grounds of appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the board could hold a public\n   hearing on the matter, the defendant formally withdrew its appeal of the order by letter dated January 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When activities allegedly continued on the property in contravention of the order, the plaintiffs commenced the present action pursuant to \u00a7 8-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The basis of that action was twofold in nature. First, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant violated \u00a7 5.2.H.5 of the regulations due to \"ongoing 'trucking or freight operations' at the [p]roperty without the required special permit ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant violated the regulations by permitting the parking and storage of commercial vehicles on the property that \"were not accessory to any use by a tenant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to those two grounds, the plaintiffs specifically alleged that \"the current violations of the [r]egulations at the [p]roperty include: [a] an illegal trucking and freight operation; [b] the parking and storage of several commercial vehicles that are not associated with any business operating at this [p]roperty; [c] the frequent ingress and egress of tractor trailers, truck tractors, semitrailers, and/or other large commercial vehicles to-from the [p]roperty, including such vehicles that are not associated with any tenant; [d] the illegal parking of tractor trailers, truck tractors, semitrailers, and/or other large commercial vehicles at the [p]roperty for compensation.\" The plaintiffs further alleged that those violations constituted \"a public nuisance due to the presence of and traffic created by tractor trailers, truck tractors, semitrailers, and/or other large commercial vehicles, and the emission or odors and noise.\" In their prayer for relief, the plaintiffs requested, inter alia, injunctive relief ordering the defendant to cease and desist from the aforementioned activities, a civil penalty of $ 2500, a civil fine to be imposed on a daily basis \"until the violations are remedied,\" and an award of costs and attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 23, 2016, the defendant filed its answer, in which it denied that any of the alleged violations had transpired on the property. The defendant also raised\n   six special defenses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the plaintiffs denied\n   in their entirety. Days later, the case was transferred by order of the court to the land use litigation docket in the judicial district of Hartford pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-347b (a). On June 27, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a certificate of closed pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the filing of the defendant's answer, the plaintiffs had filed a motion in limine, in which they sought to preclude \"all evidence, whether testimonial or documentary, pertaining to any issue which was included in the defendant's appeal of the [order], which appeal was filed with the [board] but withdrawn prior to an evidentiary hearing by that municipal board.\" In that motion, the plaintiffs argued that, \"[h]aving failed to first proceed with an available administrative process provided ... by statute, the defendant should not be permitted to present any such evidence or argument in this case.\" Relying principally on\n   <em>\n    Greenwich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kristoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951450\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/180/575/\">\n    180 Conn. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=430%20A.2d%201294\">\n    430 A.2d 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), the plaintiffs claimed that \"[s]ince the defendant chose to withdraw its [board] appeal of the [order] prior to that evidentiary hearing, this court should prohibit the defendant from now asserting [its] purported defenses in this zoning\n   enforcement litigation.\" By order dated October 13, 2016, the court ruled that \"[t]he issues in the motion [in limine] will be taken up at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A two day court trial was held in January, 2017. At its outset, the court addressed the motion in limine. The court explained that it was granting the motion insofar as the defendant sought to present evidence on special defenses that had been raised in the defendant's appeal to the board. The court nonetheless advised the parties that it would consider such evidence to the extent that it was relevant to the balancing of the equities inherent in injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, more than 100 exhibits were admitted into evidence, including dozens of photographs depicting what generically may be described as commercial trucks parked on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, two witnesses testified-LaFountain and John A. Tartaglia, the manager and 1 percent owner of the defendant. In his testimony, Tartaglia explained that the property was 5.5 acres in size and contained a 41,000 square foot building (building) \"divided into twelve commercial bays and an office wing ....\" He also testified that the property contained three parking lots located on the northerly, easterly, and southerly sides of the building. Tartaglia indicated that the northerly parking lot located to the rear of the building was only partially paved; the\n   remainder was gravel. The majority of the photographs admitted into evidence depict commercial trucks parked on that rear lot.\n   In his testimony, LaFountain confirmed that the order was issued in response to the presence of those trucks on the property. LaFountain testified that he had received multiple complaints about that issue, including a written complaint from a neighbor who resided at an abutting condominium complex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, Tartaglia admitted in his testimony that \"there were trucks parking on the property ... that were not tenants of physical space in the building, but would park trucks in the back, licensed commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles by definition would include any tractor-trailer or object that has a commercial plate in the state of Connecticut. I do not deny this.\" In its memorandum decision, the court found that Tartaglia had \"devised [a] 'tag' system ... to allow nonbuilding tenants to store trucks on [the] property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citation omitted.)\n   The court emphasized that the defendant's rent rolls, which also were admitted into evidence, documented various \"enterprises storing trucks [on the property that were] not renting space within the buildings,\" including \"a large number of Budget trucks\" that are plainly visible in the photographs in evidence. At trial, Tartaglia admitted that only three of the thirteen tenants with parking privileges listed on the defendant's September, 2015 rent roll were renting office or industrial space in the building at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court also was presented with evidence, which it acknowledged in its memorandum of decision, that subsequent to the issuance of the order, Tartaglia sought to enter into lease agreements with tenants that were not renting space in the building. The deposition testimony of Melissa Ahmetovic was admitted as a full exhibit at trial. In that testimony, Ahmetovic confirmed that she operated a business with her husband known as M&amp;A Express Transport, LLC, a \"trucking company\" that transported goods across the country. In 2015, M&amp;A Express Transport, LLC, began renting space from the defendant to store its trucks on the property. Ahmetovic testified that, after LaFountain issued the order, Tartaglia contacted her and \"said that he's going to make out a lease agreement stating that [Ahmetovic had] an office in there, there will be an office ... on the last floor of the building ... just in case the [plaintiff] comes after him, to state that [she did] have an office there, that [she does] work and everything, just\n   in case if the town comes after him.\" Appended to that deposition as an exhibit was a document titled \"Office Lease\" that identified Ahmetovic and her husband as the tenant, and described the use as \"General Office Use\" for which \"Overnight Parking\" was permitted, commencing on December 1, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ahmetovic testified that she never\n   asked to rent office space on the property and thereafter never used an office on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Tartaglia professed a lack of knowledge about the actual operations conducted on the property or the specific tenants that were storing trucks thereon, the court expressly found that testimony not credible in its memorandum of decision. Tartaglia also admitted in his testimony that he had forbidden the town's zoning enforcement officers from entering the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, the parties offered contrasting interpretations of \u00a7 5.2.H.5 of the regulations. Tartaglia opined that the phrase \"trucking or freight operations,\" as used in that regulation, did not apply to the mere parking and storage of commercial vehicles, but rather required an active trucking operation to be conducted on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tartaglia testified that his interpretation was predicated on his \"years involved in the real estate business\" and conceded that he did not examine any of the resources specified in \u00a7 2.2.B of the regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his testimony, LaFountain stated that he had consulted those resources and also noted that \u00a7 2.3.C of the regulations contains a definition of the term \"commercial vehicle,\" which includes \"box trucks\" and \"tractor trailers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reviewing those resources, LaFountain concluded that \"a trucking or a freight operation essentially is an activity where the main\n   operation is the transportation of materials using trucks. If your business is using trucks to move materials or freight ... it's a trucking or freight operation.\" LaFountain also emphasized that \"the parking of trucks is ... a very large facet of a trucking operation.... [W]hen you have a truck storage yard, for lack of a better term, it's where the primary piece of equipment that you use in a trucking operation is being stored.\" For that reason, he concluded that the parking and storage of commercial vehicles by entities engaged in the transportation of goods constituted \"trucking or freight operations\" on the property, for which a special permit was required pursuant to \u00a7 5.2.H.5 of the regulations. LaFountain further opined that the parking and storage of commercial trucks by tenants that were not engaged in a principal industrial or office use on the property could not be deemed an accessory use under the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its April 20, 2017 memorandum of decision, the court found that the plaintiffs had \"clearly proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is engaging in a trucking or freight operation without a special permit in violation of the town's zoning regulations. Notwithstanding Tartaglia's protestations and his\n   allowed testimony on equitable considerations, there is no evidence that weighs in the defendant's favor.\" The court thus granted the plaintiffs' request for permanent injunctive relief and ordered: \"[T]he defendant must comply with the town's regulations. If it seeks to conduct such trucking and freight operations on the property, it must first obtain a special permit to do so in accordance with the town's zoning regulations. Hence, all trucking operations not associated with a specific tenant business use on the property ... or any trucking and freight operations being conducted without a special permit must immediately cease. Further, in accordance with \u00a7 8-12, this court imposes a civil fine of $ 2500 for the violation of the cease and desist order as well as a civil fine of $ 50 per day from January 22, 2016, to the date of this order, together with costs and attorney's fees to be established at a hearing at a later date.\" In addition, the court noted that \"[t]o the extent there is a question on an accessory use, this court will retain jurisdiction.\" From that judgment, the defendant appealed to this court on May 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for contempt with the trial court, alleging in relevant part that the defendant \"continues to operate trucking or freight operations on the property, and continues to allow the parking or storage of trucks without a special permit in violation of the [regulations] and in violation of this court's order that [it] immediately cease the illegal activity.\" The defendant filed an objection to that motion, and the court held a hearing on July 6, 2017. By memorandum of decision dated August 18, 2017, the court granted the motion for contempt, finding that \"the testimony and the evidence is clear that the subject violations still exist.\" The court then expressly \"deferred the issue of monetary penalties\" while the underlying matter was on appeal, but noted that \"[t]he evidence\n   from this proceeding will be included in that evaluation.\" The defendant thereafter filed an amended appeal with this court to encompass the trial court's ruling on the motion for contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant claims that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in two respects. It first alleges that \"because [the] plaintiff[s] did not plead an accessory use violation, the court erred in making findings and retaining jurisdiction thereon.\" The defendant also argues that LaFountain\n   lacked standing to sue on behalf of himself or the town. Those contentions are equally unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it....

Only three sections of the regulations specifically address that activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first two deal with accessory use. Section 3.5.5, which is part of the section of the regulations addressing accessory uses in residential zones, specially permits the parking of one commercial vehicle in a residential district, subject to certain requirements. Section 3.5.5.B details specific criteria regarding commercial vehicles that are to be considered in addition to the special permit requirements contained in article VIII of the regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 3.5.5.C then indicates\n   that those criteria\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   apply to the parking of commercial vehicles in business zones,\n   stating: \"The parking of commercial vehicles is permitted in business zones as an accessory use to the permitted use of the property after the issuance of Site Development Plan approval from the [commission] permitting such vehicles. The [c]ommission shall be governed by the submission requirements and review criteria of [\u00a7] 3.5.5.B of these regulations.\" Section 5.3.2, in turn, permits the \"Parking of Commercial Vehicles, subject to the provisions of [\u00a7] 3.5.5.B\" as an accessory use of properties in the BP zone following site plan approval by the commission. Accordingly, the parking and storage of commercial vehicles may be permitted as an accessory use pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3.5.5.C and 5.3.2 of the regulations, as the court recognized in its memorandum of decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, nothing in either \u00a7\u00a7 3.5.5 or 5.3.2 permits the parking and storage of commercial vehicles as a principal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Principal uses of real property permitted in the BP zone are set forth in \u00a7 5.2 of the regulations. The only conceivable subsection that could authorize the parking and storage of commercial vehicles as a principal use of the defendant's property is \u00a7 5.2.H.5, which provides that \"[t]rucking or freight operations with complete visual screening of equipment and materials\" may be conducted as a \"Conditional Use Permitted Only After Special Permit Approval By the Commission\" in the BP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   zone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the order at issue in this appeal, LaFountain cited that section and noted that it requires a special permit from the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Language of \u00a7 5.2.H.5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that \u00a7 5.2.H.5 of the regulations is void for vagueness. Its claim is premised on the fact that the words \"trucking or freight operations\" are not defined in the regulations.

Tartaglia testified that Stefak had \"a United States Department of Transportation carrier license\" and was storing \"ten or eleven\" commercial vehicles on the property at the time of trial. M &amp; A Express Transport, LLC, is another trucking company that stored its trucks on the property. As Tartaglia emphatically stated at the subsequent contempt hearing, the defendant's tenants were \"registered as transport companies or courier companies. Indeed, that is their business. They transport through the United States Postal Service, pharmaceutical companies, Amazon. At my property, they operate offices and they park their trucks.... We have never denied this.\" It suffices to say, then, that the defendant was cognizant that trucking companies were storing\n   their commercial vehicles on the property.

Furthermore, the fact that the commission classified trucking operations conducted in the BP zone as a \"conditional use\" requiring special permit approval from the commission indicates that it wanted to retain an additional degree of oversight and control over such activities, consistent with the primary aim of zoning, which \"is to promote the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Langbein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Zoning Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618831\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/135/575/#p580\">\n    135 Conn. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%205\">\n    67 A.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp;Zoning Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777154\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/3/550/#p554\">\n    3 Conn.

In its memorandum of decision, the court imposed a daily fine from that date until \"the [April 20, 2017] date of this order ....\" As this court has observed, the trial court \"has discretion to impose [daily] fines, as the circumstances require.\"\n   <em>\n    Stamford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stephenson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2495301\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/818/#p826\">\n    78 Conn.

After noting that the action was brought pursuant to \u00a7 8-12, the plaintiffs requested, inter alia, an award of \"costs and reasonable attorney's fees\" pursuant to that statute. Such an award requires a finding \"that the violation was wilful ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Renz\n   </em>\n   , supra, 46 Conn.

The court also stated that \"[a] wilful act is one done intentionally or with reckless disregard of the consequences of one's conduct.... Willfulness in violating a [zoning regulation] implies not so much malevolent design as action with knowledge that one's acts are proscribed or with careless disregard for their lawfulness or unlawfulness.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court then made a series of findings regarding the defendant's conduct subsequent to the issuance of the order instructing the defendant to cease and desist all trucking operations on the property. The court found that \"[t]he town was concerned with the trucking operations on the property, and the evidence indicates the defendant\n   <em>\n    willingly\n   </em>\n   allowed such a use.\" (Emphasis added.) The court further found that \"Tartaglia's purported lack of knowledge in his testimony\n   about the actual operations or the specific tenants storing trucks was not persuasive.... Notwithstanding Tartaglia's protestations ... there is no evidence that weighs in the defendant's favor.\" In light of those findings, the court, in fashioning relief, awarded the plaintiffs \"costs and attorney's fees to be established at a hearing at a later date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This case thus is one in which the trial court was presented with a request for an award of costs and attorney's fees that\n   required a finding of wilfulness.

In the present case, the plaintiffs filed their motion for contempt on May 4, 2017. The defendant thereafter did not file a timely a motion to dismiss that contempt motion. Rather, the defendant on May 11, 2017, filed an objection that addressed the merits of the plaintiffs' motion for contempt. The court subsequently held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for contempt on July 6, 2017, at which the defendant presented evidence, including the testimony of Tartaglia.

Once again, we disagree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   We begin by noting that it is \"within the equitable powers of the trial court to effectuate its prior judgment\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   , regardless of whether the noncompliant party [is] in contempt.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Plan &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"832000\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/232/\">\n    260 Conn. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%201164\">\n    796 A.2d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is undisputed that the defendant did not request a discretionary stay of the court's order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-12 during the pendency of this appeal. For that reason, the plaintiffs were entitled to file their motion for contempt any time after the\n   permanent injunction was issued. The defendant has provided no legal authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We therefore turn to the substance of the defendant's claim that the court improperly found it in contempt. The evidence adduced at the July 6, 2017 contempt hearing substantiates the court's finding that the zoning violations that gave rise to this enforcement action \"still exist\" on the property. LaFountain testified that he had inspected the property on four separate occasions over the course of more than two months. Each time, he observed numerous commercial vehicles stored in the\n   rear lot of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   During those inspections, LaFountain took photographs, twenty-one of which were admitted into evidence at the contempt hearing. Those photographs depict the storage of commercial vehicles on the property that belong to trucking businesses. In light of his firsthand observation of the property in the months following the issuance of the permanent injunction, LaFountain testified that he believed that a zoning violation continued to exist on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   After the plaintiffs rested, the defendant called Tartaglia to the witness stand. In his testimony, Tartaglia confirmed that trucking businesses continued to store trucks on the property. Tartaglia also admitted that the defendant had not applied for a special permit to conduct trucking operations on the property. In addition, Tartaglia testified that he believed that the permanent injunction issued by the court months earlier was \"unjust, unfair, inequitable and an affront,\" stating \"that's my opinion and I'm entitled to it.\" He nevertheless described certain steps he had taken that allegedly were intended to secure compliance with the regulations. Specifically, Tartaglia testified that he had served notices to quit on three tenants due to violations of the terms of their leases; copies of those notices were admitted into evidence. At the same time, Tartaglia professed ignorance when asked whether the defendant subsequently had commenced eviction proceedings in the Superior Court against those tenants. Tartaglia also testified that he had provided those tenants with instructions on how to apply for a special permit with the town.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In addition, Tartaglia acknowledged that the lease agreements with those tenants, which were submitted into evidence at the contempt hearing, authorized the defendant to immediately revoke parking privileges and remove a tenant's vehicles from the property at any time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the defendant submitted into evidence a copy of the letter that it sent to\n   Stefak shortly after the permanent injunction was granted, in which Tartaglia informed Stefak that the defendant was cancelling his lease and \"any parking privileges are immediately revoked.\" On cross-examination, Tartaglia was asked if he had \"attempt[ed] to lock the gate\" or taken any other steps to \"keep the box trucks out of\" the property. Tartaglia admitted that he had \"done no such thing.\" He also stated that \"if someone in this [courtroom] thinks that we should go there and club them over the head, or throw [the tenants] out, I'm not [going to] do that because that's not what a businessman would do; and I wouldn't do that to any other person, especially decent people who've done no harm. And if that doesn't accommodate the town, I'm very sorry. But I can't do more than that because it would be wrong. Of course, it would be improper. And it's uncalled for in this case. Uncalled for. And if I'm acting from decency and proper business judgment and moving as quick as we can, and\n   that's not quick enough for someone in this [courtroom], then I think someone in this [courtroom] says that I was unreasonable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The defendant nonetheless claims that, in light of the fact that Tartaglia sent eviction notices and special permit application instructions to certain tenants, the court improperly granted the plaintiffs' motion for contempt. At its essence, the defendant's claim is that it operated under a good faith belief that such efforts constituted compliance with the court's order, which precludes a finding that it wilfully violated that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The court's order plainly states that \"the defendant must comply with the town's regulations. If [the defendant] seeks to conduct such trucking and freight operations on the property, it must first obtain a special permit to do so. Hence, all trucking operations not associated with a specific tenant business use on the property or any trucking and freight operations being conducted without a special permit must immediately cease.\" (Footnote omitted.)

Indeed, many of the newest pictures of the property submitted into evidence by the plaintiffs show the same type of-or perhaps the exact same-trucks shown in pictures submitted into evidence at trial....

If anything, that memorandum of decision reasonably can be construed as containing an implicit finding of a public nuisance, as the court (1) found that LaFountain had \"received complaints about the parking of trucks\" on the property; (2) found that the town \"was concerned with trucking operations on the property, and the evidence indicates that the defendant willingly allowed such a use\"; and (3) found that \"there is no evidence that weighs in the defendant's favor.\" Furthermore, no articulation of the court's decision was sought by the defendant with respect to that issue.
