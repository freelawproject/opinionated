On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly dismissed his complaint as untimely. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On February 18, 2016, the plaintiff received a release of jurisdiction from the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (commission), with which he had filed a complaint. On May 27, 2016, the plaintiff delivered the process to be served to Constable Ernie Dumas, who then served the defendant on May 31, 2016. The plaintiff's complaint was returned to the court on June 13, 2016. On July 8, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to commence his action within ninety days of receiving the release of jurisdiction from the commission as required by General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101 (e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By order dated November 8, 2016, the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. From that judgment, the plaintiff now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Before addressing the plaintiff's claims on appeal, we address the applicable standard of review, which is well settled. A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a ... question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.... The motion to dismiss ... admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Milford Hospital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774947\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/1/#p10\">\n    300 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20865\">\n    12 A.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argues that his action was commenced in a timely manner. Additionally, the plaintiff indicates that he believes his action falls within the remedial savings statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which would render his action\n   timely commenced if process had been delivered to the constable prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations and served within thirty days. The defendant disagrees, arguing that the commencement of an action under Connecticut law occurs with the service of the writ upon the defendant and that the defendant was served after the expiration of the statute of limitations. The defendant also\n   argues that the remedial savings statute does not apply to the plaintiff's case because the plaintiff delivered the service to the constable after the expiration of the statute of limitations. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-100 and 46a-101(e),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff had ninety days from the date in which he received the release of jurisdiction from the commission to commence his action in the Superior Court. The plaintiff received the release of jurisdiction from the commission on February 18, 2016. The plaintiff, therefore, was required to commence his action by May 18, 2016. In his brief, the plaintiff indicates that his action was filed and served on May 9, 2016, and it was, thus, commenced in a timely manner. Although the plaintiff's complaint is dated May 9, 2016, and the summons was signed by a clerk of court on May 9, 2016, the record indicates that neither was the action filed nor was the defendant served on May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It is well established that, in Connecticut, \"an action is commenced not when the writ is returned but when it is served upon the defendant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rocco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458086\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/541/#p549\">\n    268 Conn. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%20352\">\n    848 A.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The return of service indicates that Constable Dumas served\n   the defendant on May 31, 2016. Accordingly, the plaintiff commenced his action on May 31, 2016, after the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff is correct in that, pursuant to the remedial savings statute, his action would not be lost if he had delivered the process to be served to Constable Dumas by May 18, 2016, ninety days from the date he received the release of jurisdiction from the commission. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a. In his affidavit, however, Constable Dumas averred that he received the summons and complaint\n   from the plaintiff on May 27, 2016. As such, the plaintiff delivered the process to Constable Dumas after the expiration of the statute of limitations, making the remedial savings statute inapplicable to his case. We conclude, therefore, that the court properly dismissed the plaintiff's action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101 (e) provides: \"Any action brought by the complainant in accordance with section 46a-100 shall be brought not later than ninety days after the date of the receipt of the release from the commission.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    In its motion to dismiss, the defendant also argued that its motion to dismiss should be granted because the plaintiff had failed to return the process in a timely fashion and had failed to serve the appropriate individual. In its appellate brief, the defendant argues that the court could have dismissed the claim on the alternative ground that the plaintiff failed to make proper service of process. Because we agree with the court that the plaintiff did not commence his action in a timely manner, we need not address this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a provides in relevant part: \"(a) ...

In the absence of such a showing, mandatory time limitations must be complied with absent an equitable reason for excusing compliance, including waiver or consent by the parties. Such time limitations do not, however, implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the agency or the court.\"\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963525\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/258/#p269\">\n     257 Conn. 258\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 269-70,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20A.2d%20645\">\n     777 A.2d 645\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , aff'd after remand,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260580\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/67/316/\">\n     67 Conn.

Because the plaintiff presents no argument as to whether the time limit of \u00a7 46a-101 (e) is either mandatory or jurisdictional and presents no claim of waiver, consent, or equitable tolling, we conclude that \"the court properly dismissed ... the [plaintiff's] claim regardless of whether the time limit is jurisdictional.\"\n    <em>\n     Sempey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Stamford Hospital\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 616,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496310\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/184/761/\">\n     184 A.3d 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dept. of Children &amp; Families\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780748\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/759/#p767\">\n     136 Conn.
