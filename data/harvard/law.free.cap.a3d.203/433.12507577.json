A clash of values was inevitable. In 2007, Felkner filed an action against Rhode Island College and various college officials (collectively defendants),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging they had violated his constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection. In 2013, Felkner amended his complaint to include claims for conspiracy to violate his civil rights and a violation of his procedural due process rights. The matter now before us concerns his appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts and from the dismissal of his claim for punitive damages. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment in part and affirm in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Our summary of pertinent facts is garnered from Felkner's verified complaint and first amended complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as from the parties' submissions on defendants' renewed motion for summary judgment. For purposes of our summary judgment review, we present the admissible evidence in the manner most propitious to plaintiff, as the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Lehigh Cement Co. v. Quinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12351104\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/1272/#p1275\">\n    173 A.3d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1275 (R.I. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2004, shortly after Felkner began his studies at Rhode Island College (RIC), he learned that the School of Social Work (SSW) would be sponsoring a showing of the movie\n   <em>\n    Fahrenheit 9/11.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Felkner emailed defendant Professor James Ryczek, his instructor for a foundational course called \"Policy and Organizing I,\" objecting to the showing of the film. Felkner asked if the SSW would consider showing the movie\n   <em>\n    FahrenHYPE 9/11\n   </em>\n   , a conservative rebuttal to\n   <em>\n    Fahrenheit 9/11.\n   </em>\n   According to Felkner, Professor Ryczek responded that the SSW has a mission dedicated to social and economic justice and suggested that \"anyone who consistently holds antithetical views to those that are espoused by the profession might ask themselves whether social work is the profession for them.\" Felkner also wrote an email to Professor Daniel Weisman, who had sponsored the presentation of\n   <em>\n    Fahrenheit 9/11.\n   </em>\n   In response to Felkner's email, Professor Weisman expressed that the SSW was \"not committed to balanced\n   presentations\" and that, \"[f]or the most part, Republican ideology is oppositional to the [social work] profession's fundamental values.\" Ultimately, however, Professor Weisman presented\n   <em>\n    FahrenHYPE 9/11\n   </em>\n   to the same classes that saw\n   <em>\n    Fahrenheit 9/11.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As part of \"Policy and Organizing I,\" students were assigned a group project in which they were to debate a social welfare issue and write a policy paper promoting the group's position. According to Felkner, the students could choose from a list of issues provided by Professor Ryczek, all of which involved, in Felkner's words, \"a leftist position on social welfare issues.\" Professor Ryczek also informed the class that each student would participate in a class debate and then lobby for their selected issue before the Rhode Island General Assembly in the next semester's \"Policy and Organizing II\" class. Felkner joined a class group advocating for passage of Senate Bill 525 (SB 525), which he described as an amendment to \"a temporary cash assistance program for Rhode Islanders having a difficult time making ends meet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, however, Felkner asked Professor Ryczek for permission to argue against SB 525 in the class debate after he concluded that \"SB 525 did not actually help people get off welfare with higher-paying jobs * * *.\" According to Felkner, Professor Ryczek denied this request, explaining that RIC \"is a perspective school and we teach that perspective\" and \"if you are going to lobby on [SB 525], you're going to lobby in our perspective.\" Nevertheless, Felkner wrote his policy paper from a perspective opposing the passage of SB 525 and contrary to-in Felkner's words-Professor Ryzcek's \"professed support of a comprehensive welfare state.\" At his deposition, Professor Ryczek testified that he typically gives a group grade for the group work. However, after members of Felkner's group told Professor Ryzcek that Felkner \"was not participating in the group as expected[,]\" Professor Ryczek agreed to \"disaggregate\" Felkner's grade from the group grade. Professor Ryczek further stated that he had never disaggregated a student's grade before, nor had he ever given a grade lower than an \"A minus\" or \"B plus\" for the group class debate. Felkner received a failing grade on both his written assignment and classroom debate because he had not followed the directives of the assignment. Professor Ryczek then offered Felkner an opportunity to rewrite his paper. Ultimately, Professor Ryczek gave Felkner a C plus as his final course grade. Felkner appealed the failing grades for the paper and debate to the Academic Standing Committee (ASC) for the SSW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 20, 2005, the ASC held a hearing on Felkner's appeal. According to Felkner, he was denied the opportunity to question Professor Ryczek at the hearing because Professor Ryczek left the room immediately following his testimony. Because Felkner believed that Professor Ryczek had given inaccurate testimony at the ASC hearing regarding conversations between them, Felkner announced that he would henceforth record all of his conversations with RIC professors. The next day, the ASC denied Felkner's appeal of his grades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Felkner further appealed the matter to the chair of the Master of Social Work (MSW) program, Dr. Lenore Olsen, and then to the dean of the SSW, defendant Carol Bennett-Speight. In both appeals, the decision of the ASC was upheld. Felkner also contacted the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) about his alleged mistreatment. In a letter to RIC's then-President, defendant John Nazarian, dated January 28, 2005, FIRE noted that, in \"[t]he case of Bill Felkner[,]\" RIC should \"reconsider and withdraw its\n   unconstitutional policies.\" On February 15, 2005, Nazarian replied that no RIC student had been punished for failing to espouse a certain political belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the close of the Fall semester, Professor Ryczek wrote to Dr. Olsen, informing her that he would not teach the \"Policy and Organizing II\" class the next semester because, as an adjunct faculty member, dealing with Felkner required too much of his time. Consequently, Felkner was transferred to a section of the course taught by full-time Professor Roberta Pearlmutter. The plaintiff's relations with Professor Pearlmutter, however, were no more salubrious than they had been with Professor Ryczek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One assignment in \"Policy and Organizing II\" required students to complete a group project approved by Professor Pearlmutter. Felkner proposed to Professor Pearlmutter that he be allowed to form a group with students from other colleges to lobby RIC for an Academic Bill of Rights. Professor Pearlmutter rejected Felkner's proposal, noting that it did not have a direct impact on the \"poor and oppressed\" and did not advance \"social justice.\" Professor Pearlmutter also rejected Felkner's request to lobby in favor of the then-governor's welfare-reform proposal for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Next, Felkner suggested that he be allowed to work on a project lobbying for the defeat of SB 525 in the General Assembly. Professor Pearlmutter told Felkner that she would penalize his grade on the project if he did not work on it with classmates from his \"Policy and Organizing II\" class. Felkner had difficulty recruiting group members because his fellow students had already formed groups to promote policies that were contrary to his \"conscience.\" Because of the \"hostility towards his beliefs[,]\" Felkner worked on his project with a group comprising himself and two individuals from outside of RIC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some of his conversations with Professor Pearlmutter took place through the exchange of emails. One conversation about Felkner's proposed projects was in person; Felkner audio-recorded the conversation without Professor Pearlmutter's knowledge and later posted a rough transcript of the conversation to a website he had created to expose what he characterized as the \"liberal bias\" at RIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During one of Professor Pearlmutter's classes, the students were permitted to discuss their concerns about Felkner's postings on his website related to the \"Policy and Organizing II\" class. According to Professor Pearlmutter, she was approached by several students who were concerned that the confidentiality of class discussions was being compromised by Felkner when he posted about those discussions on his website. She maintained that students in the class asked that Felkner discuss any issues he had with the class during classroom discussions rather than on his website. Felkner, however, asserted that his conservative views were \"assail[ed]\" and that Professor Pearlmutter allowed other students to \"assault\" his views without allowing him the opportunity to respond. According to Felkner, \"[t]he unmistakable message Defendant Pearlmutter communicated through the discussion was that only liberal/progressive ideas can help the poor and advance the cause of social justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Professor Pearlmutter eventually filed a complaint with the ASC, asserting that Felkner had committed unethical and unprofessional\n   conduct in violation of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics. On April 27, 2005, the ASC held a hearing on Professor Pearlmutter's complaint. Thereafter, the ASC issued a written decision, through its chair Dr. Diane Martell, in which it found that Felkner's deceptive conduct in recording his conversation with Professor Pearlmutter violated one of the three sections of the Code of Ethics alleged by Professor Pearlmutter in her complaint. The ASC recommended to the chair of the MSW program that Felkner \"declare immediately, in writing, that [he] will henceforth refrain from any deceptive audio or video copying of conversations with social work colleagues and refrain from any audio or video copying without express permission from them.\" The ASC further recommended that Felkner be dismissed from the MSW program if he was unwilling to execute such a declaration. In a letter to Dean Bennett-Speight, dated May 11, 2005, Felkner stated that he would refrain from making audio or video recordings of his conversations with his SSW colleagues unless he first obtained their consent to record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the end of Felkner's first year in the MSW program, he met with his adviser and chose the Social Work Organizing and Policy (SWOP) concentration for completion of the degree. As a MSW student, Felkner was required to complete a field placement and an integrative project in order to fulfill the MSW program requirements. For Felkner's field placement and integrative project, he secured an internship in then-Governor Donald L. Carcieri's office, working on welfare-reform legislation. Felkner alleged that Professor Ryczek, as director of field placements, rejected Felkner's placement because it would not advance the concentration's objectives of promoting progressive social change. Felkner claimed that Professor Ryczek advised him that the SWOP-concentration objectives required him to advocate for liberal, progressive policies, and that he suggested Felkner's views might make him better suited to another academic discipline, such as political science. The MSW department chair, Dr. Olsen, supported Professor Ryczek's position by indicating that Felkner might consider pursuing other concentrations if he was not able to work on the academic objectives of the SWOP concentration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 9, 2005, Felkner met with Dean Bennett-Speight about his challenges with Professor Ryczek and Dr. Olsen, claiming they were discriminating against him because of his conservative views. Thereafter, Dean Bennett-Speight assigned Professor S. Scott Mueller, also a defendant in this case, as Felkner's field placement supervisor. Professor Mueller also initially rejected Felkner's proposed field placement and integrative project, but eventually RIC approved the field placement in the Governor's office. According to Felkner, Professor Mueller refused to approve Felkner's proposed integrative project on welfare reform because it was a \"toxic\" subject. Consequently, Felkner \"reluctantly conceded to work on healthcare reform for his [integrative project].\" Felkner further asserted that working on healthcare reform put him at a disadvantage relative to other SSW students because he was unable to use his field placement research for his integrative project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Felkner proceeded to work on his integrative project in the fall of 2006 and most of 2007. On November 26, 2007, Felkner requested an extension of time to complete his integrative project. In January 2008, Dean Bennett-Speight granted Felkner an extension until May 11, 2009, to complete his degree requirements. The extension was conditioned upon Felkner submitting a portion of the project by April 15, 2008, a\n   condition with which he did not comply. On March 17, 2008, Felkner requested an additional six-week extension; but both Dean Bennett-Speight and Professor Pearlmutter denied his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2007, amid his integrative project extension requests, Felkner filed the instant action in Providence County Superior Court alleging that defendants' conduct toward him during his enrollment in the MSW program violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, Felkner's initial verified complaint included claims for: deprivation of his right to freedom of expression \"on issues of political concern\" (count one) in part by placing \"unconstitutional conditions on [his] continuance in the [MSW] program\" (count four); violation of his right to freedom of expression by retaliating against him for \"expressing his political beliefs and for publicly criticizing [RIC's] liberal biases\" (count two) and by compelling him to \"express ideas * * * contrary to his political beliefs\" (count three); and violation of his right to equal protection (count five). The defendants answered and filed a motion for summary judgment, which a hearing justice denied after finding the case to be \"extremely fact intensive and not susceptible to disposition by summary proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 3, 2013, Felkner filed an amended complaint, adding two counts. One new claim alleged that defendants had violated his procedural due process rights by the way in which they conducted the ASC hearings related to the complaints involving Felkner (count six). The other new claim alleged that defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to violate his civil rights, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (count seven). For all of the alleged constitutional violations contained in the amended complaint, Felkner asserted that he was entitled to damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1988 as well as the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), including punitive damages. Felkner also sought an order expunging the ASC hearings from his academic file, an extension of time for him to complete his MSW degree, injunctive relief restraining enforcement of RIC's speech code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants sought to strike plaintiff's claim for punitive damages after receiving a request for interrogatories seeking the individual defendants' personal financial details.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After conducting a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Palmisano v. Toth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351859\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/624/314/\">\n    624 A.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1993), the hearing justice struck plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, finding that defendants' conduct toward Felkner had not \"rise[n] to the level of recklessness or callous indifference\" to his constitutional rights and that, therefore, he had not established a prima facie case for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In March 2015, defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims, arguing in part that defendants were protected from civil liability, if any, by the doctrine of qualified immunity. In Felkner's objection to the motion, he asserted that the law of the case doctrine barred the renewed motion for summary judgment because the first motion for summary judgment had been denied and defendants had previously raised the issue of qualified immunity, although the hearing justice had not yet reached the issue or made any rulings\n   thereon. He also argued that, if the renewed motion were to be considered, there were several issues of disputed facts that would preclude the entry of summary judgment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The hearing justice disagreed with Felkner's objections, concluding in a written decision that the law of the case doctrine did not prevent her from deciding defendants' second motion for summary judgment because the record had significantly expanded during the several years of discovery that had taken place between the filing of the two dispositive motions. The hearing justice also concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The hearing justice did not substantively address the issue of qualified immunity, concluding this issue was moot based upon her conclusion that none of defendants' actions had violated Felkner's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Final judgment entered in favor of defendants in November 2015, and Felkner timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Felkner is raising four main issues before this Court. The first is whether the law of the case doctrine should have precluded the hearing justice from considering defendants' renewed motion for summary judgment. The second is whether genuine issues of material fact should have precluded the entry of summary judgment for each of Felkner's federal constitutional claims. The third issue is whether the doctrine of qualified immunity protects the individually named defendants from potential liability. The fourth issue is whether Felkner demonstrated a prima facie case for punitive damages. We take each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Law of the Case Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first briefly address whether the law of the case doctrine should have precluded the hearing justice's consideration of defendants' renewed motion for summary judgment. Felkner argues that the hearing justice erred in considering the renewed motion because she relied upon the same affidavits as those relied on by the first hearing justice who presided over-and denied-defendants' first motion for summary judgment. Felkner also argues that the expanded record reinforced the factual issues, rather than eliminating them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"The law of the case doctrine provides that, after a judge has decided an interlocutory matter in a pending suit, a second judge, confronted at a later stage of the suit with the same question in the identical manner, should refrain from disturbing the first ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Quillen v.

The hearing justice acknowledged that defendants had submitted the same documents in support of their renewed motion, but that the parties had conducted significant discovery and the record had also been expanded by new exhibits. The hearing justice concluded that the law of the case doctrine did not preclude her consideration of the renewed motion for summary judgment because the record before her had \"expanded significantly\" and included \"exhibits that did not exist when the [c]ourt ruled on [d]efendants' first motion for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our review of the record reveals that the renewed motion for summary judgment was submitted on a much broader record than the original motion for summary judgment. In the intervening seven years, the parties produced additional discovery-the hearing justice referred to \"ten depositions and thousands of pages of documents\" in her written decision on the renewed motion for summary judgment-and Felkner amended his complaint to add claims for conspiracy and violation of procedural due process. Because the record before the hearing justice had indeed been expanded since the denial of defendants' initial motion for summary judgment, we are of the opinion that she was acting well within her discretionary authority in entertaining and deciding the renewed motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327114\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/1006/#p1012\">\n    160 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1012-13 ;\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6921770\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/101/1251/#p1262\">\n    101 A.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    \"Academic freedom thrives not only on the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students, but also, and somewhat inconsistently, on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Regents of University of Michigan v.

The record in this case is voluminous and replete with disputed facts. Resolving all such facts in the light most favorable to Felkner, the issue is whether he has made tenable claims that defendants have violated his constitutional rights to free speech and expression. We believe that he has. Felkner describes himself as a \"conservative libertarian\" and was no doubt a challenging student with a political agenda as robust as the agenda he ascribes to defendants. Given the broad discretion afforded to educational institutions, he may have a difficult road ahead of him. Nevertheless, he has raised genuine issues of material fact concerning whether the actions of defendants are \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\" or merely a pretext for punishing him for his conservative views.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hazelwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     484 U.S. at 273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     108 S.Ct. 562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"Although we do not second-guess the pedagogical wisdom or efficacy of an educator's goal, we would be abdicating our judicial duty if we failed to investigate whether the educational goal or pedagogical concern was pretextual.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     Axson-Flynn v.

Felkner alleges that defendants impermissibly retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional right to record his classes and discussions with faculty. According to Felkner, he began recording conversations with faculty because \"he believed that Ryczek had lied to the ASC about their conversations.\" Felkner also tape-recorded his classes. He would then post a rough transcript of some of these conversations on his personal website. Felkner further asserts that Professor Pearlmutter led a fifty-minute\n    in-class discussion assailing his conservative views and the postings on his website. According to Felkner, Professor Ryzcek also allowed other students to criticize Felkner's views without allowing him to respond. In addition, Professor Pearlmutter filed a complaint with the ASC claiming that Felkner's recordings violated the NASW Code of Ethics. Felkner argues that these actions by defendants were in retaliation against him because he had exercised his constitutional right to free speech.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    It is well settled that citizens may record government officials in the exercise of their official duties.\n    <em>\n     Glik v.

Felkner alleges that Professor Pearlmutter retaliated against his exercise of his First Amendment rights by filing a complaint against him with the ASC. The ASC found that Felkner had \"failed to adhere to academic standards of the School when [he] deceptively audio-taped a conversation with Dr. Pearlmutter in violation of Section 4.04 of the NASW Code of Ethics.\" The recommendation of the ASC was that the SSW department chair, Dr. Olsen, request Felkner \"to declare immediately, in writing, that [he] will henceforth refrain from any deceptive audio or video copying of conversations with social work colleagues and refrain from any audio or video copying without express permission from them.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Under the\n    <em>\n     Tinker\n    </em>\n    standard, it is apparent that Felkner's recordings \"might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption\" and \"collid[e] with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.\"\n    <em>\n     Tinker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p512\">\n     393 U.S. at 508, 514\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318417\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/503/#p512\">\n     89 S.Ct. 733\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, as the hearing justice noted, \"Felkner was not disciplined for the actual act of recording; rather, he was prohibited from engaging in deceptive behavior by making surreptitious recordings of his colleagues.\" He was required to obtain permission before recording any conversations, a condition that is seemingly reasonable in the context\n    of higher learning and academic freedom. We conclude, therefore, that Felkner has failed to provide evidence of a disputed issue of material fact demonstrating that any defendant interfered with or retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights with respect to his recording activities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    With respect to Felkner's other claims of retaliatory conduct, as discussed above, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Felkner's activities were protected by the First Amendment.

The hearing justice focused on Felkner's allegations that Professor Ryczek compelled him to espouse a political viewpoint contrary to his own when Felkner was not permitted to switch sides of a project topic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We start off by noting that, on summary judgment, the issue is not whether a litigant has established a prima facie claim to his stated cause of action, but rather, whether he has demonstrated the presence of genuine issues of material fact to be resolved by a factfinder. We also note that, to the extent Felkner alleges that a requirement of the \"Policy and Organizing\" course curriculum was to lobby the General Assembly, the issue is moot. There is no dispute that, although Professor Ryczek initially told Felkner he would be required to lobby from a perspective contrary to his own views, Felkner never was compelled to lobby or testify at a public hearing. The question, therefore, is more appropriately whether the \"speech\" required by his class assignments, integrative project, and other educational activities were reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\n    or, as Felkner contends, either an impermissible form of compelled speech or a \"pre-text[ ] for political discrimination.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hazelwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     484 U.S. at 273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     108 S.Ct. 562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Individual professors have the necessary authority to evaluate their students' work and to assign a grade for their students' performances on the assignments required for successful course and degree program completion. Administrators have the authority to set the academic\n    requirements for completing specific degree programs. In our opinion, the class-of-one theory is not applicable to Felkner's equal protection claim arising out of his educational experience for the same reasons discussed by the Supreme Court when it declared that the theory was not applicable to an equal protection claim arising out of an employment experience.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Engquist\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673956\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/591/#p601\">\n     553 U.S. at 605\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673956\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/591/#p601\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"To treat employees differently is not to classify them in a way that raises equal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply to exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-employee relationship.\"). Moreover, Felkner himself has neither relied on the class-of-one theory nor suggested that we consider his equal protection claim pursuant to this framework.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Notably, the First Circuit's jurisprudence on equal protection claims in the context of postsecondary education clearly focuses on whether a defendant's actions have been different toward plaintiffs compared to other students and whether the disparate treatment has been rationally related to a legitimate purpose. For example, a student teacher's equal protection claim against his university and the city in which he had been engaged in a student-teaching practicum was summarily dismissed because the plaintiff had \"failed to show that others, similarly situated, were treated differently.\"\n    <em>\n     Hennessy v. City of Melrose\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11556050\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/237/#p244\">\n     194 F.3d 237\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 244 (1st Cir. 1999). In\n    <em>\n     Toledo\n    </em>\n    , the First Circuit also affirmed the dismissal of an equal protection claim because a university student who had claimed a disability by virtue of a mental illness had failed to allege that the university's refusal to acquiesce to his demands for class scheduling and course assignment changes to accommodate his disability was a result of irrational prejudice, and the university's decisions were obviously rationally related to its academic mission and budgetary constraints.\n    <em>\n     Toledo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5563242\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/24/#p33\">\n     454 F.3d at 29, 33-34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Felkner asserts that some of his peers who held similar sociopolitical ideologies also did not speak up in class to share these views. The email exchanges with these students that Felkner provided as support for his argument do not show that defendants treated students with conservative ideologies differently than they treated students with liberal ideologies; instead, the emails simply provide evidence to support Felkner's claim that some other students felt that their sociological and political opinions should not be shared with the other students and faculty in the MSW program. This assertion is clearly more relevant to Felkner's claims based on freedom of expression than to claims based on equal protection violations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Felkner also relies on a mosaic of allegations about the various professors and administrators whose actions against him-he claims-tend to show a pattern of disparate treatment due to his political affiliation. As litigants are apt to do, Felkner cherry-picks from the myriad written communications between him and fellow students, as well as between him and RIC professors and administrators, in his attempt to demonstrate that defendants' actions were motivated by their disagreement with his political ideology. Our review of the record of this case, however, shows that the academic actions taken with respect to Felkner were, ultimately, to enforce the required components of the MSW degree at RIC. Felkner focuses on Professor Ryczek disaggregating his grade and giving him a failing grade when he refused to complete an assignment as instructed, various professors and administrators enforcing the requirement that Felkner complete both a field placement and an integrative project as a prerequisite to\n    obtaining the MSW degree, and administrators denying Felkner a further extension of time in which to complete the integrative project after he failed to respond to the SSW's offer for completing the project long after the previous deadlines set for him. In our view, these are actions that involve \"discretionary decisionmaking\" that do not implicate equal protection concerns.\n    <em>\n     Engquist\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673956\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/591/#p601\">\n     553 U.S. at 603\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673956\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/591/#p601\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Accordingly, we affirm summary judgment with respect to count five.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     7\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     Procedural Due Process\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In count six, Felkner alleges that defendants violated his procedural due process rights in several different ways related to the ASC hearings.

Felkner received a letter advising him of Professor Pearlmutter's complaint and the date of the hearing. Professor Pearlmutter's complaint and other materials were enclosed with this notice. A review of these materials shows that Felkner was undisputably told the basis for the complaint against him,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p574\">\n     419 U.S. at 582\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p574\">\n     95 S.Ct. 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and Felkner has not provided any material to the contrary. The fact that the notice did not include an express statement of permitted and unpermitted behavior by SSW students does not lead to a violation of Felkner's due process rights regarding his entitlement to notice prior to the ASC hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Second, Felkner claims he was deprived of his right to have counsel at the ASC hearing. He does not direct us, however, to any authority establishing a right to counsel in similar academic circumstances. Indeed, \"the weight of authority is against representation by counsel at disciplinary hearings, unless the student is also facing criminal charges stemming from the incident in question.\"\n    <em>\n     Gorman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772989\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/7/#p12\">\n     837 F.2d at 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Third, Felkner's challenge regarding \"\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    communications\"-referring to the deposition of Diane Martell, Ph.D., chair of the ASC, in which she testified that Dean Bennett-Speight asked Dr. Martell to assure her that Felkner would be treated fairly and that all the policies and practices would be followed-fares no better. It is difficult to see how this particular communication might compromise Dr. Martell's impartiality, and Felkner has not demonstrated a factual issue to be resolved by a jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Fourth, we address Felkner's claim that he was denied the opportunity to question his \"accusers\" at the ASC hearing. Although the MSW Academic and Field Manual expressly provides a student at an ASC hearing with \"the right to question all participants on pertinent matters[,]\" the failure to adhere to that policy is not necessarily of constitutional magnitude because Felkner did not have a constitutional\n    right to confront and cross-examine Professor Ryczek as his accuser.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goss\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p574\">\n     419 U.S. at 583\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177671\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/565/#p574\">\n     95 S.Ct. 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The undisputed facts and persuasive federal law lead us to hold that Felkner received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before the ASC.

The hearing justice concluded Felkner had not alleged \"a racial or class-based animus as motivation for the alleged conspiracy\" as required by federal law and, as a result, defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Felkner's conspiracy claim. On appeal, Felkner argues that a conspiracy to \"deprive [him] of his constitutional rights and drive him out of the MSW program\" could reasonably be inferred by the evidence presented in Superior Court that: (1) members of the faculty discussed Felkner on several occasions\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    ; (2) Professor Ryczek kept notes about Felkner and had other faculty members review a paper on which he was going to give Felkner a bad grade; and (3) Professor Mueller testified in his deposition that the ASC had not found that Felkner violated the NASW Code of Ethics but Dr. Martell stated that the ASC unanimously found Felkner had violated the code because the ASC tried to reach a consensus.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Felkner's argument, however, misses the mark entirely.

After the hearing justice determined that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all of Felkner's claims, she declined to consider defendants' argument that they were qualifiedly immune from the claims. Instead, she found this issue to be moot. In a cursory manner before us, Felkner asserts that two of the individually named defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. Felkner also acknowledges that the hearing justice did not address this issue. The defendants, for their part, have asked us-if we vacate the judgment the hearing justice entered in their favor-to conclude that qualified immunity bars Felkner's claims against them. The defendants argue that, even if their actions are deemed to have violated any of Felkner's constitutional rights, none of the violations were against clearly established constitutional rights, thereby entitling the individual defendants to qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    While defendants have presented their qualified immunity arguments to the trial court on three separate occasions, there is no dispute that a hearing justice has yet to substantively consider these arguments. We have held that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in defendants' favor on several of Felkner's claims, but we decline defendants' invitation to consider or decide whether the potential violations of Felkner's constitutional rights were violations of clearly established rights because we generally do not opine on legal issues that have not been explored and analyzed in the first instance by the trial court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pontarelli v.

As previously recounted, Felkner sought punitive damages for defendants' alleged infringement of his right to exercise freedom of speech and for delaying his completion of the MSW degree program. In response to a request for interrogatories seeking the individual defendants' personal financial details, defendants moved to strike Felkner's claim for punitive damages. After conducting a\n    <em>\n     Palmisano\n    </em>\n    hearing, the hearing justice found that defendants' conduct toward Felkner had not \"rise[n] to the level of recklessness or callous indifference\" to his constitutional rights and therefore concluded that he had not established the required prima facie case for punitive damages. Felkner argues that he did establish a prima facie case for punitive damages because the record demonstrates that defendants, by their actions, were either recklessly or callously indifferent to his constitutional rights. The defendants, not surprisingly, argue that the hearing justice did not err in her decision to grant their motion to strike Felkner's punitive damages claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    We must first determine what standard applies to our review of this issue. Felkner seems to suggest we should review this issue\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    , applying the summary judgment framework in which we view the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to him. The defendants suggest we reverse the hearing justice's ruling only if we hold that her findings of fact and ultimate decision to strike the punitive damages claim were clearly erroneous. \"\n    <em>\n     Palmisano\n    </em>\n    established a procedure whereby a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing at an evidentiary hearing that a viable claim exists for an award of punitive damages before discovery of defendant's financial worth may be undertaken.\"\n    <em>\n     Castellucci v.

I endorse wholeheartedly the hearing justice's decision to the contrary. I find her discussion of Mr. Felkner's free speech claims to be an exemplary piece of legal scholarship and absolutely correct. As such, I will not restate that analysis but rather briefly address why I arrive at the same conclusions as the hearing justice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Initially, I note that I am in agreement with the hearing justice that, \"[w]ith respect to the alleged violations of free speech, the Court first must determine whether the speech in question was protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law.\" In\n    <em>\n     Adler v.

In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has expressly stated that \"[t]he only real question, under\n    <em>\n     Hazelwood\n    </em>\n    ,\" as to \"whether the actions of the school officials were reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns * * * is a question of law.\"\n    <em>\n     Poling v.

Thus, in my considered opinion, the question of whether or not Mr. Felkner's speech was protected under the First Amendment is a question of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Mr. Felkner first alleges that Professor James Ryczek, in part one of the \"Policy and Organizing\" class, violated his free speech rights when he provided an approved list of topics concerning which students were to lobby, which topics Mr. Felkner alleges represented a \"leftist position.\" Mr. Felkner further complains that he was not permitted to switch topics and that he was given a failing grade when he wrote his paper from an opposite perspective. In my view, the hearing justice did not err in concluding that the record reflected the fact that Mr. Felkner chose a topic for a paper and debate, wanted to switch sides late in the course-and then, ignoring the professor's pedagogically appropriate refusal to let him do so, wrote the paper and participated in the group debate from a perspective opposite to that assigned. It is certainly a legitimate pedagogical purpose for a professor to require a student to write a paper or participate in a debate from a viewpoint that may conflict with that student's personal views; learning to understand and cogently articulate a viewpoint that is not one's own is without question a legitimate pedagogical purpose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hazelwood School District\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     484 U.S. at 273\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601576\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/260/#p273\">\n     108 S.Ct. 562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     C.N. v.

What is more, the hearing justice pointed out that Professor Ryczek, quite generously, even gave Mr. Felkner the opportunity to resubmit the assignment, but Mr. Felkner opted not to do so. Thus, in my judgment, the hearing justice certainly did not err in concluding that Mr. Felkner's free speech rights were not violated by the series of events that transpired in this case. Nor did she err in concluding that Mr. Felkner's free speech rights were also not violated when his appeal of his failing grade was eventually denied. In the just-described context, Mr. Felkner was not engaging in protected speech.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Adler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7941625\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/544/576/\">\n     544 A.2d at 581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Mr. Felkner also puts great weight on the fact that, in part two of his \"Policy and Organizing\" class, he was required to participate in a lobbying assignment concerning a topic with which he did not agree. As the majority notes, this issue is utterly moot given that Mr. Felkner was never required to actually lobby anyone with respect to a viewpoint that he did not share. This complaint on Mr. Felkner's part is completely devoid of any merit. So too is his contention with respect to Professor Roberta Pearlmutter's initial statement that she would reduce his grade on the lobbying assignment if he formed his own group with students who were not fellow students in the \"Policy and Organizing\" class. As the hearing justice noted, Mr. Felkner was in fact eventually allowed to form his own group. Therefore, I perceive no error in the hearing justice's conclusion that Mr. Felkner's free speech rights were not violated in this regard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The same is likewise true of Mr. Felkner's contention that he was not permitted to engage in the field placement that he chose or to work on the topic of welfare reform for his integrative project. Once again, I am in agreement with the hearing justice that it is clear from the record that Mr. Felkner was ultimately permitted to do the field placement he chose and to work on welfare reform for his integrative project. Therefore, these claims also have no merit.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Beauregard v. Gouin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307998\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/66/489/#p494\">\n     66 A.3d 489\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 494 (R.I. 2013) (stating that a \"[c]omplete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Moreover, with respect to the delay resulting from Mr. Felkner's seeking approval of the field placement and integrative project topic that he wanted, the hearing justice pointed out that he was given an extension of time within which to complete his integrative project. As the hearing justice noted, Dean Carol Bennett-Speight granted Mr. Felkner an extension to complete his degree requirements on the condition that he submit his problem statement and methodology to his advisor by a certain date and submit a plan outlining how he would finish the project by a certain date. Dean Bennett-Speight expressly required Mr. Felkner to acknowledge his understanding and acceptance of these conditions. The hearing justice is correct that the record reflects that Mr. Felkner inexplicably failed to do so. After he had\n    been given ample time to comply with the just-referenced condition precedent, Professor Pearlmutter informed him that he was no longer considered to be a student in the social work program at RIC. In my opinion, it could be convincingly contended that Mr. Felkner's complete and bewildering failure to take advantage of the proffered extension is nearly determinative of this entire case. Mr. Felkner was given the opportunity to finish his integrative project as a stepping stone towards being granted a master's degree, and he did not make even the minimal effort of informing RIC as to whether or not he was accepting the extension and its conditions. Therefore, in my opinion, it was through the fault of no one but himself that Mr. Felkner did not ultimately obtain a master's degree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    With respect particularly to Mr. Felkner's retaliation claim, the hearing justice did not err in concluding that, as to the just-discussed occurrences, Mr. Felkner was unable to show that he was engaged in constitutionally protected speech; that being the case, any retaliation claim must fail.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McCue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362159\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/334/#p338\">\n     807 F.3d at 338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Mr. Felkner further alleges, in regard to his retaliation claim, that Professor Pearlmutter penalized him with respect to his grade in her class due to the fact that he worked with students who were not fellow students in his class. However, grading is a function of the often somewhat subjective assessment criteria of a particular professor, and this Court is not in a position to second-guess such a decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Board of Curators of University of Missouri v.

As such, Mr. Felkner's retaliation claim in this regard also must fail. I would echo the hearing justice's perceptive statement that Mr. Felkner \"seems to consider free speech a one-way street.\" I believe that that assessment is also applicable to Mr. Felkner's complaint about various e-mail communications he had with RIC professors wherein they stressed the progressive nature of the School of Social Work.

Here, the ASC's hearing on plaintiff's failing grade would clearly be considered academic because it concerned Felkner's scholastic performance and, so, little process was constitutionally required in those proceedings. On the other hand, in the second hearing, because Felkner faced a possible expulsion from RIC's MSW program for allegedly and deceptively recording his teachers and fellow pupils-a penalty born from an issue with his professional ethics-more process was required from the ASC in the disciplinary hearing, despite the ASC's contention that this hearing was also academic.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    However, no one has contended-and neither do I-that the ASC failed to give plaintiff a hearing in either case.

However, that court also stated that it \"recognize[d] there may be some proceedings where written findings of fact would be required[,]\" because the cost to a school to issue such findings is minimal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p642\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p642\">\n     at 642\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Flaim\n    </em>\n    , the court held that, under the circumstances presented in that case, due process did not require the disciplinary committee to issue written findings of fact in light of the fact that the board expelled the plaintiff for a felony drug conviction, an obvious violation of the school's \"zero-tolerance policy\" regarding drugs.\n    <em>\n     Flaim\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p642\">\n     418 F.3d at 633, 642\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, I believe that there is at least an issue of material fact as to whether the ASC's written decision was adequate in light of the fact that one member of the committee doubted whether there was any ethical basis to discipline Felkner.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Moreover, in its decision letter to Felkner, the committee merely cited to Section 4.04 of the NASW Rules of Ethics-which does not specifically prohibit recording of classroom discussions-without any further explanation or findings of fact as to how the recording of conversations violated that provision. Thus, there is some question as to whether the basis of the ASC's decision was obvious.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p642\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936002\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/629/#p642\">\n     at 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Furthermore, the lack of written findings may well have affected the meaningfulness of any appeal and, thus, Felkner's due process rights, stymying him from presenting cogent reasons for appeal, because Felkner might not have been able to prepare a proper response; nor would those responsible for hearing such appeal be able to conduct a proper review of his\n    case without such findings. In the administrative setting, this Court generally requires \"an ample decisional demonstration of the grounds upon which an ultimate conclusion is predicated[,]\" to \"facilitat[e] judicial review, avoid[ ] judicial usurpation of administrative functions, assur[e] more careful administrative consideration, help[ ] parties plan their cases for rehearings and judicial review, and keep[ ] agencies within their jurisdiction.\"\n    <em>\n     Hooper v.

Although the defendants may still ultimately prevail on this issue, I believe that Felkner at least presented a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether the ASC was required to create some form of record in the disciplinary proceedings. Additionally, I would hold that there was a material dispute as to the sufficiency of the written decision. The cost of both of these procedures was slight when compared to the danger of an erroneous deprivation of Felkner's right to receive an education.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gorman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1772989\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/7/#p12\">\n     837 F.2d at 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    While I concur in most of the majority opinion, for the above-stated reasons, I must respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-194\">\n     I sincerely acknowledge the thoughtful nature of the majority opinion and that of my esteemed colleague who concurs in part with the majority opinion and dissents in part from it.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-195\">\n     Moreover, although written in the context of the workplace rather than with respect to academia, there is profound common sense and wisdom in the following observation by Judge Bruce Selya in the case of\n     <em>\n      Suarez v.
