The trial court ordered the School District to pay $3,023,067, plus interest, to the Intermediate Unit for special education services it had provided to the School District's students over the course of several years. On appeal, the School District argues that it did not have a contractual obligation to make these payments because the Intermediate Unit did not issue invoices for these services in a timely manner. The School District also argues that the Intermediate Unit was not entitled to invoke\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus occurrit regi\n   </em>\n   (\"time does not run against the king\") to defeat the applicable statute of limitations that barred at least some of the Intermediate Unit's breach of contract claims. Finally, the School District argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding interest on the judgment. For the reasons to follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Intermediate Unit provides special education services to students in 42 school districts and five vocational schools in Allegheny County, including those enrolled in the School District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joint Stipulation of Facts, \u00b6 2; Reproduced Record at 299a (R.R. ___). The Intermediate Unit provides \"District Based\" services in the School District's classrooms and \"Center Based\" services in schools operated by the Intermediate Unit. Joint Stipulation of Facts, \u00b6 15; R.R. 301a. Beginning with the 2009-2010 school year, and for each of the school years between 2010-2011 and 2014-2015, the Intermediate Unit and the School District entered into a separate \"Educational Services Agreement\" (contract) with respect to these special education services. Under each contract, the Intermediate Unit agreed to provide special education services to the School District's students, and the School District agreed to pay the Intermediate Unit for the services it provided. Each yearly contract\n   imposed a payment schedule upon the School District. For example, for the 2011-2012 school year, the contract provided that the School District was to remit its payment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-12\">Sept. 15, 2011 20% of total 10/11 bill as advance payment for the 2011/2012 school year. Nov. 15, 2011 25% of actual billing for 11/12 based on student information in the Special Education Database. Advance (20%) payment will be <em>deducted</em> from the total bill. Feb. 15, 2012 25% of actual bill based on student information in the Special Education Database. March 15, 2012 25% of actual bill based on student information in the Special Education Database. May 15, 2012 25% of actual bill based on student information in the Special Education Database.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   R.R. 536a (emphasis in original). Each successive contract contained a substantially similar payment schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to the inception of the 2010-2011 school year, the School District requested a modification to the above-stated payment schedule because of its financial difficulties, and the Intermediate Unit agreed. Under the modification, the Intermediate Unit agreed to invoice the School District $75,000 a month for 10 months; at the end of the school year, the Intermediate Unit would issue an invoice that reconciled the School District's accumulated payment to the actual cost of services provided. The modification, memorialized in an email dated August 26, 2010, stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We will invoice [the School District] mid September. The invoice will be $75,000 based on the estimate (that was mailed out prior to the new year starting) divided by 10 months. Obviously, the final invoice (June) will be reconciled based on the actual utilization of services....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   R.R. 881a. The modification was agreed to by the parties in each successive contract, with an increase in the monthly payment to $85,000 for the 2014-2015 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Spring of 2015, the Intermediate Unit discovered that it had not issued the above-described reconciliation invoice for several school years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 2, 2015, the Intermediate Unit sent the School District the reconciliation invoice for the 2014-2015 school year. Joint Stipulation of Facts, \u00b6 27; R.R. 303a (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summary Spreadsheet at R.R. 503a-16a). Then, on June 16, 2015, the Intermediate Unit issued final reconciliation invoices for each contract year. Joint Stipulation of Facts, \u00b6 28; R.R. 303a (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summary Spreadsheet at R.R. 872a-75a). The School District informed the Intermediate Unit that it would not pay any of the invoices, including the invoice for the 2014-2015 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2016, the Intermediate Unit filed the instant action against the School District for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The Intermediate Unit asserted that the School District breached the parties' contract by not paying in full for the special education services it had received for the school years 2010-2011\n   through 2014-2015. The Intermediate Unit contended that the School District owed $3,300,250, plus interest, for services provided over the five school years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Initially, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the question of whether the statute of limitations barred any part of the Intermediate Unit's breach of contract action. By order of September 12, 2017, the trial court denied the School District's motion, holding that the Intermediate Unit, as an agency of the Commonwealth, could invoke the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus occurrit regi.\n   </em>\n   The parties then addressed the issues of liability and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties filed a joint stipulation of facts and motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. Following argument, the trial court granted the Intermediate Unit's motion, holding the School District liable for breach of contract. The trial court denied the School District's motion for partial summary judgment on liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 13, 2017, the trial court conducted a trial on the issue of damages. At trial, the Intermediate Unit offered evidence that upon further reconciliation, the amount the School District owed was $3,023,067. Thereafter, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On February 5, 2018, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Intermediate Unit in the amount of $3,023,067, and interest in the amount of $194,483.98, for a total judgment of $3,217,550.98. The trial court assessed 12% annual interest, to accrue from the date of the order until final payment on the judgment. On March 16, 2018, the trial court denied the School District's motion for post-trial relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the School District raises several assignments of error by the trial court. First, the School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that it breached its contract with the Intermediate Unit. Second, the School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that the statute of limitations did not bar the Intermediate Unit's breach of contract claims that arose prior to March 4, 2012. Third, the School District argues that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding interest at the rate of 12%\n   <em>\n    per annum.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that it breached its contract with the Intermediate Unit because the condition precedent to its duty to make payment did not occur. Specifically, it argues that each contract required the Intermediate Unit to issue a reconciliation invoice in June of each school year, and the Intermediate Unit did not satisfy this condition precedent. Accordingly, the School District did not have a duty to pay the untimely invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For a breach of contract claim, a party must show: \"(1) the existence of a\n   contract; (2) a breach of the duty imposed by the contract; and (3) damages resulting from the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Sewer Authority of City of Scranton v.

Cmwlth. 2017) (citing 17A AM. JUR. 2d,\n   <em>\n    Contracts\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 452 at 440 (2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, each contract obligated the School District to pay the Intermediate Unit for the special education services provided to its students. Each contract states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The [School] District agrees to pay the [Intermediate Unit] the sum of the estimated cost of each program or service, such sum to be paid in installments in accordance with [the payment schedule.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R.R. 84a. The modification states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The invoice will be $75,000 based on the estimate (that was mailed out prior to the new year starting) divided by 10 months. Obviously, the final invoice (June) will be reconciled based on the actual utilization of services....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   R.R. 881a. The modification was limited to the payment schedule and did not have any impact upon the School District's contractual duty to pay for the special education services it actually received. To the contrary, the modification made it clear that there would be a final reconciliation and that payment for \"actual utilization of services\" was required. The possibility that the 10 monthly payments would exactly equal the services rendered over 12 months was unlikely in the extreme. Simply, the language of the modification cannot be construed to state a condition precedent that may, or may not, take place. We reject the School District's contention otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Alternatively, the School District argues that the trial court erred because the Intermediate Unit cannot recover for its unilateral mistake. The School District contends that the modification was specific as to when the Intermediate Unit was to send the reconciliation invoice,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in June of each contract year. The failure of the Intermediate Unit to do so was a mistake, and this negligence bars the Intermediate Unit's breach of contract action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   19. On August 26, 2010 [the] Assistant Director of Finance at the [Intermediate Unit] entered into an arrangement with [ ] the Business Manager for [the School District], to modify the parties' [contract] so that [the School District] would\n   be invoiced in [sic] a monthly basis starting in mid-September of 2010. Pursuant to the arrangement, the [Intermediate Unit] was expected to invoice [the School District] $75,000 per month for ten months with a reconciliation to be issued at the end of the school year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   20. Per the modified payment arrangement, [the School District] understood and agreed that at the end of the school year, the remaining balance owed by [the School District] to the [Intermediate Unit] for the special education services received was to be \"reconciled\" and invoiced to [the School District].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Joint Stipulation of Facts, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20; R.R. 302a. This stipulation established that at the end of the school year both parties \"understood\" that the \"remaining balance\" would be \"reconciled and invoiced.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320075\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/1187/#p1195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the stipulation did not identify the parties' \"understanding\" as to the date for the issuance of the reconciliation invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The modification stated that the \"final invoice (June) will be reconciled based upon the actual utilization of services.\" R.R. 881a. This language established how the final invoice would be calculated,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on the basis of actual services provided through the school year. However, the aside \"(June)\" does not state a specific deadline for the Intermediate Unit to issue the reconciliation invoice. Stated otherwise, there is no foundation to the School District's \"mistake\" argument because there was never a definitive \"understanding\" about the date for the issuance of the reconciliation invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We reject the School District's contention that the modification established a condition precedent to the School District's obligation to pay the Intermediate Unit for services or that there was a \"mistake\" by the Intermediate Unit that barred its breach of contract action. Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial court's holding the School District liable to pay the Intermediate Unit for the special education services it provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The School District next argues that the trial court erred by holding that the Intermediate Unit's claims that arose prior to March 2012 were not barred by the statute of limitations. Specifically, it contends that the four-year statute of limitations for contract actions prevented the Intermediate Unit from asserting a claim for payment of services provided prior to March 4, 2012. The School District argues that the trial court erred in holding that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    nullum tempus occurrit regi\n   </em>\n   excused the Intermediate Unit from the four-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In Pennsylvania, a breach of contract action must be commenced within four years. The Judicial Code states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   General rule.-Except as provided for in subsection (b) [ (an action relating to damages in actions for identity theft) ], the following actions and proceedings must be commenced within four years:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (8) An action upon a contract, obligation or liability founded upon a writing not specified in paragraph (7) [relating to a bond], under seal or otherwise, except an action subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   42 Pa.
