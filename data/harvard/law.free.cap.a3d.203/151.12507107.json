Plaintiff cross-appeals and asserts the trial court should have granted her request for alimony to replace the value of her lost pension benefit. Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Howell v. Howell\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), we hold a trial court may not indemnify a payee spouse when the payor spouse waives a military pension and receives veteran disability retirement benefits. However, a court is free to treat the pension waiver as a change in circumstances and may award the payee alimony or modify it. We reverse and remand the trial court's order for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the record. The parties were divorced in 1997, following a thirty-five-year marriage. At the time, both parties were fifty-five years of age. The terms of the parties' divorce were memorialized in a six-page consent dual final judgment of divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment included a mutual alimony waiver, which reads as follows: \"Plaintiff and defendant each hereby waive alimony as to the other party now and in the future.\" As to equitable distribution, the judgment provided defendant would retain the former marital residence located in Hamilton, and the mortgage obligation associated with it, and pay plaintiff $ 55,000 as her share of the equity. The parties agreed to retain all bank accounts, automobiles, and credit card debt in his or her own name without a credit, offset, or liability to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judgment also divided the parties' pensions. Plaintiff, who had been employed as an operating room nurse in a hospital, had earned a modest pension. The parties agreed defendant had a fifty percent interest in the marital coverture portion of her pension, which had \"been offset against the equity in the marital home.\" Defendant was serving full time in the Army National Guard when the divorce occurred and had also accumulated a pension. The parties' judgment divided the marital coverture portion of the military pension equally as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff shall be entitled to receive fifty percent ... of defendant's military pension which was accumulated during the marriage ... via a [q]ualified [d]omestic [r]elations [o]rder [QDRO] to be prepared by attorneys for plaintiff. Plaintiff shall not be entitled to any post-judgment, pre-retirement cost of living increases related to said pension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A QDRO of defendant's military pension was completed in 1999. Defendant continued to serve in the Army, following the divorce, until he became disabled in 2002. At the time, defendant was able to collect his pension and disability benefits without any impact upon the pension payout. Defendant also received social security benefits. At some point, defendant opted for disability benefits, which he could receive tax free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The record reflects plaintiff never contacted defendant to inquire whether the pension was in pay status and defendant assumed she had received her share of the benefit. Although the parties share children and grandchildren, they had little communication during the intervening years since the divorce. In 2010, plaintiff contacted the office of the Army charged with administering the pension to inquire why she had not receive any payments. The response was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Please be advised that a portion of [defendant's] pay is based on disability. Therefore, it cannot be divided under the USFSPA [Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. The disability amount is used as an authorized deduction. In this case, when the disability amount is deducted from his gross pay along with the survivor benefit portion, there's nothing left for the community property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, plaintiff filed a motion to compel defendant to compensate her for her share of the military pension. The court conducted a plenary hearing over two days and considered the parties' testimony. The trial judge made oral findings and signed the February 25, 2017 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The judge accepted defendant's testimony his disability forced him to retire. She found defendant's monthly income to be as follows: military disability retirement $ 3400; VA disability benefits $ 3100; and social security $ 1800. Only the social security was taxable. The judge also noted defendant had remarried and his wife was gainfully employed. The judge credited defendant's testimony he did not intentionally seek to deprive plaintiff of her share of the pension, by seeking disability benefits because neither he nor plaintiff knew of the applicable federal law. Nevertheless, she found the circumstances worked an unfair result. The judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [D]efendant took an incredibly unreasonable position, in that, looking at the statute per se, a QDRO could not be implemented whereby ... plaintiff could no longer receive her [fifty] percent of the coverture value of ... defendant's military pay, because now it's been converted to [one-hundred] percent non-taxable VA benefits that are exempt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   That doesn't mean that she loses the interest. Even ... defendant, when questioned ... by this [c]ourt ... didn't\n   think it was fair, and neither does the [c]ourt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial judge also rejected defendant's argument plaintiff had \"sat on her rights\" and was barred from seeking relief, because plaintiff had \"limited funds\" and could not hire counsel in 2010. The judge noted plaintiff had retired in 2013, and had to move out of Mercer County because her social security and pension totaled $ 22,848 per year. According to plaintiff's testimony, a condominium she had purchased in a more affordable area had lost nearly one-half of its value. The judge noted plaintiff had a \"bare bones budget\" of $ 39,540 per year, which still exceeded her income and required she sell assets to meet her needs. Conversely, the judge found defendant had \"tax free income of over $ 80,000 per year\" and \"his budget is only $ 74,436 [per year].\" These figures did not include his wife's earnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result, the judge appointed a pension appraiser \"to determine the value of plaintiff's coverture interest in ... defendant's pension at the time the parties executed their ... judgment of divorce.\" The judge ordered\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [i]n the interim, ... defendant shall pay directly to ... plaintiff the sum of $ 1800 per month, to be paid in a lump sum by the first of every month .... This payment is not to be considered an alimony payment as suggested by [plaintiff's counsel], [although] that could be a course that this [c]ourt could take but, rather, it's an equitable distribution payment and, therefore, said payments are not deductible by ... defendant nor taxable to ... plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The judge ordered defendant to pay plaintiff the $ 1800 by either utilizing the cash surrender value from liquidation of a life insurance policy or by paying her the sum directly, which the judge noted equaled his social security receipts. The judge stated the payment of defendant's social security funds to plaintiff was \"not to suggest that the [c]ourt doesn't believe that ... plaintiff should receive nothing from ... defendant's military pension. She is simply [to] get payment from some other income or from some other asset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The judge reached the conclusion to compensate plaintiff for the lost pension benefit by citing our decision in\n   <em>\n    Whitfield v. Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    373 N.J.

There, relying upon the extant federal law, we affirmed a post-judgment order,\n   which required a spouse who had served in the military \"to compensate his former wife directly for the decrease in his pension occasioned by his voluntary election [of disability benefits] after the divorce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    862 A.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial judge recited our reasoning that \"[s]trong public policy considerations militate against permitting a retiree to unilaterally convert, for his own economic benefit, a portion of his military pension to VA disability and defeat his former spouse's prior equitable distribution award.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    862 A.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial judge noted we found the order under appeal in\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   was not preempted by federal law because it did \"not provide for an explicit allocation of disability benefits or require the military spouse to remit disability funds, specifically, to the non-military spouse. The order merely enforce[d] defendant's equitable distribution obligation to his former wife, which he may satisfy from any of his resources.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439861\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/373/573/\">\n    862 A.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Regarding the request for alimony, the trial judge held \"[t]he [c]ourt is denying plaintiff's request that ... defendant should now be compelled to pay alimony. Alimony is not compensation for equitable distribution. The parties waived alimony in this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additionally, the trial judge analyzed plaintiff's request for counsel fees, and concluded she had filed the post-judgment motion in good faith and had no ability to pay her counsel fees. The judge rejected defendant's position of offering nothing to plaintiff. She found defendant's contention federal law did not permit his pension to be distributed by means of a QDRO, was unreasonable. The judge awarded plaintiff $ 10,000 in counsel fees. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We defer to a trial judge's factfinding \"when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cesare v.

Although the waiver of alimony was mutual, we need not speculate what defendant's reasons for waiving it were because his waiver stands separate, and presumably had separate consideration, from plaintiff's waiver. However, the record readily demonstrates plaintiff gave valuable consideration for the waiver of alimony in exchange for the promise of the future ability to share in defendant's military pension. Moreover, as defendant notes in his reply brief, his earnings were approximately thirty-four percent greater than plaintiff's at the time of the divorce. Thus, there was valuable consideration given by plaintiff in exchange for the alimony waiver, and the unforeseeable loss of the bargained for pension benefit was a substantial and permanent change in circumstances, which invalidated the waiver. Upholding the alimony waiver in these circumstances would be wholly unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We agree with defendant that there was not a \"full record\" created to address what alimony should be awarded. The gravamen of the trial judge's decision addressed the parties' dispute through the lens of equitable distribution. Defendant cites his age as a reason why alimony is inappropriate. Although we draw no conclusion on that account, we note the court may consider defendant's assets, or income from assets,\n   as a potential source for an alimony award as long as it is not a dollar-for-dollar indemnification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(b)(10) and (11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, we agree with defendant's argument that plaintiff's alimony claim is primarily tethered to the former marital lifestyle.\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792999\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/225/34/#p45\">\n    225 N.J. at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792999\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/225/34/#p45\">\n    137 A.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial judge characterized the parties' marital lifestyle as \"frugal.\" Even so, this does not obviate an award of alimony to plaintiff because an alimony determination requires an assessment of \"the quality of economic life during the marriage, not bare survival.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071575\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/164/11/#p24\">\n    164 N.J. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1071575\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/164/11/#p24\">\n    751 A.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lepis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"351533\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/83/139/#p145\">\n    83 N.J. at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20A.2d%2045\">\n    416 A.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Moreover, the Legislature has stated an alimony determination shall consider \"[t]he standard of living established in the marriage ... and the likelihood that each party can maintain a reasonably comparable standard of living, with neither party having a greater entitlement to that standard of living than the other.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:34-23(b)(4).

Therefore, we are constrained to reverse the award of counsel fees. However, we hasten to add that the record demonstrates plaintiff has no ability to pay counsel and the need for a contribution to her counsel fees. A Family Part judge is empowered to make an award of counsel fees to enable the parties to litigate on an even playing field \"irrespective of that party's success in the matrimonial action.\"\n   <em>\n    Anzalone v.
