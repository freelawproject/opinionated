Urquhart was poor and needed a public defender. In the five months before trial, three different public defenders represented Urquhart at preliminary court hearings. A fourth public defender would be his trial counsel, assigned to defend\n  Urquhart against charges carrying a lengthy minimum prison sentence.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Because of a trial the preceding week, and other professional commitments before that, Urquhart's trial counsel did not meet with Urquhart to prepare for trial. The morning of trial was also the first time trial counsel showed Urquhart the State's key evidence against him. Before jury selection, Urquhart expressed frustration and confusion to the court about seeing his trial counsel for essentially the first time the morning of trial and seeing the State's evidence against him. Trial went ahead, and a Superior Court jury convicted Urquhart of all charges. The judge sentenced him to fifteen years in prison. We affirmed the convictions on direct appeal.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Urquhart moved for post-conviction relief, and claimed that his trial counsel's absence before trial denied him his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. The Superior Court denied the motion. The question is now before us-whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel in a serious felony trial requires more than the mere presence of a defense attorney the day of trial. We find that it does, and reverse Urquhart's conviction and remand for a new trial.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Urquhart v.

A security camera captured the robbery. A witness told police she saw someone flee the area in a four-door green sedan and gave police the license plate number. The car belonged to Caree Matsen, who told police she loaned the car to her sister's boyfriend, Urquhart. The police found Urquhart's belongings in Matsen's sister's bedroom, and found cell phone photos of him wearing a black hooded North Face jacket. Police arrested Urquhart on July 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State charged Urquhart with first degree robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, first degree reckless endangering, and possession of a firearm by a person prohibited. Urquhart could not afford a private attorney, and was assigned a public defender.

I'm asking for help.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Instead of trial counsel speaking up and asking for a continuance, the court put the onus on Urquhart to request a delay. Urquhart declined, and trial proceeded that day. After a three-day trial, the jury convicted Urquhart of all charges, and the court sentenced him to forty-three years at Level V incarceration, suspended after fifteen years, followed by decreasing levels of supervision. He appealed on June 8, 2015, and this Court affirmed his convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Superior Court eventually appointed new counsel to represent Urquhart in post-conviction proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Urquhart claimed in his postconviction motion that trial counsel's failure to meet with him and prepare for trial deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. The claim was not, however, stated as a typical ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the United States Supreme Court case\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   where a defendant must prove both counsel's ineffectiveness and prejudice. Instead, Urquhart relied on a United States Supreme Court case decided the same day as\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cronic\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that, when the accused is completely denied counsel at a critical stage of the judicial proceedings, the accused is excused from demonstrating prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Urquhart argued that he was excused from demonstrating prejudice because trial counsel failed to represent him in the critical pretrial stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Superior Court agreed with the State that the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   decision required that Urquhart's counsel be \"completely absent\" from representation to forgo\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   prejudice requirement. Because trial counsel supposedly met with Urquhart once, spoke on the telephone with him twice, and sent him five letters before trial, the Superior Court found that trial counsel was not completely absent during the pretrial proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Urquhart could only pursue an ineffectiveness claim under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , which required a showing of prejudice. Because Urquhart did not argue prejudice, the Superior Court denied postconviction relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court reviews the denial of a motion for postconviction relief for an abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Legal and constitutional questions are reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With any appeal from a motion denying postconviction relief, we first address whether Urquhart's motion is timely\n   and meets the requirements of Superior Court Criminal Rule 61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is Urquhart's first motion for postconviction relief. It was filed within one year after conviction. Further, a Sixth Amendment claim arguing ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be raised on direct appeal and thus his motion is not repetitive or procedurally defaulted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Urquhart's claims are not barred or procedurally defaulted under Rule 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As another preliminary matter, we address the State's argument that Urquhart waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claims by stating the morning of trial he was not dissatisfied with his trial counsel and declined, in the Superior Court's words, a \"\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \" continuance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the State, \"Urquhart could have obtained a continuance and gone over any evidentiary questions with his attorney, and taken more time to prepare his defense, but he declined.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, he \"affirmatively waived any claim regarding trial counsel's pretrial performance and alleged lack of communication.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   An accused's waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Urquhart was in a state of confusion when the trial judge addressed him about a continuance. He expressed a lack of understanding of his predicament and requested help over ten times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   When first asked whether he wanted the continuance, Urquhart's answer was to ask for clarification about the State's evidence he had seen for the first time. Neither the judge nor Urquhart's trial counsel responded to his question-the judge merely rephrased the question, stating \"Mr. Urquhart, what I am asking you is are you asking me to delay the trial?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was then that his trial counsel should have spoken up to address Urquhart's confusion or request a continuance on his behalf. Instead, Urquhart's trial counsel focused solely on explaining to the judge his reasons for failing to meet with Urquhart. The judge stated that he understood counsel's caseload, telling him not to feel that he was \"personally at issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While Urquhart's trial counsel was not responsible for his caseload, it did cause trial counsel not to meet with his client to prepare for trial and should have led him to pause and ask the court for a continuance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Harden v. State\n   </em>\n   , while \"the heavy caseloads that too many of our defense counsel carry may impel them to push ahead without reflecting on the need for more time\" this does not negate counsel's responsibility \"to take the time necessary to develop a reasoned approach to [trial] with the client's input.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewed in the context of Urquhart's overall response to the court's questions-repeated requests for help and clarification-and trial counsel's failure to speak up and request a continuance for the benefit of his client, we find that Urquhart did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to later appeal his trial counsel's failure to provide effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We now reach the heart of this appeal-whether trial counsel's failure to meet with his client and prepare for trial violated Urquhart's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in his criminal trial. On appeal, Urquhart and the State essentially reiterate the arguments made in the Superior Court-for Urquhart, trial counsel's complete absence from the critical pretrial stage of the criminal proceedings was indisputably ineffective, and under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   prejudice need not be shown-and for the State, that counsel was not \"completely absent\" pretrial, his claim fell under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and not\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , and thus Urquhart was not excused from demonstrating prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" The accused's right to counsel \"is a fundamental component of our criminal justice system.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" 'Of all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the right has such special value, \"[i]t has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"If no actual 'Assistance' 'for' the accused's 'defence' is provided, then the constitutional guarantee has been violated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

A complete denial of counsel occurs \"when a criminal defendant must navigate a critical stage of the proceedings against him without the aid of 'an attorney dedicated to the protection of his client's rights under our adversarial system of justice.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, \"bad lawyering, regardless of\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   bad, does not support the [\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   ] presumption.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   the question is not whether Urquhart's trial counsel was inadequate, but whether the inadequacy rose to a\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   denial of representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Superior Court held that Urquhart was not completely denied counsel under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   because he was represented at the preliminary hearing, arraignment, and both case reviews; and he received two phone calls and four letters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Urquhart correctly points out, however, that all but two of these occurrences took place before arraignment. The United States Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the most critical period of the proceedings\" is \"the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation [are] vitally important.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although different counsel represented Urquhart at court appearances before trial, for the nearly four months between arraignment and trial, Urquhart received what appears to be one non-substantive phone call and one transmittal letter from trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel's notes summarized the phone call: \"Spoke to client. Explained that I was in a trial. That discovery is still forth coming and that I would send it as I received it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This entry, trial counsel explained, was \"an indication to trial counsel that [he] pulled and reviewed discovery with the\n   client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the entry indicated that he reviewed discovery with Urquhart, trial counsel had not received the photos or surveillance footage, and, as Urquhart points out, \"[w]ithout that evidence, ... review of the discovery was inconsequential and did not provide [him] with an opportunity to appreciate the evidence against him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the November 14 letter, it contained a copy of the discovery trial counsel received from the State that had already been sent to Urquhart on September 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   This second copy still lacked the photos and surveillance footage-more than three months after the State had revealed their existence at the preliminary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   The grim reality is, in the critical pretrial phase when trial counsel must meet with his client to review the evidence, develop strategy, and prepare for trial, that did not occur. Trial counsel admitted as much when asked by the judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We would not be the first court to find a complete denial of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   in the pretrial phase when counsel was absent before trial and did not meet with his client to prepare for trial. In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Mason\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit found the defendant was completely denied counsel during the critical pretrial phase, when \"counsel was suspended from the practice of law for the month immediately preceding trial, ... met with [the defendant] for no more than six minutes over the seven-month period before trial, ... and the trial court repeatedly ignored [the defendant's] entreaties for counsel who would properly prepare a defense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court focused on counsel's duty to investigate, explaining there was no way to discharge the duty if he failed to consult with his client. The court concluded that, in these circumstances, \"no effort to consult with the client was made,\" and thus the defendant was completely denied his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel during a critical pretrial stage of the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The facts here are similar. While Urquhart's counsel was not suspended from the practice of law, he \"went from one trial into another trial into another trial\" over Urquhart's entire pretrial period-requiring different public defenders to represent Urquhart in his place at the pretrial hearings, including the final case review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, while counsel in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   met with the defendant for no\n   more than six minutes, Urquhart's counsel did not meet with him for almost four months before trial. Lastly, and most significantly, Urquhart's repeated requests for help were effectively pushed aside by his trial counsel and the court. Thus, following\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   would lead to the conclusion that Urquhart was completely denied counsel under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We recognize that the line between a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   violation and a\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   violation is not always easy to draw. Other courts have given\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   a limited reading, making a distinction between an actual complete denial of counsel and a constructive complete denial-the situation in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Superior Court took the conservative tack, and held that the mere presence of counsel satisfied\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , regardless of the degree of counsel's effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This appeal has elements of both a\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   and a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   violation, and leads us to the conclusion that the Sixth Amendment demands more than the presence the morning of trial of a warm body with a law degree. No one seriously argues that trial counsel's failure to meet in advance of trial with a client facing a serious felony charge with lengthy minimum mandatory jail time was effective. Under the stark facts in this appeal-no advance discussion with Urquhart of trial strategy, what witnesses to call, how to respond to the State's evidence, whether the defendant should testify, and no sober conversation with counsel outside the distractions of the morning of trial whether to enter into plea negotiations and accept a plea-the defendant should not have to point to any specific event of prejudice and disprove the State's contention that trial counsel was able to \"wing it\" enough at trial to satisfy the Sixth Amendment. As the Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , some situations \"ma[k]e it so unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective assistance that ineffectiveness [i]s properly presumed without inquiry into actual performance at trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even if specific prejudice need be shown, under a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis trial counsel's pretrial ineffectiveness prejudiced Urquhart in plea negotiations. Postconviction counsel did not argue prejudice, complicating our review of a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim. It would have been preferable for postconviction counsel to make a fully briefed\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim as an alternative to\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   . But, the State has consistently maintained that\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , applies to this appeal, and that Urquhart\n   has not demonstrated prejudice. Because the prejudice is manifest from the record, in the interest of justice, we will consider prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The reasonable probability standard under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   asks whether there is \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the context of a plea offer,\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   requires a reasonable probability \"that the plea offer would have been presented to the court ... that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   A fair trial does not \"wipe[ ] clean any deficient performance by defense counsel during plea bargaining.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Here, we think it is obvious that had the objective circumstances-the evidence the State was going to present, the length of time Urquhart faced if he went to trial and was convicted, and the likelihood of an acquittal-been the subject of professionally adequate consultation between client and counsel, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that Urquhart would have accepted the plea. That is all\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Trial counsel in a criminal case must discuss with his client the possibility of a plea instead of going to trial, especially if the State has offered to resolve the case for a sentence significantly shorter than the defendant could face if convicted at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plea discussions are sensitive, and for counsel to be effective in a case like this, counsel must build trust between attorney and client through pretrial contact, a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the State's case, and a frank discussion about the defendant's chances of an acquittal after trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of that happened here before the day of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   No\n   groundwork was laid, no trust was built up, and there was no review of the State's evidence against him. Whether in a fit of pique about his attorney's performance, a state of confusion, or because he was \"seeing things for the first time,\" \"getting things late,\" and \"needing help,\" Urquhart turned down a plea offer of ten years less than offered at the final case review. Had trial counsel performed his pretrial responsibilities, communicated with Urquhart, and had counsel had a rational conversation with him outside the distractions of the morning of trial, we think under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   there is a reasonable probability that \"the result would have been different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The parties have framed this dispute as a choice between two United States Supreme Court cases-\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . This appeal, however, has elements of both cases. Under\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   , its \"presumption of prejudice is the fundamental idea that a defendant must have the actual assistance of counsel at every critical stage of a criminal proceeding for the court's reliance on the fairness of that proceeding to be justified.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel was absent for the critical pretrial stage of Urquhart's prosecution. Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , \"prejudice can be shown if loss of the plea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on more serious charges or the imposition of a more severe sentence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Urquhart could not make informed decisions about the new plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Not all plea decisions, including decisions to enter a plea on the morning of trial, are subject to challenge for ineffective assistance of counsel. Obviously, there are material differences between a case when a defendant faces a modest sentence and the facts and law are not complex, and this case. In the former, defendant and counsel can often come to a reasoned decision in a compact time frame. But where, as here, the defendant faces serious charges and the possibility of generations of prison time, the need for a correspondingly serious effort to counsel the client must be recognized if\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   is to have its intended protective effect. And where, as here, defense counsel has not engaged in a meaningful review of the evidence with the defendant, who in turn tells the court that he is confused and needs help, we are unwilling to ignore trial counsel's shortcomings by saying that trial counsel did competent work at trial with what he had. The Sixth Amendment requires more than the physical presence of counsel the first day of trial in a serious felony case with the possibility of a lengthy minimum mandatory incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Superior Court's judgment is reversed, and the case remanded to the Superior Court. Although the defendant has asked for a new trial, we leave it to the Superior Court to decide whether a new trial should be ordered, or the State and the defendant agree on another remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jurisdiction is not retained.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The record is unclear which attorneys contacted Urquhart between August 14\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    and September 30\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    App. to Opening Br. at A53 (Pet'r's Am.

I would find that he was not completely denied counsel at any critical stage of the proceeding. Urquhart was represented by the Public Defender's Office continuously from his preliminary hearing to the completion of his direct appeal. An attorney from that office appeared with Urquhart at every court proceeding, including his three-day trial in the Superior Court. According to assigned trial counsel's affidavit, trial counsel met with Urquhart on August 14, 2014. In September 2014, trial counsel sent Urquhart the State's initial discovery response. On January 21, 2015, trial counsel obtained supplemental discovery from the State and on January 28, 2015, shortly prior to trial, sent it to Urquhart. As it developed, the supplemental discovery apparently did not reach Urquhart at the prison before the February 3 trial date. On the morning of trial, trial counsel discussed the case with Urquhart. In his affidavit, trial counsel described his discussion of the case with Urquhart:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   On the day of trial, client confirmed what he had told trial counsel at a previous discussion: client did not have any witnesses or alibi witnesses for his case. Prior to the start of Trial[,] counsel reviewed the evidence and determined what evidence was objectionable or unauthenticated, as well as what evidence was admissible. A review of the evidence was that there was no evidence placing my client in the getaway car. Client was correctly confident that no one would identify him as \"E.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Trial counsel was aware of Nyla Miller as a potential witness. Trial counsel and client were also aware of the fact that no witness would identify him as the getaway\n   driver or an operator of the car, and that Nyla Miller was absent from the Court. Prior to starting the trial, trial counsel and client discussed the facts concerning Nyla Miller, and agreed not to call her as a witness. We concluded that there was no tactical advantage to calling a witness who could not provide an alibi, and who could provide detrimental and incriminating evidence. Trial counsel decided not to attempt to secure her appearance for the second day of trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Trial counsel was aware of the fact that there was a witness who identified a black jacket worn by the perpetrator. Trial counsel made a professional decision not to pursue this witness. Prior to trial, trial counsel discussed with client the fact that the \"backhoe operator\" could not and did not identify the perpetrator. Trial counsel, with client consent, wanted to focus on the fact that the client had a large and distinguishable tattoo that was not visible on the store's video tape. Trial counsel had the video stilled, enlarged and presented as evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Trial counsel developed a strategy for trial and also discussed the State's morning-of-trial plea offer with Urquhart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   requires a complete denial of counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding, it is \"very narrow\" in scope and the burden of showing that it applies is \"very heavy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   I think the activities of the Public Defender's Office, including assigned trial counsel, set forth above, are sufficient to establish that Urquhart was not \"completely denied\" counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding. I would reject his\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   claim and find that he is not entitled to a presumption of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I would find that Urquhart's claim is governed by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States Supreme Court has stated that the difference between\n   <em>\n    Cronic\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   \"is not of degree but of kind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   They do not overlap. It is one or the other, but not both. Here, counsel can be criticized for not requesting a continuance, for not being more aggressive in obtaining the photos and surveillance footage earlier, for not investigating the case more thoroughly, for not meeting with Urquhart before the day of trial as the trial date approached, and perhaps for other things, but these are all\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is not enough for the defendant to show that errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The movant \"must make specific allegations of actual prejudice and substantiate them\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   these allegations\n   must show \"that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[I]t requires more than a showing of a theoretical possibility that the outcome was affected.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the defendant must prove actual prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The problem is that Urquhart has not presented a\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim in this appeal and has not claimed that trial counsel's conduct caused him any specific, actual prejudice. The Majority thinks that if trial counsel had done more pretrial preparation and discussed the case more fully with Urquhart before the morning of trial, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different; that is, Urquhart probably would have accepted the State's plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The record suggests otherwise. Urquhart's first case review was held on October 20, 2014. At that case review, no plea offer was made. His final case review was held on January 26, 2015, in the week preceding trial. At that time, the State made an offer with a fifteen-year minimum at Level V. Urquhart rejected that offer. On the morning of trial, the State made a revised plea offer of five years at Level V. Urquhart rejected that plea offer, stating to trial counsel, \"I rather do 95 years then [sic] take a plea to 5, [i]t all the same to me.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Urquhart's only opportunity to take the five-year plea offer was on the morning of trial. Whether Urquhart would have accepted the offer that morning if his trial counsel had done more preparation or spoken more with him before the day of trial is speculative. Urquhart has never even claimed that if trial counsel's representation had been different, he probably would have accepted the plea offer made to him the morning of trial. The idea that he would have accepted the plea offer if things had happened differently is not supported by the record. It is the kind of hypothetical, theoretical prejudice that the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard specifically rejects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   I would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n     466 U.S. 648\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2039\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n     80 L.Ed.2d 657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1984).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     466 U.S. 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     80 L.Ed.2d 674\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1984).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bell v.
