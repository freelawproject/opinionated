I \u00a7 8, cl. 4. Despite this seemingly clear grant of power, it took Congress a long while to establish federal bankruptcy law, and longer still for it to establish a permanent bankruptcy law that preempted existing state insolvency laws. Thus, there were long stretches during the 19th century in which Maryland had its own insolvency law that operated alongside, or even instead of, federal bankruptcy law. State insolvency laws were finally preempted in 1898\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Maryland's version remained dormant, on the books, until 1975 when it was deleted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   One provision of the old state insolvency law, however, survived: a provision that tolls causes of action against a debtor during insolvency proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   If a debtor files a petition in insolvency which is later\n   <em>\n    dismissed\n   </em>\n   , the time between the filing and the\n   <em>\n    dismissal\n   </em>\n   is not included in determining whether a claim against the debtor is barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Md.

Lowery proposes a broad interpretation, which would include\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   termination of a bankruptcy proceeding, not just dismissals. And because every bankruptcy must end, he argues, this statute tolls every creditor claim when a debtor enters bankruptcy, until the bankruptcy ends. Hoang, by contrast, advocates for a narrower reading that would limit \"dismissed\" and \"dismissal\" in CJ \u00a7 5-202 to only cases that are \"dismissed\" in modern federal bankruptcy practice, meaning dismissed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy), \u00a7 1112(b)(1) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy), or \u00a7 1307(b) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy). We will select an intermediate course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   There are three specific facts necessary to understand this case: (1) Hoang incurred a debt to Lowery in 2002; (2) Hoang filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and was denied a discharge; and (3) Hoang received $ 87,000 in 2016 out of which Lowery seeks to be paid for the 2002 debt. We explain the details of each below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The 2002 Debt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 11, 2002, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County entered a default judgment in favor of Lowery against Hoang for $ 16,987. Lowery has yet to collect on that judgment. With interest, Lowery's judgment totaled over $ 41,000\n   by July of 2016. A money judgment in Maryland expires after 12 years, unless it is renewed before it expires. CJ \u00a7 5-102(a)(3) (establishing the limitations period).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   All parties agree that Lowery did not renew that judgment within the 12-year period. Thus, the 2002 debt has been extinguished if it was not somehow extended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Hoang's Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hoang petitioned for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 10, 2005 and the bankruptcy court issued an automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (authorizing an automatic stay). A bankruptcy trustee was appointed to administer Hoang's bankruptcy estate. For reasons that don't concern us, Hoang's bankruptcy was converted into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on October 28, 2005. Hoang behaved badly and hid assets from the trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, on March 22, 2006, the Bankruptcy\n   Court issued an Order denying Hoang a discharge and lifting the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (authorizing denial of discharge);\n   <em>\n    In re Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286216\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/520/520/#p533\">\n    520 B.R. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533 (Bankr. E.D.Tex. 2014) (\"The denial of a debtor's discharge is akin to financial capital punishment. It is reserved for the most egregious misconduct by a debtor.\") (Cleaned up). Thus, Hoang's bankruptcy case remains open: the bankruptcy trustee has not yet finished marshalling her assets and distributing the proceeds to her creditors. We are informed that this process may still take years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The 2016 Recovery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In April of 2016, Hoang recovered $ 87,000 in the settlement of an unrelated real estate dispute. Pursuant to a deal struck with her bankruptcy trustee, half of the settlement, $ 43,500, went to the trustee for the benefit of her creditors and half went to Hoang's lawyer. Lowery learned of the settlement, however, and served a writ of garnishment in the amount of $ 41,294.31 (the amount of the original 2002 judgment plus interest).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Subsequent Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hoang moved to quash the writ of garnishment arguing that, as described above, Lowery's judgment was more than 12 years old and had expired pursuant to the 12-year statute of limitations in CJ \u00a7 5-102(a)(3). Lowery responded that his time for collecting the judgment had been extended by operation of CJ \u00a7 5-202. The circuit court agreed with Hoang, finding that CJ \u00a7 5-202 did not toll the limitations period on Lowery's judgment. Lowery appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The question that we must consider then is what the legislature intended when it adopted (and repeatedly readopted) the\n   precursor to what is now CJ \u00a7 5-202. If it meant the words \"dismissed\" and \"dismissal\" to mean what they mean in modern bankruptcy law, then Hoang's bankruptcy has not been dismissed and may never be dismissed. If so, Lowery must watch and wait. If Hoang's bankruptcy is ever dismissed, then he may resurrect his claim. Alternatively, if the legislature intended the words \"dismissed\" and \"dismissal\" to have a broader meaning, then perhaps \"dismissal\" also includes other resolutions of bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our use of the traditional methods of statutory interpretation is inconclusive. Although the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   discussed the meaning of dismissal as used in CJ \u00a7 5-202, it did not settle on a conclusive meaning and did not reach a result that decides this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have reviewed the remaining legislative history\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (of which there is little), as well as contemporaneous general dictionaries,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   contemporaneous legal dictionaries,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   contemporaneous legal practice manuals\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   -only to have emerged as uncertain as when we began. Fortunately,\n   however, we think a functional method of statutory interpretation provides a historically accurate and correct interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As we understand it, under traditional Maryland insolvency practice, the debtor's nonexempt assets would be gathered and turned over to a trustee and eventually, the creditors. 1805 Acts, ch. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5. In exchange, the debtor would receive a\n   discharge of debts and a fresh start. 1805 Acts, ch. 110, \u00a7 13. Of course, not all insolvencies reached this successful conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   1805 Acts, ch. 110, \u00a7 9 (precluding debtors who are convicted of deceiving their creditors from benefiting from the insolvency laws). The predecessor to CJ \u00a7 5-202 was adopted to ensure that creditors, whose debtors failed in obtaining a discharge, wouldn't be worse off for cooperating in the process. Thus, if an insolvency was successful, the creditors got the debtor's available assets. 1805 Acts, ch. 110, \u00a7 7. If the insolvency was unsuccessful, the creditors' claims were preserved and everyone was restored to their prepetition status. Operationally, this was accomplished by CJ \u00a7 5-202 extending the statute of limitations for the period during which the debtor was pursuing insolvency up until the court determined that it was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In modern bankruptcy, the vast majority of proceedings end in one of the same two ways that insolvency proceedings ended 200 years ago. A successful bankruptcy today results in a closure, by which the debtor's estate is fully administered for the benefit of the creditors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20350\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"After an estate is fully administered and the court has discharged the trustee, the court shall close the case.\"). The creditors recover what they can and the debtor receives a discharge and a fresh start. Alternatively, bankruptcy cases can end unsuccessfully, in a dismissal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy), \u00a7 1112(b)(1) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy), or \u00a7 1307(b) (providing for dismissal of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy). A bankruptcy can be dismissed for a host of reasons, including failure to pay certain fees and material default of the confirmed repayment plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (listing what constitutes \"cause\" for dismissing or converting a case). If the bankruptcy case is dismissed, the debtor does not receive a discharge, but instead the automatic stay is dissolved and dismissal \"restores the assets and parties to their prepetition status, as if the case had never been filed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Woodhaven, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6508441\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/139/745/#p748\">\n    139 B.R. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (Bankr. N.D. Ala. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Modern bankruptcy law, however, also permits a third possible outcome:\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   a denial of discharge. This is a rare occurrence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   reserved for the most misbehaving debtors.\n   <em>\n    In re Packer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286216\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/520/520/#p533\">\n    520 B.R. at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   effect of a denial of discharge is really the worst of both worlds for the debtor: the debtor remains in bankruptcy and his or her assets continue to be administered for the benefit of the creditors. BANKRUPTCY CODE MANUAL , \u00a7 727:8 (\"If a debtor is denied a discharge under \u00a7 727(a), the debtor remains liable for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   unpaid obligations. Moreover, the assets that the nondischarged debtor may acquire in the future are also subject to the claims of creditors.\"). But a debtor who is denied a discharge will never obtain a discharge in their case or a fresh start.\n   <em>\n    In re Olivier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126432,1710151\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/550/\">\n    819 F.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552 (5th Cir. 1987) (explaining that a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"entirely bars discharge\"). As we said before, however, the denial of discharge did not exist in Maryland insolvency law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lowery's solution is that every outcome in bankruptcy-successful or unsuccessful-ought to receive the benefit of the tolling provided by CJ \u00a7 5-202. This theory is obviously wrong. The state legislature in 1815 only extended the benefit of tolling to creditors when the debtor's insolvency was unsuccessful. We won't extend the benefit to a situation that the legislature clearly intended to exclude: a successful bankruptcy. Hoang's solution is that dismissal in 1815 meant exactly the same as what dismissal means today. She argues that because her bankruptcy hasn't been dismissed, her creditors are not entitled to the benefit of tolling. This seems wrong too. The legislature wouldn't have intended for the worst debtors to be treated better than merely unsuccessful debtors, like\n   those whose cases are dismissed for failing to pay the correct fees or failing to file correct information with the court within 15 days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We think that the solution is obvious. The legislature, in enacting CJ \u00a7 5-202, intended to hold creditors unharmed by preserving their otherwise time-barred claims while participating in an unsuccessful bankruptcy. That benefit was not necessary and therefore was not provided for creditors participating in a successful bankruptcy. We hold that that was the distinction that the legislature intended in 1815 and that we will enforce today by holding that creditors of debtors whose bankruptcies are dismissed, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20707\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \u00a7 1112(b)(1), \u00a7 1307(b), or denied a discharge, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are entitled to the tolling offered by CJ \u00a7 5-202.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This outcome, while not compelled by\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   , is certainly consistent with the Court of Appeals' statement that CJ \u00a7 5-202 was \"enacted to address the public's complaint that debtors manipulated the bankruptcy and insolvency process by entering bankruptcy, waiting for the statute of limitations to expire, and subsequently dismissing the bankruptcy proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695417\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/249/\">\n    416 Md. at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695417\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/416/249/\">\n    6 A.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

From this we know only that the lifting of the automatic stay is not a \"dismissal\" for purposes of CJ \u00a7 5-202.

Ch. 122 of the Acts of 1815 (full text in Appendix). Section 3 was the predecessor to CJ \u00a7 5-202 and used the word \"dismissal.\"\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 3. Section 2 described the procedure that creditors should take when reviving a judgment against the debtor, but used three terms: \"dismissal,\" \"withdrawing of any petition,\" and \"decisions thereon against the petitioner.\" Thus, if the drafters of the bill were using the word \"dismissal\" in \u00a7 3 in a manner that is consistent with how they used it in \u00a7 2, we might infer that \"dismissal\" does not include a withdrawal or an adverse decision. While interesting, this insight doesn't get us any closer to understanding what the drafters intended the scope of dismissal to be.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    We looked at, for example, John Ash , New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1795) (defining \"dismiss\" as \"[t]o send away, to give leave to depart, to discard, to divest from office\"); Noah Webster , A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language (1806) (defining \"dismiss\" as \"to send or put away, discard or dispose\"). These definitions in contemporaneous general dictionaries are, unfortunately, not very helpful in understanding what the legislature intended \"dismissal\" to include. Because the definitions do not specify why a case would be disposed of, they could be read broadly enough to encompass every reason a case ends (whether by dismissal or closure) or narrowly enough to include only cases that end due to dismissal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    We looked at, for example, John Bouvier , A Law Dictionary Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States of America (1839) (defining \"to dismiss a cause\" as \"removing a cause out of court without a formal hearing\"); Black's Law Dictionary (1st ed. 1891) (defining \"dismissal\" as \"[t]o send away; to discharge; to cause to be removed\"). These contemporaneous legal definitions are not helpful in understanding what the legislature intended \"dismissal\" to include. Although they tell us that a case is removed from the docket, the definitions don't tell us\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    a case may be removed, allowing the possibility that the legislature meant dismissal to be defined broadly, like Lowery advocates, to include termination for any reason, or narrowly, like Hoang prefers, to limit dismissal to the modern bankruptcy definition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    We have found two contemporaneous (or reasonably contemporaneous) legal practice manuals that explain Maryland insolvency law. Unfortunately, neither helps us resolve this case. Poe's Practice and Procedure, a Maryland civil procedure manual that includes insolvency practice, discusses the \"term \"dismissal\" only in the context of\n    <em>\n     involuntary\n    </em>\n    insolvency petitions. Poe's Practice and Procedure \u00a7 800 (1st ed. 1880). That doesn't help us because CJ \u00a7 5-202, by its terms, applies only to\n    <em>\n     voluntary\n    </em>\n    insolvencies and, in fact, Maryland didn't adopt an involuntary insolvency procedure until 65 years later, in 1880. John Dorsey's treatise on insolvency law described insolvency law in many states, but sometimes focused on Maryland's insolvency law. John L. Dorsey , A Treatise on the American Law of Insolvency 82 (1832).
