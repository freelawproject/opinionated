(SCI), MFS, Inc. (MFS) and Dana Corporation (Dana) in this wrongful death/product liability complaint based upon asbestos exposure. Plaintiff also appeals from denial of her motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. SCI cross-appeals from denial of summary judgment on the ground of successor liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Plaintiff is the executor of her husband\u2019s estate. In a series of amended complaints filed from May 1992 through November 1996, plaintiff alleged that her husband was exposed to asbestos that was manufactured, distributed, imported or used by numerous corporations. On August 22,1997, plaintiffs motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint was denied by Judge Rosemary Reav-ey. The complaint was originally filed in Monmouth County, but venue was ultimately transferred to Middlesex in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">On October 24,1997, Judge Reavey granted summary judgment in favor of SCI on the punitive damage claims and denied summary judgment on the remaining claims. On SCI\u2019s motion for reconsideration on November 21, 1997, Judge Reavey dismissed all of the claims against SCI because plaintiff failed to provide adequate proof that her husband was exposed to SCI\u2019s product, SprayDon. On October 24, 1997, Judge Reavey also granted summary judgment in favor of MFS and Dana on the same ground and on the additional ground that plaintiff failed to demonstrate successor liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>In essence, plaintiff argues two points against these three defendants: (1) that she established the decedent\u2019s exposure to SprayDon under the requirements of <em>Sholtis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 568 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989); and (2) that defendants are subject to successor liability in accordance with <em>Bussell v. DeWalt Products Corp., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 614 A.2d 622 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>431, 627 A.2d 1137 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The product SprayDon is at the core of this appeal. SprayDon was first manufactured in 1954 and contained approximately thirty percent asbestos until 1970, when it was reformulated to be asbestos free. Plaintiff alleges that her husband was employed by Sprayon Research Corp. for short periods of time in 1955 and again in 1960. The decedent was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1986 and died in 1990. Plaintiff concedes that \u201cthere is no evidence as to where [decedent] performed work\u201d for the company or that he was ever exposed to SprayDon. Nevertheless, plaintiff \u201casserts that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from [decedent\u2019s brief employment at Sprayon] is that his employer used the Spray Don product, which it had developed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Asbestos exposure cases present unique problems in litigation. Since injury from asbestos exposure is cumulative, and a plaintiff may be injured by a product long after his or her exposure, we have approached the issue differently, depending upon the facts presented. In <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 25, 568 A.2d 1196, we held that \u201cthe exposure to the products of ... defendant, whether proven directly or circumstantially, or if reconstructed or even risk-weighted, must have been a proximate cause of, <em>i.e., </em>a substantial factor in bring about, plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u201d We adopted the \u201cfrequency, regularity and proximity\u201d test as \u201ca fair balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>between the needs of plaintiffs (recognizing the difficulty of proving contact) and defendants (protecting against liability predicated on guesswork).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 568 A.2d 1196.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">At a summary judgment motion a plaintiff only need produce evidence from which a fact-finder, after assessing the proof of frequency and intensity of plaintiffs contacts with a particular manufacturer\u2019s friable asbestos, could reasonably infer toxic exposure. The affidavits, certifications and depositions must be read together anew, giving plaintiffs all favorable inferences. <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>[67,] 75, 110 A.2d 24 [(1954)] .... From these sources, the trial judge must determine whether a jury could reasonably infer that one or more of the ... defendants must share responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Therein lies plaintiffs problem in this case. Not only was the decedent\u2019s employment at Sprayon limited to a minimal period of time many years prior to his asbestos diagnosis, but plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the decedent was ever exposed to the product during his employment there. Rather, she asks us to <em>assume </em>that he was exposed to the product because the product was used by Sprayon during the brief time he was employed by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Plaintiff concedes that there is no evidence of the work decedent performed or of the Sprayon location at which he worked. Nevertheless, she presents the certification of Milo DeGugas, decedent\u2019s cousin, who attested that he worked as an \u201capplicator of sprayed mineral fiber which until 1970 or 71 contained asbestos.\u201d While he states that he was \u201ca co-worker on many occasions with Charles Provini,\u201d he never worked at Spray-on in 1955 or 1960 when the decedent was employed there. Rather, he worked at Sprayon in 1954, 1956, 1957 and 1958. DeGugas\u2019 certification is limited to the work <em>he </em>did and <em>his </em>exposure during <em>his </em>periods of employment. DeGugas\u2019 testimony cannot be used, even inferentially, as \u201cproof of frequency and intensity of plaintiffs contacts with a particular manufacturer\u2019s friable asbestos.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[A] determination [of] whether there exists a genuine issue with respect to a material fact [that precludes summary judgment] ... requires the motion judge to consider whether the competent evidential materials presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, ... are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In an asbestos case, plaintiff must present <em>prima facie </em>evidence of \u201can exposure of sufficient frequency, with a regularity of contact, and with the product in close proximity\u201d in order to hold a defendant strictly liable. <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 568 A.2d 1196. The absence of such evidence warrants dismissal on summary judgment. <em>R. </em>4:46-2(e); <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 523, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Since we have affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the issue of exposure, we need not reach the question of successor liability in plaintiffs appeal or SCFs cross-appeal. Nor do we reach plaintiffs appeal of the denial of leave to file a fifth amended complaint, which was based upon allegations of successor liability against Dana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Grandovic v.

Sandoz Pharm., Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>622, 633, 693 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> Plaintiff settled with Lac d'Amiante du Quebec, Ltee. and Armstrong Contracting &amp; Supply, Inc. The complaint against a number of defendants was dismissed because they filed petitions in bankruptcy, and the entire complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>was dismissed with prejudice on October 25, 2001.
