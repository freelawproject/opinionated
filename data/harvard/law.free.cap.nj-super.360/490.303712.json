Defendants appealed from the \u201cSecond Order Amending [the] Final Judgment and Other Relief,\u201d entered on October 10, 2001, awarding plaintiff a total of $1,324,585.20, plus post-judgment interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Approximately two months after oral argument before us, the parties advised the Clerk of this court that the case, which impacted on the administration of Dr. Pica\u2019s estate, had been settled in principle. We appreciate such advice, at the earliest opportunity, even before an actual settlement is reached, because it permits us to concentrate our time and resources on matters which must be decided and not an appeal which may subsequently become moot before an opinion is filed. We indicated our willingness to accommodate settlement efforts for a reasonable period of time and asked for a report on the status of such efforts by May 16, 2003. The parties did so. We are now advised that the parties have reached an amicable settlement of the underlying case, thereby resolving the appeal. Accordingly, we do not pass on any issue before the trial court, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Despite our appreciation of the communications from counsel in this case, we take this opportunity to remind the bar of its obligation, too often disregarded, to advise us, as expeditiously as possible, of a settlement or potential settlement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The appeal is dismissed with prejudice and without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-16\"> The award included $20,659.03 for \u201cpast lost wages,\u201d $47,962.19 for \u201cmedical expenses,\u201d and a molded 65% of the jury award for \"disability, impairment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>[and] loss of enjoyment\u201d in the amount of $975,000 plus $253,500 in interest on that award, and approximately $30,000 in fees and costs under the offer of judgment rule, <em>R. </em>4:58-2.
