The appeal also involves interpretation of a 1995 statute that allows a retail seller of an alleged defective product to be relieved of liability by filing an affidavit correctly identifying the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">On February 4, 1997, plaintiff sustained a serious injury to his right eye while operating a hydraulic punch press in the course of his employment at Norsal Distribution Associates (Norsal). According to the report of plaintiffs safety expert, the accident was caused by a design defect in the punch press\u2019s safety guard, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>allowed a piece of metal to shoot from the machine into plaintiffs eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At the top on the operator\u2019s side of the punch press is an oval panel which states in large capital letters: \u201cHELLER.\u201d This side of the punch press also has a small metal plate affixed which sets forth the machine\u2019s serial number, model, size and specifications. At the top of this plate is the name \u201cFICEP,\u201d followed in small letters by \u201cS.p.A\u201d At the bottom the name \u201cHELLER\u201d is repeated in capital letters next to the name \u201cE.G. HELLER\u2019S SON, INC.,\u201d also in capital letters, followed by Heller\u2019s address and telephone number. The back of machine has affixed another plate, which includes a sign with Heller\u2019s full corporate name and address, with the name \u201cHELLER\u201d and Heller\u2019s initials \u201cEHG\u201d in capital letters on both sides of the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Based on the labeling on the punch press, both plaintiff and his employer believed that the machine had been manufactured by Heller. Accordingly, on February 3, 1999, one day before expiration of the two-year limitations period, plaintiff filed this products liability action against Heller.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Heller was the only specifically named defendant, the complaint also joined as defendants \u201cABC Corporations 1-10\u201d and \u201cJohn Does 1-10,\u201d representing unidentified \u201cmanufacturers, distributors, designers, repairers and sellers\u201d of the punch press.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">On September 13, 1999, Heller filed a motion for leave to file a third-party complaint against FICEP, S.p.A. (FICEP). The certification in support of the motion simply stated that \u201c[pjretrial discovery has revealed the existence of a person or entity potentially liable for all or part of plaintiffs claim in this suit, specifically third-party defendant FICEP, S.p.A.,\u201d without indicating the basis of Heller\u2019s claim against FICEP. On October 8, 1999, the trial court granted Heller\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Because FICEP is an Italian corporation, Heller had to get its third-party complaint and summons translated into Italian and served in Italy. This process took several months. FICEP filed an answer to Heller\u2019s third-party complaint on March 23, 2000 and actively participated in the litigation from that point forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On March 9, 2001, the trial court entered a case management order which required all discovery to be completed by June 1, 2001 and stated that a trial would be scheduled in July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On May 2, 2001, plaintiff moved to amend its complaint to name FICEP as a direct defendant. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that plaintiff had \u201cknown the identity of FICEP for over a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Shortly after the denial of plaintiffs motion to add FICEP as a defendant, Heller moved for summary judgment on the basis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(a), which provides that the seller of a product may be relieved of liability by \u201cfil[ing] an affidavit certifying the correct identity of the manufacturer.\u201d In support of its motion, Heller filed an affidavit certifying that FICEP was the manufacturer of the punch press. On June 8, 2001, the trial court entered an order granting Heller\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Plaintiff appeals from the orders denying its motion for leave to add FICEP as a direct defendant and granting Heller\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\"><em>Rule </em>4:26-4 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">In any action, ... if the defendant\u2019s true name is unknown to the plaintiff, process may issue against the defendant under a fictitious name, stating it to be fictitious and adding an appropriate description sufficient for identification. Plaintiff shall on motion, prior to judgment, amend the complaint to state defendant\u2019s true name, such motion to be accompanied by an affidavit stating the manner in which that information was obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The identification of a defendant by a fictitious name, as authorized by <em>Rule </em>4:26-4, may be used only if a defendant\u2019s true name cannot be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>to filing the complaint. <em>Mears v. Sandoz Pharms., Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>622, 631-33, 693 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1997); <em>Cardona v. Data Sys. Computer Ctr., </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 235, 618 A.2d 864 (App.Div.1992). If a defendant is properly identified by a fictitious name before expiration of the applicable limitations period, an amended complaint substituting a fictitiously named defendant\u2019s true name will relate back to the date of filing of the original complaint. <em>Viviano v. CBS, Inc., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>538, 548, 503 A.2d 296 (1986); <em>Farrell v. Votator Div. of Chemetron Corp., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>111, 120-23, 299 A.2d 394 (1973). To be entitled to the benefit of this rule, a plaintiff must proceed with due diligence in ascertaining the fictitiously identified defendant\u2019s true name and amending the complaint to correctly identify that defendant. <em>Farrell, supra, 62 N.J. </em>at 120, 299 A.2d 394; <em>Johnston v. Muhlenberg Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 208, 740 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.1999). In determining whether a plaintiff has acted with due diligence in substituting the true name of a fictitiously identified defendant, a crucial factor is whether the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay in its identification as a potentially hable party and service of the amended complaint. <em>Farrell, supra, 62 N.J. </em>at 122-23, 299 A.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The trial court denied plaintiffs motion to substitute FICEP for a fictitiously named defendant solely on the ground that plaintiff failed to proceed with due diligence in moving to amend his complaint after learning FICEP\u2019s identity. However, FICEP argues, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that plaintiff failed to exercise due diligence in identifying FICEP as the manufacturer before filing his complaint. Consequently, we first consider whether plaintiff exercised due diligence in identifying FICEP as the manufacturer of the punch press before filing the complaint and second whether plaintiff acted with due diligence in substituting FICEP as a direct defendant once he became aware that FICEP, not Heller, was the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Plaintiff had a reasonable basis for believing that Heller was the manufacturer of the punch press. On the top of the operator\u2019s side of the machine is a panel which states in large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>capital letters: HELLER. In the middle on the same side of the punch press machine is a metal plate which sets forth the machine\u2019s serial number, model, size and specifications. At the top of this plate in large capital letters is the name \u201cFICEP,\u201d followed in small letters by the initials \u201cS.p.A.\u201d At the bottom of this plate, also in large capital letters, is the name HELLER, followed by its full corporate name, address and telephone number. The back of the machine also contains a metal plate with Heller\u2019s full corporate name, address and telephone number. On the top of this side of the machine, beside a logo, is the word \u201cFICEP\u201d in capital letters. However, there is no indication what this word signifies. Consequently, even if plaintiff had looked at the back of the machine, he could have reasonably thought FICEP was a Heller brand or product model name. Moreover, even if plaintiff noticed the initials \u201cS.p.A.\u201d after FICEP in the one place those initials appear, it would be unreasonable to expect a layman or even a lawyer to know that this is the Italian equivalent of \u201cInc.\u201d We also note that the principal of plaintiff\u2019s employer certified that he believed, based on the labeling placed on the machine and the prominent mention of Heller in the operating manual, that Heller was the manufacturer. Therefore, we reject FICEP\u2019s argument that plaintiff should have ascertained before filing his complaint that FICEP, not Heller, was the manufacturer of the punch press.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">We consider next whether plaintiff acted with due diligence in moving to substitute FICEP for a fictitiously identified defendant. When Heller moved for leave to file a third-party complaint, its supporting certification simply identified FICEP as a party \u201cpotentially liable for all or part of plaintiffs claim.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, this motion did not inform plaintiff that FICEP had manufactured the punch press. Moreover, FICEP\u2019s answer, filed on March 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>2000, did not identify FICEP as the manufacturer. However, plaintiffs counsel must have become aware through informal discussions with other counsel that FICEP was the manufacturer because he filed a certification on July 25, 2000, which stated that \u201c[t]he defendant manufacturer is an Italian company and has only been in this case for approximately three months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">After learning that FICEP was the manufacturer of the punch press, plaintiff did not move to name FICEP as a direct defendant until more than nine months later, on May 2, 2001. The question, therefore, is whether this nine-month delay manifested a lack of due diligence which justified the denial of plaintiffs motion to join FICEP as a direct defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The purpose of the requirement that a plaintiff exercise due diligence in ascertaining the true name of a fictitiously named defendant and promptly serve an amended complaint with the defendant\u2019s correct name is to prevent undue prejudice as a result of delay in that defendant being made aware of the action. <em>See Johnston, supra, 326 N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 740 A.2d 1122. However, even though \u201ca defendant suffers some prejudice merely by the fact that it is exposed to potential liability for a lawsuit after the statute of limitations has run[,]\u201d <em>Mears, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 631, 693 A.2d 558, absent evidence that \u201cthe lapse of time has resulted in a loss of evidenee[,] impairment of ability to defend\u201d or \u201cadvantage\u201d to plaintiffs, \u201cInjustice impels strongly towards affording the plaintiffs their day in court on the merits of their claim[.]\u201d <em>Farrell, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 122, 299 A.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In <em>arguing </em>that plaintiffs delay in moving to <em>name </em>it as a direct defendant constituted a lack of due diligence, FICEP relies upon cases in which service of an amended complaint identifying the true name of the fictitiously named defendant was a manufacturer\u2019s first notice that it was being sued. <em>See, e.g., Johnston, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 206-08, 740 A.2d 1122; <em>Mears, supra, </em>300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>at 632-33, 693 A.2d 558. In such a case, any delay in identifying and serving an amended complaint upon a fictitiously named defendant directly implicates the policy of repose a statute of limitations is designed to serve. <em>See Johnston, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 208, 740 A.2d 1122; <em>Mears, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 630, 693 A.2d 558. However, once FICEP was served with Heller\u2019s third-party complaint, it had notice of plaintiffs injury and of its potential liability. To protect its interests, FICEP then retained counsel and actively participated in the litigation, including taking plaintiffs deposition and submitting an expert report. FICEP has not suggested any additional discovery or other pretrial preparation it could have undertaken if it had been named as a direct defendant earlier. FICEP also should have reasonably anticipated it would be named as a direct defendant sooner or later. In short, FICEP has not shown that it suffered any prejudice as a result of plaintiffs delay in moving to name it as a direct defendant. <em>See Lawlor, supra, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 266 A.2d 569. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In 1995, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-8 to -9 <em>(L. </em>1995, c. 141), which allows a seller of an alleged defective product to be relieved of liability under certain circumstances by filing an affidavit correctly identifying the manufacturer of the product.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This legislation provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">a.

A product seller shall be liable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">(1) The product seller has exercised some significant control over the design, manufacture, packaging or labeling of the product relative to the alleged defect in the product which caused the injury, death or damage____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">There is no reported decision by a New Jersey court interpreting N.<em>J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9. Moreover, although a number of other states have enacted statutes that provide a similar defense to a seller that was not responsible for an alleged product defect, <em>see </em>1 <em>American Law of Products Liability 3d </em>\u00a7 5.15 at 30 (1994), we are not aware of any state with a statute containing language comparable to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, any decisions interpreting the statutes in other states would not be directly relevant to the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">There is no need to undertake a comprehensive review of the various subsections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9 in order to decide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>appeal. However, it is appropriate to outline the provisions relevant to Heller\u2019s argument that it relieved itself of potential liability for plaintiffs claim simply by identifying FICEP as the punch press manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Although the purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9, in the words of the sponsor, was \u201cto reduce litigation costs borne by innocent retailers in product liability actionsf,]\u201d Sponsor\u2019s Statement to S. 1495 of 1995, enacted as L. 1995, c. 141, the statute relieves a seller of liability only if it had no significant responsibility for the alleged product defect and the manufacturer is amenable to service of process and is likely to be able to satisfy any judgment. Thus, a product seller may be subject to liability if it \u201cexercised some significant control over the design, manufacture, packaging or labeling of the product relative to the alleged defect in the product which caused the injury, death or damage.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(d)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A product seller also remains subject to liability if \u201c[t]he manufacturer has no known agents, facility, or other presence within the United States,\u201d or \u201c[t]he manufacturer has no attachable assets or has been adjudicated bankrupt and a judgment is not otherwise recoverable from the assets of the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(c)(2),(3). Consequently, before a retail seller will be relieved of liability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9, it must be shown to be truly innocent of responsibility for the alleged defective product and the injured party must retain a viable claim against the manufacturer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>To assure that the injured party will retain a viable claim against the manufacturer after the seller is dismissed from the action, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Due diligence shall be exercised [by the seller] in providing the plaintiff with the correct identity of the manufacturer or manufacturers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">A seller\u2019s compliance with this due diligence requirement reduces the possibility that the plaintiff will be confronted, as in this case, with an assertion that he failed to exercise due diligence in amending his complaint to identify the true name of a fictitiously named manufacturer-defendant. In addition, a seller\u2019s early revelation of the manufacturer\u2019s identity enables a plaintiff to conduct discovery of the manufacturer before the passage of time results in a loss of documents or other information required to prove a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">A seller\u2019s compliance with the due diligence req\u00fairement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(b) also promotes efficient judicial management. A product seller\u2019s motion for dismissal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9 may require the plaintiff to conduct additional discovery that would not be required to show the existence of a defective product. Thus, a plaintiff would not have to obtain information relating to whether the manufacturer has \u201cknown agents, facilities] or other presence within the United States,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(c)(2), or whether it has \u201cattachable assets or has been adjudicated bankrupt^]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(c)(3), in order to prove a products liability claim, but discovery relating to these subjects may be necessary if a product seller seeks dismissal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(b) based on its certification of the manufacturer\u2019s identity. Consequently, unless the product seller identifies the manufacturer and moves for dismissal, during the prescribed discovery period, the plaintiff may be forced to seek an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>extension of time to conduct discovery that would be relevant only to the product seller\u2019s defense under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In this case, Heller did not send an affidavit to plaintiff certifying that FICEP was the manufacturer of the punch press and move for dismissal until May 10, 2001, on the eve of trial. However, as previously discussed, plaintiff was aware no later than July 2000 that FICEP was the manufacturer, and plaintiff could have joined FICEP as a direct defendant any time thereafter. Furthermore, we have concluded in section I of this opinion that plaintiff is entitled to maintain its product liability claim against FICEP. Under these circumstances, it would be unjust to foreclose Heller from obtaining dismissal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9(b) on the ground that it failed to comply with the due diligence requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9, especially in view of the fact that this statute has not previously been subject to judicial interpretation. Nevertheless, we caution product sellers that in future cases a motion for dismissal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9 may be denied based on a failure to comply with the due diligence requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In support of its motion for dismissal, Heller submitted a certification of Robert E. Heller, who identified himself as \u201can employee of E.G. Heller\u2019s Son, Inc.,\u201d which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">3. E.G. Heller\u2019s Son, Ine. does not manufacture Ironworkers and did not manufacturer the machine at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">4.

Therefore, if an affidavit supporting a factual assertion in a statement of material facts does not comply with <em>Rule </em>1:6-6, the assertion is not \u201csufficiently supported\u201d and thus will not be \u201cdeemed admitted\u201d even though it is not contested by a responding statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Robert Heller\u2019s certification did not comply with <em>Rule </em>1:6-6 because it did not indicate he had any personal knowledge of the facts he asserted. His assertion that FICEP had manufactured the punch press was \u201cbased upon the information provided to me.\u201d His assertions that FICEP was solvent and had not been adjudicated bankrupt and that Heller did not exercise significant control over the design, manufacture, packaging or labeling of the punch press were both introduced by the qualification: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d The mandate of <em>Rule </em>1:6-6 that an affidavit supporting a motion must be based on \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d is not satisfied by a statement \u201cbased merely on \u2018information and belief.\u2019 \u201d Pressler, <em>supra, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>1:6-6 (2003); <em>see Stowell v. N.J. State Ass\u2019n of Chiefs of Police, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 520-21 n. 2, 739 A.2d 1011 (App.Div.1999). Thus, Heller\u2019s statement of material facts in support of its summary judgment motion was not \u201csufficiently supported\u201d by competent evidence. Moreover, even if Robert Heller purported to have personal knowledge of FICEP\u2019s financial condition and Heller\u2019s role in the design, manufacture, packaging and labeling of the punch press, plaintiff would be entitled to conduct discovery concerning those allegations because they are based on information solely within the knowledge of FICEP and Heller. <em>See Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 193-94, 536 A.2d 237 (1988); <em>Bilotti v. Accurate Forming Corp., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>184, 206, 188 A.2d 24 (1963). Therefore, the summary judgment in Heller\u2019s favor must be reversed, subject to renewal upon completion of the discovery relevant to the availability of the defense provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the orders denying plaintiffs motion for leave to amend its complaint to add FICEP as a direct defendant and granting Heller\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The complaint also asserted a per quod claim on behalf of plaintiff\u2019s wife Beth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> We note that plaintiff could have amended its complaint to name FICEP as a direct defendant without leave of court if it had acted within forty-five days after service of the order granting Heller leave to file a third-party complaint against FICEP. <em>R. </em>4:8-1 (b). However, such an amended complaint would not have related back to the date of filing the complaint, thus satisfying the two-year limitations period which expired one day later, unless it substituted FICEP for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fictitiously identified defendant pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:26-4. <em>See Lawlor v.

See 44 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>62,714 to 62,750 (1979). The statutes enacted in a number of states also include provisions designed to serve this purpose. <em>See e.g., Colo.Rev.Stat.
