Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions generally may take either of two forms: a civil lawsuit in federal district court, or an administrative proceeding conducted by the Commission or an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Where both of those alternatives are available, the choice between them belongs to the SEC without express statutory constraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">In this case, the SEC chose to seek penalties against the appellants, Lynn Til-ton and several of her investment firms, by commencing an administrative proceeding conducted by an ALJ. That proceeding is subject to two layers of review: A party that loses before the ALJ may petition for <em>de novo </em>review by the Commission, and a party that loses before the Commission may petition for review by a federal court of appeals. Not unlike a lawsuit in district court, therefore, the administrative proceeding ultimately offers the losing party a route to federal appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">The appellants contend that the SEC\u2019s administrative proceeding is unconstitutional because the presiding ALJ\u2019s appointment violated Article II\u2019s Appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ments Clause. They have raised that claim as an affirmative defense within the proceeding and will be able to argue the issue in a federal court of appeals if they lose before the Commission. The appellants nevertheless sought more immediate access to federal court: Two days after the administrative proceeding against them began, they filed a separate lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting their Appointments Clause claim and seeking an injunction against the ALJ\u2019s adjudication based on its alleged unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The district court (Ronnie Abrams, <em>Judge) </em>dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Relying in part on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Elgin v. Department of Treasury, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2126, 183 L.Ed.2d 1 (2012), <em>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board, </em>561 U.S. 477, 130 S.Ct. 3138, 177 L.Ed.2d 706 (2010), and <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, </em>510 U.S. 200, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994), the court concluded that the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge fell within the exclusive scope of the SEC\u2019s administrative review scheme and could reach a federal court only on petition for review of a final decision by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We agree. By enacting the SEC\u2019s comprehensive scheme of administrative and judicial review, Congress implicitly precluded federal district court jurisdiction over the appellants\u2019 constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Until 2010, the SEC\u2019s authority to impose monetary penalties through administrative proceedings was relatively limited. The agency could not, for example, penalize a non-regulated person such as Tilton through administrative channels. The Dodd-Frank Act dramatically expanded the SEC\u2019s authority to impose penalties administratively, making it essentially \u201ccoextensive with [the SEC\u2019s] authority to seek penalties in Federal court.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 111-687, at 78 (2010). Since then, the SEC has reportedly prosecuted an increasing number of cases through administrative proceedings, with a rate of success notably higher than it has achieved in federal district courts. <em>See </em>Jean Eaglesham, <em>In-House Judges Help SEC Rack Up Wins, </em>Wall St. J., May 7, 2015, at Al.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">When the Commission chooses to seek penalties administratively, it must either preside over the proceeding itself or designate a hearing officer \u2014 usually an ALJ \u2014 to do so. <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.110. A presiding ALJ has authority to issue an initial decision, which may become final only by order of the Commission. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 201.360. If a party petitions for review of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, the Commission ordinarily reviews the decision <em>de novo </em>before issuing a final order. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 201.411. And a final order issued under the securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-l <em>et seq., </em>is in turn subject to judicial review by a federal court of appeals, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 80b-13(a) (providing that \u201c[a]ny person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission under [the Investment Advisers Act] may obtain a review of such order in the United States court of appeals within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal office or place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">During the past year or so, several respondents in ongoing SEC administrative proceedings have asserted that Article II of the United States Constitution bars the agency\u2019s ALJs from acting as hearing officers. These respondents have made two distinct constitutional arguments: that the ALJs are impermissibly insulated from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>presidential removal, and that they were not appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondents may raise those arguments as affirmative defenses during the course of their administrative proceedings, subject to potential judicial review in the event of an adverse decision by the Commission. Seeking more immediate judicial scrutiny, however, some respondents \u2014 the appellants among them \u2014 attempted to raise their Article II claims in parallel actions brought in federal district courts before their administrative proceedings concluded. <em>See Spring Hill Capital Partners, LLC v. SEC, </em>No. 15-CV-4542 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (challenging ALJ\u2019s appointment); <em>Hill v. SEC, </em>114 F.Supp.3d 1297 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (challenging ALJ\u2019s appointment and insulation from removal); <em>Duka v. SEC, </em>103 F.Supp.3d 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (challenging ALJ\u2019s appointment and insulation from removal); <em>Bebo v. SEC, </em>No. 15-C-3, 2015 WL 905349 (E.D. Wis. 2015) (challenging ALJ\u2019s insulation from removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In the case at bar, the SEC initiated an administrative proceeding before an ALJ in March 2015, alleging that the appellants had violated the Investment Advisers Act. Two days later, the appellants filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They sought to enjoin the SEC\u2019s administrative proceeding on the ground that, among other things, the presiding ALJ\u2019s appointment violated the Appointments Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The SEC moved to dismiss the suit, arguing in part \u2014 as it has in cases brought by similarly situated respondents \u2014 that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the lawsuit. In the Commission\u2019s view, the administrative proceeding at issue, once begun, precluded the appellants\u2019 collateral Appointments Clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">While the district court heard argument and deliberated, several other federal judges reached conflicting decisions on the same jurisdictional issue, creating a split both within and outside the Southern District. <em>Compare Spring Hill, </em>No. 15-CV-4542 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2015) (bench ruling) (Ramos, /.) (concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction over a respondent\u2019s Article II challenge to the ALJ conducting an ongoing administrative proceeding), <em>with Hill v. SEC, </em>114 F.Supp.3d 1297 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (concluding that there was such jurisdiction), <em>and Duka v. SEC, </em>103 F.Supp.3d 382, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (same); <em>see also Bebo v. SEC, </em>2015 WL 905349, at *4, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25660, at *10 (E.D. Wis. Mar. 3, 2015) (concluding, before the case at bar was filed, that the court lacked jurisdiction over a respondent\u2019s Article II challenge to the ALJ conducting an ongoing administrative proceeding), aff<em>'d, </em>799 F.3d 765 (7th Cir. 2015). On June 30, 2015, after weighing the merits of those intervening decisions, the district court decided in favor of the SEC, dismissing the appellants\u2019 suit as implicitly precluded by the Commission\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>scheme of administrative and judicial review. <em>Tilton v. SEC, </em>No. 15-CV-2472, 2015 WL 4006165, at * 1, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The appellants now ask us to reverse the district court\u2019s jurisdictional dismissal of their Appointments Clause claim and rule, on the merits, that the ALJ presiding over their administrative proceeding was unconstitutionally appointed. At the appellants\u2019 request, we have stayed the SEC\u2019s proceeding pending our decision in this appeal. We review the district court\u2019s determination of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Scelsa v. City Univ. of N.Y., </em>76 F.3d 37, 40 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The statutes that establish the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative and judicial review, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Investment Advisers Act, do not expressly preclude federal district court jurisdiction over the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim. The crucial jurisdictional issue in this case, therefore, is whether the statutes do so implicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">To resolve that issue, we must first determine whether it is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from the \u201ctext, structure, and purpose\u201d of the securities laws that Congress intended the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative and judicial review \u201cto preclude district court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2132-33. That initial inquiry is guided by the proposition that \u201c[gjenerally, when Congress creates procedures designed to permit agency expertise to be brought to bear on particular problems, those procedures are to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 489, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">If we conclude that the SEC\u2019s scheme precludes district court jurisdiction, we must then decide whether the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim is \u201cof the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 207, 114 S.Ct. 771). This second inquiry is guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Thunder Basin, Free Enterprise </em>and <em>Elgin, </em>which instruct us to \u201cpresume\u201d that a claim is not confined to administrative channels \u201cif \u2018a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; if the suit is \u2018wholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions\u2019; and if the claims are \u2018outside the agency\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 212-13, 114 S.Ct. 771). We refer to those considerations as the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Our resolution of these two inquiries\u2014whether Congress intended the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme to preclude district court jurisdiction, and whether the scheme encompasses a respondent\u2019s Appointments Clause challenge to a presiding ALJ\u2014leads us to conclude that the appellants\u2019 lawsuit must be dismissed. Two of our sister circuits recently reached similar conclusions. <em>See Jarkesy v. SEC, </em>803 F.3d 9 (D.C. Cir. 2015); <em>Bebo v. SEC, </em>799 F.3d 765 (7th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1500, 194 L.Ed.2d 588 (2016). We agree in large part with their reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">As an initial matter, the text, structure, and purpose of the securities laws make clear that Congress intended the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative review to permit the Commission to bring its expertise to bear in enforcing the securities laws. The scheme enables the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement to bring statutory charges before an administrative tribunal and affords respondents the opportunity to gather evidence, present a defense, and appeal any adverse rulings in federal court. In <em>Thun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>der Basin, </em>the Supreme Court held that a similar scheme precluded federal district court jurisdiction over challenges to an agency\u2019s application of a statute to particular facts. 510 U.S. at 208-09, 216, 114 S.Ct. 771. We reach the same conclusion here. Generally, therefore, persons responding to SEC enforcement actions are precluded from initiating lawsuits in federal courts as a means to defend against them. <em>See Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 16-17 (analogizing the SEC\u2019s statutory review scheme to the scheme at issue in <em>Thunder Basin </em>and concluding that Congress intended \u201cto preclude suits [in federal courts] by respondents in SEC administrative proceedings in the mine-run of cases\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The appellants do not contest that conclusion. They implicitly acknowledge that an SEC administrative proceeding, once initiated, is the exclusive initial forum for claims \u201crequiring the development of a factual record, the exercise of agency discretion, or the application of a statute to particular facts.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 4. They argue, however, that their Appointments Clause challenge is a distinct type of claim: \u201ca threshold constitutional challenge to agency practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. They assert that this type of claim satisfies all three of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors and so falls outside the exclusive purview of the SEC\u2019s administrative review scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The district court held that the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim failed to satisfy at least two of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors: It would be subject to meaningful judicial review within the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme, and it was not \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the scheme. <em>Tilton, </em>2015 WL 4006165, at * 4-12, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *9-34. The district court also suggested, but did not decide, that the Appointments Clause claim failed to satisfy the remaining <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor because it did not fall outside the SEC\u2019s expertise. <em>See id. </em>at 2015 WL 4006165, at *12-13, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *34-36. Despite leaving a decision as to that factor open, the court concluded that Congress intended the SEC\u2019s administrative review scheme to encompass the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim, to the exclusion of federal district court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We agree with that conclusion. The appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim will be subject to meaningful judicial review through administrative channels, a fact-that weighs strongly against district court jurisdiction. <em>See Bebo, </em>799 F.3d at 774-75 (characterizing the availability of meaningful judicial review as the \u201cmost important\u201d <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor). And although the other two <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors present closer questions in this case, they do not persuasively demonstrate that the Appointments Clause claim falls outside the scope of the SEC\u2019s overarching scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\n<em>A The Availability of Meaningful Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">Turning in more detail to the application of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors, we first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>consider whether the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme assures that the appellants have an opportunity for meaningful judicial review of their Appointments Clause claim. The appellants do not dispute that the scheme offers <em>some </em>judicial review: an appeal to a federal circuit court from an adverse ruling by the Commission. They argue, however, that such review would not be \u201cmeaningful\u201d because it could not provide an adequate remedy for the SEC\u2019s alleged violation of the Appointments Clause. That is so, in the appellants\u2019 view, because their exposure to the ongoing proceeding \u2014 as distinct from any adverse ruling that might result \u2014 would itself constitute a grave constitutional injury that could not be redressed after the fact. As precedential support for their position, the appellants cite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Free Enterprise </em>and our decades-old decision in <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, </em>609 F.2d 570 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The appellants\u2019 argument is not without force, as demonstrated by its success in several district courts. <em>See Hill, </em>2015 WL 4307088, at *6-8, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74822, at *17-19; <em>Duka, </em>103 F.Supp.3d 382, 390-91. Ultimately, however, we are not convinced. In our view, the appellants\u2019 argument misconstrues both <em>Free Enterprise </em>and <em>Touche Ross </em>and is at odds with the established approach to analogous jurisdictional disputes in federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>i. Free Enterprise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Free Enterprise </em>dealt with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), an entity created under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745, to supervise the practices of accounting firms. The PCAOB\u2019s five members were to be appointed by the SEC, and some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the PCAOB\u2019s regulatory actions required SEC approval in the <em>form of </em>a final Commission order. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, like the Investment Advisers Act before it, permitted losing parties to appeal from an adverse final order to a federal court of appeals. The statute made no provision, however, for federal review of Board actions that did not require SEC approval. <em>See Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 489-90, 130 S.Ct. 3138.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">In the <em>Free Enterprise </em>case, the PCAOB had, in the course of its supervisory work, \u201cinspected [a particular accounting] firm, released a report critical of its auditing procedures, and [begun] a formal investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 130 S.Ct. 3138. Those actions were not subject to review by the SEC or approval by final Commission order, and so did not give rise to an administrative route to federal review. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 130 S.Ct. 3138. The accounting firm then filed a lawsuit in federal district court that sought to void the PCAOB\u2019s actions on Article II grounds. The firm argued, as the appellants do here, that the SEC had violated the Appointments Clause when it selected the members of the PCAOB, rendering their appointments constitutionally infirm. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 130 S.Ct. 3138.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The Supreme Court held that the district court could exercise jurisdiction over the accounting firm\u2019s lawsuit, despite the availability of administrative review regarding some other PCAOB actions. <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 130 S.Ct. 3138. The Court reasoned, in part, that the administrative review scheme failed to make any form of judicial review meaningfully accessible to the firm. Because the PCAOB\u2019s regulatory actions had not produced a renewable Commission order, the accounting firm could have raised its constitutional objection in federal court through administrative channels only by manufacturing a new, tangential dispute that <em>would </em>require a Commission order, and then using that dispute as a vehicle for its Article II <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>claims. The Court deemed that circuitous option inadequate, and so concluded that meaningful judicial review was not otherwise available to the accounting firm. <em>Id. </em>at 490,130 S.Ct. 3138.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The appellants read <em>Free Enterprise </em>to suggest that judicial review of an Article II challenge to an administrative tribunal is not meaningful if conducted after the tribunal\u2019s proceeding concludes, because of the inherent remedial limitations of post-proceeding review. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 13, 17-18. We disagree. The <em>Free Enterprise </em>Court\u2019s analysis turned on the accessibility of post-proceeding review by a federal court of appeals- \u2014 not on whether such review, if accessible, could adequately remedy the PCAOB\u2019s alleged violation of Article II. <em>Free Enterprise </em>therefore lends no support to the appellants\u2019, characterization of their prospective constitutional injury as irremediable after the conclusion of their administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>ii Touche Ross</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Touche Ross </em>is similarly unavailing. There, the SEC took steps to institute an administrative proceeding against an accounting firm and several of its partners (collectively, \u201cTouche Ross\u201d) under Rule 2(e) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice, which related to the suspension and disbarment of persons practicing before the Commissioner. Touche Ross immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to enjoin the proceeding on the ground that Rule 2(e) was not authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The district court declined to exercise jurisdiction. It reasoned, in part, that the planned administrative proceeding would not irreparably harm Touche Ross, which meant that Touche Ross was required to exhaust the administrative review process before raising its claims in federal court. <em>See Touche, Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, </em>No. 76-CV-4489, 1978 WL 1084, at *4-5, 7-9, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17974, *9-12, 18-19, 23 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24,1978), <em>aff'd sub nom. Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. SEC, </em>609 F.2d 570 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">On appeal, this Court recognized district court jurisdiction over Touche Ross\u2019s lawsuit. The panel acknowledged that federal challenges to administrative proceedings at \u201cintermediate stages\u201d are generally disfavored, particularly where \u2014 as in the case before it \u2014 the agency had not acted \u201cplainly beyond its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Touche Ross, </em>609 F.2d at 576. Nonetheless, the Court permitted Touche Ross\u2019s lawsuit to proceed on the ground that its constitutional claim would not benefit from the SEC\u2019s \u201cexpertise,\u201d \u201cdiscretion\u201d or factfinding, and was thus already ripe for federal adjudication. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">The Court\u2019s decision did not suggest that a federal court would be unable to vindicate Touche Ross\u2019s challenge to Rule 2(e) after the SEC\u2019s proceeding concluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It held only that there was no compelling reason for Touche Ross to wait for post-proceeding review because the administrative tribunal would not bring its expertise to bear in a way that would aid a federal court\u2019s eventual adjudication. That proposition does not support the appellants\u2019 contention here that post-proceeding judicial review of their Appointments Clause challenge will not be meaningful. Rather, <em>Touche Ross </em>resonates with a different <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor: whether a claim falls outside an agency\u2019s expertise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>And its reasoning on that issue is no longer considered sound, as we explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">iii. <em>Conflict with Established Practice Regarding Analogous Challenges to a Tribunal\u2019s Constitutional Legitimacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMH\">The appellants\u2019 argument that post-proceeding judicial review of their Appointments Clause claim will be meaningless is not merely unsupported by <em>Free Enterprise </em>and <em>Touche Ross; </em>it is also at odds with established practice in federal court regarding analogous challenges to a tribunal\u2019s constitutional legitimacy. As the district court explained, litigants who unsuccessfully challenge the authority of a presiding judge or jury to decide a case often must wait to appeal the issue until after the court renders a final judgment. <em>See, e.g., Germain v. Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>930 F.2d 1038, 1040 (2d Cir. 1991) (concluding that a defendant who unsuccessfully challenged the plaintiffs right to jury trial must await the jury\u2019s verdict before appealing); <em>D\u2019Ippolito v. Am. Oil Co., </em>401 F.2d 764, 764-65 (2d Cir. 1968) (per curiam) (deciding that a defendant who unsuccessfully challenged the transfer of his case to another district must await the other district court\u2019s \u201cfinal judgment\u201d before appealing); <em>see also In re al-Nashiri, </em>791 F.3d 71, 75, 80 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (concluding, in denying a petition for writ of mandamus, that a defendant who unsuccessfully raised an Appointments Clause challenge to two of the United States Court of Military Commission Review\u2019s presiding judges must await the judges\u2019 ruling before appealing in federal court). Like the appellants here, a litigant in this kind of case must expend financial and emotional resources to complete a proceeding that may ultimately prove constitutionally infirm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequent judicial review cannot restore those resources, but it can vacate the resulting judgment and remand for a new proceeding. That post-proceeding relief, although imperfect, suffices to vindicate the litigant\u2019s constitutional claim. <em>See Germain, </em>930 F.2d at 1040 (explaining that if a jury trial were in fact improper, an appellate court could \u201cremand for a nonjury trial, thus vindicating the [objecting defendant\u2019s] right\u201d); <em>see also In re al-Nashiri, </em>791 F.3d at 80 (\u201cVacatur [premised on the defendant\u2019s Appointment Clause claim], even at the appeal-from-final-judgment stage, would fully vindicate [the defendant\u2019s] rights and the President\u2019s and the Senate\u2019s constitutional powers.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The litigant\u2019s financial and emotional costs in litigating the initial proceeding are simply the price of participating in the American legal system, and not an irreparable injury that necessitates interlocutory review of the initial court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The Supreme Court applied this principle to facts similar to those presented to us here in <em>FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>449 U.S. 232, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980). There, an oil company brought suit in federal district court to enjoin an ongoing administrative proceeding conducted by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), contending that the proceeding as a whole was unlawful because the FTC had initiated it without the requisite evidentiary basis. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 101 S.Ct. 488. As a general matter, a respondent in this type of proceeding must exhaust its administrative remedies before filing a related action in federal court, unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>respondent would suffer irreparable injury from the delay. <em>See Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 24, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974). The oil company argued that it had exhausted all relevant remedies before filing its federal lawsuit. <em>Standard Oil, </em>449 U.S. at 243, 101 S.Ct. 488. In the alternative, however, the company contended that any failure to exhaust should be excused because the company would suffer irreparable injury in the form of \u201cexpense and disruption\u201d if it were compelled to complete the administrative proceeding before reaching federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 101 S.Ct. 488. That argument closely resembles the appellants\u2019 claim here that post-proceeding judicial review will be powerless to remedy the injury they will suffer by enduring the SEC\u2019s administrative adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that a federal court would be able to meaningfully review the oil company\u2019s claim after the administrative proceeding ended, and therefore ordered the company\u2019s lawsuit dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. The Court acknowledged that the company would endure \u201csubstantial\u201d expense and disruption before the administrative proceeding concluded. <em>Id. </em>But it deemed that hardship to be \u201cpart of the social burden of living under government,\u201d rather than a form of irreparable injury justifying immediate judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 101 S.Ct. 488. As the D.C. Circuit subsequently explained, where \u201cthe \u2018injury\u2019 inflicted on the party seeking review is the burden of going through an agency proceeding,\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Standard Oil </em>\u201cteaches that the party must patiently await the denouement of proceedings within the Article II branch.\u201d <em>USAA Fed. Sav. Bank v. McLaughlin, </em>849 F.2d 1505, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988):</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In other decisions, the Supreme Court has concluded that post-proceeding judicial review would not be meaningful because the proceeding itself posed a risk of some additional and irremediable harm beyond the burdens associated with the dispute resolution process. <em>See, e.g., McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., </em>498 U.S. 479, 496-97, 499, 111 S.Ct. 888, 112 L.Ed.2d 1005 (1991) (permitting a class of undocumented aliens to raise a due-process challenge to INS proceedings in district court, rather than pursue eventual review in a federal court of appeals through administrative channels, partly because most of the aliens could \u201censure themselves review in courts of appeals only if they voluntarily surrender[ed] themselves for deportation,\u201d a \u201cprice ... tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens\u201d). But the appellants have identified no such additional, irremediable harm here. The only prospective injury that they describe is \u201cbeing subjected to an unconstitutional adjudicative procedure,\u201d with the attendant \u201cembarrassment, expense, ... ordeal ... [and] state of anxiety and insecurity.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 19, 21 (alterations in original and internal quotation marks omitted). As <em>Standard Oil </em>and other decisions discussed above indicate, the prospect of such harm alone does not render post-proceeding judicial review less than meaningful. <em>Cf. In re al-Nashiri, </em>791 F.3d at 79-80 (explaining that the defendant\u2019s \u201cabstract concern\u201d that his presiding judges violated \u201cthe separation of powers\u201d because they had been improperly appointed did not establish a prospective irreparable injury that justified immediate federal intervention in ongoing administrative proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We therefore conclude that the appellants will have access to meaningful judicial review of their Appointments Clause claim through administrative channels. <em>See Bebo, </em>799 F.3d at 774 (concluding that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>respondent in an ongoing SEC administrative proceeding could obtain meaningful judicial review \u201c[ajfter the pending enforcement action has run its course\u201d by \u201craising] her objections,\u201d including an Article II challenge to the presiding ALJ, \u201cin a circuit court of appeals established under Article III\u201d); see <em>also Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 27 (\u201cEven assuming [the respondent] is right that Congress has unconstitutionally delegated power to the SEC to decide whether to place him in an administrative proceeding rather than in a court action, [the respondent] has no inherent right to avoid an administrative proceeding at all. Thus, his rights can be vindicated by a reversal of the Commission\u2019s final order if the court of appeals grants his petition for review.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>B. Wholly Collateral</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We next consider whether the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim is \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme. The Supreme Court has not explained precisely how to make this determination, although <em>Elgin </em>suggests that a claim is not wholly collateral if it serves as the \u201cvehicle by which\u201d a party seeks to prevail in an administrative proceeding. <em>See </em>132 S.Ct. at 2139-40. In the absence of more extensive guidance, lower courts have adopted two competing approaches. Some decisions have suggested that a claim is <em>not </em>wholly collateral to an administrative proceeding only if it is substantively intertwined with the merits dispute that the proceeding was commenced to resolve. <em>See Hill, </em>114 F.Supp.3d at 1309 (concluding that the respondent\u2019s Article II challenge was \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the ongoing administrative proceeding because \u201c[w]hat occurs at the ... proceeding and the SEC\u2019s conduct there is irrelevant to\u201d the constitutional challenge); <em>Duka, </em>103 F.Supp.3d at 391 (concluding that the respondent\u2019s Article II challenge was \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the ongoing administrative proceeding because the challenge did not \u201cattack any order that may be issued ... relating to the outcome of the SEC action\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Other decisions have suggested that a claim is not wholly collateral if it has been raised in response to, and so is procedurally intertwined with, an administrative proceeding \u2014 regardless of the claim\u2019s substantive connection to the initial merits dispute in the proceeding. <em>See Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 23 (concluding that claims arising \u201cfrom actions the Commission took in the course of [its administrative] scheme\u201d were not \u201cwholly collateral\u201d); <em>Bebo, </em>2015 WL 905349, at *2-4, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25660, at *4-10 (implicitly concluding that the respondent\u2019s Article II challenge did not qualify as wholly collateral to the ongoing administrative proceeding because it was raised there as an affirmative defense). <em>See generally Bebo, </em>799 F.3d at 773-74 (comparing these two lines of decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The district court here adopted the latter approach. It began its analysis by noting that the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim is substantively \u201cunrelated to the securities violations underlying the administrative proceeding,\u201d such that resolving the challenge \u201ccannot reasonably be characterized as the \u2018regular\u2019 or \u2018routine\u2019 business of SEC administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Tilton, </em>2015 WL 4006165, at *11, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *31-32 (quoting, with minor alterations, <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2140). Nevertheless, the court decided that the claim did not qualify as \u201cwholly collateral\u201d because it was procedurally intertwined with the SEC\u2019s ongoing proceeding, where it functioned as an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 2015 WL 4006165, at *12, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Absent further guidance from the Supreme Court, we are inclined to agree with the district court\u2019s assessment. The SEC chose to enforce the Investment Advisers Act against the appellants by initiating an administrative proceeding and appointing an ALJ to act as the hearing officer. The appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim arose directly from that enforcement action and serves as an affirmative defense within the proceeding. To be sure, the claim could be narrowly categorized as collateral to the statutory merits of the Investment Advisers Act charges against the appellants. But we cannot conclude that the claim is <em>wholly </em>collateral to the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme more broadly. As the district court recognized, it is \u201cdifficult to see how [the Appointments Clause claim] can still be considered \u2018collateral to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought,\u2019 since the ALJ and the Commission will, one way or another, rule on those claims and it will be the Commission\u2019s order that [the appellants] will appeal.\u201d <em>Tilton, </em>2015 WL 4006165, at *12, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85015, at *32 (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138); <em>see also Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 23 (reaching a similar conclusion). Put another way, the Appointments Clause claim, like' accompanying defenses to the merits of the Investment Advisers Act charges, is a \u201cvehicle by which\u201d the appellants seek to prevail in the proceeding. <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2139. The claim identifies a purported error in the way the Commission has sought to enforce the securities laws, albeit one that sounds in administrative procedure rather than statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The dissent argues that the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim is as collateral to the SEC\u2019s administrative scheme as the accounting firm\u2019s Appointments Clause claim was in <em>Free Enterprise. See post </em>at 297. We are not persuaded by the analogy. The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdictional conclusion in <em>Free Enterprise </em>was, in our view, shaped principally by the absence of the type of procedural link between constitutional claim and administrative proceeding that exists here. The accounting firm objected to actions that the PCAOB had taken entirely outside the scope of the SEC\u2019s scheme of administrative and judicial review \u2014 actions that could not be the subject of \u201cany Commission orders ... from which review might be sought.\u201d <em>Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138. The firm filed suit in federal district court, and the Supreme Court allowed the suit to proceed, because the Appointments Clause claim was not moored to any proceeding that would provide for an administrative adjudication and subsequent judicial review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, by contrast, the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim targets an aspect of an ongoing administrative proceeding. We think that distinction significantly alters the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d analysis, such that the second <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor does not favor district court jurisdiction in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>case. <em>See Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 23 (noting that a constitutional challenge might qualify as collateral if it \u201cwere filed in court before the initiation of any administrative proceeding,\u201d as in <em>Free Enterprise, </em>but concluding that constitutional challenges were not collateral when raised in response to \u201cmultiple aspects of [an] ongoing proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>C. Agency Expertise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The final consideration within the <em>Thunder Basin </em>framework is whether the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim falls outside the SEC\u2019s expertise. This is a close question. As an initial matter, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Free Enterprise </em>suggests that the SEC does not possess unique legal expertise in analyzing the constitutional sufficiency of its appointments. There, the Court concluded that the merits of an Appointments Clause challenge to the PCAOB fell \u201coutside the Commission\u2019s competence and expertise\u201d because the claim raised only \u201cstandard questions of administrative law,\u201d which were unrelated to any \u201cstatutory\u201d or \u201cfact-bound inquiries\u201d that the SEC might be singularly qualified to perform. 561 U.S. at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Under <em>Touche Ross, </em>that conclusion might end our analysis of agency expertise. As noted, the panel there permitted respondents to challenge an ongoing SEC administrative proceeding in federal district court solely because the legal substance of the challenge fell outside the administrative tribunal\u2019s expertise and could not be usefully developed through its factfinding. 609 F.2d at 577. But the Supreme Court has since adopted a broader conception of agency expertise in the jurisdictional context. <em>Elgin, </em>in particular, emphasizes that an agency may bring its expertise to bear on a constitutional claim indirectly, by resolving accompanying, potentially dispositive issues in the same proceeding. <em>See Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 28-29 (noting that <em>\u201cElgin </em>... clarified ... that an agency\u2019s relatively low] level of insight into the <em>merits </em>of a constitutional question is not determinative\u201d of whether the agency can bring its expertise to bear).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In <em>Elgin, </em>federal employees who allegedly had been discharged for violating a statutory command sought reinstatement by challenging the constitutionality of the statute. Congress had previously created an administrative process to adjudicate specified personnel decisions regarding federal employees, which was conducted initially by the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) and subject to review in the Federal Circuit. Before completing that administrative process, the employees attempted to raise their constitutional challenge to the statute in federal district court. In an effort to establish federal jurisdiction, they contended that the claim fell outside the MSPB\u2019s expertise because the MSPB disclaimed authority to determine the constitutionality of a federal statute. <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2130-31, 2140.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The Supreme Court disagreed. Although the MSPB had indeed disclaimed authority to resolve constitutional challenges to statutes, the Court identified several ways in which the agency might \u201cotherwise\u201d bring its expertise \u201cto bear\u201d in proceedings that raised those challenges. First, the MSPB could resolve \u201cpreliminary questions unique to the employment context\u201d that might \u201cobviate the need to address the constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2140. Second, \u201cthe challenged statute [could] be one that the MSPB regularly construes, and its statutory interpretation could alleviate constitutional concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And third, \u201can employee\u2019s appeal [could] involve other statutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>constitutional challenge to a federal statute,\u201d whose resolution \u201cin the employee\u2019s favor might fully dispose of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of those potential applications of agency expertise to other dimensions of the administrative proceeding, the Court concluded that there was \u201cno reason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt\u201d the employees\u2019 constitutional challenge \u201cfrom exclusive review before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Applying <em>Elgin\u2019s </em>approach here, we think that the SEC might bring its expertise to bear on the appellants\u2019 proceeding by resolving accompanying statutory claims that it \u201croutinely considers,\u201d and which \u201cmight fully dispose of the case\u201d in the appellants\u2019 favor. 132 S.Ct. at 2140. In particular, the Commission could rule that the appellants did not violate the Investment Advisers Act, in which case the constitutional question would become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">It may be argued that the application of agency expertise to the statutory issues in the appellants\u2019 proceeding would improperly skip over their Appointments Clause claim, which raises a \u201cthreshold\u201d issue that logically precedes a merits adjudication. Although we are mindful of that concern, the Supreme Court appears to have rejected an analogous argument in <em>Standard Oil. </em>There, the respondent oil company, like the appellants here, sought to raise a \u201cthreshold\u201d challenge to its administrative proceeding as a whole soon after the proceeding began. The Ninth Circuit permitted the district court to exercise jurisdiction over that challenge, in part because it feared that the oil company\u2019s victory on other grounds in the administrative proceeding would evade, and improperly \u201cmoot,\u201d the threshold issue. <em>Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. FTC, </em>596 F.2d 1381, 1387 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>449 U.S. 232, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980). The Supreme Court expressly rejected that rationale and reversed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[O]ne of the principal reasons to await the termination of agency proceedings is to obviate all occasion for judicial review. Thus, the possibility that [the oil company\u2019s] challenge may be mooted in adjudication warrants the requirement that [the company] pursue adjudication, not shortcut it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\"><em>Standard Oil, </em>449 U.S. at 244 n.11, 101 S.Ct. 488 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In light of that passage, we are inclined to read <em>Elgin\u2019s </em>mention of \u201cother statutory or constitutional claims\u201d that might \u201cfully dispose of the case,\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 2140, to include the Investment Advisers Act charges here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Such a reading of <em>Elgin </em>dovetails with our analysis of the availability of meaningful judicial review. We have already concluded, in keeping with established federal practice regarding analogous disputes, that the appellants may adequately vindicate their Appointments Clause claim by first awaiting a final Commission order and then petitioning for judicial review on constitutional grounds only if the order is adverse. By the same logic, a favorable Commission order, including one on statutory grounds, would provide an acceptable resolution of the Appointments Clause claim and obviate any need for judicial review. It follows, we think, that the Commission may bring its expertise to bear in a manner potentially relevant to the constitutional issue by resolving the statutory charges against the appellants. For that reason, the final <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor lends minimal support to the appellants\u2019 jurisdictional argument. <em>See Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 29 (concluding that \u201cthe Commission\u2019s expertise can otherwise be brought to bear on the issues in [the respondent\u2019s] proceeding\u201d because \u201cthe agency could moot the need to resolve\u201d the respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>constitutional claims, including several threshold challenges to the proceeding as a whole, \u201cby finding that he did not commit the securities-law violations of which he stands accused\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Bebo, </em>799 F.3d at 773 <em>{\u201cElgin </em>explained that the possibility that [the respondent] might prevail in the administrative proceeding (and thereby avoid the need to raise her constitutional claims in an Article III court) does not render the statutory review scheme inadequate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">After considering each of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors, we conclude that Congress intended the appellants\u2019 Appointments Clause claim \u201cto be reviewed within\u201d the SEC\u2019s exclusive \u201cstatutory structure.\u201d <em>Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 489, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (quoting <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 207, 114 S.Ct. 771). The \u201cthreshold\u201d nature of the claim does not defeat the presumption that it, like other procedural and substantive defenses to an enforcement action, must be resolved in the first instance through agency proceedings. To the contrary: \u201cMany respondents in SEC proceedings join substantive defenses to their securities charges together with challenges to the Commission\u2019s actions or authority. It makes good sense to consolidate all of each respondent\u2019s issues before one court for review, and only after an adverse Commission order makes that review necessary.\u201d <em>Jarkesy, </em>803 F.3d at 29-30. We therefore conclude, in keeping with the decisions of the Seventh and D.C. Circuits in <em>Bebo </em>and <em>Jarkesy, </em>that the appellants must await a final Commission order before raising their Appointments Clause claim in federal court. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and our stay on further proceedings by the SEC is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">.

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHK\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">An additional reason why the Appellants in this case must raise their Appointments Clause issue by filing a petition for review in a court of appeals rather than initiate a new action in a district court is a concept that has been called \u201ccolorable jurisdiction.\u201d As the Seventh Circuit has explained in a case challenging an order of criminal contempt, \u201cIf a court has colorable jurisdiction of a case, though later it is determined that actually it didn\u2019t have jurisdiction, an order of criminal contempt issued by the court before the absence of jurisdiction is determined is valid.\u201d <em>Mann v. Calumet City, </em>588 F.3d 949, 954 (7th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The Supreme Court, without using the phrase \u201ccolorable jurisdiction,\u201d made the same point in <em>United States v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). The Court there ruled that even if the constitutionality of a statute is in doubt, an order issued by a court under that statute must be obeyed and enforced even by criminal contempt. <em>See id. </em>at 293, 67 S.Ct. 677. The Court noted that \u201ca different result would follow were the question of jurisdiction frivolous and not substantial,\u201d <em>id. </em>or, as Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurrence put it, the \u201ccourt is so obviously traveling outside its orbit as to be merely usurping judicial forms and facilities,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 309, 67 S.Ct. 677 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The concept of colorable jurisdiction has also been deemed relevant to the availability of a collateral attack to challenge a judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Courts have distinguished between an erroneous assertion of subject matter jurisdiction, where collateral attack is precluded by <em>res judicata, </em>and a clear usurpation of judicial power, where collateral attack is permitted. <em>See Nemaizer v. Baker, </em>793 F.2d 58, 65 (2d Cir. 1986) (collecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>cases); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12(1) (1982). \u201cCollateral attack is available only if the assertion of subject matter jurisdiction was without colorable basis, not merely erroneous.\u201d <em>In re U.S. Catholic </em>Conference, 824 F.2d 156, 165 (2d Cir. 1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, U.S. Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., </em>487 U.S. 72, 108 S.Ct. 2268, 101 L.Ed.2d 69 (1988) (on direct appeal, nonparty witness held in civil contempt may challenge subject matter jurisdiction of court in underlying action).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that will be hearing the pending administrative proceeding against the Appellants is not an interloper. The ALJ is an official of the agency, facially clothed with authority to adjudicate the proceeding before her. Whether her appointment comports with the Appointments Clause is a fair question, but there is surely a plausible basis for arguing that her appointment is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">With colorable jurisdiction, the ALJ may adjudicate the administrative case, and the losing party will have its opportunity to seek review before the Commission and then petition for review of a final order in a Court of Appeals, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">For this additional reason, I concur in Judge Sack\u2019s opinion for the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\">DRONEY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AIG\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">This case is nearly indistinguishable from <em>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Board, </em>561 U.S. 477, 130 S.Ct. 3138, 177 L.Ed.2d 706 (2010). It differs in only one significant way: administrative proceedings have begun against the appellants. The majority concludes that this distinction alone warrants a different outcome, finding that the fact of the ongoing proceedings means that the three factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, </em>510 U.S. 200, 114 S.Ct. 771, 127 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994) for determining whether Congress intended to limit jurisdiction of the district courts are satisfied. Consequently, the majority holds that there was no subject matter jurisdiction before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">I respectfully dissent. The majority\u2019s application of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors has stripped the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factors of any significance: in its view, as long as administrative proceedings have been initiated, those two factors are always satisfied. The majority bases its understanding of this substantive-to-procedural switch in those two factors on their application by the Supreme Court in <em>Elgin v. Department of Treasury, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2126, 183 L.Ed.2d 1 (2012), but the nature of the constitutional claim presented in <em>Elgin </em>was entirely different. I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Elgin </em>and conclude that those two <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors must be analyzed substantively to determine their weight in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">I conclude that <em>Free Enterprise </em>controls here. In my view, those two factors here have precisely the same weight as they did in <em>Free Enterprise, </em>and the application of the remaining factor does not change the result. Thus, I would find that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction .to consider the constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">I. The <em>Thunder Basin </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">The Supreme Court in <em>Thunder Basin </em>identified the following three factors as helpful in determining whether a statute which provides for administrative review of agency action was intended by Congress to preclude district court jurisdiction over claims before a final administrative determination: whether the claims are \u201cwholly collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>whether they are \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise,\u201d and whether \u201ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212-13, 114 S.Ct. 771 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court referred to each as helping determine whether it is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from a \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d that Congress \u201chas allocated initial review to an administrative body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 212-13, 114 S.Ct. 771.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">I disagree somewhat with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the third factor, \u201cmeaningful judicial review,\u201d but it is the majority\u2019s application of the two other factors\u2014 \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d \u2014 with which I most disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">There are three cases in which the Supreme Court has reviewed the application of these three factors: <em>Thunder Basin, Free Enterprise, </em>and <em>Elgin. </em>In each, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factors has focused on the substance of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>Thunder Basin, </em>a non-union mine owner filed an action in district court challenging its employees\u2019 designation of certain union representatives to be involved in safety inspections under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act (\u201cMine Act\u201d). The Mine Act provided for administrative hearings and decisions concerning safety issues, and ultimate appeal to the Courts of Appeals. Respondents contended that this \u201ccomprehensive review process,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 208, 114 S.Ct. 771, in the Mine Act indicated that Congress intended that the safety claim be exclusively reviewed in the \u201cstatutory structure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771, and that there was no subject matter jurisdiction for the mine owner\u2019s suit in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">In its analysis of whether the mine owner\u2019s claims must first be brought in an administrative proceeding, the Supreme Court analyzed the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factors only by considering the substance of the claims with no mention of the procedural aspects of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 114 S.Ct. 771 (noting that \u201cPetitioner\u2019s statutory claims at root require interpretation of the parties\u2019 rights and duties under [the Mine Act and accompanying regulations], and as such arise under the Mine Act and fall squarely within the Commission\u2019s expertise\u201d and that the agency has \u201cextensive experience interpreting the walk-around rights\u201d that were at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The Supreme Court engaged in the same sort of substantive analysis in <em>Free Enterprise. </em>In <em>Free Enterprise, </em>an accounting firm filed an action in the district court which challenged a report issued by the newly created Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d). The PCAOB was created as an accounting reform in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its members were appointed by the SEC. The report had criticized the firm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>accounting procedures, but no sanctions were imposed. Thus, the accounting firm could not utilize the' statutory administrative review proceedings available before the SEC. The action in the district court by the accounting firm challenged the appointments of the PCAOB members by the SEC, claiming that they violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and the members had no authority to issue the negative report. The PCAOB sought to dismiss the action on the basis that the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the accounting firm\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In its analysis of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s review\u201d factors, the <em>Free Enterprise </em>Court examined the substance of the constitutional claim as it related to agency expertise, 561 U.S. at 491, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (\u201c[T]he statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.\u201d (quotation marks and alterations omitted)), and explained the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d factor in terms of the substantive content of the challenge, <em>id. </em>at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138. (\u201c[Petitioners object to the Board\u2019s existence, not to any of its auditing standards. Petitioners\u2019 general challenge to the Board is collateral to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.\u201d). It made no reference to the procedural aspects of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">II. <em>Elgin v. Department of Treasury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The third case in which the Supreme Court addressed the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors was <em>Elgin v. Department of Treasury, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2126, 183 L.Ed.2d 1 (2012). The majority concludes that the <em>Elgin </em>Court considerably altered the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d\" factors, but I disagree. I believe the outcome in <em>Elgin </em>was not produced by varying those factors, but by the different type of constitutional claim presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">In <em>Elgin, </em>the plaintiffs challenged their dismissal from federal employment for failure to comply with the Military Selective Service Act by not .registering for the draft. Although the plaintiffs had available to them the right to challenge their dismissals through administrative hearings before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) and subsequent judicial review in the Federal Circuit, they instead brought suit in federal district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their constitutional arguments were that the Selective Service Act discriminates on the basis of sex by requiring only males to register and is a bill of attainder. <em>Id. </em>at 2131. Notably, the plaintiffs made no challenge to the available administrative process; they argued only that the <em>substance </em>of the laws being enforced against them\u2014 laws routinely administered by the MSPB \u2014 was unconstitutional. Unsurprisingly, then, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and \u201coutside of the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factors, and its conclusion that those two factors in <em>Elgin </em>weighed in favor of dismissal of the district court action, was necessarily quite different from that in <em>Free Enterprise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">The Supreme Court\u2019s application of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d factor rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their constitutional claims had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the \u201cday-to-day personnel actions adjudicated by the MSPB.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2139. The Supreme Court pointed out that a challenge to dismissal from employment based on federal statutes is \u201cprecisely the type of personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>action regularly adjudicated by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit within the [Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d) ] scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2140. Whether or not that particular challenge involved a constitutional question, it was \u2014 in the words of the Supreme Court \u2014 \u201ca challenge to CSRA-covered employment action brought by CSRA-covered employees requesting relief that the CSRA routinely affords.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The majority here concludes that <em>Elgin </em>held that \u201ca claim is not wholly collateral if it has been raised in response to, and so is procedurally intertwined with, an administrative proceeding,\u201d Majority Op. at 287, pointing to the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that the constitutional claims in <em>Elgin </em>were \u201cthe vehicle by which [the petitioners] s[ought] to reverse the removal decisions\u201d made against them, <em>id. </em>at 2139. However, that overstates what the Supreme Court did in its application of that factor. That portion of the opinion meant nothing more than that the plaintiffs were challenging actions against them under the statutes committed to the MSPB by attacking the constitutionality of those very statutes \u2014 it does not suggest that <em>no challenge </em>that would end ongoing proceedings could be considered collateral to a statute\u2019s review provisions. Such an interpretation would swallow the rule, for there would no longer be any need to evaluate the substance of a claim as long as the claim could somehow serve to end administrative proceedings in a plaintiffs favor. This is inconsistent with <em>Thunder Basin </em>and <em>Free Enterprise </em>(and, in fact, with <em>Elgin, </em>which looked carefully at the substance of the challenge). It would also turn the factor into an easy, binary question: Is a proceeding ongoing? If yes, then no claim that would end the proceeding can be wholly collateral. This cannot be what the <em>Elgin </em>Court intended. In my view, it held only that a claim involving the substance of the very act entrusted to the agency for implementation and requesting the types of relief that the agency regularly gives \u2014 -a far cry from the present case, where the constitutional claim has no relation to the securities laws entrusted to the SEC and the requested remedy of disallowing the proceedings before the ALJ is obviously not a routine outcome \u2014 cannot be considered \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to the administrative scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">As for the \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factor, the <em>Elgin </em>Court made clear that this factor would weigh against jurisdiction in cases where a claim needing agency expertise was a \u201cthreshold\u201d or \u201cpreliminary question\u201d that would \u201cobviate the need to address the constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2140. This described the situation in <em>Elgin, </em>where before deciding that the Selective Service Act was unconstitutional the MSPB had to decide \u201cthreshold questions\u201d to which the MSPB could apply its expertise, such as whether constructive discharge occurred as well as whether additional claimed violations of employment statutes took place, which \u201cmight fully dispose of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those decisions could be informed by its agency expertise in the area of employment law. <em>Id. </em>In such a context, the MSPB\u2019s expertise could properly be \u201cbrought to bear\u201d on the constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 214-15, 114 S.Ct. 771). The majority here acknowledges that an issue of federal jurisdiction or the appropriate composition of an adjudicatory body \u2014 such as the Appointments Clause challenge presented in this case \u2014 logically precedes a merits adjudication; therefore, there is no \u201cthreshold\u201d or \u201cpreliminary\u201d question that would \u201cobviate the need to address the constitutional challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The majority nonetheless concludes that the <em>Elgin </em>Court interpreted this factor to mean that \u201can agency may bring its expertise to bear on a constitutional claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>indirectly, by resolving accompanying, potentially dispositive issues in the same proceeding.\u201d Majority Op. at 289. It does so by citing the <em>Elgin </em>Court\u2019s reference to a situation in which an appeal involves \u201cother statutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a constitutional challenge to a federal statute.\u201d <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2140. The majority thus concludes that an issue to which an agency may apply its expertise need only be dispositive, not necessarily \u201cpreliminary,\u201d for it to weigh against jurisdiction. Majority Op. at 289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">That interpretation does not comport with the language of <em>Elgin, </em>however, which explicitly set that description out as an <em>example </em>of a situation in which there might be \u201cthreshold questions\u201d that would allow the initial agency reviewing the case to <em>not reach </em>the constitutional question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor would such an expansive interpretation be consistent with the facts underlying and the setting of <em>Elgin, </em>where the potentially dispositive issue was clearly a \u201cpreliminary\u201d or \u201cthreshold question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">To read <em>Elgin </em>as broadly as the majority does would mean that as long as a proceeding is ongoing, the \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factor <em>must </em>weigh against jurisdiction \u2014 because any time a proceeding has commenced there is of course some possibility that a plaintiff may prevail on the merits. This would turn a substantive factor into a purely procedural \u2014 and binary \u2014 one, which is inconsistent with the description of the factor in <em>Thunder Basin, Free Enterprise, </em>or <em>Elgin </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In sum, to agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Elgin, </em>one must conclude that the Supreme. Court intended to eliminate any substantive analysis of the \u201cwholly collateral\u201d and the \u201coutside the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d factors in any case where an administrative proceeding is ongoing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the contrary, <em>Elgin </em>itself engages with the substance of the precluded claims in a way that the majority seems to believe is now unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">The majority\u2019s interpretation also serves to move the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors away from their original function, which was to assist in a holistic analysis to determine whether it is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d from a \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d that Congress \u201chas allocated initial review to an administrative body.\u201d <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 207, 114 S.Ct. 771. <em>Elgin </em>recognized this function: it engaged in an extensive analysis of the history and structure of the relevant statutes before turning to the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors, which it referred to as \u201cthree additional factors in arguing that [the petitioners\u2019] claims are not the type that Congress intended to be reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>within the CSRA scheme.\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 2136.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">I would apply the three <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors for divining legislative intent faithful to <em>Thunder Basin, Free Enterprise </em>and <em>Elgin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">III. Application of the <em>Thunder Basin </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">A.\u201cWholly Collateral to a Statute\u2019s Review Provisions\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Free Enterprise </em>concluded that the constitutional claim there was \u201cwholly collateral\u201d to any administrative proceedings that might be brought against the plaintiffs. That challenge was essentially the same as the challenge here: that the appointment of the members of the PCAOB by the SEC violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. It explained that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cgeneral challenge to the Board is \u2018collateral\u2019 to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought\u201d because they \u201cobject to the Board\u2019s <em>existence, </em>not to any of its auditing standards.\u201d <em>Free Enterprise, </em>561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (emphasis added). Here, as well, the appellants object to the very existence of SEC administrative proceedings conducted by ALJs who are, in their view, not appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The majority finds that this factor weighs against jurisdiction based only on its interpretation of <em>Elgin, </em>which I have addressed above. I would reject that interpretation. I see no difference between the Appointments Clause challenge in <em>Free Enterprise </em>and here; it is completely collateral to the work of the PCAOB as well as to the work of the SEC and its ALJs. I would find that this factor weighs strongly in favor of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">B. \u201cOutside the Agency\u2019s Expertise\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">In <em>Free Enterprise, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the Appointments Clause claim relating to the appointment of the PCAOB by the SEC was \u201coutside the Commission\u2019s competence and expertise,\u201d requiring no understanding of a particular industry and no \u201ctechnical considerations of agency policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491,130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The same conclusion applies to the Appointments Clause issue here. Like the determination of the appointment authority for the PCAOB members in <em>Free Enterprise, </em>the SEC has no particular expertise in determining whether the system of appointing its Administrative Law Judges comports with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">The majority agrees as far as <em>Free Enterprise </em>goes, concluding only that this <em>Thunder Basin </em>factor has been changed by <em>Elgin. </em>For the reasons discussed above, I disagree. I see no difference in the application of this factor here to the SEC and its application to the SEC in <em>Free Enterprise. </em>I would find that this factor also weighs strongly in favor of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">C. \u201cMeaningful Judicial Review\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d factor presents the only significant difference between the present case and <em>Free Enterprise. </em>I agree with the majority that this factor tends to weigh in favor of preclusion because a subsequent appeal to this Court following a final Commission order is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">Nonetheless, I do not believe that the difference between the available judicial review in <em>Free Enterprise </em>and in this case is so significant as to justify a different outcome, given the identical application of the other two factors, as well as a substantial question as to whether subsequent judicial review here would be \u201cmeaningful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The majority is correct in noting that <em>Free Enterprise </em>differed from this case in that no renewable administrative order was possible unless the plaintiff \u201cmanufae-tur[ed] a new, tangential dispute that <em>would </em>require a Commission order.\u201d Majority Op. at 283. And as the <em>Free Enterprise </em>Court noted, \u201c[w]e normally do not require plaintiffs to bet the farm by taking the violative action before testing the validity of [a] law.\u201d 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The <em>Free Enterprise </em>situation was not so different from the present one as to require a different outcome, however. Here, the administrative proceedings once concluded would have led to an order subject to judicial review \u2014 but only if the appellants had continued litigating before the SEC ALJ and lost on the merits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Forcing the appellants to await a final Commission order before they may assert their constitutional claim in a federal court means that by the time the day for judicial review comes, they will already have suffered the injury that they are attempting to prevent. The majority finds that the \u201clitigant\u2019s financial and emotional costs in litigating the initial proceeding are simply the price of participating in the American legal system,\u201d Majority Op. at 285, but the issue is less the costs and burden of litigation and more that the appellants are challenging the very existence of the ALJs as a part of the statutory scheme. The appellants seek to enjoin the SEC proceedings, but by the time that they access any judicial review, the proceedings will be complete, rendering the possibility of obtaining an injunction moot even if the final Commission order is vacated. In my view, this diminishes the weight of this factor, for while there may be review, it cannot be considered truly \u201cmeaningful\u201d at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The majority cites a number of decisions for the principle that \u201cpost-proceeding relief ... suffices to vindicate the litigant\u2019s constitutional claim,\u201d Majority Op. at 285, but none involves an analysis of the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d prong of this test. <em>Germain v. Connecticut National Bank, </em>930 F.2d 1038, 1040 (2d Cir. 1991) involved an interlocutory appeal of the denial of a jury trial demand in a bankruptcy proceeding and the application of the collateral order doctrine exception that an order be \u201ceffectively unreviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>D\u2019Ippolito v. American Oil Co., </em>401 F.2d 764, 765 (2d Cir. 1968) addressed the question of whether an order by a district court transferring an antitrust action to another district was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>In re al-Nashiri, </em>791 F.3d 71, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2015), addressed the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d test meriting the grant of a writ of mandamus to stop a military commission trial. And <em>FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>449 U.S. 232, 244, 101 S.Ct. 488, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980) concerned whether the issuance of a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission caused \u201cirreparable injury\u201d allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>for judicial review or whether final agency action was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">When it comes to the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d factor, it is my view that we need look no further than <em>Free Enterprise </em>itself to understand that being forced to undergo an allegedly unconstitutional proceeding may play into the analysis of whether judicial review is \u201cmeaningful.\u201d The Court in <em>Free Enterprise </em>identified a number of <em>possible </em>ways that the plaintiffs in that case could obtain review of their constitutional claims against the board (such as \u201cseleet[ing] and challenging] a Board rule at random\u201d or \u201cincur[ring] a sanction (such as a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for documents and testimony,\u201d 561 U.S. at 490, 130 S.Ct. 3138); it simply decided that none of the options were reasonable to ask of the plaintiffs and therefore none provided \u201cmeaningful\u201d judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 130 S.Ct. 3138.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Free Enterprise </em>also explained that the plaintiffs were \u201centitled to declaratory relief sufficient to ensure that the reporting, requirements and auditing standards to which they are subject <em>mil be enforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the Executive, \u201d </em>and it allowed the plaintiffs to bring their claim at a time where no administrative proceedings had yet been formally brought against them. 561 U.S. at 513, 130 5.Ct. 3138 (emphasis added). This suggests that the Supreme Court considers the very <em>process </em>of enforcement by an unconstitutional body to be an injury that can be relevant to the determination of whether post-proceeding review is \u201cmeaningful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">For all these reasons, I am unpersuaded that the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d prong has enough weight to overpower the other two factors and result in a finding of no jurisdiction. The other two factors clearly mirror those in <em>Free Enterprise, </em>and the available review is not meaningful enough to set those two factors aside. Thus, the Appointments Clause challenge here is not \u201cof the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Thunder Basin, </em>510 U.S. at 212, 114 S.Ct. 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">I would reverse the decision of the district court and remand for an adjudication of the merits of the Appointments Clause claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. The majority describes the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors as coming into play only in the second part of a two-part test, seemingly splitting the analysis between asking (1) whether Congress intended to preclude district court jurisdiction and (2) whether Congress intended for the claims at issue to be reviewed within the statutory structure. Majority Op. at 281. I disagree with this dichotomy and the conclusion that the factors are relevant only to the second inquiry. <em>See, e.g., Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2136 (referring to <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors as relevant to the single argument characterized variously as: \u201cCongress does not intend to limit district court jurisdiction\u201d (alterations omitted) and \u201c[Petitioners'] claims are not the type that Congress intended to be reviewed within the [administrative] scheme\u201d). However, the majority opinion does not return to this schema and thereafter focuses on the <em>Thunder Basin </em>factors as answering the ultimate question of whether the appellants are precluded from bringing their constitutional claims in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-9\">. One of the plaintiffs did pursue remedies through the MSPB, but declined to appeal the decision he received within the administrative system, instead joining the others in their suit in district court. <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">. That paragraph in <em>Elgin </em>makes clear that each of the sentences cited by the majority at Majority Op. 289-90 are examples of cases with \u201cthreshold questions,\u201d not additional pathways to preclusion. See <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2140 (\"But petitioners overlook the many threshold questions that may accompany a constitutional claim and to which the MSPB can apply its expertise. Of particular relevance here, preliminary questions unique to the employment context may obviate the need to address the constitutional challenge. <em>For example, ... In addition, </em>.... <em>Or, </em>an employee's appeal may involve other statutory or constitutional claims that the MSPB routinely considers, in addition to a constitutional challenge to a federal statute.\u201d (emphases added)). The Supreme Court has elsewhere defined a \u201cthreshold question\u201d as one \"that must be resolved.... before proceeding to the merits [of another claim].\u201d <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 88-89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\">. In fact, in <em>Elgin, </em>only one of tire plaintiffs had initiated administrative proceedings; the others had filed suit directly in the district court but could have initiated proceedings. <em>Elgin, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2131. Consequently, the implication of the majority\u2019s reading of <em>Elgin </em>is likely to be even greater than this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. Given that the vast majority of all S E C administrative proceedings end in settlements rather than in actual decisions, it might well be that choosing to litigate is, in fact, equivalent to \"betting the farm.\u201d <em>See </em>Brian Maho-ney, <em>SEC Could Bring More Insider Trading Cases In-House, </em>Law360 (June 11, 2014), http://www.law3 60.com/articles/547183/sec-could-bring-more-insider-trading-cases-in-house (quoting Andrew Ceresney, the head of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, as explaining that the \"vast majority of our cases settle,\u201d and stating, \"I will tell you that there have been a number of cases in recent months where we have threatened administrative proceedings, it was something we told the other side we were going to do and they settled\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. Since the purpose of the application of the Free Enterprise factors is to determine whether Congress intended to deprive district courts of subject-matter jurisdiction to hear pre-administrative-adjudication claims, it seems relevant that Congress continues to authorize the SEC to choose whether it will pursue violations before its ALJs in administrative proceedings or in the district court as civil actions. To permit those subject to SEC enforcement actions to challenge administrative proceedings in the district courts on the basis of constitutional challenges that have nothing to do with the expertise of the SEC or with factual matters relevant to their Own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>particular circumstances would seem consistent with that Congressional intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
