R. App. P. 35 on the petition for rehearing en banc, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Entered at the direction of Judge Floyd.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b476-9\">NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ata\">dissenting from the denial of the petition for rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Bodily privacy is historically one of the most basic elements of human dignity and individual freedom. And forcing a person of one biological sex to be exposed to persons of the opposite biological sex profoundly offends this dignity and freedom. Have we not universally condemned as inhumane such forced exposure throughout history as it occurred in various contexts, such as in prisons? And do parents not universally find it offensive to think of having their children\u2019s bodies exposed to persons of the opposite biological sex?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Somehow, all of this is lost in the current Administration\u2019s service of the politically correct acceptance of gender identification as the meaning of \u201csex\u201d \u2014 indeed, even when the statutory text of Title IX provides no basis for the position. The Department of Education and the Justice Department, in a circular maneuver, now rely on the majority\u2019s opinion to mandate application of their position across the country, while the majority\u2019s opinion had relied solely on the Department of Education\u2019s earlier unprecedented position. The majority and the Administration\u2014 novelly and without congressional authorization \u2014 conclude that despite Congress\u2019s unambiguous authorization in Title IX to provide for the separation of restrooms, showers, locker rooms, and dorms on the basis of sex, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1686; 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 106.32, 106.33, they can override these provisions by redefining sex to mean how any given person identifies himself or herself at any given time, thereby, of necessity, denying all affected persons the dignity and freedom of bodily privacy. Virtually every civilization\u2019s norms on this issue stand in protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">These longstanding norms are not a protest against persons who identify with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>gender different from their biological sex. To the contrary, schools and the courts must, with care, seek to understand their condition and address it in permissible ways that are as helpful as possible in the circumstances. But that is not to say that, to do so, we must bring down all protections of bodily privacy that are inherent in individual human dignity and freedom. Nor must we reject separation-of-powers principles designed to safeguard Congress\u2019s policymaking role and the States\u2019 traditional powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">While I could call for a poll of the court in an effort to require counsel to reargue their positions before an en banc court, the momentous nature of the issue deserves an open road to the Supreme Court to seek the Court\u2019s controlling construction of Title IX for national application. And the facts of this case, in particular, are especially \u201cclean,\u201d such as to enable the Court to address the issue without the distraction of subservient issues. For this reason only and not because the issue is not sufficiently weighty for our en banc court, I am not requesting a poll on the petition for rehearing en banc. I do, however, vote to grant panel rehearing, which I recognize can only be symbolic in view of the majority\u2019s approach, which deferred to the Administration\u2019s novel position with a questionable application of <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). Time is of the essence, and I can only urge the parties to seek Supreme Court review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
