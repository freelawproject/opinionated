The \u25a0.second is the extent to which this subject must be elaborated in the title J and the third is the limit or license of \u2022discretion which the courts accord to the Legislature in determining for themselves what is a sufficient expression of \u2022the subject of the act in the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">I. What is the subject of this act? Common sense has \u2022some play in this matter. The title is \u201c An act in relation to the Florida Agricultural College.\u201d The mention of the term Florida Agricultural College leads the mind of even those who are the least informed, with most accurate promptness, to the only institution and the only property which, in the history of the legislation of this State, has been designated by such terms. Every mind concludes at once that it \u25a0.refers to the organization to which the State delegated the-duty of appropriating the land or land scrip granted by the United States to the State of Florida to the purpose of such grant, to wit: an Agricultural College.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The subject of the act is the property of every kind, includging the buildings erected at Eau Gallie as well as the other property of the organization, and the organization it-\u201d1 self. The most careful reading of the act discloses that there is nothing in it that does not relate to that college, its properties, organization or management; and that everything in it appertains to the college suggested by the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-5\">It is true that in Chapter 1905 of the Laws of Florida the corporators are constituted a body corporate and politic by the name of the <em>Florida State Agricultural </em>College, but it is equally true that by Chapter 1766 of the Laws of Florida-(the original act) the college is established as the <em>Florida Agricultural </em>College, (sec. 1) and it is unquestionable that the use of either designation brings to the mind of every intelligent man in Florida the same subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">There is nothing in either of the three acts in question which does not relate to the same subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">In the case of Morton, Bliss <em>&amp; </em>Co. vs. Comptroller General, (4 S.

The defendant, Woodward, was in possession of some of the property of the college, and the new trustees brought suit to recover it. He resisted the suit on the ground that the act changing the trustees was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-7\">Chief-Justice Marshall, in delivering his opinion in this case, said : <em>\u201c </em>If the act of incorporation was a grant of political power\u2014if it created a civil institution to be employed in the administration of the government, or if the funds of the college be public property, or if the State of Hew Hampshire as a government be alone interested in its transactions, the subject is one in which the Legislature of the State may act according to its own judgment, unrestrained by any limitation of its powers imposed by the Constitution of the United States;\u201d and again, \u201cwe are informed by the case of Philips vs. Barry, 1 Lord Raymond, 5, S. C., 2 T. R., 346, which contains all the doctrines of corporations connected with this point, that there are two kinds of corporations aggregate, viz : such as are for public government, and such as are for private charity. The first are those for the government of towns, cities or the like, and, being for public advantage, are to be governed according to the law of the land, the validity and justice of their private laws and constitution, are examinable in the King\u2019s Courts. Of these there \u2022 are no particular founders, and consequently no particular visitors. There are no pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>rons of these corporations; but private and particular corporations for charity, founded and endowed by private persons, are subject to the private government of those who create them, and are to be visited by them and their heirs as they may appoint. The only rules for the government of the private corporations are the laws and constitutions assigned by the founders. This right of government and visitation arises from the property which the founder had in the lands assigned to support the charity, and as he is the author of the charity, the law invests him with the necessary power of inspecting and regulating it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-5\">Justice Story, in the same case, also explains the difference between public and private corporations. He says: \u201c Another division of corporations is into public and private. Public corporations are generally esteemed such, or exist for public purposes only, such as towns, cities, parishes and counties, and in many respects they are so, though they involve some private interests; but strictly speaking, public corporations are such only as are founded by the government for public purposes, when the whole interest belongs to the government. If, therefore, the foundation be private, though under the charter of the government, the corporation is private, however extensive the uses may be to which it is devoted, either by the bounty of the founder, or the nature and objects of the institution. Eor instance, a bank created by the government for its own use, whose stock is owned exclusively by the government, is, in the strictest sense, a public corporation ; so a hospital created and endowed by the government for general charity. But a bank whose stock is owned by private persons is a private corporation, although it is created by the government and its objects and operations partake of a public nature.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-6\">A little further on, in the same opinion, Judge Story says : \u201c When the corporation is said at the bar to be public, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>it is not merely meant that the whole people may be the proper objects of the bounty, but that the government has the sole right, as trustee of the public interests, to regulate, control and direct the corporation, and its funds and its franchises,-at its own good will and pleasure. Row such an authority does not exist, except when the corporation is, in the strictest sense, public.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-5\">It is plain from the foregoing extracts from the opinions of Judges Marshall and Story, that the Legislature has the constitutional power to change the trustees, and in other respects to alter the charters of public corporations, but not of private ones.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-6\">The only question, therefore, is whether the Florida Agricultural College is a public or a private corporation ? It is clear from the extracts which I have read that if the funds with which the college was established are public, then the college is a public corporation, if not it is a private corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-7\">The only question left is: \"Were the funds with which this college was founded public or private ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-8\">The act of incorporation of 1870 shows upon its face that all the funds with which the college was endowed were public\u2014the property of the State through the gift of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-9\">Sec. 7 of said act reads thus : \u201c See. 7. Said trustees are hereby authorized to claim and receive from the Secretary of the Interior the Agricultural Land Scrip to which this State is entitled, by act of Congress of July 2, 1862, and acts supplemental thereto. Said scrip is hereby transferred and assigned to and vested in the Trustees of the Florida Agricultural College and their successors and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-10\">The scrip so granted by Congress to the State, and by the State to the College, is expressly recognized in sections 8, 9,12 and 17 of said act as <em>\" </em>the fund \u201d or <em>*( </em>funds \u201d of slid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>college, and no mention is made in the act of any other \u201c fund or funds \u201d whatever. That the whole fund of the college at the time of its incorporation consisted of said gr.ant, is an historical fact too well authenticated to need argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">The funds of the college being public property, it follows, in the language of Chief Justice Marshall, that the subject is one in which the Legislature of the State may act according to its own judgment, unrestrained by any limitation of its power imposed by the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-6\">The law thus laid down in the' Dortmouth College cas\u00e9 has been received and acted on by the courts of Alabama', Arkansas and Kentucky, and perhaps other States, where banks, colleges and other institutions, whose funds were furnished exclusively by the State, have been adjudged to be public institutions, whose charters are subject to be amended and altered at the will of the Legislature. See 5 Stewart and Porter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-7\">The case of McCulloch vs. the United States was decided in 1820, 4 Wheaton, 316, and Osborn vs. The Rank in 1824, 9 Wheaton, 738. These cases hold that the bank of the United States was a public corporation, created for public and national purposes. The court treated the United States bank as one of the institutions of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-8\">In Osborn vs. The Bank of the United States, C. J. Marshall said: \u201c The bank is not considered as a private corporation, whose principal object is individual trade and individual profit, but as a public corporation created for nanational purposes.\u201d * * * <em>\u201c </em>It was not created for its own sake, or for private purposes.\u201d 9 Wheaton, Con. R., 770.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-9\">The whole opinion of the court is founded on the idea that the bank in McCulloch vs. Maryland is an institution which is necessary and proper for carrying into effect the powers vested in the government of the United States. \u201c It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>,.is not an instrument which the government found ready : made and supposed to he adapted to its purposes, but one ' which was created in the form in which it now appears for : national purposes only. It is undoubtedly capable of transacting private as well as public business. While it is the great instrument by which the fiscal operations of the gov- , ernment are effected, it is also trading with individuals for -its own advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-5\">A writer in the Law Eeview says: \u201c The opinion of Taney in the bridge case was, as Story felt, a great departure from the principles underlying the opinion of Marshall in Fletcher ys. Peck and in the college case. The opinion in Munn vs. The People is, in effect, a far greater one.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-7\">The court will see from the foregoing opinions that the Supreme Court of the United States has largely modified its rulings in the college case, and now holds a good many institutions to be public and subject to legislative control, which could not be so held under the strict rulings of that case. But admitting all the rulings in the Dartmouth College case to be in full force, I have shown that the Florida Agricultural College is a public corporation, whose trustees may be removed by the Legislature. This was the view of the law taken by the Legislature, when, in 1872, they amended the charter by changing the trustees, and this was the view taken in 1877, when the trustees were again changed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlI\">To quote the language of Judge Washington : \u201c These .trustees have no interest, no privileges and immunities .which are violated by such interference. * * They accepted the charter for the public benefit alone, and there should seem to be no reason why the government, under proper limitations, should not alter or modify such a grant at pleasure. * <em>* </em>* All those powers, rights and privileges flow from the property of the founder in the funds assigned for the support of the charity. * * * * The \u2022 endower- is the <em>perficient </em>-founder to whom of right belong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>all the powers and privileges which have been described.\u201d * By looking at the acj\u00a1 of Congress of July 2, 1862, the-\u00bb court will see clearly that Congress intended that this college should be a State or public, and not a private institu- - tion. The first and second sections give to the State the land scrip on which the college is to be founded. The third section provides that the State shall pay all expenses in the management of the monies received from the sale of the scrip. The fourth section provides that the State Legislature shall prescribe the manner in which the prescribed studies shall be conducted. The fifth section provides that the Legislature alone can authorize- the expenditure of money in the purchase of sites for experimental farms; that the State \u201c shall be bound to pay the United States the amount received for any lands previously sold, &amp;c.; that the State shall make an annual report tq the Secretary of the Interior of the progress of the college,\u201d including State, industrial and economical statistics. By the eighth section the Governor of the State is required to report annually to Congress the sales of the land scrip- and the disposition made of the proceeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-5\">Under the act of Congress the Legislature could not have made this a private college,- even if it had tried to do so. . It would have been eminently improper for the State to place this magnificent fund, given to her by Congress, under the*-control of irresponsible trustees, whom she could not remove, even though she should see that they were wasting\u00bb the: fund. Such an act by her would have been a just cause - for -the invocation of the grant by Congress. But the State*of Florida intended no such act of folly and injustice. j</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-6\">By the seventeenth section of the act of 1870 the Comptroller of the State is authorized to make examination from' time to time, as he may see fit, into the actions and doings of said trustees, to the end that he may ascertain whether the proceeds committed to them have been managed accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ing to the letter and intent of this act, and the trustees are required, to report to the Comptroller annually.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-5\">By seetioh 18 of the act of 1870 the trustees are required' to report to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction annually all their actions and doings, and: said Superintendent is required- to lay said report of the Trustees before <em>&lt;l </em>the Legislature at the beginning of each regular session.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-6\">But why should the report of the trustees be laid before the Legislature, along with the reports of the examinations of the State Comptroller, if the Legislature has surrendered all its power to the trustees,,and were to he mere passive spectators of their actions ? Evidently it was the intention of the Legislature in thus providing for keeping itself constantly advised of .the conduct of the trustees, to keep itself in pqsition to correct abuses by the removal of trustees in proper cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-7\">The twentieth section of the act of 1870 provides that Ci the Judges of the Supreme Court of the State shall constitute. an examining committee, with power to investigate the affairs of the corporation, and to appoint proxies in their. stead.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-8\">In private corporations the \u201c <em>incipiens fwndator </em>\u201d alone appoints visitors and examiners to look into the affairs of his,corporation and report to him, in order that he may:correct. abuses Wo one else has a right to. intermeddle with, his corporation; but in a public corporation the State' appoints the visitors, such as-the Comptroller, and the Justices of the Supreme Court in this case, and they report, not to the Trustees, but to the State, the <em>inovpims-fwndator </em>and, <em>-peroipiens fwndator </em>of this college, in order that, the State, through its Legislature, may eorreot abuses, by removing the, trustees or amending the charter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>E.

The Attorney-General denies this, and claims that it was established by the latter act alone. The act approved February 17, 1872, did not, of itself, provide for the establishment of a college. It was simply supplementary to and amendatory of the act approved February 18, 1870, which provided all the details for the organization and management of the college, and it so expressly stated both in the title and in the body of the act. The first act did not take effect until after the passage of the second act, because the corporators therein named failed to accept it. The supplemental act provided new corporators in place of those who declined to act; changed the name of the college from \u201c The Florida Agricultural College \u201d tp \u201c The Florida State Agricultural College,\u201d and made several other alterations. The two acts then became one act, and, together, formed the charter of the college, which the corporators, named in the supplemental act, accepted, and under which they organized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-6\"><em>The Act approved March </em>7, 1877, <em>does not comply with the Requirements of the Constitution of the State.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-7\">Section 14 of Article IV., of the Constitution of Florida, provides as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-8\">\u201c Section 14.

An act creating a college cannot properly be entitled an act in relation to that college, for the term implies the pre-existence of the thing to which the act relates. There was no institution in existence by the name of \u201c The Florida Agricultural College,\u201d in relation to which acts could be passed. The act really embraces several subjects, none of which are expressed in its title. One subject is, professedly, the amendment of certain sections of the act approved February 17, 1872; but in reality is the creation of a new corporation under a new name. Another subject is the transfer of thefproperty belonging to the Florida State Agricultural College to this new corporation. Another subject is the location of the Florida State Agricultural College.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-5\">Under the common law, the title of an act, or the preamble to it, are not, strictly speaking, parts of the act; (1 Kent Com., 509,) but where the Constitution provides that the subject shall be expressed in the title, the title becomes a part of the act.

The land was conveyed to the trustees, and the permanent location of - the college-was fixed by the trustees at Eau Gallie, where a collegebuildipg was subsequently erected. The act of March 7,. .1877, authorizes the trustees therein named to remove the college from Eau Gallie to some other place, thus utterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ignoring and deliberately violating the contract made with Mr. Gleason. A law, then, which authorizes the removal of the college without the consent of the donor of these lands, is a law impairing the obligation of a contract, and is within the prohibition of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-5\"><em>The Legislature, m Passing the Act of March </em>7, 1877 <em>Exceeded its Power.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-6\">- The Florida State Agricultural College is a private eleemosynary corporation, incorporated\" by the Legislature of Florida on the strength of an endowment promised by the United States Government. The endowment, though granted to the State in terms, was not intended for the use of the . State, nor to be subject to the control of the State, for the manner in which it was to be invested, and the uses to which it was to be applied, were expressly stated in the grant. It was, by the terms of the grant, to be given to at least one Agricultural College, to be established by the State within a specified time. The State was made a trustee, (1 Perry on Trusts, 41,) and was to be. held responsible for the faithful execution of the trust and the safe-keeping of the fund. A State can only execute a trust through officers or corporations.created by the Legislature for that purpose, and the State, therefore, created this corporation to manage the fund and control the college. In granting the charter it might have reserved to itself the power to change the trustees, but it did not do so, and consequently the corporators named in the charter acquired a permanent right to their character as trustees, which could only be divested in the manner pointed out in the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-7\">In point of fact, however, the State never became even a trustee; for, having failed to comply with the conditions of the grant, the United States refused to deliver to it the scrip.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>and, without such delivery, the grant did not take effect. 1 Perry on Trusts, Sec. 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\">The Florida State Agricultural College being, then, an existing corporation, capable of taking and holding property for the purposes specified in its charter, Congress ignored the State and made a new grant, followed by actual delivery of the scrip to this college. The result is that the State is absolved from any responsibility relative to the fund, or from any obligation to keep it undiminished, and the college holds and manages the fund, subject only to the limitations and conditions prescribed in its charter, and not subject to any control on the part of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">The Constitution of Florida provides that \u201c no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken without just compensation.\u201d Declaration of Rights, Sec. 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">A corporation is a person, and the rights, privileges and franchises of a body corporate and politic are as much \u201cproperty\u201d as are real and personal estate. Blackstone, after enumerating other liberties and franchises, says : \u201c It is likewise a franchise for a number of persons to be incorporated and subsist as a body politic, with a power to maintain perpetual succession and do other corporate acts; and each individual member of such corporation is also said to have a franchise or liberty.\u201d 2 Black. Com., 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-8\">The property belonging to the college is also the property1 of the trustees. It is true they hold it in trust for certain purposes, but the legal estate is theirs, and this legal estate is as much an object of legal protection as any other estate. But whatever may be the title of the trustees, this property certainly is not the property of the State. It was given directly to the trustees by the Upited States Government and by individuals; it never was, either directly or indirectly, \u2022the property of the State, nor in its possession, nor subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>to its control; nor has the State ever expended a single dollar towards endowing or maintaining the college.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\">The act of March 7, 1877, then, deprives the respondents of their property in the rights, privileges and franchises belonging to them as trustees of the Florida State Agricultural College without due process of law, and it takes away from them private property, the property of a private corporation, in which they have a legal estate, without just compensation.

These acts, giving a condensed statement of their provisions, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Chapter 1766, of the Laws of Florida, is an act to establish the Florida Agricultural College. The first section of the act established the college. The second section announces its design and purpose. The third section constitutes certain persons a body corporate, by the name of the Trustees of the Florida Agricultural College, investing them with the general powers of a corporation, and with right to use a corporate seal. The fourth section gives the power of removal from office, as well as the power of filling vacancies in office. The 5th section provides for the election of an executive committee with named powers. The 6th provides for their compensation. The 7th, 8th and 9th relate to the agricultural land scrip, which the State is entitled to under the act of Congress of July 2, 1862, the investment of the proceeds of the sale thereof and application of the interest. The 10th provides for the location of the college. The 11th makes the expense incurred in procuring and selling the scrip a charge against the State. The 12th authorizes an investment of the money in State bonds. The 13th gives the trustees power to name a president of the college and professors, and for their compensation. The l\u00e9th provides for the faculty. The 15th prescribes their duties. The 16th provides that each county may send one student for each member of the Assembly. The 17th gives the Comptroller authority to examine the acts of the trustees, and makes it their duty to report to him. The 18th requires the trustees to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The 19th authorizes the Legislature to add other departments of learning. The 20th provides that the Justices of the Supreme Court shall constitute an examining committee to inquire into the affairs of the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Chapter 1905, of the Laws of Florida, is \u201c An act supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>mentary to Chapter 1766 of the session laws of 1870, being an aet to establish the Florida Agricultural College.\u201d The 1st section of this act repeals sections 3 and 5 of Chapter 1766. Section 3 of Chapter 1766 named the trustees and established them a body corporate, with right to use a corporate seal and have succession. Section 5 of that chapter provided for their first meeting, for the election of officers and an executive committee and fixed their powers. Sections 2 and 3 of the supplementary act are plainly in lieu of sections 3 and 5 of the first act thus repealed. These sections of the supplementary act named certain persons as corporators under the name of the \u201c Florida State Agricultural College,\u201d giving them corporate powers and defining their duties and powers, and it is under <em>these sections </em>that respondents claim title. The necessary conclusion is, that the two sections, 2 and 3 of the supplementary act, were in lieu of sections 3 and 5 of the first act. Section 4 of the last act gives them power to construst college buildings, \u25a0 to sue and be sued, and to receive donations. Section 5 gives each State Senator the right to nominate a student, who shall be entitled to receive instruction at the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">-Chapter 3045, of the Laws of Florida, is \u201c An act in relation to the Florida Agricultural College.\u201d The 1st section enacts that section 2 of <em>\u201c </em>An act supplementary to Chapter 1766 of the session laws of 1870, being an act to establish the Florida Agricultural College,\u201d be amended so as to read as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u201c The Superintendent of Public'Instruction and the Treasurer of the State of Florida, by virtue of their offices as such, and J. Wofford Tucker,'. David S. Walker, J. H. Roper, James M. Baker, C. H. Smith, F. Branch, W. D. Barnes, their successors, are hereby constituted a body corporate and politic by the name of the <em>\u2018 </em>Florida Agricultural College,\u2019 and are entrusted with the general powers of a corporation for the benefit of causing to be taught such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>branches of learning pertaining to agriculture and the mechanic arts, military tactics, and other scientific and classical studies, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life, and said corporation shall have perpetual succession, as is provided in the original act incorporating said college, and the right to use a corporate seal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The 2d section provides \u201c that section 3 of said Chapter 1905 be amended so as to read as follows.\u201d Then follows the substituted section, making the Superintendent of Public Instruction and State Treasurer ex-ofiicio President and and Treasurer of the Board of Trustees. It also provides for an executive committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The 3d section authorizes the Treasurer to receive the property belonging to the board; the 4th gives the trustees power to remove the college from its present location, and the 5th is the usual repealing clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The clause of the State Constitution, to which this last act is claimed to be obnoxious, is as follows: ci Each law enacted in the Legislature shall embrace but one subject and matter properly connected therewith, which subject shall be briefly expressed in the title, and no law shall be amended or revised by reference to its title <em>only; </em>but in such case the act as revised, or section as amended, shall be re-enacted and published at- length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The first objection to the act approved March 7, 1877, which we consider, is that it undertakes to amend the act of' February 17, 1872, by reference t\u00f3 its title only. This, in point of fact, is a mistake. The amending act not only refers to the title of the act being amended, but it also refers to the chapter of the act being amended, and the sections as amended are re-enacted and published at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">.The only authority under which the respondents claim to hold and exercise their franchises is the second section of. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the act of February 17, 1872. This the act of 1877 repeals in express terms, and in a 'manner complying with the constitutional requirements as to the method of amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The next objection is that \u201c the subject of the act is not briefly expressed, is not expressed at all in the. title; that an act creating a college cannot properly be entitled an act in relation to that college, for the term implies the pre-exist-; ence of the thing to which the act relates. There was no institution in existence by the name of <em>c The Florida Agricultural </em>College,\u2019 in -relation to which acts could be passed. The act really embraces several subjects ; none of which are expressed in its title. One subject is professedly the amendment of certain sections of. the act approved February 17, 1872, but in reality is the creation of a new corporation under a new name. Another subject is the transfer of the property belonging to the Florida State Agricultural College to this corporation. Another subject is the location of the Florida State Agricultural College.\u201d There is nothing in the objection that th'e Legislature cannot establish \u2022 a college or corporation because it is not in existence already. On the contrary, the very fact that it' does not exist is the cause and reason for legislative action to bring it into existence. If it existed before, there is no necessity for legislation bringing it into existence; nor is there any objection to proper legis- \u25a0 lation in respect to it when it does exist. Where is there any limitation upon the power of- the Legislature in this respect ? There is none. The creation of new corporations \u2022 and the changing of the names of public corporations, are \u2022 admitted powers of this branch of the government. The \u25a0title of this act relates to the \u201c Florida Agricultural College,\u201d and the provisions of the law following embrace noth- \u25a0 ing but the subject of the <em>\u201c </em>Florida Agricultural College \u201d \u2022 and matter properly connected therewith. Every section of this law, when examined, will be found to refer to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>subject alone. This title indicates the one general subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It is not necessary to state in detail in the title the matters embraced in the body of the statute connected with that subject. The act is properly entitled in relation to the Florida Agricultural College. If the body of the act relates to that one subject, and if the Florida State Agricultural College is matter properly connected with the Florida Agricultural College, as created by the act and in view of its general purposes looking to its particular provisions, that is enough. I do not think, looking to the authorities upon this subject, that there is any sanction for the idea that an act in relation to a new corporation is not a sufficient statement of the subject of an act which, in its body, changes the name of an existing corporation to the new name stated in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">While the provision in the Constitution is mandatory, still \u201cthere has been a general disposition in the courts of this and other States to construe it liberally rather than embarrass legislation by a construction where strictness is unnecessary to the accomplishment of the beneficial purposes for which it was adopted.\u201d Gibson vs. The State, 16 Fla.; Cool. Con. Lim., 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As is said by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, (20 Wis., 411,) \u201c the subjects of legislation are usually expressed with the utmost brevity and conciseness in their titles, and some consideration must be given to this circumstance in determining the question. The court is not to set aside or declare an act void because the subject was not as fully or as unequivocally expressed as it might otherwise have been. A liberal rule of interpretation must prevail in this respect, not only for the reason just stated, but because the proposition Is to strike down and defeat the act of the Legislature, which can never be done upon any slight or untenable grounds. It is a truth which has been often asserted and often acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>upon by the courts, that to justify the annulling of a statute by judicial sentence, the violation of the Constitution, must be clear and unmistakable.\u201d Considering, therefore, that the statement of the subject is always concise, I cannot see' how it can be contended that each and every section of this act does not relate to the Florida Agricultural College. This section of the Constitution relates to the exercise of legislative power by the legislative department of the government, and for this reason, among others, some of the State courts have held that it is directory. While. we cannot agree with this conclusion, still we do say that the conflict must be clear before any act of the Legislature is to be declared by us unconstitutional for non-compliance with requirements as to the method of enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It is insisted further that the two other remaining sections of the act of 1877 amend some part of the antecedent statutes of 1870 and 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Upon an examination of these sections it will be found that their effect is to give the' new corporation additional powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The trustees having been changed by the first section of the act, section three gives the new treasurer power to receive and send for all property belonging to the board, and the fourth section gives the new trustees power to remove the college from its present site.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">It is insisted further that the act of 1877 is a revision of the acts of 1870 and 1872. An act cannot be said to be an act revising \"two other acts, unless it is apparent and clear that the provisions of the new act are to be in lieu of the preceding acts. Because the provisions of this act affect some older law on the same subject, by adding in one section to the power of the treasurer, and in another giving additional power to the board, it cannot be said to be an act revising the antecedent act. So far as this act is amendatory in its character, it complies with the constitutional limitation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the other sections are original and not revisory legislation in the sense of that word as used in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Every act containing different provisions upon a matter which has been already the subject of legislation cannot be called a revisory act. 40 Ala., 77; 41 Ala., 18 ; 13 Mich., 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The next general proposition as to this statute is that it impairs the obligation of a contract. The statute changes the trustees of this college. It substitutes the trustees named in the act of 1877 for those named in the act of 1872, as the act of 1872 substituted those named in it for those mentioned in the act of 1870. The ground upon which this view is based is that this is a private not a public' corporation. The corporation is itself founded by the State through property derived from the government of the United States. These trustees are made by this legislation the agents of the State to collect and disburse property appropriated by the General Government to the State for a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">There is not and never was any private property in the trustees in the funds. They were derived from the government. The founder of this institution was the government of the State of Florida, and the property which constituted its basis was public moneys of the State of Florida derived by it from the government of the United States in trust for the establishment of an institution of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">It never was the purpose of the State of Florida to give these trustees any private right to this property. Throughout the whole legislation they are shown to be simple public agents to manage a public property. The only <em>right </em>they have to it is by the legislation of the State, and every section of these acts shows that it was founded by public funds and for a public purpose. 5 Stew. <em>&amp; </em>Port., <em>23; 4 </em>Wheat., 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">It may be true that any legislation of the State appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ating these funds to any other purpose than that public purpose named in the act of Congress, might have been in bad faith, but that is a matter which does not concern these trustees, nor does this fact change the nature of the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">It is insisted that the obligation bf a contract with W. H. Gleason is impaired by the act of 1877, in that it directs a removal of the college. This question is entirely independent of the question raised in this case, which is the right of the trustees to hold and _ exercise a public trust against the provisions of a statute naming other persons trustees in their stead.
