At common law such common carrier cannot charge excessive or unreasonable rates of freight. The common law protects the individual from. extortion and limits the carrier to a reasonable rate, but there is no common law rule requiring equal rates. What is charged one person, and the tariff of rates, are but matter of evidence to determine whether a charge is a reasonable compensation for the service performed.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-10\">Writ of error to the Circuit Court for Escambia county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-11\">The plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff in the Circuit Court, sued the defendant in error in an action of assumpsit. The declaration contained several counts, but a non-suit having been taken as to all but the first count, this count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>alone and the pleadings and proceedings relating to it constitute the case before this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">The first count alleges that the defendant being a common carrier of lumber and other merchandise between Per-dido bay and Pensacola bay, in the county aforesaid, and as such carrier bound by law to furnish the like transportation at the same rates of freight to all shippers by its railroad, did, in disregard and violation of its legal duty and obligation, compel the plaintiff to pay to the said defendant, between the 1st day of July, A. D. 1874, and the 1st ofMax-ch, A. D. 1877, fifty cents per thousand feet on 4,400,000 feet of lumber shipped by plaintiff over said i\u2019aikoad, making an aggregate of $22,000 in excess of what the said defendant charged the Perdido Bay Lumber Company for like transportation over said railroad during <em>the said period between 1st day of July, A. D. </em>1874, <em>and </em>ls\u00bf <em>of Ma/roh, A:D. </em>1877, and that thereby the said defendant became indebted to the plaintiff in the said sum of $22,000 ; and being so indebted, the defendant afterwards, to wit: on the 1st day of March, 1877, pi\u2019omised to pay to the plaintiff the said sum of $22,000; but although often so requested to do hath hitherto wholly refused to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-6\">To this count the defendant demurred.

That the discrimination was <em>\u201c </em>in consideration of the said Perdido Bay Lumber Company furnishing defendant with a great amount of business.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">, The contract contradicts this statement; for it only provides for lumber that may be manufactured to the extent of 30,000,000 feet or under, and therefore the discrimination applied to any quantity short of the 30,000,000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-9\">Besides, we have no comparative statements of the quantity shipped by plaintiff and the favored company, and, therefore, the argument is but fair that we have no such statements, because they would not sustain defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-10\">\u201d But to justify discrimination on the ground of the mere difference in the amount of business done by shippers would be to make the effect justify the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-11\">Eor to say that for like transportations, one mill, one cotton shipper, or one town, shall be charged less freight than another, is a sure way of enabling it to ship more than such other. The carrier would decide the .race of competition before it begun. But this feature of the plea does not touch the objection which lies at the root of a discriminating rate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-12\">The essence of discrimination is, that you do for one shipper what you will not do for another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Here the rate was reduced one-third, in consideration of a great amount' of business, as it is pretended. Now, if a \u201c great amount of business \u201d was to be obtained from one shipper by a reduced rate, why might not another \u201cgreat amount \u201d be procured from another shipper by a like reduction ? But the contract absolutely forbids, for ten years, any reduction to any other shipper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">It is patent, therefore, on the face of the contract itself, that it was not \u201c a great amount of business \u201d to be secured th\u00e1t prompted the arrangement, but an undue advantage to be conceded to Queal &amp; Co. over and above all other shippers.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-6\">In respect to the express undertaking, not to do for others-what was done for Queal <em>&amp; </em>Co., this case stands alone in the history of discrimination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-7\">3d. That contract was entered into long before plaintiff acquired any interest in mill property on defendant\u2019s road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-8\">It is a sufficient answer to this point, that the contract was void at its inception, so far as it touched the rights of the public, of which plaintiff is one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-9\">Again, plaintiff\u2019s rights, as one of the public, to use defendant\u2019s road at such such time as he saw fit on like terms as any other citizen, is something derived from the State, which the defendant can neither abridge nor destroy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-10\">The third ground of demurrer alleges that the contract between plaintiff and defendant required plaintiff to pay $1.50, \u201c as the regular established rate,\u201d but that $1.50 was not such rate, since the Perdido Bay Lumber Company was not required to pay more than $1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-11\">The plea admits that plaintiff contracted to pay $1.50, as the \u201c regular established ratebut relying on the order of time in which the contracts were executed, without venturing, however, to charge upon plaintiff notice of the Queal &amp; Co. agreement, it insinuates, rather than charges, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s undertaking was to pay $1.50 absolutely, when he shipped on defendant\u2019s cars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-5\">As plaintiff\u2019s contract makes no reference to the Queal <em>&amp; </em>Co. contract, and he had no notice of it, the latter can have no bearing on the construction of the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">As $1.50, according to the plea, had been announced to mill-owners as the regular and established rate, so it is recognized in plaintiff\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">The end and object of plaintiff\u2019s contract was to enable him to facilitate his transportation by putting five cars on defendant\u2019s road, and to fix the rate of freight on them, and not to fix-the rate of freight when ^ defendant\u2019s cars were used, for the contract assumes this rate to be already \u201c established.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-8\">The reference to the $1.50 rate was made, not for the purpose of incorporating it into, but excepting it from the operation of the contract, and, at most, it is but a recognition of what was the regular rate at the date of the contract, .and perfectly consistent with the case presented in the first count of the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-9\">The contract is dated 2d March, 1874. The discrimination complained of began, according to the declaration, on 1st July, 1874.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-10\">Consent, that on 2d March, 1874, $1.50 was the regular established rate, is no recognition of it as such rate on and after 1st of July, 1874, when it had become an irregular, partial, discriminating, and, therefore, illegal rate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-11\">Again, if this feature of the contract is viewed, not as an exceptional clause, or mere recognition of an existing rate, but as an agreement to pay $1.50, as \u201c a regular established rate,\u201d the agreement involves two obligations. Defendant contracts that $1.50 shall be the regular established rate, that is to say, the uniform rate required by the common right, and applicable to all shippers. The plaintiff contracts to pay that rate, not absolutely, but conditionally, upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>remaining such \u201c regular established rate.\u201d The undertakings are dependent, and the. agreement expresses only the correlative right and duties of the parties as prescribed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">To an action on the contract by defendant against plaintiff for freight at the rate of $1.50, would it not be a good plea in bar that at the time the same was reduced, $1.50 had ceased to be the regular established rate ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">To read the agreement as an undertaking to pay $1.50, absolutely and unconditionally, the words \u201c regular established rate \u201d must be blotted out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">To retain them is to exclude the idea of any but a common and equal rate, applicable to all shippers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Regular \u201d implies uniformity, according to rule or law. <em>\u201c </em>Established \u201d implies fixed, settled. Is that rate uniform which applies to one man and not another ? Can that be settled and fixed in law which is contrary to law ?'</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arb\">This construction of plaintiff\u2019s agreement is in harmony with its language and the rules of law which it embodies, whilst it is consistent with the legal duties and obligations o\u00ed defendant as a common carrier, whose contracts are always construed so as to make them accord with those duties and obligations. The St. Louis, &amp;c., Railway Co. vs. Smuck, et al., 49 Ind., 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apb\">Any other construction would work the grossest injustice to plaintiff; for when he shipped on his own cars, (the use of which it is fairly inferrable from the agreement-was worth to defendant 50 cents per M. feet of lumber,) he would ;be charged the same rate as the Perdido Bay Lumber Company, which relied on the defendant\u2019s cars exclusively. On the other hand, when plaintiff shipped on defendant\u2019s cars he would be charged 50 cents more than that company, and thus, in either case, he would be the object of .hostile, and the company of favorable, discrimination to the extent of 50 cents per M. feet, a difference sufficient to break him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>down in the race of competition, especially on a low market.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-5\">This action is for the 50 cents excess of the discriminating charge when plaintiff shipped on defendant\u2019s cars, between 1st of July, 1874, and 1st March, 1877. And the following is a summary of the principles on which it rests: \u25a0 Equality is the measure of the enjoyment of a common or public right, as it is of the burdens of such enjoym'ent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-6\">The maximum enjoyment of such right conceded to one for a given charge, is the minimum enjoyment to which another can be restricted for a like charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"177\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-7\">On the other hand, the minimum charge fixed for a given amount of enjoyment by one, is the maximum charge that can be exacted from another for a like enjoyment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"178\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-8\">And a contract between the manager of such public right, or use, with one party, to change that measure of enjoyment or burden is as futile, as against the public, as would be the attempt to bind the rights of 0. by a contract between A. and B.</p>\n<p data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b654-9\">Nor can the impecuniosity of such manager be pleaded as a justification in such case, any more than it could be available as a defence for the breach of any other legal obligation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-10\"><em>E.

This court, then, may at the outset, and without inquiring into the sufficiency of defendant\u2019s .pleas, refuse to reverse the judgment, because of the insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s declaration to sustain a different judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-6\">To hold that plaintiff\u2019s declaration would support a judgment in his favor, the court must hold that defendant, by carrying for the Perdido Bay Lumber Company at one-third less than its tariff rate, became indebted to the plaintiff in one-third of the amount received for the three years\u2019 service. Had defendant carried for Perdido Bay Lumber Company for nothing, then it would have become indebted to the plaintiff in the whole amount paid it for transportation; and this without any allegation that plaintiff was in any respect injured by defendant\u2019s liberality to the Perdido Bay Lumber Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-7\">This is very different from a case where a carrier had charged a customer more than its adopted tariff, or more than a reasonable rate, which party had paid under protest. In such case he might, probably, by action recover back the over-charge, or if carrier\u2019s rates are limited by statute, and the carrier charges and the customer pays beyond the limit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-8\">The defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration was overruled mainly upon the authority of Chig. &amp; Alton R.

To compel a common carrier, because licensed by the State, to treat all cases, however different, in identically the same way, would-, be like compelling the doctors, because they are licensed, to - administer to all parties identically the same medicine, regardless of different symptoms and circumstances. When-the plaintiff, by his demurrer, admits the 3d plea, he admits there was no discrimination, lawful or unlawful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-10\">By admitting the 4th plea, he admits that he was not, damaged by the action of defendant. The suit is solely for.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>damages, and by his demurrer to 4th plea he admits he has no cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">The purpose of the 5th plea is to negative any charge or implication that the defendant charged the fifty cents less in discrimination between the Perdido Bay Lumber Co. and the plaintiff, and to that end the plea alleges that the less charge was made for the benefit of defendant and not to benefit the Perdido Bay Lumber Co., or prejudice the plaintiff, and therefore was not an \u201c unreasonable, unjust, or unlawful discrimination.\u201d Nor would it have been under the strict statutes in force in England.

That question in no way affects this case or the sufficiency of the plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-11\">This plea fully sets forth the consideration which defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ant received in'lieu of the fifty cents per thousand feet for \u25a0freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-5\">Admit, if plaintiff so desires, that the contract is bad; 'the $10,000 is not bad \u25a0; there is nothing void in that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-6\">And it is not material whether or not the Perdido Bay \u25a0Lumber Co. could force the defendant to carry its lumber .and make the agreed deduction, although it paid the $10,-000 for freight in advance and built \u00fap a large business for defendant. The only question is, did considerations move from the Perdido Bay Lumber Co. to defendant, so that defendant - was -justified in, and benefited by, securing \u25a0that money and that business, upon the terms of the agreement?</p>\n<p data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avp\">Was there any consideration which supplied the place of the fifty cents per thousand feet? Was not the payment in advance, and long in advance, a consideration ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-8\">Admit that the contract was ineffectual to bind the company, for the reasons urged by plaintiff, still there remains the fact shown by the contract, or paper, or whatever it may be called, that the defendant was induced to remit fifty \u25a0eents per- thousand feet, in consideration of the use of $10,-\u25a0000, which the lender could only hope to get back by doing what defendant- was at that time moving heaven and earth to have done, that is, by building up a large business for the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-9\">So as to the contract between plaintiff and defendant: it \u2022may be a void contract in every particular urged by the counsel for the plaintiff; yet the plea is a good plea, and the con- \u25a0 traet fulfills the- part allotted to it. It shows defendant could have had no intention of discrimination in favor of the Perdido Bay Lumber Co., and against the plaintiff; of attempting to biiild up one and keep down the other, as argued by plaintiff. It shows that plaintiff well knew defendant\u2019s established rates of $1.50, and that he, in consideration of certain advantages, (the privilege of putting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>own cars on the road and transporting upon them at less rate) voluntarily contracted to pay that established rate for freight shipped on defendant\u2019s cars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-5\">Plaintiff having thus for a consideration voluntarily contract to pay the rates and prices he has paid, by what principle does he now come and claim the right to recover that money back, without any allegation of fraud, undue advantage or concealment ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-6\">Plaintiff makes no complaint of invidious discrimination in allowing him fifty cents deduction from the adopted tariff, in consideration of his furnishing cars for the road, which (inasmuch as defendant had the right to become the owner of said cars by refunding to the plaintiff the cost thereof) was one form of making a loan to defendant, but the cry comes in when the Perdido Bay Lumber Oo. is alloyed the' same in consideration of its furnishing the money necessary for defendant\u2019s very existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">The plaintiff discerns a great difference between freight being carried on his cars, and another customer\u2019s money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-8\">That the consideration and inducements for the less charge to the Perdido Bay Lumber Co. would be sufficient, under the most strict laws against discrimination, is seen by a careful examination of the plaintiff\u2019s own authorities, and by reference to Nicholson vs. Great Western Railway Co., 5th C. B., (N. S.) 366, reviewed and reaffirmed in. 7th C. B., (N.

If the law of the State requires modification to protect the people against corporations, defendant has no fear but that\u2019 this court will leave it to the Legislature to make that modification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-5\">\u2022 But if we admit the declaration sufficient, and admit that the common law, and that is the law of this State, imposes - upon common carriers the obligation to charge equal rates-to all their customers, the pleas come in and deny the inequality, for they show that the defendant received as mucht benefit for its service from the one customer as the other... The $1 paid to defendant, February 16, 1872, for service to-be rendered July 1, 1874, was equal to $1.50 charged to-plaintiff and paid at the time of service. Where,'then, is-'the inequality of price? It is no more of an inequality than if one customer had paid for his freight one dollar in.gold worth one dollar and a half, while plaintiff paid in &lt; currency worth only par.</p>\n<p data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-6\">By reference to the two contracts attached to the pleas, it will be seen that defendant was not only ready to extend,, but actually has extended to the plaintiff the same or similar privileges. In consideration of plaintiff\u2019s loaning five cars he gets reduction upon a great part of his shipments,, the same as that allowed to the lender of the money, and to-this day he may get the same reduction on all his shipments by availing himself of the privilege extended to him of loaning the defendant five more cars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-7\">The court cannot fail to observe the difference between* contract X. and-.the contract \"in'Messenger vs. Penn. R. R.. Co., (7 Vroom, 407,) cited by plaintiff, and the only case in which it does not appear that any State statute figured..</p>\n<p data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-8\">In the contract in that case it does not appear that there-was any payment in advance, or other circumstances that made the less price for which , the railroad company hath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>agreed to carry plaintiff\u2019s goods equal to the prices charged to others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-5\">In contract X. there were circumstances and considerations which made the nominally less charge to the P. B. L\u201e Co. equal, if not greater than the adopted tariff charged to plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-6\">So even in a suit by the P. B. Lumber Co. vs. defendant, under contract X., it is by no means clear the contract would not be enforced. But in this case the contract is not pleaded as a contract, but is an exhibit attached to plea to show the circumstances of defendant, which made the payment of $1 long in advance equal to $1.50 paid when service was rendered. The allegation of the plea that the less charge was in consideration of the Perdido Bay Lumber Co. furnishing defendant a great amount of business, if not proved clearly by the contract attached, is an allegation of fact which may, if denied, be proved by any competent testimony. There is certainly nothing in contract X. which proves that the P. B. Lumber Co. has not furnished a great anlount of business. And the contract upon its face shows that only by furnishing a great amount of business to defendant could the P. B. L. Co. expect to be repaid the $10,-000 advanced by it to defendant. Does the exhibit then so contradict the allegation of the plea as to neutralize it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-7\">In view of the charge by plaintiff\u2019s attorney that defendant\u2019s attorney traveled out of the record in stating incidentally the paternity of contract X., and in justice to defendant\u2019s attorney, he invites the court\u2019s attention to the allegation in 5th plea as to this matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-8\">If plaintiff\u2019s counsel did deny in the court below the truth \u2022of the allegation in the plea, defendant\u2019s counsel did not hear the denial, and it certainly does not appear of record.

What he questions .first, as a matter of practice, is the correctness of the ruling \u2022 of the Circuit Court upon the demurrer to defendant\u2019s pleas. The defendant before filing its pleas had demurred to the declaration, and the court had overruled the demurrer. To the ,pleas then filed the plaintiff demurred, and the first question in the case to be;determined is, does this demurrer reach.the declaration, or, the declaration having been sustained by the court in overruling defendant\u2019s demurrer thereto,'does this action of the-.court fix the law of the case, and, xipon demurrer to the plea, prevent this court or the Circuit-Court from going back to the declaration ?</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The plaintiff in error here maintains that it does, and insists that the only question is, admitting the declaration to be .good, is this a good plea.? The only case brought to our attention in this connection is the case of Ellison, Adm\u2019r, vs. Allen, 8 Fla., 209. There this, court held that a defendant in the Circuit Court, and appellant.here, could not avail himself of his demurrer, abandoned in .that eourt, by his .pleading over when it was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">We will state the principles of law .controlling this subject as applicable to that case, as well as to this. Upon the interposition of the demurrer of the defendant to plaintiff\u2019s declaration, going as-it did to the sufficiency in law of the matter stated as a foundation for.the action, the judgment consequent upon the overruling the demurrer was a judgment <em>.quod recuperet. </em>-This was the-strict.common .law rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>(Tidd\u2019s Prac., 657.) This rule has been varied in most of the State courts, as well as in the courts of the United States. The general rule is now that even after the court has announced its judgment to be that the declaration is good in law, the defendant is permitted to withdraw his demurrer, to plead <em>de </em>novo, and thus avoid a final judgment against him. In this State the statute provides (act of Nov. 23, 3828, Thomp. Dig., 331,) that \u201cno demurrer, either at law or in equity, shall be considered as an admission of the facts set forth in the pleadings demurred to, so as to debar the person demurring from any substantial claim or defence which he might have urged if said demurrer had not been filed,\u201d and the constant practice upon the circuit is, upon overruling a demurrer to a declaration, to permit the defendant to plead to the merits. When, howevef, he pleads to the merits he must withdraw his demurrer, and the consequent final judgment <em>quod </em>recuperet, which is the only known form of judgment which can follow overruling a general demurrer to a declaration, is not entered. This is the reason why a defendant, if he pleads over after judgment against him upon his demurrer to the declaration, is held to waive his demurrer. In such cases courts of error, controlled by the common law practice, treat the record as not containing any such judgment or demurrer\u2014treat the case as if no demurrer had been filed. This, in view of our \"statute, is eminently just and proper. The statute takes from the plaintiff, so far as defendant\u2019s pleading is concerned, all advantage of the judgment in his favor upon defendant\u2019s demurrer to his declaration; and as to the defendant, it very properly provides that his case shall stand as \u201c if said demurrer had not been filed.\u201d This is the reason why the appellant in the case referred to by the plaintiff in error here (8 Fla., 209,) was not permitted to assign for error the judgment of the court upon his demurrer. This court in that</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">case says, if he desired to have that ruling reversed he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>have refused to go to the country, and have permitted the judgment on the demurrer to stand. The only authority cited by this court in that case for the view there announced was the case of the United States vs. Boyd, 5 How., 51. There the Supreme Court of the United States says, \u201c The withdrawal of the demurrer and going to issue upon the pleading operated as a waiver of the judgment. If the defendants had intended to have a review of that judgment on a writ of error, they should have refused to amend the pleadings and have permitted the judgment on the demurrer to stand.\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States is somewhat more explicit in the language used in the later cases covering this subject. In the United States vs. Vigil, 10 Wall., 423, that court says, \u201c The filing of a plea to the merits after the demurrer was overruled, operated as a waiver of the demurrer. The pleading was thus abandoned and ceased thenceforth to be a part of the record.\u201d In Young vs. Martin, 8 Wall., 357, the same court, in speaking of this subject says, \u201c They thus abandoned their demurrer, and it ceased to be a part of the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">With this explanation and statement of the true grounds of this action of the court and of the Supreme Court of the United States, in cases where the plaintiff in error seeks to question a judgment of the court of original jurisdiction overruling a demurrer after he has plead over, we ask what is the result of its application here ? The rule being that such a demurrer and judgment is, in contemplation of law, no part of the record, or if it is strictly a part of the record it is waived, then the general rule that upon plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the defendant\u2019s pleas, the sufficiency of the declaration is brought in question must operate, for the simple reason that there is nothing to prevent its operation. The record stands as if originally there was nothing but the declaration, the plea and the demurrer thereto. Why should the defendant be held to have waived his demurrer, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>plaintiff be given all advantage, of it in the same manner as if not waived ? How can it be held that a demurrer can. be considered as withdrawn for one party and not for the other ? The law has no such anomalies. If it is withdrawn it is withdrawn for all parties, and that is the end of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">This, our conclusion, reasoning from elementary principles of pleading, is sustained, without exception, by the cases which we have been able to find covering the precise point. In Cumming vs. Gray, 4 Stew. <em>&amp; </em>Port., 397, the Supreme Court of Alabama says, \u201c That where a demurrer to a declaration containing no substantial cause of action has been overruled and the defendant pleads over, a second demurrer may well be extended bach to the declaration.\u201d To the same effect are the cases reported in 13 Ala., 265, and 13 Ala., 490-500, and the like rule is announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in 7 Wall., 93. Our conclusion as to this point is that the demurrer to the plea reached the declaration, notwithstanding a previous demurrer to the declaration overruled, and that upon the argument of the demurrer to the plea, the record was to be treated in just the same manner as it should have been if no demurrer to the declaration was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The next question in order in view of this conclusion is, do the facts set forth in this declaration constitute in law a cause of action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The facts here alleged are that the defendant, a common carrier, compelled the plaintiff to pay to the defendant, between the first day of July, A. D. 1874, and the first day of March, A. D. 1877, fifty cents per thousand feet on 4,400,-000 feet of lumber shipped by plaintiff over said railroad, making an aggregate of $2,200 in excess of what the said defendant charged the Perdido Bay Lumber Company for like transportation over said railroad during the said period, between the first day of July, A. D. 1874,fand^ the first of March, A. D. 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Under the charter of this company it has the general power \u201c to' levy and collect tolls from all persons, property, merchandise, and all other commodities transported \u201d on its road. There is no statute in this State regulating the matter of freights and charges by railroad companies. It is not denied that this company is a common carrier. We must, therefore, look to the common law for the settlement of the question involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u2022The fact here stated is, that defendant compelled plaintiff to pay for lumber shipped over its road fifty cents per one thousand feet more than it charged another party for transporting lumber over its road at the same time, and the plaintiff insists that this difference of fifty cents was an illegal charge, and that he is entitled to judgment for $2,200, having been compelled to pay freight at that rate and in this manner on 4,400,000 feet of lumber.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The question here is, what was and is the extent of the obligation of a common carrier at common law to the public, when viewed in reference to charges for tolls and freights ?</p>\n<p id=\"AV3\">. In Peck vs. North Staffordshire Railroad Company, decided in the House of Lords in 1863, (10 Ho. Lords cases, 511,) Mr. Justice Blackburn says : \u201cA common carrier, is bound to carry for a <em>reasonable </em>remuneration.\u201d In one of the earliest cases upon the subject (Bastard vs. Bastard, 2 Show., 81,) it is said that <em>\u201c </em>where there is no agreement as to price,\u201d (and this is really the best method by which to fix the common law right.,) \u201c the carrier might have a <em>quamtiwm meruit </em>for his hire.\u201d This means simply that he could recover the value of his service. In Harris vs. Packard, 3 Taunt., 264, it is said: \u201c A carrier is bound by law to carry everything which is brought to him for a reasonable sum to be paid to him for the same carriage, and not to extort what he will.\u201d We cannot say that the carrier is bound to carry anything beyond articles of such class as he is under a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>obligation to cany, (3 Story, 34,) but it is unquestionably true that his charge must be \u201c reasonable.\u201d So in Comyn\u2019s Digest we find it announced that in the absence of an agreement for a price certain, the common carrier may have a <em>qucmbwm mermi. </em>1 Com. Dig. C., citing 1 Sid., 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In the case of the Citizens\u2019 Bank vs. The Kan tucket Steamboat Company, 2 Story, 35, Mr. Justice Story, speaking of the hire or recompense of common carriers, remarks that \u201cit may be in the nature of a <em>quantum </em>meruit.\u201d The same view is announced in 5 Wend., 340, and in 5 Wend., 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Says Parke B., in Pickford vs. The Grand Junction Railroad Company, 8 M. &amp; W., 378 : \u201c The carrier is bound to receive the goods on the money being paid or tendered, and the bailor to pay the reasonable amount demanded.\u201d In 2 Steph. N. P., 978, it is said \u201c common carriers are bound to receive and carry the goods of the subject, for a reasonable reward.\u201d In 1 Duval, 146, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky says: \u201c A common carrier cannot, like a merchant or mechanic, consult his pleasure or caprice as to. the conduct of his business. The law makes it his duty, when he can conveniently do so, to receive and .carry goods, for any person whatsoever for a reasonable hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Under the English decisions a warehouseman, having by virtue of an act of Parliament a monopoly of his business, is, as to rates of compensation which he can demand, placed upon the same footing as a common carrier. He is bound by law to receive goods into his warehouse for <em>a reasonable price and reward. </em>The principles which underlie this rule,' as announced by Lord Hale, are stated by the English courts as the basis of their conclusions as to this matter. So in a case in the Supreme Court of the United States, (4 Otto, 134,) where it proposed to state the common law on the subject, the views of Lord Hale, and these decisions of the courts of England, are cited as giving the true rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In Allnut and another vs. Inglis, Treasurer of the Lon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>don Dock Company, (12 East, 527,) Lord Ellenborougli says that according to Lord Hale, \u201c wherever the accident of time casts upon a party the benefit of having a legal, monopoly of landing goods in a public port, as where he is the owner of the only wharf authorized to receive goods, which happens to be built in a port newly erected, he is confined to take reasonable compensation only for the use of the wharf. Lord Hale puts the case either way ; where the King or a subject have a public wharf to which all persons must come who come to that port to unlade their goods, either because they are the wharves <em>only licensed </em>by the Queen, or because there is <em>no other whmf </em>in that port, <em>as it may fall </em>out; in that case (he says) there cannot be taken arbitrary and excessive duties for cranage, wharfage, &amp;c., neither can they be enhanced to an immoderate rate, but the duties must be reasonable and moderate, though settled by the King\u2019s license or charter.\u201d And then he assigns this reason, \u201c for now the wharf and crane and other conveniences are affected with a public interest and they cease to be <em>juris privati </em>only.\u201d Lord Ellenborough then says: <em>\u201c </em>Here the company\u2019s warehouses were invested with the monopoly of a public privilege, and, therefore, they must by law confine themselves to take reasonable rates for the use of them for that purpose.\u201d Le Blanc, J., in the same case, after stating that the act of Parliament confines the privilege to the company\u2019s warehouse, enquires: <em>\u201c </em>Is it not the privilege of the public, and shall not that which is for the good of the public attach on the monopoly, that they shall not be bound to pay an arbitrary but only a reasonable rent ?\u201d and then answers his own enquiry by declaring that \u201c in case of dedication to such a purpose as this \u201d (that is, where private property is affected with such a public interest,) \u201c the owners cannot take arbitrary and excessive duties, but the duties must be reasonable. That principle was followed up in the case of Bolt vs. Stennett, (8 Term Reports, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>606,) for there the quay being one of the public quays licensed under the statute of Elizabeth, it was held that the owner was bound to permit the use of the crane upon it and could not insist either that the public should not use the crane at all, or should use it only upon his own terms, but that he was bound to permit the use of it upon reasonable terms.\u201d In the same case like views were expressed by Bayley, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">It cannot be questioned that the reason why a common carrier is restricted to. reasonable rates is the same that causes the limitation at. common law upon the rates to be charged by a wharfinger licensed under- a statute. (Munn vs. Illinois, 4 Otto, 129-30.) In reference to a railroad company it may be truly said that it exercises a <em>quasi </em>public employment. While railroads are managed for private benefit and the profits resulting from their operation go to individuals, yet they are treated as merely a public convenience and agency in the matter of State and inter-State commercial intercourse. It is the public character attached to them which, under certain circumstances, authorizes taxation for their construction, as a tax for a private purpose is unconstitutional; and it is the like public nature of their functions which enables them to become the objects of a legislative grant to take the property of an individual for their use, paying a reasonable compensation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We have exhausted the material at our hands in the endeavor to ascertain the result of the English cases upon this question.. We can find in England or the United States no ease involving the precise point here involved, which is, whether, at common law, the defendant, a common carrier, is responsible to the plaintiff for the excess charged him upon the like material and during the same time over a charge for like freights for like material during the same time made of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In the case of the Fitchburg Railroad Company vs. Gage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>and others, (12 Gray, 393,) the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held \u201c that a railroad corporation is not obliged as a common carrier to transport goods and merchandise for all persons at the same rates.\u201d In speaking of the common law rule, that court says : \u201c It requires equal justice to all. But the equality which is to be observed in relation to the public and to every individual <em>consists in the restricted, right to cha/rge in each particular case of service a reasonable compensation and no more. </em>If the carrier confines himself to-this, no wrong can be done and no cause afforded for complaint.\u201d The claim made in this case arose out of a difference between the freights upon plaintiff\u2019s ice and the price-charged others upon the same <em>class </em>of freights. It was not upon the same material, but the court treated the case as involving the same principle. It based its conclusion upon the ground that tbe plaintiff did not set out a case of <em>excessive or unreasonable charge. </em>In the last edition of Story on Bailments, we find the rule of the common law thus stated : \u201cAt common law a common carrier of goods is not under any obligation to treat all customers equally. lie is bound to accept and carry for all upon being paid a reasonable compensation. But the fact that he charges less for one than for another is -only evidence to show that a particular charge is unreasonable; nothing more. There'is nothing in the common law to hinder a carrier from carrying for favored individuals at an unreasonably -low rate or even gratis.\u201d In support of this doctrine the following cases are cited: 12 Gray, 393 ; 2 P. C., 237; 4 C. B., (N. S.) 78; 12 C. B., (N. S.) 74. While the text is the reasonable deduction from remarks in these cases, still, with the exception of the case reported in 12 Gray, they were (so far as we have been able to examine them) cases arising under statutes. Most of the cases treat of the common law rule strictly as between the parties, and without comparison as to the charges against others, the cases where legislative action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>being construed and is controlling, being omitted as not being in point. The cases stating the common law rule are simply that the charge must be reasonable. Thus far there cannot be any reasonable difference between fair minds. In the next place, the right to h'avfe the service of the common carrier at a reasonable rate is common.. Upon a tender of a reasonable compensation, unless there is a reasonable ground for his refusal, in case of refusal he will be liable to an action. Under such circumstances he must receive and carry all goods offered for transportation (which it is his duty to transport,) by <em>any persons </em>whatever, upon receiving a suitable hire. .Looking to the pases,'and rejecting as we always must <em>theories of judges </em>based upon ill defined definitions and outside of the facts before them, the term \u201c common \u201d in this connection is used as contra-distinguished to private or exclusive. It means a public carrier as distinct from a private carrier\u2014a carrier, simply <em>pro hac vice. </em>As to whether a carrier is public or private is the method by which you measure his responsibility. In case of loss or damage to goods by a carrier, the grounds of the difference of the responsibility depend upon whether he is a public or a private carrier. The cases in England and the United States show that the term common .as applied to carriers means simply <em>public- </em>as distinct from <em>primate. </em>The term common does not measure the extent of the right of each or its nature. It simply means that whatever is the right of one is the right of all, without proposing to define what is the right of any, except that the term common as applied to carrier involves the duty and Obligation to undertake the service, while the term private as applied to carrier involves discretion' in the matter. (2 Stephens N. P., 962.) Common carriers are \u201c carriers for hire indifferently for all persons.\u201d \u2019 \u25a0 \u201c Those who are engaged in the business of carrying for all\u2019 who apply, indiscriminately, upon a particular route, by whatever mode of transportation they conduct their busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ness, must be regarded as common carriers; while those who undertake to carry in a single instance, for a particular person, not being engaged in the business as a general employment, even for a portion of the time, must be considered private carriers.\u201d (4 Harr., 448; 1 Pick., 50; 2 Red. on Rail., 5 Ed., p. 5, and cases.cited.) Says Chancellor Kent, \u201ccommon carriers undertake generally, and not as a casual occupation, and for all people indifferently, to convey goods and deliver them at a place appointed, for hire as a business, and with or without a special agreement as to price.\u201d (1 Salk., 249 ; 8 Carr, and P., 207; 3 Barb., 388; 2 Kelly, 353.) Says Nisbet, J., (in the case last cited,) when treating of the distinctions between a common and private carrier: \u25a0 \u201cIf he refuse to carry he is liable to be sued and to respond in damages to the person aggrieved, and this is perhaps the safest test of his character.\u201d Says Mr. Justice Story, (Story on Bailments, 495,) after speaking of his general obligations, \u201c a common carrier has therefore been defined to be one who undertakes for hire or reward to transport the goods of such as choose to employ him, from place to place.\u201d (1 Wend., 272; 2 Story, 17; 25 Penn. St., 120.) In the last case the terms common and public are used as synonymous words. It is useless to multiply quotations to determine the signification of the term common in this connection. It is used not to define, to limit, or explain the degree or amount of compensation which can be demanded tor the service to be performed. . Indeed, as to the amount of compensation which can be d\u00e9manded, the rule as to public and private carriers is the same. It is a <em>quantum rnermt. </em>True, the responsibility, the risk of the public carrier is greater, and that fact may possibly enter into the estimate of the value of the service. That, however, would simply increase the damages, on account of the different degrees of responsibility attending the several bailments. It would not vary the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Our conclusions are that, as against a common or public carrier, every person has the same right; that in all cases, where his common duty controls, he cannot refuse A. and .accommodate B.; that all, the entire public, have the right to the same <em>carriage for a reasonable price, and at a reasonable charge for the service performed ; </em>that the commonness of the duty to <em>ca/rry for all, </em>does not involye a commonness or equality of compensation or charge; that all the shipper ean ask of a common carrier is, <em>that for the service performed he shall charge no more thorn a reasonable sum to him; </em>that whether the carrier charges another more or less than the price charged a particular individual, may be a matter of evidence in determining whether a charge is too much or too little for the service performed, and that the difference between the charges cannot be the measure of damages in any case, unless it is established by proof that the smaller \u25a0charge is the true reasonable charge in view of the transportation furnished, and that the higher charge is excessive to that degree. The obligations in this matter must be reciprocal. Where there is no expr\u00e9ss contract, the common, law action by the carrier against the shipper is for a <em>quantum meruit, </em>and the liability of the shipper is for a reasonable sum in view of .the service performed for him. What is charged another person, (in this case the amount charged the Perdido Bay Lumber Company,) or the usual charge made against many others (the freight tariff) is matter of evidence admissible to ascertain the value of the service performed. In every case the legality of the charge is established and measured <em>by the value of the service performed, </em>and not by what is charged another, unless what is charged the other is the compensating sum, in which event it is the proper sum, not on account of its <em>equality, </em>but because of the relation it bears <em>to the value of the service performed </em>as an adequate compensation therefor. To sum the whole matter .up, the common law is that a common carrier shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>charge excessive freights. It protects the individual from, extortion, and limits the carrier to a reasonable rate, and this on account of the fact that he exercises a public employment, enjoys exclusive franchises and privileges, derived, in the ease of defendant here, by grant from the State. The rule is not that all shall be charged equally, but reasonably, because the law is for the reasonable charge and not the; equal charge. A statement of inequality does not make a. legal cause of action, because it is not necessarily unreasonable. It would be a strange rule indeed which would authorize a shipper, after being compelled to pay his freights according to established rates, (this appears from the pleas and declarations,) to look around and find some smaller charge for the same- service during the same time, which may be either as a gratuity, or a sale of service at a non-compensating rate, or less than the reasonable charge, and claim his damages according to this difference, based upon an inequality not general in its character, but existing only by virtue of a charge made for the same service against one-other person. If this court sanctions the doctrine of absolute equality, and then measures the damages by the difference in the charge as to one person named in a declaration, which does not negative a fair inducement or consideration for the difference, it must sustain such a rule as that stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The declaration, to be good in law, must state a case of excessive charge for the service performed. When it simply states a case of inequality of charge, it states no cause of' action, for the smaller charge may be less than reasonable,, and the greater charge may be exactly the value of the service and the reasonable charge for the- transportation furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Whether a charge made by A. against B. is reasonable- \u25a0 cannot be determined by establishing the charge against C. for the same service. It is too plain for argument that the higher charge, where there is a difference, may be what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the compensating sum, and the lower charge may be too .small for the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In a case of this importance we do not deem it improper to review the cases brought to our attention by the plaintiff in error here. Our attention has been called to the following cases, decided by the Supreme Court of Illinois: The Chicago and Alton Railroad Company vs. The People, 67 Ill., 11 ; Vincent vs. Chicago and Alton Railroad Company, 49 Ill., 33, and Chicago, B. <em>&amp; </em>Q. R. R. Co. vs. Park, 18 Ill., 460. The first case was an information in the nature of a <em>quo wa/rramto </em>based upon the provisions of \u201can act to prevent unjust discrimination and extortion' in the rates to be charged by the different railroads for the transportation of freight on said roads.\u201d The question was whether a charge of $5.65 per thousand feet of lumber a distance of 110 miles, while at the same time the company charged $5 per thousand feet of lumber for a distance of '126 miles, did not subject the company to the penalties prescribed by the act. In answer to the information, the company alleged that the higher charge for the shorter distance-was a reasonable charge, and that the smaller charge was unreasonably low. Upon demurrer to this answer or plea, the court held that notwithstanding the charter of the corporation was a contract giving general power to prescribe tolls, the Legislature had power to prohibit unjust discriminations ; that it did not have the power under the. Constitution to prohibit any discrimination, and that \u201c the naked fact that a railway company charged a larger sum for transporting freight of the \u25a0same class over a given distance than it is charging for the same distance over another part of its road, or in the opposite direction, is not of .itself conclusive evidence of an unjust discrimination,\u201d and \u201c'that a difference of price for the same distance of transportation is not necessarily an unjust discrimination.\u201d In the case reported in 49 Ill., the court decided that railroad companies were not at liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>to discriminate at their discretion in their charges for delivery at different warehouses. The case reported in 18 Ill., 466, was a claim by a passenger for damages for an alleged illegal expulsion at a place not a station. In the later cases in Illinois we find the question of discrimination discussed. In 76 Ill., 67, the court sustained a contract allowing a rebate of 5-J- cents less than the uniform tariff per bushel for corn. In 79 Ill., 121, the question of the power of a railroad company, <em>anterior to this </em>legislation, to make a contract with a party \u201c for transportation of freight at a less rate than the general public was required to pay,\u201d was sustained. The agreement was to transport coal for $3 per car load, the-freighter furnishing the cars, while the regular tariff was $9.. We do not think the question of equality was involved in any of the Illinois decisions brought to our attention by counsel. The later cases sustaining a difference (76 and 79 Ill.) in the amounts paid for freight, we think are entitled toraore consideration. The case reported in 76 111. was upon a contract made before any of the legislation against unjust discrimination. The rule for its determination was the common law. It is, therefore, more like this case, and what is there said is entitled to more weight. We consider other cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The case reported in 57 Maine, 188, was where a railroad company refused to carry the plaintiff\u2019s express freight. The case reported in 52 N. H., 430, was upon a statute requiring that \u201c all persons shall have reasonable and equal terms, facilities and accommodations for the transportation of themselves, their agents and servants, and of any merchandise,\u201d &amp;c. In speaking of the rule of the common law upon the subject as stated by the English courts, the Supreme Court of Hew Hampshire in this ease says : <em>\u201c </em>We-have not overlooked the fact that in England it seems to be supposed that at common law common carriers are not bound to carjy all and for all on reasonably equal terms,\u20197 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and that \u201c the fact seetns now to be overlooked \u201d (by the English courts) <em>\u201c </em>that the general principle of equality is the principle of the common law.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>A mistake of this kind is an evil of some magnitude.\u201d This case is under a statute. Not only is this true, but we cannot accept the reasoning of this court, based upon- no authority, founded in decisions involving the points discussed, as against what it admits is the rule as announced by the English courts. The English courts announce the rule as it is fixed by the common law cases cited in the beginning of this opinion. The New Hampsaire court fails to pay any attention to these sources of information, and calls the conclusions therefrom a mistake. <em>We </em>think the dictum of the New Hampshire court wrong, and the doctrine of the English courts right.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The case in 68 Penn. St., 370, did not involve the question of equality of charges for transportation. It involved a right of wharfage. The court--held that the nature of wharfage required exclusive possession. The case reported in 24 Penn. St., 378, was under the statute incorporating the company, and the court held that under this statute a contract giving to one express company an exclusive right of transportation in the passenger trains was illegal and void. The case cited from 24 La. An., 1, is against the plaintiff. It approves the decision in 12 Gray, 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In the case of Messenger, et al. vs. Penn. R. R. Co., 7 Vroom (N. J. L.) 407, it was held -that an agreement by a railroad company to carry goods for certain persons at a cheaper rate than they will carry under the same conditions for others is void, as creating an illegal preference. The declaration in the case before us does not make a case of charge for carriage greater against the plaintiff, <em>under the same conditions, </em>than a smaller charge was made of the Perdido Bay Lumber Company. It simply sets up that 50 cents per thousand feet of lumber was charged plaintiff beyond what was charged the Perdido Bay Lumber Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for transportation for lumber at the same time. Hor is there any sanction in this case in Hew Jersey for the idea that the damages are to be measured alone by the extent of the inequality in the charge. Indeed, in this very case the court say that \u201c the duty of the common carrier was to receive and carry all goods offered for transportation, upon receiving a reasonable hire.\u201d This case in Hew Jersey is to the effect that it is not <em>\u201c </em>admissible for a common carrier to demand a different hire from various persons for an identical kind of service, under identical conditions.\u201d The declaration in the case before us does not make this case. It makes a case of difference in charge upon the same kind of freight (lumber) during the same time. The amount of freight to be furnished by the parties may have been different, and there pay be other circumstances so unlike in character <em>(in re </em>Baxendale vs. The G. W. R. R. Co., 94 E. C. L., 308,) as to control. Independent of these questions, however, the common law rule as we understand it, and we ascertain it by looking to the elementary principles as announced by the English and American courts, and not from any process of reasoning as to what the rule, in our judgment, ought to be, does not require an equality of charge, but only a reasonable charge in view of the service which the party gets and the carrier renders. Erom the very earliest English cases the measure of the right of the carrier was a <em>quantum meruit. </em>The carrier <em>must receive this if </em>tendered, <em>and must </em>(with certain defined exceptions) <em>perform the </em>service, and the shipper must pay the value of what he gets. Whether as an internal State regulation of commerce equality should be required by the Legislature, is a matter of legislative discretion ; at least this court can only enforce the rule of the common law as it finds it, and not as it ought to be. Even as to the power of the Legislature in the. premises, however, we say nothing in this case, as it is not \u25a0involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Our conclusion is that the declaration does not contain a legal cause of action, and that the demurrer to the pleas of the defendant reached the declaration, notwithstanding a previous demurrer to the declaration by the defendant had been overruled. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
