Service of Notice of Appeal.\u2014The notice of appeal required by section 537 of Hill\u2019s Code should be served on the attorney of the respondent, if such attorney reside in the county where the case is pending: Code, 2 531.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b618-12\">2. Service op Notice op Appeal by Attorney.\u2014The notice of appeal required by section 537 of Hill\u2019s Code may be served by the appellant\u2019s attorney under the terms of Hill\u2019s Code, 2 527.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-15\">Appeal from Marion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-16\">In perfecting the appeal herein the notice of appeal was served by the attorney for appellant by leaving a copy at the office of respondent\u2019s attorney in Marion County as provided by subdivision 1 of section 527, Hill\u2019s Code. Respondent now moves to dismiss the appeal because the notice of appeal was not served on the respondents personally, and because said notice was not served by a sheriff, by a deputy sheriff, or by a person specially appointed by the sheriff, or by a person specially appointed by the judge of the court where the action was pending: Code, \u00a7 54.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-17\"><em>Wm. M. Kaiser, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-18\">This court has practically decided this motion in the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>14 Or. 470. But the statute, section 527, provides that the \u201cproof of service shall be the same as proof of service of a summons,\u201d and the only persons who can serve a summons are those designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>in section 54. An attorney is not one of the persons so designated, and it seems to necessarily follow that the notice in this case has never been legally served.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>jRobert Q. Morrow, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-6\">1. The question here raised has been entirely settled by the case of <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>20 Or. 129, to the effect that the notice of appeal may be served on either the respondent or his attorney, when either resides in the county where the action is pending. It is true that section 537 provides that the notice shall \u201cbe served on the adverse party,\u201d but this must be considered in connection with section 531, which requires all papers to be served on the attorney of record in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-7\">2. To the second ground of the motion it may be answered that the classes who may serve a notice of appeal are designated in section 527, viz., \u201cby any person other than the party himself.\u201d Whoever serves the notice must make proof of his act in one of the two ways laid down in section 61, but the persons who may make the proof are designated by section 527, and not, as respondent contends, by section 54. The service was made by some person other than a party, (viz., his attorney,) and the proof was properly made by affidavit, as required by section 61.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b619-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The service of the notice of appeal having been made on respondent\u2019s attorneys residing in the county where the cause was pending, is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">We are further of opinion that a notice of appeal may be served by appellant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
