The unnecessary matter can and should be treated as surplusage. Goodwin v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 600, 158 S. W. Rep., 274, in which a large number of cases are collated and cited. The words in brackets above are surplusage; but if not they in no way invalidate the complaint and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">Appellant has no bill of exceptions in the record. He attempts to raise some question as to the introduction of some testimony by his motion for new trial, which we can not review in the absence of a bill of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">By other grounds of a motion for new trial he attacks the judgment of the court because he claims the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. While the evidence was conflicting to some extent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>testimony as a whole clearly was sufficient to establish both charges in. the complaint and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
