No exceptions were reserved to the introduction of testimony, therefore, the only ground in the motion we can take into consideration is the one complaining of the sufficiency of the testimony. The witness Linnie Gibbs testified: \u201cYes, I bought a pint of whisky from Mr. Boyd,\u201d and while his further examination might tend to weaken this statement, yet that was a question for the jury and not for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">January 14, 1914.</p>\n<author id=\"b477-6\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">Appellant has filed a motion for a rehearing in this case, and undertakes to impeach the record, in that he attaches to his motion the affidavit of Lennie Gibbs, stating that he did not swear on the trial that he purchased a bottle of whisky from appellant. The statement of facts recites that Lennie Gibbs testified as follows: \u201cYes, I bought a pint of whisky from Mr. Boyd (appellant).\u201d This statement of facts is agreed to by the county attorney and appellant\u2019s counsel,' and approved by the county judge. This record can not be impeached by ex parte affidavits. If it is not a true recitation of the testimony heard on the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel should not have agreed to and signed it. If we permitted the record to be impeached by ex parte affidavits, there would be no end to the trial of a case. We must take the record as made on the trial of the case and certified to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
