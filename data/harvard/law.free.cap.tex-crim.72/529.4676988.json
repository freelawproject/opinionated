He sued out a writ of habeas corpus before Hon. R. H. Buck, judge of the District Court of the Forty-eighth Judicial District. Upon a hearing he was remanded, and gave notice of appeal to this court. The record discloses that he is not in custody, and has not been, since he gave notice of appeal to this court. It has been so often de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tided that this court will not entertain an appeal in habeas corpus cases unless the relator is in custody of the officers, it seems unnecessary to cite authorities, but see Ex parte Parvin, 63 Texas Crim.
