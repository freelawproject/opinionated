B. Sisk and John Price. As no bills of exception were reserved to the introduction of the testimony of these witnesses, the record does not disclose that this testimony was objected to at the time of its introduction, nor during the trial of the case, and after verdict it is too late to object to the introduction of testimony admitted on the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The third ground of the motion for a new trial reads as follows: \u201cThe court erred in giving special charges 1, 2, 3, 4 as requested by the defendant.\u201d Of course, the court would not err in giving a special charge requested by the person on trial, for if error there be in giving such charge, it would be error invited by defendant in requesting such instruction. However, while the motion for a new trial reads as indicated above, yet the record discloses that such special charges were not in fact given, but were marked \u201crefused\u201d by the court, and the question arises, is the objection too general to be considered. In this ground of the motion there can be no doubt that the exception is too general to be considered. However, the next ground in the motion complains that the court erred in failing to \u201ccharge the jury that if they believed that septic poison was introduced into the wound by the cloth sweater or towel placed there by the witness Brice after the cutting that they should acquit the defendant of the charge of murder or manslaughter.\u201d The court did in fact so charge the jury in paragraphs fourteen and fifteen of the charge. These are all the grounds alleged in the motion for a new trial, which was overruled b'y the court. After the motion for a new trial had been overruled by the court what is termed \u201can amended motion for a new trial\u201d was filed without leave of the court to do so being obtained, and which was never acted on by the trial court. Under such circumstances the amended motion for a new trial can not be considered by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<disposition id=\"b464-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"Atd\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">January 14, 1914.</p>\n<author id=\"b464-10\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQK\">Appellant files a motion for a rehearing in which he has the clerk to certify the \u201cmotion docket\u201d shows that leave was granted to file an amended motion for a new trial, and that same was overruled by the court\u2014the certificate reading: \u201cI, Max Andrews, Clerk of the Criminal District Court of Harris County, Texas, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of the original entry as it appears on the <em>motion docket </em>of the Criminal District Court of Harris County.\u201d This term of court adjourned on the third day of May, 1913, and no order or judgment was entered in the minutes of this court, but since the original opinion was rendered by this court, counsel for appellant has prevailed on the court to attempt to make a nunc pro tunc order, the order reciting that \u201cwhereas the order of the court made on the 26th day of April, 1913, and the minutes of the court fail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>to show that the court overruled said amended motion for a new trial, it is now ordered and adjudged that this order be entered in the minutes of the court nunc pro tune, now for then as it was the original order intended to be entered on the minutes of said court.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b465-9\">[Rehearing denied January 14, 1914.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The question arises, can the court order this judgment entered nunc pro tune, without notice to a person, while the case is pending in this court? In the case of Long v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 321, it was said: \u201cThe notice of appeal was not entered of record, <em>though the cleric certifies that the notes made by the judge upon his docket </em>show that defendant gave notice of appeal. <em>The entries on the judge\u2019s docket will not supply the place of or supersede the necessity for an entry upon the record.\u201d </em>Lawrence v. State, 14 Texas, 432; Hughes v. State, 33 Texas, 683. This has always been the rule in this court, that the entry or order to be of any force and effect must be carried forward into the minutes of the court, and where the entry was not made in the minutes at the term of court, no nunc pro tunc entry or order can be made while the case is pending in this court on appeal. In the case of Estes v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 506, this court, speaking through Judge Davidson, said: \u201cAppellant was convicted at the September term, 1896. He filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and gave notice of appeal. The judgment was not entered at that term, but was entered nunc pro tune at the March term, 1897. Under this state of case the court below had lost authority to enter judgment at the March term, 1897. When the September term, 1896, closed, the notice of appeal having been given, jurisdiction had attached to this court. The judgment was not a lost or destroyed part of the record, and, therefore, could not be entered pending the appeal\u2014the trial court had lost jurisdiction,\u201d citing Lewis v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 126; Quarles v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 362. This has not only been the rule in this court, but the Code of our State so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Thus it is the entry on the motion docket, but not carried into the minutes of the court, and can not be considered by this court, and the trial court had no authority nor power to enter the nunc pro tune order in December when the term of court at which the appellant was tried adjourned in May previous, and notice of appeal given at that term. It is strange to us that attorneys will not give care, consideration and attention to seeing that the judgments and orders are entered in criminal that they do in civil cases, but so long as they are negligent in this-respect we are powerless to aid them until the Legislature changes the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
