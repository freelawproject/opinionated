'We always regret to have records come before us in a way that we can not review the questions sought to be raised on the motion for a new trial, where a person convicted desires to prosecute an appeal; and more especially do we do so in a case where the death penalty has been inflicted. Several grounds of alleged error are assigned in the motion for a new trial, but it is impossible for us to review any of them in the absence of a statement of facts and bills of exception; consequently there is nothing we can do but affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AUD\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
