There is a purported statement of facts, but the judge trying the cause certifies that same was not presented to him until August 30, 1913. This case was tried January 25, 1913, and sentence pronounced on February 24, 1913. The official stenographer\u2019s Act provides that time may be extended in which to file statements of facts and bills of exceptions, and, further, provides that a statement of facts in a felony case may be filed, whether time is granted by the trial judge or not, at any time <em>before the time of filing of the transcript in the appellate court expires. </em>We have frequently had occasion to call attention to the fact that the time for filing transcripts in the appellate court expires in ninety days from the adjournment of the term of court, or if the term extends more than eight weeks, within ninety days from date of sentence. See. 7 of chap. 119, Acts of Thirty-second Legislature; arts. 929, 930, 931, and 934 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of Code of Criminal Procedure; Rule 2 of the Supreme Court, 142 S. W. Rep., and Rule 1, page xvii; Constitution, sec. 25 of art. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">There is another matter disclosed by this record we would call attention to. The motion for a- new trial was filed on January 27th and overruled on February 22, 1913. After said motion for new trial was overruled, appellant, without leave of the court, undertakes to file, two days after the motion for new trial had been overruled, an amended motion for a new trial, which the record does not disclose was ever called to the attention of this court. Under such circumstances this court would not be authorized to consider the amended motion for new trial. If, after the motion for new trial has been overruled by the trial court, an appellant desires to file an amended motion for new trial, he should file a motion asking the trial court to set aside the order overruling the motion for new trial and grant him a new trial, and the record should disclose by an order duly entered that such action was taken, and that the trial court then ruled on the amended motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">There being no statement of facts we can consider, no matter is presented we can review.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">December 10, 1913.</p>\n<author id=\"b224-10\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6C\">The motion for rehearing in this case undertakes to lay the blame for failure to secure a statement of facts on appellant\u2019s counsel. Appellant employed bis own attorney, and if this attorney was negligent this will be attributed to him. The term of court at which appellant was tried lasted more than eight weeks. The appellant was sentenced February 24, 1913. The statement of facts was not presented to the judge until August 30, 1913. It was through no fault of the prosecuting officers, nor the district judge, that this delay occurred: consequently nothing stated in the- affidavit of appellant filed would entitle him to have the statement of facts considered. ' But if we did consider it, the witnesses for the State positively identify appellant as one of those who robbed A. B. Clayton. Mr. Clayton positively swears he is one of the two men. While appellant undertakes to prove an alibi by J. B. Ivie and his daughter, yet everything they say could he true and yet he be the person who robbed Clayton. She says that she left home about 7:15 to go to town, and as she looked back} she saw appellant and Arisman (the man who is said to have aided in the robbery) coming along after her. Clayton says he is not positive about the time he met appellant but it was about 7:15 and that he was robbed at about 7:30. There is no such discrepancy in the time and place of the robbery fixed as to render the testimony irreconcilable, and the court submitted the issue of alibi in the language frequently approved by this court. Hines v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 23; Caldwell v. State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>28 Texas Crim. App., 566; Harris v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 411; Stevens v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The alleged newly discovered evidence is supported by the affidavit of no person and no reason stated why such affidavit is not attached, and this, under such circumstances, presents no error. Love v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 501; Cotton v. State, 4 Texas, 260; Evans v. State, 6 Texas Crim. App., 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">If there was any variance in the \u201cproof and the allegations contained in the indictment,\u201d no exception was reserved to the introduction of the testimony. But no such variance occurs. The indictment alleges that Mr. Clayton was robbed of ten dollars. Proof that he was robbed of more than ten dollars,\u2014fourteen dollars,\u2014would be no variance. Neither was it necessary for the indictment to allege denomination and kind of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">If the jury was composed wholly of \u201ctalesmen\u201d as alleged in the motion for a new trial, in the absence of any exception being reserved to the formation and organization of the jury, such fact would present no ground for reversal of the case. So, if we considered the statement of facts and every ground stated in appellant\u2019s amended motion for a new trial, no error would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Motion for rehearing overruled. <em>Overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
