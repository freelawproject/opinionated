There is in the record what purports to be a statement of facts and bills of exception, approved long afterwards by Judge Crawford, his successor, instead of by him. This ease is in precisely the same condition as the case of Will Porter v. State, from Dallas County, recently decided but not yet reported. Upon motion of the Assistant Attorney-General and on authority of that case and Richardson v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 111, 158 S. W. Rep., 517, and the statute, the said purported statement of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and bills of exception herein are struck out and can not be considered.
