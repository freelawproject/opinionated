M. Blalack, towit: the daughter of Sarah Walser, being then and there the sister of him, the said D. M. Blalack, in this, that D. M. Blalack and Sarah Walser were the Children of the same father and mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Among other things, appellant requested the following instruction: \u201cYou are instructed to return a verdict of not guilty, if you find from the evidence that the State has failed to prove that one Sarah Walser, was the sister of the defendant and mother of said Rusha Walser, and that the State has failed to prove that said Sarah. Walser and defendant, D. M. Blalack, were the children of the same parents.\u201d In refusing to give this charge the court makes this explanation: \u201cThe prosecutrix and her brother both testified she was the niece of defendant, and while it was not specifically proved that prosecutrix was the daughter of Sarah, yet there was no question raised as to this issue only in the above special charge presented after the evidence closed. C. F. Spencer, etc.\u201d In order to obtain a conviction under this indictment it was necessary to prove the relations of the parties as set out in the indictment. It is unnecessary to discuss the question whether the descriptive averments were unnecessary or not. It was charged in the indictment that appellant and Sarah. Walser were the children of the same parents, and that Sarah Walser was the mother of the prosecutrix with whom appellant is alleged to have had incestuous intercourse. The State was necessarily compelled to meet the allegations in the indictment. It was incumbent upon the State to prove that the mother of prosecutrix was named Sarah Walser; and \"that Sarah Walser was the sister of the defendant, and, that they were brother and sister of the same father and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>mother. This was not done. That prosecutrix was a niece of appellant does not prove she was the daughter of Sarah Walser. The court should have given the charge as requested. Not only so, but we are of opinion under the judge\u2019s explanation, not only ought he to have given the charge, but if the State does not meet these allegations by evidence the conviction could not be sustained under this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">There is another trouble in the case not specifically pointed out, but we call attention to it in view of another trial. The court charging the jury uses this language: \u201cYou are instructed that you can not find the defendant guilty upon the testimony of said Kusha W\u00e1lser, unless you first believe her testimony is true, and that it shows or tends to show 'that the defendant is guilty as charged in the indictment, and unless you further believe,\u201d etc. This charge has been condemned in quite a number of cases. The evidence of the prosecutrix should not only be found to be true by the jury, but that it shows the guilt of the .defendant. It is not sufficient if it merely tends to do so as the charge asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
