This indictment was drawn under article 548 of the Revised Penal Code. The evidence fails to show the house where the game was played was a private residence ; it further fails to show it was commonly resorted to for the purpose of gaming. It is necessary to prove these matters in order to constitute a violation of the law under this prosecution. The facts show, if there was any betting done, which is a controverted issue so far as appellant is concerned, it was a banking game exhibited and not a game of cards, as charged in the indictment. This would be a variance under the authorities. See Chancellor v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 464; Vinson v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 47; Arridondo v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 145; Averhart v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 651; Saw v. State, 33 S. W. Rep., 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
