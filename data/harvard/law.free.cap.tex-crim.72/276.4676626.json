Appellant denies taking this ring, and testifies to facts which would perhaps justify him in making the assault. The court in his charge instructed the jury that if appellant did not take the ring they would acquit appellant. Under the evidence in this ease, when the court instructed the jury that if appellant did not take the ring from off the person of Mr. Jones to acquit him, it was a charge presenting the case as made by the testimony in behalf of appellant in as favorable light as he had a right to expect. If he took the ring under the circumstances detailed by Mr. Jones and the witnesses for the State, it was robbery, and when the court instructed the jury that if he did not take the ring, as he and his witnesses testify, to acquit, it was all he had a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ask. While, perhaps, it is true that, under' the evidence, if he did not take the ring, he might have been convicted of an assault, yet when the court made the criterion of his conviction, the fact of whether or not he took the ring as testified to b'y the State\u2019s witnesses, this would not be error of which he would be heard to complain. In plain terms the jury was instructed if he did not take the ring from the person of Mr. Jones with the intent and purpose to appropriate it to his own use to acquit him, or if they had a reasonable doubt of such being the case to acquit. The case was presented in a way appellant will not be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
