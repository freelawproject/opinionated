If records were promptly sent to this court, as required by the law, this would not occur. In this case the law required this record to have been filed in this court not later than April 25th, but it was not done until some five months later than that time. Such neglect is inexcusable and works a hardship both on the prisoner and the county. We keep calling attention to these matters in the hope that we may get the officers to comply with their plain duty under our Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
