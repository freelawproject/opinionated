In 2012, Burnett filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2) based on Amendments 748 and 750 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG). The district court denied this motion, finding that Burnett was not eligible for a reduction in his sentence because he was originally sentenced as a career offender pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Burnett now appeals, and the government has moved to summarily affirm the district court ruling and to stay the briefing schedule in the meantime. After careful review, we grant the government\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. As a result, the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Summary disposition is appropriate either where time is of the essence, such as \u201csituations where important public policy issues are involved or those where rights delayed are rights denied,\u201d or where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">Summary disposition for the government is appropriate here because our binding precedent clearly prevents Burnett from receiving the sentencing relief he is seeking. In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.Bd 1323 (11th Cir.2008), this Court held that prisoners who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 are not authorized to be resentenced pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the \u201cretroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Burnett responds that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), calls into question this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Moore. </em>He acknowledges, however, that this Court considered and rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2012). <em>See id. </em>at 1321 <em>(\u2018Moore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled.\u201d). Thus, Burnett is not entitled to relief here because he was originally sentenced as a career offender, and his guidelines range was not changed by Amendments 748 and 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">To the extent that Burnett argues that he is entitled to be resentenced because of the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s reduction of certain statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>argument is also foreclosed by this Court\u2019s binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>Berry, </em>this Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Additionally, this Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to the Act\u2019s enactment on August 3, 2010. <em>Id. </em>Burnett, who was sentenced in 2003, therefore cannot benefit from the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s reductions in statutory mandatory minimums.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Because this Court\u2019s binding precedent forecloses the review Burnett seeks, the government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-11\">. In <em>Bonner v. Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered before October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1207.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
