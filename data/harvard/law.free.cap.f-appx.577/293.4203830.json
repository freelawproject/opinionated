McMillian was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. As a condition of his supervised release, McMil-lian was ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>to pay $18,000 in restitution to Jerry McKay, the owner of the property at issue. McMillian contends: there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a violation of \u00a7 2314; and the district court erred in ordering restitution as a condition of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">The sufficiency challenge was preserved in district court. Therefore, in determining whether the evidence was sufficient, the relevant question is \u201cwhether the evidence, when reviewed in the light most favorable to the [Government with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of a conviction, allows a rational fact finder to find every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. <em>United States v. Cannon, </em>750 F.3d 492, 506 (5th Cir.2014) (citations omitted). This standard \u201cleaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial, requiring only that jurors draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d. <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2060, 2064, 182 L.Ed.2d 978 (2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e accept all credibility choices and reasonable inferences made by the trier of fact which tend to support the verdict\u201d and \u201cwill not second guess the jury in its choice of which witnesses to believe\u201d. <em>United States v. Jefferson, </em>751 F.3d 314, 320-21 (5th Cir.2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-25\">A conviction for interstate transportation of stolen property requires proof of \u201c(1) the interstate transportation of (2) goods, merchandise, wares, money, or se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>curities valued at $5,000 or more ... (3) with knowledge that such items have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud\u201d. <em>United States v. Onyiego, </em>286 F.3d 249, 253 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. As noted by both parties, the only element at issue is whether McMillian took the property (an indirect heater) by fraud. The jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that McMillian entered into the lease-purchase agreement with McKay in order to induce McKay to release possession of the indirect heater to him. McMillian\u2019s failure to make a single payment and his lack of a response to McKay\u2019s numerous attempts to discuss and settle the matter support the inference that McMillian possessed the intent to defraud. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Saks, </em>964 F.2d 1514, 1518-19 (5th Cir.1992) (discussing intent in bank fraud context). Accordingly, the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, contains sufficient evidence to support McMillian\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Regarding McMillian\u2019s having to pay restitution to McKay as a condition of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (inclusion of supervised release term after imprisonment), \u201c[a] federal court cannot order restitution except when authorized by statute\u201d. <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>677 F.3d 730, 732 (5th Cir.2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because McKay ultimately sold the indirect heater for a profit, there was no \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of the Victim and Witness Protection Act or the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. Therefore, as the Government concedes, the court could not order restitution to McKay as a condition of McMillian\u2019s supervised release pursuant to \u00a7 3583(d). <em>See United States v. Maturin, </em>488 F.3d 657, 660-61 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2007). As the Government states, \u201cthe district court\u2019s reliance upon the supervised release statute as authority for the imposition of a restitution order ... was misplaced\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING REGARDING SUPERVISED RELEASE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
