In his \u00a7 2241 petition, he contended that he was actually innocent of his sentence because the Government failed to allege and prove the drug quantity that subjected him to a higher statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Because Moore sought to attack the manner in which his sentence was determined, he had to meet the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 451-52; <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Moore does not address or challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his claims were not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition and offers no argument that his claims fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001) (setting forth requirements to meet savings clause). Accordingly, he has failed to demonstrate any error and, in effect, has abandoned any challenge to the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See McGowen v. Thaler, </em>675 F.3d 482, 497 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
