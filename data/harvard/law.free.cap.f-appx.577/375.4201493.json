Marquez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He maintains that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because the Guideline under which he was sentenced, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed. He asserts that his guidelines range was greater than necessary because \u00a7 2L1.2 double counted his prior convictions and because his offense was a mere trespass. He contends that the sentence failed to account for his personal history and characteristics because it did not reflect his strong ties to the United States and the threats to him in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">In the district court, Marquez did not object to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. Marquez argues that such an objection is not required to preserve the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for review, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent and raises the issue to preserve it for further review. As Marquez did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>object in the district court, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, Marquez must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Marquez makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but should do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). As Marquez concedes, his argument that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The district court considered Marquez\u2019s request for lenience, and it determined that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. The international trespass and the double counting of prior convictions arguments that Marquez raises have both been previously raised in this court without success. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. As Marquez was sentenced within the guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, and Marquez has not shown sufficient reason for us to disturb that presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Considering the totality of the circumstances, as we must, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), Marquez has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable, much less plainly erroneous. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359-60, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
