He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his 2005 Virginia conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine was a felony drug trafficking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), as well as this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268 (5th Cir.2005), Cortes-Tolentino argues that the Virginia statute under which he was convicted, Va. Code ANN. \u00a7 18.2-248, is broader than the drug trafficking offense definition set forth in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because under Virginia law, \u201cdistribution\u201d of a controlled substance includes giving it away for no consideration. Because the state court documents did not narrow his conviction to a qualifying drug trafficking offense, he argues that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement was a clear and obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">As Cortes-Tolentino concedes, this court\u2019s review is for plain error because he did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) enhancement in the district court. <em>See United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Cortes-Tolentino must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Cortes-Tolentino acknowledges that in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 523-24 (5th Cir.2008), this court held that distribution of cocaine under \u00a7 18.2-248 is a drug trafficking offense under the Sentencing Guidelines. However, he contends that <em>Rodriguez </em>does not foreclose the issue he raises on appeal because this court did not address in <em>Rodriguez </em>the argument that \u201cdistribution\u201d under the Virginia statute can encompass giving away a controlled substance and that giving away a controlled substance falls outside of the definition of a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">After this court\u2019s decision in <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>the United States Sentencing Commission amended \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a drug trafficking offense to include offers to sell a controlled substance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1(B)(iv)); <em>United States v. Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d 210, 211-12 (5th Cir.2011). This court has not conclusively answered the question whether a conviction for giving away or offering to give away a controlled substance constitutes a drug trafficking offense under the post-2008 version of \u00a7 2L1.2. Further, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mon-crieffe </em>addressed whether an alien\u2019s Georgia conviction for possession with intent to distribute 1.3 grams of marijuana qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), <em>Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1683-84, and this court has yet to address <em>Moncrieffe\u2019s </em>effect, if any, on whether a conviction for sharing a small amount of a controlled substance for no remuneration qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because the issue is subject to reasonable debate and the error is not readily apparent, the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) enhancement, if erroneous, did not rise to the level of a clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Cortes-Tolentino cannot show plain error, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
