By so moving, Rich challenges the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal point arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">In his motion, Rich argues that the \u00a7 2241 petition should not have been filed by the clerk, and that he was \u201cinveigled to furnish documents which were apparently employed to transform [his request for leave to proceed under \u00a7 2241] into some procedure which was in contravention to the [sanction] warning.\u201d He argues that it was only through the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that he learned that \u201cthe nature of the case had somehow been transformed into something entirely different from the procedural request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\">None of these contentions were raised in the district court. Instead, Rich argued that his \u201ccurrent\u201d \u00a7 2241 petition was not abusive and that it was, in fact, allowable under the sanction warnings issued by the district court and this court. This court will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal \u201cmerely because a party believes that he might prevail if given the opportunity to try a case again on a different theory.\u201d <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To the extent that Rich suggests that he did not have the opportunity to present his newly raised contentions in the district court, we note that Rich failed to raise these contentions in his objections to the report and recommendation. We also note that despite his conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tion that he has been unfairly sanctioned, he continues to press arguments that have been rejected by this court. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
