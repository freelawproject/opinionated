Cox alleges that Kaelin retaliated against him in response to his support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent in the 2012 race for Nueces County Sheriff and his involvement in the political process, in violation of his First Amendment rights to free speech and association. The district court denied Kae-lin\u2019s motion to dismiss, in which he asserted that Cox had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and raised the defense of qualified immunity. Kaelin brings this interlocutory appeal of that judgment. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">In Cox\u2019s Fifth Amended Complaint, he alleges the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">Prior to his termination, Cox had been employed by the Nueces County Sheriffs Department for over twenty years. During the last ten years of his employment, he had served as the President of the Nueces County Sheriff Officers\u2019 Association, a Political Action Committee (\u201cPAC\u201d). In early May 2012, Kaelin \u2014 who was the Sheriff of Nueces County at the time\u2014 became upset that Thomas Burnside \u2014 who was employed by the Sheriffs Department and was a chairman of the PAC \u2014 began supporting Kaelin\u2019s opponent in the upcoming election. The PAC itself, as well as Cox, also seemed to be supporting Kae-lin\u2019s opponent, which apparently also upset Kaelin.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">Sometime around May 15, 2012, Kaelin advised Cox that he should remove Burnside as a chairman of the PAC, in an apparent attempt to sway the PAC to support his candidacy. Kaelin informed Cox that Burnside was going to be transferred to a position working in the Nueces County Jail, which he reportedly characterized as a demotion. Kaelin threatened the same action against Cox, who at the time had been working on a task force for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>(\u201cDEA\u201d), should he ignore Kaelin\u2019s request to remove Burnside from his chairmanship. Kaelin presented Cox with an ultimatum, stating he had until May 18, 2012 to respond to Kaelin\u2019s request. Cox thereafter suspended the PAC for a short period of time in order to determine his course of action and to fill vacancies. However, Cox reinstated the PAC, which resumed its activities and held a meeting sometime around May 28, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On May 31, 2012, Cox was summoned into his supervisor\u2019s office, where he was told to call Kaelin on his cell phone. During the phone conversation, Kaelin allegedly became very upset, accused Cox of lying to him, and remarked, \u201cRemember what I said I was going to do?\u201d Kaelin thereafter reassigned Cox to a position in the jail, giving him 48 hours to vacate his position on the DEA Task Force. Cox characterizes this reassignment as a demotion. As a result of his transfer to the jail, Cox\u2019s vehicle was taken away, including the gas, mileage, and insurance benefits that came with it. In addition, Cox was no longer eligible for overtime pay, which amounted to over $10,000 per year. Cox was initially assigned to work the \u201cgraveyard shift,\u201d which encompasses early morning hours, and remained in that position for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On March 28, 2013, Cox\u2019s employment with the Nueces County Sheriffs Department was terminated. Cox presumes that his employment was terminated due to his dissemination of a recorded conversation, wherein Kaelin threatened an officer who has since resigned from his position. At the time, Cox was working in the jail along with Burnside and another employee who apparently was previously assigned to the DEA Task Force, but who was also reassigned by Kaelin to jail duty for political-related reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Cox avers that his involvement with the PAC, Burnside, or the election was in no way associated with his employment, and he did not discuss these matters during work hours. Cox asserts that his involvement with the political process and his known support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent in the upcoming election were the causes of his demotion to a position in the jail, as well as his eventual termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Cox then filed this \u00a7 1983 action in federal court, naming both Nueces County, Texas, a municipality, and Kaelin, individually, as defendants. Cox asserted that the defendants maintain a pattern or practice of depriving persons of their First Amendment rights, and that defendants retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment because he engaged in free speech and association in regards to the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In response, Kaelin filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in addition to raising the defense of qualified immunity. In support of this motion, Kae-lin argued that: (1) Cox\u2019s pleadings were conclusory.and did not meet the necessary pleading standard to survive a motion to dismiss; (2) Cox had not pleaded a policy on which his claim was based; (3) Cox had not pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim of retaliation for engaging in conduct protected by the First Amendment; and (4) Cox\u2019s pleadings failed to negate Kae-lin\u2019s qualified immunity defense. The matter was referred to a United States Magistrate Judge, who found that Cox had pleaded sufficient facts to support all of the required elements of a First Amendment retaliation claim and had pleaded sufficient facts to negate Kaelin\u2019s qualified immunity defense at the motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>stage. The Magistrate Judge further found that the issue of whether there was a practice or policy violative of the First Amendment was not relevant to the cause of action against Kaelin. The Magistrate Judge therefore recommended that Kae-lin\u2019s motion to dismiss be denied. The district court thereafter overruled all of Kaelin\u2019s objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation, adopted its findings and conclusions, and denied Kaelin\u2019s motion to dismiss. Kaelin then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In his brief, Cox asserts that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Kaelin\u2019s motion to dismiss, arguing that the district court did not reject Kaelin\u2019s defense of qualified immunity, but rather made a \u201cpreliminary determination\u201d that Cox had pleaded sufficient facts that, if proven, would negate Kaelin\u2019s qualified immunity defense. However, a district court order denying a government official\u2019s claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, provided \u201cit turns on an issue of law.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 672, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A district court order ruling on the sufficiency of the pleadings on the basis of qualified immunity \u201cturns on an issue of law,\u201d as \u201cevaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a \u2018fact-based\u2019 question of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Therefore, the denial of the motion to dismiss in this ease is \u201can order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding,\u201d which gives this Court jurisdiction to review that order pursuant to the collateral-order doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 672, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Our jurisdiction in this case is not limited to reviewing the rejection of the qualified immunity defense; we also have jurisdiction to review whether the pleadings sufficiently state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (holding that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the sufficiency of the pleadings because \u201cthe sufficiency of respondent\u2019s pleadings is both inextricably intertwined with and directly implicated by the qualified immunity defense\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">At the outset, Kaelin complains generally that the Magistrate Judge relied on matters outside of the pleadings in denying his motion to dismiss; namely, Kaelin asserts that the Magistrate Judge relied on the pleadings from a separate action against Kaelin. Kaelin argues that this is reversible error without any further elaboration. However, \u201cfederal courts are permitted to refer to matters of public record when deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,\u201d so long as the court does not rely on those matters when deciding the motion. <em>Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 372 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1343 n. 6 (5th Cir.1994)). If the Magistrate Judge did in fact rely on pleadings from a separate case, the district court \u201cshould have converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, given the parties notice, and then considered all of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Scanlan v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ., </em>343 F.3d 533, 539 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cOnly if it appears that the district court <em>did </em>rely on matters outside the pleadings should an appellate court treat the dismissal as a summary judgment.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 283 (5th Cir.1993) (emphasis in original). There is nothing in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum and Recommendation to suggest that the Magistrate Judge placed any reli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>anee on facts outside the pleadings, including those alleged by Kaelin, in arriving at his conclusions; all of the Recommendation\u2019s findings are fully supported by the pleadings themselves. Further, this Court must give credence to the district court\u2019s explicit statement that the Recommendation \u201cis based strictly on the pleadings.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Ware v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., </em>614 F.2d 413, 414-15 (5th Cir.1980)). Therefore, the district court committed no error and the Court will review the denial of the motion to dismiss solely on the basis of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint on the basis of qualified immunity de novo. <em>Atteberry v. Nocona Gen. Hosp., </em>430 F.3d 245, 252 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIn applying this standard, we accept all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">A pleading must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2), \u201cin order to give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements will not do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDetermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will ... be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937. \u201cBut where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged\u2014 but it has not shown \u2014 that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In order for a public employee to recover for a free speech retaliation claim, the plaintiff must satisfy four elements: \u201c(1) the plaintiff must suffer an adverse employment decision; (2) the plaintiffs speech must involve a matter of public concern; (3) the plaintiffs interest in commenting on matters of public concern must outweigh the defendant\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency; and (4) the plaintiffs speech must have motivated the defendant\u2019s' actions.\u201d <em>Finch v. Fort Bend Indep. School Dist., </em>333 F.3d 555, 563 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Cox has pleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim with sufficient facts to render it plausible on its face. It is plausible from the facts Cox alleges that his reassignment to a position in the jail, as well as his discharge, were adverse employment decisions. \u201cAdverse employment actions are discharges, demotions, refusals to hire, refusals to promote, and reprimands.\u201d <em>Benningfield v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Houston, </em>157 F.3d 369, 376 (1998). Cox\u2019s alleged discharge is clearly an adverse employment decision. <em>Id. </em>It is also plausible that his reassignment to the jail was an adverse employment decision, as he alleges that Kaelin himself referred to Burnside\u2019s reassignment to the jail as a demotion. <em>See id. </em>This Court has previously held that transfers to jail duty, even without a decrease in pay, can be adverse employment decisions because \u201cjobs in the jail are not as interesting or prestigious as jobs in the law enforcement section.\u201d <em>Click v. Copeland, </em>970 F.2d 106, 110 (5th Cir.1992). We made that finding only after reviewing the evidence presented at trial, and thus we can only make such a finding in this case after further facts have been adduced. However, it is certainly plausible that a position in the jail is less prestigious or interesting than Cox\u2019s previous position on a DEA task force. Thus, it is plausible from the facts alleged, including the loss of various benefits, that Cox\u2019s reassignment to the jail was indeed an adverse employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Regarding the second element of a First Amendment retaliation claim, we must determine whether it is plausible from the pleadings that Cox \u201cspoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). The first step of this inquiry questions whether Cox engaged in First Amendment speech as a citizen or in his role as a public employee. <em>See Lane v. Franks, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2369, 2378-80, 189 L.Ed.2d 312 (2014). It is clear that Cox did not participate in the PAC and support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent in the course of his ordinary duties as a public employee; on the contrary, Kaelin specifically pleaded that he never discussed his involvement with the PAC or the upcoming election during work hours. Thus, it is clear that Cox engaged in these activities as a citizen. His role as a citizen is impacted neither by the relationship between the PAC \u2014 which is an association of sheriff officers \u2014 and his employment as a deputy sheriff, nor by the fact that he was supporting the opponent of his superior officer in an upcoming election, as \u201cthe critical question ... is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2379.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Next, we must determine whether the speech involved a matter of public concern. <em>See id. </em>at 2380. \u201cSpeech involves matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe inquiry turns on the \u2018content, form, and context\u2019 of the speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)). The content \u2014 support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent \u2014 and form\u2014 participation in a PAC \u2014 of the speech at issue clearly support the notion that it involved matters of public concern, as we have previously held that \u201cthere can be no question that ... associating with political organizations and campaigning for a political candidate[ ] related to a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Vojvodich v. Lopez, </em>48 F.3d 879, 885 (5th Cir.1995). The context of the speech, insofar as it occurred in the midst of an upcoming local election, bolsters the conclusion that Cox\u2019s speech involved a matter of public concern. Kaelin argues that Cox has not specifically pleaded any facts that suggest he had actually engaged in verbal speech, and that this omission belies any claim that Cox engaged in protected speech. However, we have previously held that political associations qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>as speech under the First Amendment, and thus Kaelin\u2019s argument is meritless. <em>See Steadman v. Texas Rangers, </em>179 F.3d 360, 367 (5th Cir.1999) (stating that verbal enunciation of political views is not required to receive First Amendment protection; political association is sufficient in itself). Therefore, it is plausible from the facts alleged that Cox engaged in speech in the role of a citizen on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Kaelin further argues that the district court erred in not conducting a balancing analysis, weighing Cox\u2019s interest in commenting on matters of public concern against the defendant\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency in the workplace, in order to determine the sufficiency of the pleadings in regards to the third element. Kaelin cites <em>Kennedy v. Tangipahoa Parish Library, </em>224 F.3d 359 (5th Cir.2000), among various other authorities, in support of the proposition that such a balancing inquiry must be made at the motion to dismiss stage of a proceeding. However, <em>Kennedy </em>explicitly opposes this assertion, stating, \u201cThe third element, being the factually-sensitive balancing test that it is, implicates only the summary judgment, not failure to state a claim, analysis.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Tangipahoa Parish Library, </em>224 F.3d 359, 366 n. 9 (5th Cir.2000) (abrogated n other grounds by <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 563, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Therefore, such a balancing inquiry is not warranted at this stage of the proceedings, and it suffices that Cox\u2019s pleadings, in which he avers he did not discuss his political affiliations at work, render it plausible that his interest in commenting on matters of public concern outweighed Kaelin\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Cox has also pleaded sufficient facts to support his claim that his transfer to the jail and subsequent termination were motivated by his political activity. Cox specifically pleads that Kaelin threatened a transfer to the jail should Cox ignore his request to remove Burnside as chairman of the PAC. Cox additionally pleads that Kae-lin referenced that previous threat in the phone call during which Kaelin actually transferred Cox to the jail. Additionally, Cox pleads that his support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent was \u201cknown,\u201d and thus it is plausible that his political activity and \u201cknown support\u201d for Kaelin\u2019s opponent motivated his eventual termination, aside from Cox\u2019s further claim that his termination was presumably due to the dissemination of a recording. Kaelin argues that the ten-month lapse of time between Cox\u2019s transfer and his termination undermines any claim that his termination was motivated by his political activity. However, Kaelin\u2019s argument presupposes that Cox\u2019s political activity and support for Kaelin\u2019s opponent ceased upon being reassigned to the jail. The pleadings support the inference that Cox\u2019s political activity continued following his reassignment, and thus it is plausible that his termination was also motivated by his political activity. Whether Cox\u2019s political activity did indeed continue following his transfer is a question better suited for determination at a later stage of the proceedings. Therefore, it is plausible from Cox\u2019s pleadings that both his transfer to the jail and subsequent termination were motivated by his political activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Accordingly, Cox\u2019s complaint \u201ccontain[s] sufficient factual matter ... to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d as it is plausible from the complaint that Cox can succeed on all the elements of a First Amendment retaliation claim, and it therefore withstands Kaelin\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Regarding Kaelin\u2019s claimed defense of qualified immunity, he argues that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>heightened pleading standard applies when the defense of qualified immunity is asserted, relying on <em>Schultea v. Wood, </em>47 F.3d 1427 (5th Cir.1995). Kaelin\u2019s argument, however, misreads this Court\u2019s opinion in that case. In <em>Sehultea, </em>we held that \u201ca plaintiff suing a public official under \u00a7 1983 [must] file a short and plain statement of his complaint, a statement that rests on more than conclusions alone.\u201d <em>Schultea v. Wood, </em>47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir.1995). We further held that a district court \u201cmay, in its discretion, insist that a plaintiff file a reply tailored to an answer pleading the defense of qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1433-34. The power to order such a detailed reply is based on the authority of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7, and was not derived from the heightened pleading standards espoused in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <em>Id. </em>The district court, in its discretion, did not insist that Cox file such a reply, as it found that he had met his burden to negate the defense of qualified immunity because he had alleged sufficient facts in the short and plain statement that <em>Schulte a </em>initially requires. We review that decision de novo. <em>Atteberry, </em>430 F.3d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In order to negate the defense of qualified immunity, Cox must plead sufficient facts to make it plausible that Kaelin\u2019s conduct: (1) violated a \u201cclearly established federal constitutional right;\u201d and (2) was not \u201cobjectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Nunez v. Simms, </em>341 F.3d 385, 387 (5th Cir.2003). The law is clearly established that a public employee may be neither discharged nor demoted in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment Rights. More specifically, the Supreme Court has consistently held that governmental officials are forbidden from discharging public employees for their political affiliations. <em>See Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., </em>497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990); <em>Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980); <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). Further, we have held that \u201c[t]he law was established clearly enough in this circuit [as far back as] January 1988 that a reasonable officer should have known that if he retaliated against an employee for exercising his First Amendment rights, he could not escape liability by demoting and transferring the employee rather than discharging him.\u201d <em>Click, </em>970 F.2d at 111. Kaelin argues, citing <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011), that these statements of law are impermissibly general and thus do not constitute clearly established law. This argument, wherein Kaelin attempts to equate the fairly specific principle barring the discharge or demotion of public employees for exercising their First Amendment rights with the broad notion \u201cthat an unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment,\u201d which the Court in <em>al-Kidd </em>cited as an overly general proposition, is, at best, baseless. Therefore, it is plausible from the facts alleged that Kaelin violated a clearly established constitutional right and his conduct was objectively unreasonable. Accordingly, on the face of the pleadings, Cox has negated Kaelin\u2019s qualified immunity defense for the purposes of this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Kaelin\u2019s motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
