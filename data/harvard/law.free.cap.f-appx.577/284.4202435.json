Chavira, </em>530 Fed.Appx. 330 (5th Cir.2013). On Chavira\u2019s first appeal, this matter was remanded for resen-tencing because the district court erred by holding Chavira accountable for cocaine found in an attic and including that cocaine in the drug-quantity calculation. <em>Id. </em>at 332-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Chavira contends the district court erred in applying a two-level firearms enhancement and by determining he was not eligible either for safety-valve relief or a minor-role reduction. He also' contends the court erred by not addressing these issues at resentencing and by not conducting a <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearing on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Chavira\u2019s claims regarding the firearms enhancement and the safety-valve and minor-role adjustments were not raised in his original appeal and are, pursuant to the mandate rule, beyond the scope of our remand. <em>See United States v. Griffith, </em>522 F.3d 607, 610 (5th Cir.2008) (explaining \u201can objection to a sentence must be appealed for the district court, on remand, to have authority to revisit it\u201d); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 323 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>139 F.3d 528, 530-31 (5th Cir.1998). Chavira has not demonstrated these claims fall within an exception to the mandate rule. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, the claims in this second appeal will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
