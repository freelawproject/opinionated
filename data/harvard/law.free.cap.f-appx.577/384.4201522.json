Hoffart also registered the district court\u2019s final judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, and sought to enforce the judgment there. He was unsuccessful in federal court in Oregon, and his case is currently pending on appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Because we conclude that we have no proper role in this enforcement action, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">This matter has a lengthy procedural history encompassing multiple lawsuits in both the state and federal courts in Texas and Oregon. The factual and procedural background relevant to the issues raised on appeal is limited to what follows. Sylvester Hoffart (\u201cHoffart\u201d), proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in 2008, individually and as guardian of his wife, Louise Hoffart,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempting to obtain repayment of sums of money he and Louise had loaned to Louise\u2019s son, Hal Wiggins,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Hal\u2019s wife, Joanne Wiggins, to invest in Hal\u2019s company, DWD Contractors, Inc. (\u201cDWD\u201d) (collectively \u201cAppel-lees\u201d). Construing the Hoffarts\u2019 claims liberally, the court determined that they alleged claims of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">The matter proceeded to a jury trial in 2012 before the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found that: (1) Hal Wiggins breached his fiduciary duty to Louise, awarding her $44,000 in damages against Joanne and Scott Wiggins, as representatives of Hal Wiggins\u2019s estate, and (2) DWD was liable to both Hoffarts for promissory estoppel, awarding $5,000 to Sylvester against DWD and $5,000 to Louise against DWD.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">The district court construed one of the Hoffarts\u2019 several post-judgment motions as a request for a writ of execution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69, which it granted in September 2012. The court ordered that a writ of execution be entered \u201cagainst the property, located in the State of Texas, of Defendants DWD Contractors, and Joanne and Scott Wiggins, as representatives of the estate of Hal Wiggins.\u201d The separately-entered writ of execution stated that it was \u201cenforceable in, and may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>be served by [the United States Marshals Service] in, the State of Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Hoffarts registered the district court\u2019s final judgment in federal court in Oregon, seeking to enforce and collect on the judgment there, against \u201ccertain assets located in Oregon.\u201d In its July 10, 2013 order, the district court in Oregon determined that the Hoffarts could not collect on the property located in Oregon that was held by Hal Wiggins at his death, and which passed to his wife by right of surviv-orship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Hoffarts have appealed this holding, and the appeal is currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">While their claims were pending in Oregon, the Hoffarts also filed several motions in the federal district court in Texas that are relevant to us now. In particular, the Hoffarts filed a \u201cMotion to Return\u201d in April 2013 (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 270), seeking to compel \u201cJoanne Wiggins to return all properties and monies taken by her from the Estate of Hal C. Wiggins, Deceased\u201d; a \u201cMotion for an Order\u201d in August 2013 (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 279), which appears to object to the application of Oregon law to the Hoffarts\u2019 efforts to collect on the final judgment in Oregon; and a \u201cMotion for a Charge of Contempt\u201d in November 2013 (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 284) (\u201ccontempt motion\u201d), seeking both a contempt order against Joanne and Scott Wiggins \u201cfor not obeying Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel\u201d and an order \u201ccharging said Defendants with [p]erjury for lying in their responses to their [interrogatories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The district court denied the first two motions in a September 2013 order (Dist. Ct. Docket No. 281). Concerning the \u201cMotion to Return,\u201d the court explained that \u201cany issues the Hoffarts may have with the distribution of the estate as it applies to the execution of the judgment need to be addressed where the property is found.\u201d The court noted that \u201cit appears that the property in question was located in Oregon.\u201d Turning to the \u201cMotion for an Order,\u201d the district court concluded that since the Hoffarts registered the court\u2019s final judgment in the district court in Oregon, \u201cOregon law is applied to the enforcement proceedings of the Texas judgment.\u201d The court explained that \u201cTexas law is not applied in the collection efforts occurring outside of this state.\u201d The court did not rule on the Hoffarts\u2019 contempt motion before the Hoffarts timely filed their notice of appeal in February 2014, which indicated their intention to appeal both the un-ruled-on contempt motion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the district court\u2019s rulings on the other motions discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">As the district court noted, this case concerns the unfortunate fact that Hoffart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>has \u201cdiscovered that <em>collecting </em>on a judgment is often times more difficult than obtaining that judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Hoffart appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his post-judgment motions, and also appeals his unruled-on contempt motion. He argues that the court \u201cissued a Writ of Execution for Plaintiffs[ ] to collect their Judgment in the State of Texas only,\u201d although the court \u201cknew all of Hal C. Wiggins\u2019[s] [a]ssets and [e]state were in the [s]tate[s] of Oregon and California.\u201d Hoffart claims that the district court\u2019s writ of execution \u201cdenied this elderly couple the ability to collect anything for their Judgment.\u201d Hoffart also contends that the court \u201chas and had the power to hold the Defendants in [cjontempt of [cjourt until the Judgment was paid,\u201d but \u201cdenied Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 right to use the power of the [cjourts to collect said Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">A party may register the final judgment of one district court with another district court if certain conditions are met. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 (1996). \u201cA judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69 explains that \u201c[a] money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We conclude that the district court did not err in issuing the writ of execution against Appellees\u2019 property in the State of Texas. Contrary to Hoffart\u2019s argument, the district court could not issue a writ of execution for the Hoffarts to collect their judgment against property located outside the State of Texas. <em>See Toland v. Sprague, </em>37 U.S. 300, 328-29, 12 Pet. 300, 9 L.Ed. 1093 (1838).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, Rule 69 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 contemplate that Hoffart could register the district court\u2019s final judgment in another federal district court and initiate collection proceedings there, which is precisely what happened in this case. The fact that the federal district court in Oregon issued a decision disagreeable to Hoffart does not give him valid reason to challenge the underlying writ of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">The Hoffarts\u2019 contempt motion sought an order of contempt against Ap-pellees \u201cfor not obeying Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel,\u201d as well as \u201can order charging said Defendants with [pjerjury for lying in their responses to their [interrogatories.\u201d The district court had not yet ruled on the motion when the Hoffarts submitted their notice of appeal in February, indicating their intention to appeal the unruled-on motion. Hoffart now pursues the contempt motion simultaneously in the district court and before our circuit. As noted above, the district court recently denied Hoffart\u2019s motion for a final ruling on the contempt motion, explaining that \u201cthe court cannot enter a final ruling on that motion\u201d because Hoffart is appealing it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the Fifth Circuit. Because there has been no final ruling on the contempt motion in the district court, there is nothing for us to review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Hoffart also appears to argue that the district court violated his \u201crights under Multidistrict Litigation, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407.\u201d Hoffart misunderstands the role of the multidistrict litigation rules, which have no bearing here. Although it was true, earlier in these proceedings, that \u201ccivil actions involving one or more common questions of fact [we]re pending in different districts,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407(a), neither a party nor the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation initiated proceedings for transfer of one of the actions under \u00a7 1407(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">To the extent Hoffart\u2019s brief might be construed as making any other arguments, we find those arguments waived because they have not been adequately briefed. \u201c[W]e liberally construe briefs of pro se litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than parties represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Haase v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>748 F.3d 624, 629 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cThis principle, however, does not give [Hoffart] a pass on compliance with Rule 28 relating to [his] appellate brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed. R.App. P. 28). \u201c[His] \u2018arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">.Louise passed away on March 13, 2014.

Hal Wiggins passed away on January 13, 2011, after the suit was filed, but more than a year before the jury trial took place and the final judgment was entered.

In a June 17, 2014 order, the district court denied Hoffart's motion for a final ruling on the contempt motion, explaining that \"because Hoffart is appealing [the motion] to the Fifth Circuit, that aspect of this case is involved in the appeal, and the court does not have jurisdiction to decide it.\u201d Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"the court cannot enter a final ruling on that motion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">.
