The district court sentenced Macedo-Silva to 37 months in prison and did not impose a supervised release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">In his only issue on appeal, Macedo-Silva contends that the district court erred in concluding that his 2001 Mississippi conviction for conspiracy to commit rape warranted a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Because Macedo-Silva has been released from prison after completing his prison term and he has no additional sentence to serve, his appeal is moot. <em>See Spencer v.
