Payne was convicted in 2001 of possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b)(1)(A) (Count One), possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count Two), possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (Count Three), and possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871 (Count Four). The district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 292 months of imprisonment on Count One, 120 months of imprisonment on Count Three, and 120 months of imprisonment on Count Four, with a consecutive term of 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two, for a total of 352 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Following the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2007 retroactive amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, Payne filed a pro se motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court granted the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reduced his sentence to 240 months of imprisonment on Count One, resulting in a total amended sentence of 300 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In November 2009, the Government filed a motion to reduce Payne\u2019s sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and reduced Payne\u2019s sentence to concurrent terms of 180 months of imprisonment on Count One, 90 months of imprisonment on Count Three, and 90 months of imprisonment on Count Four, with a consecutive term of 45 months of imprisonment on Count Two, for a total of 225 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In December 2011, Payne filed a second pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion seeking a sentence reduction pursuant to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2011 retroactive amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines (Amendment 750). After taking into account the policy statements set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court denied Payne\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Payne contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He argues that: (1) his sentence was based on the 125.08 grams of crack cocaine seized by law enforcement officers; (2) he was eligible for a sentence reduction despite his being sentenced below the statutory minimum sentence; and (3) an attorney should have been appointed to represent him in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o),\u201d so long as the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Contrary to Payne\u2019s contention, he was held accountable for 3.875 kilograms of crack cocaine. Thus, he was originally subject to a base and total offense level of 38, a criminal history category of III, and a guidelines imprisonment range of 292 to 365 months. After the district court granted Payne\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, he was subject to a base and total offense level of 36, a criminal history category of III, and a guidelines imprisonment range of 235 to 293 months. Under Amendment 750, Payne would have been subject to the same base and total offense level of 36, criminal history category of III, and guidelines imprisonment range of 235 to 293 months. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2011) (at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine). Further, the record reflects that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>cy statements set forth in \u00a7 1B1.10, and Payne\u2019s arguments in support of a reduction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010). The district court was under no obligation to reduce Payne\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), nor was it required to provide reasons or explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74. Finally, because there is no right to appointed counsel in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, Payne\u2019s contention that an attorney should have been appointed to represent him is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, Payne has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Payne also argues that: (1) the district court erred in failing to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e); (2) the district court\u2019s chronological application of the sentence enhancements set forth in \u00a7 924(c) violated the rule of lenity and failed to produce the lowest possible sentence on the multiple firearm counts; and (3) the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress. Because Payne\u2019s challenges to his conviction and original sentence do not relate to a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines, they are not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-31, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Payne\u2019s motion to strike the appellee\u2019s brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
