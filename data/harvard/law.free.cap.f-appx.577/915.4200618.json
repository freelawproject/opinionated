He appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his pre-trial motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. He also challenges for the first time on appeal the sufficiency of the judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">I. Jurisdictional Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b941-24\">Turner first argues that the district court erred in failing to stay the proceedings to require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the court had jurisdiction over his case. We review a claim for the dismissal of an indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>for lack of jurisdiction de novo. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>438 F.3d 1257, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Dismissal is improper if \u201cthe factual allegations in the indictment, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, were sufficient to charge the offense as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258-59 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">United States federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. If an indictment alleges conduct constituting a federal offense, the district courts have jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. McIntosh, </em>704 F.3d 894, 902-03 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Here, Turner was charged with several offenses against the United States, including, but not limited to, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514 (presenting fictitious financial obligations); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) (making a false statement under oath in a bankruptcy proceeding). Turner\u2019s jurisdiction argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">II. Insufficient Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Second, Turner argues that the judgment was insufficient, as it was not authenticated with the court\u2019s impressed seal and signed by the clerk of court. He acknowledges that he did not raise this argument before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">We review objections raised on appeal that were not timely raised in the district court for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Plain error review requires that we find \u201can \u2018error\u2019 that is \u2018plain\u2019 and that \u2018affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776. The \u201cplain\u201d requirement means that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, [we] cannot correct an error ... unless the error is clear under current law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(k)(l), a judgment of conviction must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-10\">set forth the plea, the jury verdict or the court\u2019s findings, the adjudication, and the sentence. If the defendant is found not guilty or is otherwise entitled to be discharged, the court must so order. The judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(k)(1). Here, the judgment stated that Turner pled not guilty, that the jury found him guilty on all counts of the indictment, and that he was adjudicated guilty of the offenses charged in the indictment, which it enumerated. It also stated the sentence imposed by the court, was signed by the judge, and was entered into the docket. As a result, it was sufficient under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(k)(1). No current law requires that a judgment issued in a federal criminal case be sealed or signed by the clerk of court. Here, there is no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Accordingly, Turner\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
