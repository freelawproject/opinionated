Leary alleged that prison officials and employees violated his right of access to courts by obstructing his ability to file a timely petition for writ of certiora-ri.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-19\">We apply <em>de novo </em>review to a prisoner\u2019s action dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). We have reviewed the record and Leary\u2019s brief and agree with the dismissal for failure to state a claim on the alternative ground that Leary did not \u201cidentify a nonfrivolous, arguable underlying claim\u201d and describe it \u201cwell enough to apply the \u2018nonfrivolous\u2019 test and to show that the \u2018arguable\u2019 nature of the underlying claim is more than hope.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415-16, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In the district court, Leary did not address the nature of his certiorari petition or describe the claim(s) he sought to raise therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Leary\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-21\">The dismissal of Leary\u2019s civil complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Leary is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
