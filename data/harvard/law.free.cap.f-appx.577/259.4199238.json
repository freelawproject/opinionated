The district court granted the defendants\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) motion, dismissed the suit, and denied Haendel authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Now, Haendel moves this court for IFP status, thereby challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into Haendel\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Haendel has not met this standard. There is little in his opening and reply briefs that relates to the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his suit. The majority of the briefs consists of recitations of various facts and law that do not relate to the district court\u2019s judgment. Those few bits of the briefs that do mention various aspects of the district court\u2019s judgment, such as Haendel\u2019s assertion that qualified immunity is not absolute immunity, do not suffice to show a nonfrivolous appellate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">This appeal lacks arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Consequently, Haendel\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
