As part of the agreement, Rene broadly waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, reserving only the rights to appeal any punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum, to challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea or appeal waiver, and to bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that influenced the voluntariness of the plea or waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"ABY\">On appeal, Rene contends that the district court erred in applying the importation enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(14)(C) and in determining the drug quantities used to calculate his base offense level and further that the district court failed to properly consider and weigh relevant mitigating factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The Government argues that the appeal is barred by the appeal waiver provision of the plea agreement. Rene acknowledges the waiver but contends it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"AUC\">As an initial matter, Rene\u2019s contention that his guilty plea violates due process because he was not aware of the actual sentence he faced or that he would be held accountable for \u201cfactually unsupported\u201d drug amounts is refuted by the record. In writing and during his rearr\u00e1ignment, Rene verified that he understood that he faced a maximum possible penalty of 20 years in prison on each count. He therefore was fully aware of the consequences of his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Guerra, </em>94 F.3d 989, 995 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">Further, the record of Rene\u2019s rearraignment shows that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, as Rene knew he had the right to appeal and that he was giving up that right as set forth in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994). Renes argument that he was unaware he would be without recourse to correct an \u201cimproper\u201d or \u201cunjust\u201d sentence resulting from an unforeseen offense level does not alter this conclusion. <em>See United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). Similarly, Rene\u2019s challenge to the group guilty-plea procedure fails, as the record reflects that the magistrate judge addressed the defendants individually and was careful to obtain individual answers from each defendant, including Rene, and Rene did not object to the procedure. <em>See United States v. Salazar-Olivares, </em>179 F.3d 228, 229-30 (5th Cir.1999). Further, the waiver was not rendered invalid by the district court\u2019s mistaken assertion at sentencing regarding Rene\u2019s appellate rights and the Government\u2019s failure to correct the mistake. <em>See Melancon, </em>972 F.2d at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">Because the plain language of the appeal waiver provision applies to Rene\u2019s challenges to his sentence, we will enforce the waiver and DISMISS the appeal. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
