Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 409 (5th Cir.2006). The IJ\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and its findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517-18 (5th Cir.2012). Lezama applied for withholding of removal based on her membership in the particular social group of Mexican nationals returning to Mexico from the United States; she contends that members of her proposed social group are perceived by Mexican society to have money due to their residence in the United States. We have repeatedly concluded that aliens returning to their home country from the United States who are perceived as wealthy lack the requisite particularity to constitute a particular social group. <em>See, e.g., Vasquez-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 382, 383 (5th Cir.2013). Lezama offers no basis for distinguishing this persuasive authority. <em>See Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, she has failed to show error in the IJ\u2019s decision that she was not entitled to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">We review the denial of Lezama\u2019s motions to reopen and to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to Lezama\u2019s argument, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by assessing Lezama\u2019s prima facie eligibility for withholding of removal based on the evidence presented in her motion to reopen. <em>See INS. v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(1). Her reliance on the regulatory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>hibition on BIA factfinding in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) is misplaced as this regulation governs the BIA\u2019s role in deciding an appeal and not a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As to whether the BIA abused its discretion by concluding that she failed to make a prima facie case for withholding of removal, Lezama offers only conclusory assertions that fail to meaningfully challenge the BIA\u2019s decision. Because Leza-ma fails to show that the BIA abused its discretion in concluding that she did not make a prima facie case for withholding of removal, we need not decide whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen on the other grounds articulated by the BIA. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Lezama\u2019s arguments on appeal regarding the denial of her motion to reopen parallel the arguments she raised in her motion to reconsider. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lezama\u2019s motion to reconsider for the same reasons that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lezama\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Lezama\u2019s petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
