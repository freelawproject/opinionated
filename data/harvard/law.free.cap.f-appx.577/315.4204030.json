Aguirre claims that the BIA misapplied the standard for evaluating, under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), whether his United States citizen children would be subject to \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if he is deported to Mexico. He contends that the BIA failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to consider and give weight to all of the testimony and evidence he provided in support of his request for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Our jurisdiction over immigration proceedings is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) strips us of jurisdiction to review an immigration court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b or the findings of fact made in support of that decision. <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). We have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), however, to consider de novo any \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review of such a decision. <em>Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 276-77 &amp; nn. 9 <em>&amp; </em>11 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Aguirre has not raised any claim of constitutional or legal error in connection with the BIA\u2019s denial of his request for cancellation of removal. Aguirre\u2019s claim that the BIA misapplied the standard for determining whether his children would face \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if he is deported to Mexico is, in essence, an argument that the BIA, in exercising its discretion to deny cancellation of removal, failed to give the appropriate weight to the evidence and testimony presented in support of his request. Section \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) prohibits us from reviewing that decision or the factual findings on which that decision was based. <em>See Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir. 2014); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Aguirre\u2019s attempt to cloak his challenge to the BIA\u2019s non-reviewable, discretionary decision in legal terms does not create jurisdiction when it is otherwise lacking. <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Accordingly, Aguirre\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
