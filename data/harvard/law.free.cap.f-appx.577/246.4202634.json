He further argues that the BIA\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because he provided sufficient evidence of past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Muslim religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Generally, this court reviews only the final decision of the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). When, as in the present case, the BIA\u2019s decision is affected by the IJ\u2019s ruling, however, this court also reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>Although this court reviews the legal conclusions of the IJ and the BIA de novo, it reviews their factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence standard, \u201creversal is improper unless we decide \u2018not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but [also] that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u2019\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Momin\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the wrong standard of review in reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision is not supported by the record. The BIA correctly applied the clearly erroneous standard to the IJ\u2019s factual finding that Momin failed to demonstrate the required nexus that the mistreatment he suffered in India was due to his Muslim religion, a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2004) (noting that an IJ\u2019s determination that an asylum applicant failed to demonstrate the requisite nexus between persecution and protected ground was a question of fact). Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that the Hindu extremists\u2019 motive for targeting Momin was not his Muslim religion, but rather extortion. Similarly, Momin\u2019s own testimony indicated that his detention by Indian authorities in 2002 was not on account of his Muslim religion, but rather because he was suspected of being a Pakistani agent. As the BIA concluded, Momin failed to make the required nexus that \u201cone central reason\u201d for his mistreatment was due to a statutorily protected ground. <em>See Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863-64 (5th Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the record does not compel the contrary conclusion that Momin is entitled to asylum. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Because Momin cannot demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum, he also cannot show that he meets the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Momin did not satisfy his burden for relief under the CAT. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 354 (5th Cir.2002). Although there is no dispute that Momin was tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>tured in 2002 by the Indian authorities, Momin remained in India without incident for an additional three years. In fact, as the BIA and the IJ noted, Momin showed no fear in reporting the 2005 incident with Hindu extremists to the Indian authorities. Further, Momin acknowledged that his parents and siblings live in other areas of India, and that they have not experienced any issues with Hindu extremists or the Indian authorities. Momin further acknowledged that he has never attempted to relocate in another part of India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(ii) (directing consideration of \u201c[e]videnee that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured\u201d); <em>Arce v. Holder, </em>449 Fed.Appx. 404, 406-07 (5th Cir.2011). The evidence does not compel a finding that it is more likely than not that Momin would be tortured upon removal to India. Accordingly, Momin has failed to show error on the part of the BIA in denying him relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Momin also fails to show error on the part of the BIA in considering the denial of his asylum and withholding of removal claims \u201cfinal\u201d as of its June 18, 2009 decision. The BIA specifically ordered that \u201c[t]he appeal is dismissed with respect to asylum and withholding of removal\u201d and that \u201c[t]he record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding protection under CAT consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.\u201d As the BIA concluded, this was a final decision by which the BIA was bound. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(7)). Accordingly, the subsequent attempts by Mo-min to reintroduce evidence in support of his asylum and withholding of removal claims were properly construed as motions to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. Further, our dismissal of Momin\u2019s initial petition for review for lack of jurisdiction was proper given that there was no final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Thus, Momiris arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s June 18, 2009 decision are unavailing. As such, he has shown no abuse of discretion on the part of the BIA for denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Accordingly, the petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
