The BIA determined that Mosanya and his family had overstayed their visas and that Mosanya was not eligible to adjust his status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c)(8) because he had engaged in unauthorized employment. Mo-sanya contends that he should be permitted to seek adjustment of status because his failure to renew his visa was \u201cthrough no fault of his own,\u201d as he received incorrect information from a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services employee about the legal effect of his pending application for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1255(c)(2). Because the petitioners are challenging the determination that Mosan-ya is ineligible to adjust his status, we have jurisdiction to review the arguments. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sattani v. Holder, </em>749 F.3d 368, 370-72 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-24\">Section 1255(c)(8) provides that an \u201calien who was employed while the alien was an unauthorized alien\u201d is not eligible to adjust his status. There is no dispute that Mo-sanya continued working after the expiration of his employment visa, and Mosanya does not contend that he was authorized to work at that time. Although he asserts that he should not be penalized for not renewing his visa in light of his attempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>to obtain accurate information from the agency, the \u201cno fault of his own\u201d language constitutes an exception to \u00a7 1255(c)(2), which states that an alien is ineligible to adjust his status if he \u201cfailed (other than through no fault of his own or for technical reasons) to maintain continuously a lawful status since entry into the United States.\u201d Because the BIA determined that Mosan-ya was ineligible to adjust his status under \u00a7 1255(c)(8), the exception in \u00a7 1255(c)(2) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">To the extent that the petitioners\u2019 claim should be considered as a request for equitable estoppel, they have not established that any misinformation that was provided rose to the level of affirmative misconduct. <em>See Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1003 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Kwon v. INS, </em>646 F.2d 909, 910, 916-19 (5th Cir.1981) (en bane). Consequently, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
