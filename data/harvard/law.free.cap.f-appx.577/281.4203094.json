West, </em>567 Fed.Appx. 240, 2014 WL 1797725 (5th Cir. May 7, 2014). Prior to entry of the final judgment, West filed several pro se motions seeking various forms of relief from the district court. The instant appeal is from the district court\u2019s denial of those prejudgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u201cUnder Article III of the Constitution, federal courts may adjudicate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990). \u201cThe case-or-controversy requirement is present at all levels of litigation, from the trial level through the appellate process.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>479 Fed.Appx. 649, 649 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>Lewis, </em>494 U.S. at 477-78, 110 S.Ct. 1249). \u201cAn appeal is moot when the court can no longer grant any effectual relief to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Jeffers, </em>479 Fed.Appx. at 649-50 (citing <em>Motient Corp. v. Dondero, </em>529 F.3d 532, 537 (5th Cir.2008)). Because it implicates the case-or-controversy requirement under Article III, mootness is jurisdictional and this court must raise the issue <em>sua sponte </em>if necessary. <em>United States v. Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d 352, 354-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Given that the judgment of conviction has been rendered and affirmed, this court cannot grant West the effectual relief he requests in this, the appeal of the denial of the prejudgment motions. Accordingly, the appeal is moot and it is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Lares-Meraz, </em>452 F.3d at 354-55.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
