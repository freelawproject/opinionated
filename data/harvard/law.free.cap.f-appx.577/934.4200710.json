(\u201cMTA\u201d). Because the district court made findings of fact without allowing an evidentiary hearing, we vacate the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">The Plaintiffs in this suit each signed employment agreements when they began working for MTA. While the terms of the agreements varied, each contained restrictive covenants preventing the disclosure of confidential information, solicitation of MTA\u2019s customers, and restricting competition with MTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">Over a three year period, each of the Plaintiffs left employment with MTA and began working for a similar company called Advanced Compliance Solutions. Following their departure, MTA sent the Plaintiffs \u201ccease and desist\u201d letters claiming they were violating the terms of the restrictive covenants and threatening legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">In response, the Plaintiffs filed this suit seeking a declaratory judgment that they were not violating the restrictive covenants or that the restrictive covenants were invalid. MTA responded by filing a counterclaim for an injunction and moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining the Plaintiffs from violating the restrictive covenants. The parties submitted various conflicting affidavits related to the motion for a preliminary injunction. The Plaintiffs moved for an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The district court denied the motion, but held a nonevidentiary oral argument on the motion. After the oral argument, the court issued an order granting the preliminary injunction. The Moons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">II. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">On appeal, the Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by issuing the preliminary injunction. Specifically, they contend that the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing, erred by holding that MTA was likely to succeed on the merits, and erred by holding that MTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>would be irreparably harmed absent a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">We review the decision to grant a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. \u201cIn so doing, we review the findings of fact of the district court for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. This scope of review will lead to reversal only if the district court applies an incorrect legal standard, or applies improper procedures, or relies on clearly erroneous factfinding, or if it reaches a conclusion that is clearly unreasonable or incorrect.\u201d <em>Forsyth Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, </em>633 F.3d 1032, 1039 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">A. The district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">The Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by denying their motion for an evidentiary hearing and deciding the preliminary injunction motion without an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">An evidentiary hearing is not always required before the issuance of a preliminary injunction. <em>All Care Nursing Serv., Inc. v. Bethesda Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc., </em>887 F.2d 1535, 1538 (11th Cir.1989). But, \u201c[w]here the injunction turns on the resolution of bitterly disputed facts, however, an evidentiary hearing is normally required to decide credibility issues.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">To reach its conclusion in this case, the district court made extensive factual findings. In fact, the district court\u2019s order\u2014 which MTA drafted \u2014 includes almost five pages of factual findings. However, many of these facts are disputed by the parties\u2019 conflicting affidavits. For example, the Plaintiffs dispute whether they competed in the restricted area (R. 18-3 at 4-5), whether they solicited MTA\u2019s customers (18-8 at 2), and whether MTA\u2019s customer relationships were substantial (R. 18-3 at 5, R. 18-6 at 5, R. 18-7 at 3). Additionally, the district court\u2019s order states that the Plaintiffs \u201cadmittedly used confidential information to steer business away from MTA.\u201d (R. 35 at 5.) But the Plaintiffs never made this admission and in fact stated they did not use confidential information. (R. 18-3 at 5-6, R. 18-5 at 2.) Despite these conflicts, the district court\u2019s order neither references the Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, nor explains why the Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits are not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">In this case, \u201cwhere much depends upon the accurate presentation of numerous facts, the trial court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve these hotly contested issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the face of two plausible affidavits \u201csubmitted to demonstrate a contested issue, the district court is not at liberty to accept one construction of the evidence and reject the other without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>CBS Broadcasting Inc. v. EchoStar Communications Corp., </em>265 F.3d 1193, 1207 (11th Cir.2001). On remand, the district court should conduct an evi-dentiary hearing. And, the movant \u2014 in this case MTA \u2014 must clearly satisfy the burden of persuasion as to each element of the preliminary injunction. <em>Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">B. We cannot decide the merits of the preliminary injunction at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">The Plaintiffs also contend that the district erred by failing to apply Florida law and by applying an incomplete irreparable injury standard. However, because the propriety of the injunction turns on factual findings, we cannot decide the merits of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">On remand the district court should consider the application of <em>Shields v. Paving Stone Co., Inc., </em>796 So.2d 1267, 1269 (Fla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>4th DCA 2001), because a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to apply the law of the forum state. <em>See Bravo v. United States, </em>577 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[W]e are \u2018bound\u2019 to follow an intermediate state appellate court \u2018unless there is persuasive evidence that the highest state court would rule otherwise.\u2019\u201d). Additionally, the district court should apply the preliminary injunction standard we dictated en banc in <em>Siegel, </em>234 F.3d at 1176. In this Circuit, \u201ca preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Robertson, </em>147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.1998)). To show irreparable injury, MTA bears the burden of clearly establishing it will be harmed in the future by an actual and imminent injury for which adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will not be available. <em>See Sampson v. Murray, </em>415 U.S. 61, 90, 94 S.Ct. 937, 953, 39 L.Ed.2d 166 (1974); <em>Siegel, </em>234 at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">The district court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we vacate the court\u2019s injunction and remand with instructions to hold an eviden-tiary hearing and further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION VACATED, CASE REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
