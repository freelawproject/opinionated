He argues that the superceding indictment was defective because it specifically cited to the sex trafficking conspiracy statutory subsection, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1594(c), while omitting specific recitation to the forced labor conspiracy statutory subsection, \u00a7 1594(b). He further argues that (1) errors made pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 11 rendered his guilty plea invalid and (2) his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court committed numerous errors in calculating his guidelines sentencing range. Williams did not raise these issues in the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d 889, 900 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Because Williams entered a voluntary and unconditional guilty plea, he waived any challenge to nonjurisdictional defects in the superceding indictment. <em>See United States v. Daughenbaugh, </em>549 F.3d 1010, 1012 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630-31, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Moreover, Williams\u2019s assertion that his guilty plea was invalid because the district court did not properly admonish him regarding the nature of the charges against him or the maximum possible sentence is without merit. Given the specificity of the plea agreement and the superceding indictment, the lengthy factual basis supporting his guilty plea, and Williams\u2019s \u201c[sjolemn declarations in open court\u201d that he understood the charges against him and the consequences of pleading guilty, Williams cannot demonstrate that but for any Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 errors he would likely not have pleaded guilty. <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>570 F.3d 641, 649 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Similarly, the appellate waiver is valid because the record reveals that Williams read and understood the terms of the plea agreement and did not ask any questions, ask for clarification, or express any confusion concerning the waiver provision. <em>See United States v. Higgins, </em>739 F.3d 733, 736-37 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014). Because the Government did not breach the plea agreement, Williams is bound by his knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>309 F.3d 882, 886 (5th Cir.2002). Williams\u2019s waiver of appeal allowed him to appeal his sentence only where he alleged constitutional violations due to ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. His sentencing issues do not rise to constitutional dimension, and he does not allege either ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, he was waived review of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>sentencing issues. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
