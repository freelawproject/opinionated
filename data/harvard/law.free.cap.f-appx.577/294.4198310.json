Morales contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because the district court gave too much weight to his prior criminal convictions, and because the district court failed to give sufficient weight to the mitigating facts. Morales argues that his prior convictions were 15-20 years old, that he had changed in the intervening years, that his recent offenses were only illegal reentry offenses, and that he had returned to the United States only to support his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Morales has not shown that his sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Rather, the record shows that the district court properly considered the advisory guidelines range, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the arguments of counsel. The district court considered Morales\u2019s several prior convictions, his repeated illegal reentry offenses, and the speed with which he had returned to the United States after deportation. The district court concluded that the sentence reflected Morales\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to protect the public, and the need to deter future crimes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Morales\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to show an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Although the sentence is 12 months above the top of the advisory guidelines sentencing range, we have upheld variances of a greater magnitude. <em>See United States v. Rhine, </em>637 F.3d 525, 526-27, 529-30 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 805, 805-08. Morales\u2019s 24-month sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of these circumstances. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-49 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
