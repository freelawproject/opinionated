Martinez argues that the IJ and BIA improperly considered the pretrial intervention service (\u201cPTI\u201d) document demonstrating that Martinez admitted to possessing cocaine, and erred by concluding that, due to evidence of an admitted controlled substance offense, she was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Additionally, Martinez argues that she had a valid entry document at the time of her application for admission and, therefore, the IJ and BIA erred by concluding that she was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)\u00ae. Finally, Martinez argues that that the IJ erred by failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing regarding her Temporary Protected Status (\u201cTPS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>our jurisdiction over a petition for review. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We also review <em>de novo </em>questions of law. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). If jurisdiction exists over the peti tion for review, we review the decision of the BIA as well as any portions of the IJ\u2019s opinion that the BIA expressly adopted. <em>Id. </em>We may review the IJ\u2019s decision to the extent that the BIA expressly agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Id. </em>An issue not argued on appeal is deemed abandoned. <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Petitioners are required to exhaust all administrative remedies available in order for us to review a final order of removal. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, if the petitioner failed to raise his claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. The exhaustion doctrine requires the petitioner to raise claims before the agency, to thereby ensure that the agency had a full opportunity to consider the petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">A petitioner is required only to present the \u201ccore issue\u201d to the BIA in order to exhaust the claim. <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008). However, the petitioner must exhaust discrete arguments relating to the core issue before the BIA. <em>See Shkambi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>584 F.3d 1041, 1048 n. 4 (11th Cir.2009) (dismissing as unexhausted a petitioner\u2019s specific argument that the IJ had engaged in speculation in discrediting him, although the petitioner had contested the broader adverse-credibility finding before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Any alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of a crime involving a violation of any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance is inadmissible and, therefore, removable. INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). To be removable under this statute, an alien need not have been convicted of a controlled substance offense, but only needs to have admitted to committing a controlled substance offense. <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasizing that the statute applies to aliens \u201cwho admit[ ] having committed\u201d an offense). A determination of removability requires \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.\u201d Gar<em>ces v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1347 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">Under Florida law, it is unlawful for any person to be in actual or constructive possession of cocaine, a controlled substance. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 893.13(6)(a), 893.03(2)(a)4. Possession of cocaine qualifies as an offense relating to a controlled substance. <em>Fernandez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">As an initial matter, Martinez\u2019s sole argument to the BIA regarding her removability as a criminal alien was that her PTI admission was inadmissible as an evidentiary matter because it was not within the limited category of documents admissible to prove a conviction. Martinez argues for the first time before us that her PTI admission does not constitute an \u201cadmission\u201d for the purposes of INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) because she did not admit to each essential element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>crime and was not afforded various procedural safeguards. Because this argument was not raised before the BIA, Martinez failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and we lack jurisdiction to entertain this argument. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Additionally, by conceding that <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), does not apply retroactively, Martinez effectively abandoned her argument regarding its applicability and argues, for the first time before us, that her defense attorney\u2019s failure to advise her on the immigration consequences of her PTI admission constitutes a Fifth Amendment due process violation. <em>Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1145. Again, Martinez did not raise this argument before the BIA and, therefore, failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, meaning we lack jurisdiction to entertain the argument. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, those parts of the petition are dismissed, and the sole exhausted issue relating to Martinez\u2019s re-movability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) over which we have jurisdiction is whether the IJ and BIA erred by considering the PTI admission because it was not admissible evidence of a conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The IJ and BIA did not err by concluding that Martinez\u2019s PTI admission was relevant and admissible evidence sufficient to demonstrate her removability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Here, it is irrelevant whether PTI documents are sufficient to prove the existence of a conviction because, as correctly noted by the BIA, the only issue regarding Martinez\u2019s removability was whether she <em>admitted </em>to committing an offense relating to a controlled substance, not whether she actually sustained a conviction. In the PTI documents, Martinez \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d admitted that she was \u201cguilty of ... Possession of Cocaine,\u201d which constitutes an offense relating to a controlled substance. <em>Fernandez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1309. This document was \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\u201d of Martinez\u2019s removability as a criminal alien. <em>Id.; Garces, </em>611 F.3d at 1347. Accordingly, the IJ and BIA did not err by considering Martinez\u2019s PTI admission and concluding that she was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i) (I I). We, therefore, deny this part of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">The Attorney General may temporarily parole an alien into the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). An alien may receive advance authorization for parole if she has not yet, but will, travel to the United States without a visa. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(f). Commonly called \u201cadvance parole,\u201d this administrative device allows an alien in the United States, who fears that she will be inadmissible if she leaves and tries to return, to leave with the assurance that she will be paroled back into the United States upon return. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2003). Parole, however, is not regarded as an admission of the alien. INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). When a charging document is served on the alien, the eharg-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>ing document constitutes written notice of termination of parole. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(e)(2)\u00ae. When parole is terminated, the paroled alien is restored to the status that he or she had at the time of' parole and becomes subject to removal proceedings. <em>Id.; Assa\u2019ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Any immigrant at the time of application for admission who is not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, re-entry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document is inadmissible and, therefore, removable. INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)\u00ae. An application for admission to the United States is a continuing application and admissibility is determined on the basis of the law and the facts existing at the time the application is finally considered. <em>Matter of Kazemi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">The IJ and BIA did not err by concluding that Martinez was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)\u00ae. Martinez last entered the United States via advance parole, which does not qualify as an admission into the United States. INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). By filing a Notice to Appear, the DHS terminated Martinez\u2019s parole and she was, therefore, restored to the status she had at the time of parole and subject to removal proceedings. <em>Assa\u2019ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1327; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(e)(2)(i). Although Martinez had TPS status at the time of her parole, it was revoked due to her cocaine possession admission and she was, therefore, an arriving alien. At the time of her application for admission before the IJ, Martinez did not possess a valid entry document. <em>Ka-zemi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 51. Because Martinez had no valid entry document at the time of her application for admission, she was removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Martinez\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit. First, the notion that Martinez\u2019s 2003 advance parole constitutes a \u201cvalid entry document\u201d for the purposes of INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)\u00ae contradicts the language of the statute, which states that parole does not qualify as an admission into the United States. INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A). Second, the argument that Martinez reverted back to her TPS status upon revocation of her parole is facially appealing, but ultimately unavailing. According to Martinez, her parole termination should restore her TPS status, even though the revocation of her TPS status was what caused DHS to terminate her parole. The more logical interpretation is that under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(e)(2)\u00ae, Martinez reverted back to her status prior to obtaining advance parole, which was that of an arriving alien, not an alien with TPS status, because her TPS status had been revoked. Finally, to the extent that the IJ and BIA erred, any such error was harmless because, as discussed above, Martinez was otherwise inadmissible as a criminal alien under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Accordingly, we deny this part of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">Martinez appears to argue that either (1) the IJ erred by failing to grant her a <em>de novo </em>hearing regarding her TPS renewal application, or (2) the IJ erred by failing to explicitly rule on her request for TPS renewal. Either way, Martinez never argued to the BIA that the IJ erred in any way relating to her TPS renewal applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>tion. Accordingly, Martinez failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to review her argument, and this part of her petition is dismissed. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-6\">. While we do not have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed violation of law relating to a controlled substance, we still have jurisdiction to review \"constitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C-D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C-D). Because this issue and the remaining issues involve questions of law, we retain jurisdiction over the petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
