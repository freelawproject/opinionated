We issued a writ of certiorari to determine whether the evidence in this case was sufficient to support Harrison\u2019s conviction of attempted second-degree murder. Harrison argues that the evidence was not sufficient to prove the intent element of that crime. For the reasons discussed herein, we agree -with Harrison and hold that, under the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent,\u201d the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that Harrison possessed the requisite intent for attempted second-degree murder. We also hold that the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d does not support the conviction because \u201ctransferred intent\u201d may not be applied to prove attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Harrison engaged in a shooting in Baltimore City on July 27, 2001. As a result of the incident, the State charged Harrison in a nine-count indictment with: (1) attempted first degree murder in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 411A (b) (1957,1996 RepLVoL);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) attempted second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>degree murder of Cook in violation of Article 27, Section 411A (a);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) first-degree assault of Cook in violation of Article 27, 12A-1 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) second-degree assault of Cook in violation of Article 27, Section 12A (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (5) reckless endangerment of Cook in violation of Article 27, Section 12A-2 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) use of handgun in the commission of a felony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>crime of violence in violation of Article 27, Section 36B (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2000 Supp.);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (7) the wearing, carrying, and transportation of a handgun in violation of Article 27, Section 36B (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2000 Supp.);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (8) possession of a regulated firearm after having been previously convicted of a misdemeanor carrying a penalty of more than two years imprisonment in violation of Article 27, Section 445(d)(l)(iii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (9) possession of a regulated firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime of violence in violation of Article 27, Sections 445(d) and 449(e) (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On June 12, 2002, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Harrison was convicted of attempted second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence on an agreed statement of facts, which the prosecutor narrated for the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">The facts would be that, on July 27, 2001, in the fifteen hundred block of Clifton Avenue, the victim in this matter, Mr. James Cook, was standing and talking with friends when he was struck in the neck with a bullet. Investigation revealed that [Harrison] and another unknown person were shooting at someone known only to them only as Valentine, and in the course of the shooting, accidentally struck the victim, Mr. Cook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">Your Honor, a witness was identified. He was taken down to the station and shown a photo array. He observed the photo array and picked out [Harrison] who would be identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>fied in court here today as Mr. Gerard Harrison to my right, with counsel, as the person he knows as Fats and as one of the shooters. I believe the photo array is already in evidence in the court file from the motions hearing. Situationally, the defendant was advised of his rights. He waived his constitutional rights and he did give a statement that was taped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">I believe that and the advisement of rights are already in the court file as well from evidence and motions hearings. During the statement, [Harrison] advised that he and a person known to him as Twin Shitty began firing on a person that they knew as Valentine. [Harrison] stated that he had one gun and the other person had two guns, stating that he had fired six shots and then they both ran. Found out later that somebody other than their intended target was shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[I]f called to testify, the ballistics examiner would have stated that the ballistics evidence recovered from the crime scene was consistent with [Harrison\u2019s] confession and that the ballistics show that there were three different firearms used and they matched the caliber that [Harrison] described. The victim was taken to Sinai Hospital where he was operated on. All events occurred in Baltimore City, State of Maryland. That would be the statement supporting the guilty plea as a Count Two, attempted murder in the second degree and Count Six, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The statements made by Harrison during a police interrogation on August 22, 2001, which were referred to in the agreed-upon facts, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">[Officer]: Okay and if you could, in your own words again tell me what you know and what happened as far as what you knew in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Harrison: All I know is that me and another ... another dude, a friend of mines walking up on the basketball court and he had two guns, I had one. We just started shooting in the direction of Valentine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>[Officer]: Of Valentine, and why were you all shooting at Valentine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Harrison: Because he around there selling some dope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF9M\">[Officer]: Okay, and was he told something in the past?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9_6\">Harrison: He was told in the past not to hustle around there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[Officer]: Okay, and when you all were shooting in the direction of Valentine, what type of gun did you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnH\">Harrison: I had a .38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">[Officer]: Okay. Now when you all were shooting at Valentine, how many shots did you shoot at him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">Harrison: Six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">[Officer]: So did you have any more shots left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">Harrison: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The judge imposed concurrent sentences of twelve years imprisonment for attempted second-degree murder and five years imprisonment for the handgun violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. <em>Harrison v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 648, 828 A.2d 249 (2003). In addition to affirming the handgun conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Harrison\u2019s conviction of attempted second-degree murder of Cook. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 828 A.2d at 257.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the court considered the State\u2019s arguments that the intent element of the crime could be supported under theories of \u201ctransferred intent,\u201d \u201cdepraved heart\u201d recklessness, and \u201cconcurrent intent.\u201d The court concluded that the conviction could not rest on theories of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d or \u201cdepraved heart\u201d recklessness. <em>Id. </em>at 659-660, 828 A.2d at 255. The theory of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d fails because, according to the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>under <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984 (1993), the doctrine only applies when a defendant shoots at his target, misses, and an unintended victim receives a <em>fatal </em>injury. <em>Harrison, </em>151 Md.App. at 658, 828 A.2d at 254-55. The court held that \u201cdepraved heart\u201d recklessness also does not apply because Harrison\u2019s conviction of attempted second-degree murder requires that he had a specific intent to kill; depraved heart\u201d murder, on the other hand, \u201conly requires wanton disregard for human life, ... a mental state [that] falls short\u201d of the necessary mental element of attempted second-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 828 A.2d at 255. Nevertheless, in the court\u2019s view, the evidence did support a finding of the requisite intent, under the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 828 A.2d at 256-57. The court held that the jury could infer that Harrison \u201cintentionally created a \u2018kill zone\u2019 to accomplish the death of Valentine, the primary victim,\u201d and, therefore, the jury could also infer that Harrison had a concurrent intent to kill Cook, who was among those \u201cgathered at the scene of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 828 A.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Harrison petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari and raised two questions, which we have rephrased and combined into one: Is the evidence sufficient to support a conviction of attempted second-degree murder, where Harrison fired six shots at one person, missed that person, but hit another person causing injury and not death? <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence fails to support a conviction for attempted second-degree murder based on the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d because the stipulated facts do not prove that Cook inhabited the \u201ckill zone\u201d when Harrison fired the errant shots. Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>thermore, the State\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d also fails inasmuch as that doctrine does not apply to a charge of attempted murder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Our opinion in <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12-13, 796 A.2d 821, 827 (2002) sets out the appropriate standard of review in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">The standard of review for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979) and <em>Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 182-83, 502 A.2d 496, 498 (1986)). We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675, 685 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998) (quoting <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478, 649 A.2d at 337).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cMurder is the killing of one human being by another with the requisite malevolent state of mind and without justification, excuse, or mitigation.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>308 Md. 337, 340, 519 A.2d 735, 736 (1987). The malevolent states of mind that qualify are: (1) the intent to kill, (2) the intent to do grievous bodily harm, (3) the intent to do an act under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life (depraved heart), or (4) the intent to commit a dangerous felony. <em>Id. </em>The General Assembly has determined that certain murders qualify as murder in the first degree, such as murders committed in the perpetration of enumerated felonies or any kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 407\u2014 410 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) (setting forth the various circum stances in which a murder will be classified as murder in the first degree). Second-degree murder includes all other types of murder. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 411 (\u201cAll other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">To be guilty of the crime of attempt, one must possess \u201ca specific intent to commit a particular offense\u201d and carry out \u201csome overt act in furtherance of the intent that goes beyond mere preparation.\u201d <em>State v. Earp, </em>319 Md. 156, 162, 571 A.2d 1227, 1230 (1990); <em>Bruce v. State, </em>317 Md. 642, 646, 566 A.2d 103, 104 (1989). For attempted second-degree murder, the State has the burden to prove \u201ca specific intent to kill \u2014 an intent to commit grievous bodily harm will not suffice.\u201d <em>Earp, </em>319 Md. at 164, 571 A.2d at 1231; <em>see </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 6.2 at 500-01 (2d ed. 1986) (\u201c[0]n a charge of attempted murder it is not sufficient to show that the defendant intended to do serious bodily harm or that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>acted in reckless disregard for human life.... [Attempted murder requires an intent to bring about the result described by the crime of murder (i.e., the death of another).\u201d); Clark &amp; Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes, \u00a7 4.08 (7th ed. 1967) (\u201cTo constitute an attempt to murder, specific intent to kill is necessary, and an intent to commit any other crime will not suffice.\u201d). One has committed second-degree attempted murder when he or she harbors a specific intent to kill the victim and has taken a substantial step toward killing the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Harrison challenges his conviction for attempted second-degree murder, arguing that he did not possess the requisite intent to murder Cook because his target was Valentine. In support of this argument, Harrison relies on the agreed-upon facts, which state that Harrison \u201caccidentally\u201d struck the victim, Cook. Harrison contends that the term \u201caccidentally\u201d characterizes his state of mind at the time of the shooting, thereby nullifying the specific intent to kill the victim and obviating guilt of attempted second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The State responds that the term \u201caccidentally\u201d does not characterize Harrison\u2019s state of mind, but, rather, \u201caccidentally\u201d refers to the fact that the bullets, by accident, hit Cook instead of Valentine, the intended target. The State argues that the facts support the trial court\u2019s determination that Harrison had a specific intent to kill Valentine by shooting six bullets at him. This specific intent to kill, according to the State, should be attributed to Harrison for shooting Cook under two theories: \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d and \u201ctransferred intent.\u201d As to the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent,\u201d the State argues that, by firing six shots to kill Valentine, Harrison intentionally created a \u201ckill zone.\u201d Citing to the considered dicta explicated in Judge Chasanow\u2019s discussion for the Court majority in <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984 (1993), the State maintains that the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d functions to apply Harrison\u2019s specific intent to kill to everyone in that zone, including Cook. Under the theory of \u201ctransferred intent,\u201d the State argues, Harrison\u2019s intent to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Valentine transferred to Cook, the person who actually sustained injury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We first dispose of Harrison\u2019s argument that the term \u201caccidentally\u201d in the agreed statement of facts defines his <em>mens rea </em>at the time of the shooting. Harrison\u2019s reliance on that term is not persuasive. The term \u201caccidentally\u201d describes the outcome of Harrison\u2019s act, not his state of mind. Furthermore, in Harrison\u2019s statement to the police, which is incorporated by reference in the agreed statement of facts, Harrison admits that he intentionally fired his handgun at Valentine. When a police officer asked what happened, Harrison replied that he and a friend walked to the basketball court and \u201cjust started shooting in the direction of Valentine.\u201d The officer asked why, and Harrison responded, \u201cBecause he around there selling some dope .... He was told in the past not to hustle around here.\u201d From this evidence, as well as the agreed-upon statement that Harrison \u201cfired six shots at a person [he] knew as Valentine,\u201d the trial judge reasonably could have inferred that the shooting was no accident. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Harrison had a specific intent to kill is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Harrison argues, nonetheless, that, even if he did maintain a specific intent to kill, it was directed at Valentine and not at Cook, the one who suffered the injury. Consequently, we must determine whether the necessary specific intent as against Cook could derive from Harrison\u2019s specific intent to kill Valentine; or in other words, does Harrison\u2019s specific intent to kill Valentine satisfy the requisite intent for attempted second-degree murder, when the actual victim (and who alone was named in the indictment) in this case was a bystander? The State contends that the theories of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d and \u201ctransferred intent\u201d support its assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Harrison\u2019s specific intent to kill fulfills the intent element as against Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">A. Concurrent intent</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Court of Special Appeals upheld Harrison\u2019s conviction of attempted murder because a specific intent to murder Cook could be inferred under the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>151 Md.App. at 662, 828 A.2d at 257. This theory emerged from the discussion in <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984 (1993), in which the Court expressed its disapproval of the use of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d in cases where the defendant faced charges of attempted murder of a bystander. <em>See </em>LeEllen Coacher &amp; Libby Gallo, <em>Criminal Liability: Transferred and Concurrent Intent, </em>44 A.F.L.Rev. 227, 235 (1998). The <em>Ford </em>Court discussed the doctrine of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d to \u201cexplain[ ] and justif[y]\u201d the result in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>313 Md. 600, 546 A.2d 1041 (1988), the case in which this Court held that \u201ctransferred intent\u201d could be used to prove the specific-intent element of attempted murder of a bystander. <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 716, 625 A.2d at 1000. Explaining the distinction between \u201ctransferred intent\u201d and \u201cconcurrent intent,\u201d Judge Chasanow for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">In transferred intent, the intended harm does not occur to the intended victim, but occurs instead to a second ... victim. The actual result is an unintended, unanticipated consequence of intended harm. For example, consider a defendant who shoots a single bullet at the head of A, standing with B and C. If the defendant misses A and instead kills B, the defendant\u2019s intent to murder A will be transferred to allow his conviction for B\u2019s murder. The intent is concurrent, on the other hand, when the nature and scope of the attack, while directed at a primary victim, are such that we can conclude the perpetrator intended to ensure harm to the primary victim by harming everyone in that victim\u2019s vicinity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\"><em>Id. </em>To further distinguish between the two theories, the Court offered a hypothetical example of the application of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>[A]n assailant who places a bomb on a commercial airplane intending to harm a primary target on board ensures by this method of attack that all passengers will be killed. Similarly, consider a defendant who intends to kill A and, in order to ensure A\u2019s death, drives by a group consisting of A, B, and C, and attacks the group with automatic weapon fire or an explosive device devastating enough to kill everyone in the group .... When the defendant escalated his mode of attack from a single bullet aimed at A\u2019s head to a hail of bullets or an explosive device, the factfinder can infer that, whether or not the defendant succeeded in killing A, the defendant concurrently intended to kill everyone in A\u2019s immediate vicinity to ensure A\u2019s death. The defendant\u2019s intent need not be transferred from A to B, because although the defendant\u2019s goal was to kill A, his intent to kill B was also direct; it was concurrent with his intent to kill A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 716-17, 625 A.2d at 1000-01. The Court summed up the rule of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d as follows: \u201cWhere the means employed to commit the crime against a primary victim create a zone of harm around that victim, the factfinder can reasonably infer that the defendant intended that harm to all who are in the anticipated zone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 625 A.2d at 1001.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The <em>Ford </em>Court then turned its attention to the facts of <em>Wilson, </em>which, according to the Court, \u201creached the right result\u201d but for the wrong reasons. Retroactively applying the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d to the facts in <em>Wilson, </em>the Court stated that the jury could have found that the defendant in that case intended to create a \u201ckill zone\u201d by firing multiple bullets and that \u201ceveryone in the path\u201d of the bullets were intended targets. <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 625 A.2d at 1001. The Court concluded: \u201c[T]he bystander victim, was obviously in the ... direct line of fire and the evidence permitted finding concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>rent intent to kill everyone in the path of the bullets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 625 A.2d at 1001.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The doctrine of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d also has found favor in several other jurisdictions. For example, using \u201cconcurrent intent,\u201d the Supreme Court of California, in <em>People v. Bland, </em>28 Cal.4th 313, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107 (2002), upheld attempted-murder convictions that arose out of a gang-related shooting resulting in the death of the intended victim and injury to two bystanders. <em>Id. </em>at 1120-21. Wilson, a member of the Rolling 20\u2019s Crips, was driving through a Long Beach neighborhood with two passengers when he encountered Bland and a friend, both members of the Insane Crips. <em>Id. </em>at 1110. Bland approached Wilson\u2019s car, began shooting into the vehicle, and, along with his friend, continued to shoot as the car started to drive away. Wilson died, and both of his passengers received non-fatal gunshot wounds. <em>Id. </em>During Bland\u2019s trial, the jury was instructed according to the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent,\u201d after which Bland was convicted of first-degree murder of Wilson and attempted first-degree murder of the two injured bystanders. <em>Id. </em>at 1110-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Supreme Court of California held that Bland\u2019s convictions for attempted murder could not be premised upon \u201ctransferred intent\u201d because, in California, that theory did not apply to attempted murder. <em>Id. </em>at 1117. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the convictions could rest upon the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent.\u201d After quoting <em>Ford </em>at length, the California court stated the facts before it \u201cvirtually compelled\u201d an inference that Bland harbored a specific intent to kill all those in harm\u2019s way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Even if the jury found that [Bland] primarily wanted to kill Wilson rather than Wilson\u2019s passengers, it could reasonably also have found a <em>concurrent </em>intent to kill those passengers when [Bland] and his cohort fired a flurry of bullets at the fleeing car and thereby created a kill zone. Such a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>fully supports attempted murder convictions as to the passengers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The court in <em>Ruffin v. United States, </em>642 A.2d 1288, 1298 (D.C.1994) also applied a concurrent-intent analysis. In <em>Ruffin, </em>the defendant and four others fired multiple shots at an intended target, Younger. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. The shooting left Younger merely injured, but bullets also hit two bystanders, killing one and injuring the other. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. The defendant was convicted of three specific intent crimes, first-degree murder of the deceased bystander, Williams, and assault with intent to kill while armed on Younger and Walker, the injured bystander. <em>Id. </em>Holding that the assault-with-intent-to-kill conviction was sustainable under the doctrine of \u201cconcurrent intent,\u201d the court declared that, by firing ten to fifteen shots\u2014 \u201ca hail of bullets\u201d \u2014 at his intended victim, Ruffin and his cohort possessed a \u201cconcurrent intent to kill everyone in the path of the bullets,\u201d including the unintended victim who was in the \u201cdirect line of fire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (quoting <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 717-18, 625 A.2d at 1001).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In <em>United States v. Willis, </em>46 M.J. 258 (1997), the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces also used \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d to uphold an attempted-murder conviction. Willis was facing charges of attempted murder of his wife, so he concocted an elaborate plan to kill her as well as his aunt, whom he learned planned to testify against him. <em>Id. </em>at 259. On the day of a hearing in the case against him, Willis first shot and killed his wife. He then went to the base legal office, where he found his aunt, his uncle, and Captain Hatch, the Chief of Military Justice. The uncle tried to hold the office door closed, but because Willis was trying to force his way inside, the office door remained open by six inches. When Willis saw Captain Hatch between the six-inch gap, Willis fired one shot at him but missed. Willis then reached around the door, aimed his pistol behind the door where his aunt and uncle were, and fired three random shots, intending to kill his aunt. <em>Id. </em>Willis pled guilty to attempting to murder the aunt, uncle, and Captain Hatch.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>On appeal, Willis challenged the plea of guilty to the attempted murder of the uncle, who was not his primary target. <em>Id. </em>The court, after explaining the doctrine of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d as discussed in <em>Ford </em>and <em>Ruffin, </em>stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">Under a concurrent-intent approach, [the court] infer[s] the intent when the result was the same as that intended or at least a natural and probable consequence of the intended result. As long as the defendant has the requisite intent for the intended crime, the defendant will be responsible for the natural and probable consequences of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 261. The court held that Willis\u2019 actions were \u201csufficient to establish that he had the concurrent intent to kill both his aunt and his uncle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Willis created a \u201ckill zone\u201d by shooting \u201cbehind the door in three different spots, moving his pistol randomly between the shots.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, according to the court, Willis was responsible for the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d of his act, including \u201cthe death or grievous bodily harm of whoever was behind the door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In concurrent-intent analyses, courts focus on the \u201cmeans employed to commit the crime\u201d and the \u201czone of harm around [the] victim.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 717, 625 A.2d at 1001. The essential questions, therefore, become (1) whether a fact-finder could infer that the defendant intentionally escalated his mode of attack to such an extent that he or she created a \u201czone of harm,\u201d and (2) whether the facts establish that the actual victim resided in that zone when he or she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">As to the first question, courts have permitted an inference that the defendant created a kill zone when a defendant, like Harrison, fired multiple bullets at an intended target. In <em>Wilson, </em>the defendant and his brother fired \u201cmultiple bullets\u201d from two handguns. <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 718, 625 A.2d at 1001 (discussing <em>Wilson, </em>313 Md. at 601, 546 A.2d at 1042). The defendant in <em>Bland, </em>fired a \u201cflurry of bullets,\u201d and in <em>Ruffin, </em>the defendant and his cohort fired ten or fifteen rounds, which the court described as \u201ca hail of bullets.\u201d <em>Bland, </em>121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d at 1119; <em>Ruffin, </em>642 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>at 1298; <em>see also Hunt v. United States, </em>729 A.2d 322, 326 (D.C.1999) (holding that by \u201cunloading multiple \u2018quick fire\u2019 shots\u201d to hit the target, the defendant created a \u201ckill zone\u201d that \u201censnared\u201d the bystander); <em>Walls v. United States, </em>773 A.2d 424, 434 (D.C.2001) (holding that evidence of the defendant firing \u201cseveral shots\u201d permitted a jury inference that the defendant created a \u201czone of danger\u201d); <em>People v. Smith, </em>9 Cal.Rptr.3d 387 (Cal.App.2004) (allowing an inference of concurrent intent to kill the intended victim and unintended victim where the defendant fired a \u201csingle shot\u201d at a moving vehicle containing the target and a bystander \u201cin the line of fire\u201d). Just three random shots directed behind a door gave rise to a permissible inference of a \u201ckilling zone\u201d in <em>Willis, </em>46 M.J. at 261-62. These methods of attack are similar to Harrison\u2019s six shots at Valentine. We conclude, therefore, that the facts support an inference that Harrison created a \u201ckill zone\u201d around Valentine and that Harrison had the specific intent to kill everyone inside of the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The facts in this case, however, <em>do not </em>permit an inference that Cook, the unintended victim, inhabited the \u201ckill zone\u201d when Harrison\u2019s bullet hit him. Courts that have considered the issue all have relied on specific facts showing the location of the unintended victim either in relation to the intended victim or in relation to the defendant. In <em>Bland, </em>for example, the unintended victims occupied the same car as the intended victim when the defendant fired a hale of bullets at the car. <em>Bland, </em>121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d at 1110. When, in <em>Hunt, </em>the defendant fired multiple \u201cquick fire\u201d shots inside the automobile in which the primary victim sat, the murdered bystander was standing right next to the car. 729 A.2d at 323. Also, in <em>Willis, </em>the court held that the unintended victim resided in the \u201ckill zone\u201d behind an office door where he and the intended victim tried to avoid the defendant\u2019s random gunshots. 46 M.J. at 261; <em>see also Harvey, </em>111 Md.App. at 405, 434-35, 681 A.2d at 630, 645 (holding that, where the injured bystander was \u201cin close proximity\u201d to the intended target, the \u201cevidence was sufficient to permit a finding that [the bystander] was in [the] \u2018kill zone\u2019 \u201d). The unintended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>victims in <em>Ruffin </em>occupied a car \u201cin the vicinity of the shooting\u201d and were in the defendant\u2019s \u201cdirect line of fire.\u201d 642 A.2d at 1290, 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In the present case, however, the State\u2019s argument that Cook was in Harrison\u2019s \u201ckill zone\u201d at the time of the shooting lacks adequate support from the evidence. According to the agreed statement of facts, \u201cin the fifteen hundred block of Clifton Avenue, [Cook] was standing and talking with friends when he was struck in the neck with a bullet.\u201d Although this statement shows generally where Cook was standing when he was shot, it and the remaining evidence provide no indication where Cook was in relation to Valentine or Harrison. A fact finder, let alone an appellate court, has no idea, based on this meager evidence, whether Cook stood in Harrison\u2019s direct line of fire, next to the intended victim, or at a distance from Harrison or his target, Valentine. Absent more specific evidence of Cook\u2019s location in relation to the shooter and the intended victim, no inference is permissible that Cook occupied the \u201ckill zone\u201d when he was struck by the bullet. Consequently, we disagree with Court of Special Appeals and conclude that the agreed statement of facts does not provide sufficient evidence to support a finding of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d on the part of Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">This Court and the Court of Special Appeals have heretofore made clear that prosecutors risk acquittal when a not-guilty agreed statement of facts fails to support the legal theory upon which the State relies. <em>See Bruno v. State, </em>332 Md. 673, 684, 632 A.2d 1192, 1197 (1993) (noting that the State \u201crisk[s] an acquittal\u201d by proceeding on a not-guilty agreed statement of facts that does not present sufficient evidence to support the crimes charged); <em>Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 28, 354 A.2d 499, 501 (1976) (stating that, even in a case based on an agreed statement of facts, \u201can accused must be acquitted if the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain his conviction\u201d). We renew that admonition today. If a prosecutor proceeds on a not-guilty agreed statement of facts, he or she should take care to assure that the statement contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>evidence to support each element of the crime or crimes charged, or else acquittal necessarily will follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">A. Transferred Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The State argues that the theory of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d also supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Harrison possessed the intent required for attempted second-degree murder. The theory of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d has received considerable attention over the years in this Court and the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See, e.g., Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 671 A.2d 501 (1996); <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984 (1993); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>313 Md. 600, 546 A.2d 1041 (1988); <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 330 A.2d 176 (1974); <em>Williams v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 55, 699 A.2d 473 (1997); <em>Harvey v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 401, 681 A.2d 628 (1996); <em>Harrod v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 128, 499 A.2d 959 (1985). We first recognized the viability of the doctrine in <em>Gladden v. State, 273 </em>Md. 383, 330 A.2d 176 (1974), which involved a classic question of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d: whether Gladden was guilty of first-degree murder when he shot and killed a twelve-year-old bystander in the course of attempting to kill a man named Seigel. <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 330 A.2d at 177. Judge O\u2019Donnell traced the common law origin of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d back to 1576, when the court in <em>Reg. v. Saunders, </em>2 Plowd. 473, 474a, 75 Eng.Rep. 706, 708 (1576) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">And therefore it is every man\u2019s business to foresee what wrong or mischief may happen from that which he does with an ill-intention, and it shall be no excuse for him to say that he intended to kill another, and not the person killed. For if a man of malice prepense shoots an arrow at another with an intent to kill him, and a person to whom he bore no malice is killed by it, this shall be murder in him, for when he shot the arrow he intended to kill, and inasmuch as he directed his instrument of death at one, and thereby has killed another, it shall be the same offense in him as if he had killed the person he aimed at, for the end of the act shall be construed by the beginning of it, and the last part shall taste of the first, and as the beginning of the act had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>malice prepense in it, and consequently imported murder, so the end of the act, <em>viz. </em>the killing of another shall be in the same degree, and therefore it shall be murder, and not homicide only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><em>Gladden, </em>273 Md. at 390-91, 330 A.2d at 180 (quoting <em>Saunders, </em>2 Plowd. at 474a, 75 Eng.Rep. at 708). Summarizing the court\u2019s holding in <em>Saunders, </em>Judge O\u2019Donnell quoted the works of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir William Blackstone. Hale stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">To these may be added the cases above mentioned, <em>viz. </em>if A. by malice forethought strikes at <em>b. </em>and missing him strikes C. whereof he dies, tho he never bore any malice to C. yet it is murder, and the law transfers the malice to the party slain; the like of poisoning, <em>sed de his supra cap.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 391, 330 A.2d at 181 (quoting Sir Matthew Hale, 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown at 466). Blackstone described the same rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">Thus if one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case where one lays poison for A; and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him; this is likewise murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 391-92, 330 A.2d at 181 (quoting Sir William Blackstone, 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England 201 (Cooley, 3d ed., 1884)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Reflecting upon the viability of the doctrine, Judge O\u2019Donnell also consulted several modern sources, including Clark and Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes, \u00a7 10.06 (6th ed., 1958), which offered this illustration of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">Whenever an accountable man kills another intentionally, he is guilty of murder with express malice unless the killing is justifiable or excusable, or unless there are such circumstances of provocation as will reduce the homicide to manslaughter. This principle is applied when a man kills one person when he intended to kill another. For example, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>man shoots at one person with intent to kill him, and unintentionally kills another, or sets poison for one person and another drinks it and dies, it is murder with express malice of the person killed, though he is a friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><em>Gladden, </em>273 Md. at 392, 330 A.2d at 181. The Court was persuaded that the doctrine \u201chas lost none of its patina by its application over the centuries down unto modern times; its viability is recognized by its current acceptance and application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 330 A.2d at 181. Rather, according to the Court\u2019s review of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d in other states, \u201cthere is a singular unanimity among the decisions in the overwhelming majority of the states\u201d that a homicide committed upon an unintended target \u201cpartakes of the quality of the original act, so that the guilt of the perpetrator of the crime is exactly what it would have been had the blow fallen upon the intended victim instead of the bystander.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 330 A.2d at 181. The Court held, \u201cupon application of the principles of common law and the overwhelming weight of judicial authority, ... that the doctrine of \u2018transferred intent\u2019 is the law of Maryland .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 330 A.2d at 189. Described simply, \u201ctransferred intent\u201d operates so that \u201cthe <em>mens rea </em>of a defendant as to his intended victim will carry over and affix his culpability when such criminal conduct causes the death of an unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 330 A.2d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Years later, in <em>Wilson, </em>this Court extended the application of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to cover circumstances where the unintended victim suffered injury and not death. 313 Md. 600, 546 A.2d 1041. In <em>Wilson, </em>two brothers became involved in a dispute with Brown, and after the brothers threatened to pistol-whip him, Brown fled the scene. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 546 A.2d at 1042. Both brothers fired multiple times at Brown, who evaded the bullets. <em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 546 A.2d at 1042. One of the \u201cerrant shots\u201d struck an innocent bystander, Kent, paralyzing him and leaving him unable to walk or speak. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 546 A.2d at 1042. The brothers were convicted of attempted murder of both Brown, the intended target, and Kent, the unintended victim. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, one brother, Timothy Wilson, argued that he did not possess the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>intent to murder Kent, and the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d did not apply to attempted murder. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Court interpreted <em>Gladden </em>as not limiting \u201cthe doctrine\u2019s applicability to only cases of completed homicide\u201d but, instead, allowing \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to extend \u201cto all situations where a defendant\u2019s intended act (which in all other respects constitutes a crime) \u2018affects\u2019 or \u2018inflicts harm upon\u2019 an unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 546 A.2d at 1043. Accordingly, the Court held \u201cthat the doctrine of transferred intent applies to the crime of attempted murder and that the <em>mens rea: </em>or specific intent of a defendant as to his intended victim will carry over and determine his culpability when such criminal conduct causes injury to an unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609, 546 A.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The breadth of the <em>Wilson </em>holding was called into question in <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 714, 625 A.2d at 999, in which Judge Chasanow, writing on behalf of the Court stated: \u201cWe believe <em>Wilson </em>should not have applied transferred intent to attempted murder.\u201d Ford was one of several individuals who stood along the Capital Beltway, waved their arms to slow traffic, and then hurled large rocks at passing cars. <em>Id. </em>at 689-91, 625 A.2d at 987-88. The rocks hit between fifteen and forty cars, severely damaging the cars and injuring occupants. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 625 A.2d at 987-88. For his role in these attacks, Ford was convicted of several crimes, including assault with attempt to disable. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 625 A.2d at 987. He challenged the convictions of assault with attempt to disable on the ground that the State did not prove that he possessed a specific intent to disable a person. <em>Id. </em>at 702, 625 A.2d at 993-94. Ford argued that the evidence reflected only a \u201c \u2018generalized malevolence\u2019 and not a specific intent directed to a specific victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707, 625 A.2d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">This Court rejected Ford\u2019s argument and held that the evidence was sufficient to support a rational inference of such an intent. <em>Id. </em>at 705, 625 A.2d at 994-95. The Court reasoned that the jury could infer that, by hurling a rock through the windshields of fast-moving vehicles, Ford \u201ccreated a zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of extreme peril inside the vehicles,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 707, 625 A.2d at 996, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">Within this zone [of peril], many or all occupants of the vehicles would likely be harmed, whether by the rock, the flying glass, or the drivers\u2019 losing control of the vehicle. Under these circumstances, one act, the throwing of a single rock, could foreseeably cause multiple injuries. Where his actions were such that a single act could be expected to cause harm to all the vehicles\u2019 occupants, the jury reasonably concluded that Ford had the specific intent to disable all the vehicles\u2019 occupants, not just a \u201cgeneralized malevolence.\u201d A defendant can be convicted of multiple specific intent crimes from one act when it can be inferred that he intended to cause harm to more than one victim. Because of the potential for multiple injuries from Ford\u2019s acts, the jury could properly have inferred an intent to disable all the occupants of the vehicles, not just a \u201cgeneralized malevolence\u201d as Ford contends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 707-08, 625 A.2d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Although the Court in <em>Ford </em>rested its holding solely on these grounds, Judge Chasanow went a step beyond this analysis to discuss the issue of \u201ctransferred intent,\u201d which the Court of Special Appeals had addressed at length in its opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 709, 625 A.2d at 997. The Court took the position that \u201ctransferred intent\u201d should not apply where \u201cthe crime intended has actually been committed against the intended victim ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 625 A.2d at 998. This is so because \u201cthe doctrine was intended to enable conviction of [the] defendant of the crime he intended to commit only when that crime was not committed upon the intended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710-11, 625 A.2d at 998 (emphasis omitted). In addition, the Court saw the \u201cunderlying rationale for the doctrine\u201d as suggesting that it should apply \u201conly when, without the doctrine, the defendant could not be convicted of the crime at issue because the mental and physical elements [the <em>mens rea </em>and <em>actus reus </em>] do not concur as to either the intended or the actual victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711, 625 A.2d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>This view, Judge Chasanow recognized, \u201cseems at odds\u201d with the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wilson </em>that a conviction of attempted murder against an unintended victim could be sustained even though the defendant also had been convicted of attempted murder against the intended victim. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 625 A.2d at 999. The Court insisted that applying \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to the attempted murder of an unintended victim would contradict the purpose of the doctrine by multiplying criminal liability when all of the elements of the crime had already been established with respect to the intended victim. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 625 A.2d at 999. As another reason for not applying \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to attempted murder, Judge Chasanow stated that the \u201ccrime of attempted murder requires no physical injury to the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 625 A.2d at 1000. Contemplating an attempted murder scenario in which a shooting left no bystanders injured, he considered it \u201cvirtually impossible to decide to whom the defendant\u2019s intent should be transferred\u201d and could conceive of \u201cno rational method\u201d for deciding how to transfer the defendant\u2019s intent when many victims could have been \u201cfrightened and thereby assaulted by the shot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715-16, 625 A.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Three judges disagreed with the rejection of the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d in attempted murder cases. Judge McAuliffe\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Ford, </em>joined by Judges Rodowsky and Karwacki, characterized the majority\u2019s discussion of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d as \u201cdictum,\u201d attempting to \u201cinvalidate a portion of [the] doctrine that [the Court had] recently and specifically approved in <em>[Wilson </em>].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 625 A.2d at 1004 (McAuliffe, J., concurring). The three judges viewed the majority\u2019s limitation on the transferred-intent doctrine as presenting \u201cinteresting problems\u201d for future prosecutions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGP\">Assume, for example, that the defendant, intending to kill <em>A, </em>shoots and wounds him, but the bullet passes through <em>A </em>and kills <em>B. </em>Under the Court\u2019s theory, I assume the defendant would be guilty of the murder of <em>B, </em>although also guilty of attempted murder or assault with intent to murder <em>A. </em>If <em>A </em>had also died, the Court would hold that the defendant could not be convicted of the murder of <em>B, </em>but only of battery, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>perhaps manslaughter. What happens, then, if the defendant is convicted of the murder of <em>B </em>while <em>A </em>is still alive, but <em>A </em>dies of wounds received in the assault within a year and a day of the shooting?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 726, 625 A.2d at 1005. In light of these potential problems, the concurrence concluded that the \u201cCourt goes too far in its attempt to limit the utilization of the doctrine of transferred intent in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Court revisited the <em>Ford </em>disagreement in <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 671 A.2d 501 (1996), in which Judge Chasanow, again writing for the Court, addressed the factual scenario suggested by Judge McAuliffe in his <em>Ford </em>concurrence. Poe, in the course of a heated exchange with his estranged wife, retrieved a shotgun from the trunk of his car and, shouting, \u201cTake this, bitch,\u201d fired a single .50 caliber slug at her. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 671 A.2d at 502. The bullet passed through the arm of Ms. Poe, his intended target, and struck a six-year-old bystander in the head. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Poe suffered a non-fatal injury, but the child died instantly. <em>Id. </em>At Poe\u2019s trial, the judge instructed that \u201cif the jury would have convicted Mr. Poe ... had she died as a result of the shot, they could convict Mr. Poe of first degree murder of [the child], because the intent to kill Ms. Poe transfers to [the child], the unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 671 A.2d at 502-03. The jury found Poe guilty of first-degree murder of the child and attempted first-degree murder of Ms. Poe. <em>Id., </em>671 A.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In <em>Poe, </em>the primary issue was whether the trial court erred \u201cin ruling that the doctrine of transferred intent applies where a defendant intends to kill A, shoots and wounds A, but kills B, an unintended victim, by that same shot.\u201d 341 Md. at 528, 671 A.2d at 503. Relying on <em>Ford, </em>Poe maintained that, because he had completed the crime of attempted murder of Ms. Poe, his specific intent to kill her could not also be transferred to the child. <em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 671 A.2d at 504. This Court disagreed, explaining that limitations on \u201ctransferred intent\u201d apply only when the defendant shoots at an intended victim and, instead, wounds an unintended victim <em>\u201cwithout killing either.\u201d Id. </em>at 530, 671 A.2d at 504 (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>original). <em>Ford, </em>therefore, was inapposite to the facts of <em>Poe, </em>because the unintended victim in <em>Poe </em>had been killed, not merely injured. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that \u201ctransferred intent\u201d applied to the death of the bystander, despite the fact that Poe also had wounded his intended victim. <em>Id. </em>The Court narrowed the question of when to apply \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to \u201cwhat could the defendant have been convicted of had he accomplished his intended act?\u201d and spoke of <em>Ford </em>only to note why the defendant\u2019s reliance on that case was misplaced. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 671 A.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The Court unanimously agreed with the result in <em>Poe, </em>but three judges again joined a concurring opinion to voice concerns over the future use of \u201ctransferred intent.\u201d Judge Raker, the author of the concurring opinion, took issue with the majority\u2019s \u201coverly broad\u201d assertion that \u201cthe doctrine of transferred intent does not apply to attempted murder when there is no death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 671 A.2d at 507 (Raker, J., concurring). The correct statement of the law, in Judge Raker\u2019s view, \u201cis that transferred intent should not apply to attempted murder if no one is injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For support, Judge Raker cited several cases from England and the United States, in which courts have held the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d does apply when bystanders received non-fatal injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 537, n. 3, 671 A.2d at 507, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Judge Raker also presented various policy considerations for the application of the doctrine without regard to whether the unintended victim was killed or merely injured, to include that extended application of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d would \u201censure proportionate punishment of criminal offenses\u201d and prevent increased difficulty in prosecuting criminals for the harm inflicted on bystanders. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 671 A.2d at 509. In support, Judge Raker posed the following hypothetical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">[A] defendant, A, participates in a drive-by shooting on a public street, intending to kill B, but instead non-fatally injuring B, and non-fatally injuring bystander C. Although A may be convicted of attempted murder of B, it will be difficult to convict A of the attempted murder of C, or of assault with intent to kill C. Without transferred intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the State will be required to offer separate proof of intent for each victim, e.g., by demonstrating \u201cdepraved heart.\u201d While firing a \u201chail of bullets\u201d at a person on a busy street may be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a depraved heart, numerous factual situations may arise where it will be difficult to demonstrate recklessness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 539-40, 671 A.2d at 509. In conclusion, Judge Raker stated her understanding that the majority held simply that transferred intent may be applied to first-degree murder of a bystander, \u201cregardless of whether the defendant also injured his intended victim,\u201d and ergo, <em>Wilson </em>remains viable. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 671 A.2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The question now before us is almost identical to the one debated in <em>Wilson, Ford, </em>and <em>Poe: </em>whether \u201ctransferred intent\u201d may apply in an attempted murder case, where a bystander has received a non-fatal injury. Citing <em>Ford, </em>the Court of Special Appeals held that the transferred-intent doctrine \u201c[could] not be used to sustain [Harrison\u2019s] conviction\u201d because it did not apply in cases charging attempted murder of an unintended victim. <em>Harrison, </em>151 Md.App. at 658, 828 A.2d at 254-55. We conclude that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that the theory of transferred intent applies only when a bystander has suffered a fatal injury. This holding, as we shall explain, comports with numerous other jurisdictions who have considered the issue and avoids the numerous logical hurdles that arise when \u201ctransferred intent\u201d is applied to inchoate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">A number of other jurisdictions have rejected the doctrine of transferred intent in relation to the crime of attempted murder of an unintended victim. <em>See, e.g., Ramsey v. State, </em>56 P.3d 675 (Alaska App.2002); <em>Jones v. State, </em>159 Ark. 215, 251 S.W. 690 (1923); <em>People v. Bland, </em>28 Cal.4th 313, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107 (2002); <em>State v. Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); <em>State v. Brady, </em>745 So.2d 954 (Fla.1999); <em>State v. Williamson, </em>203 Mo. 591, 102 S.W. 519 (1907); <em>People v. Fernandez, </em>88 N.Y.2d 777, 650 N.Y.S.2d 625, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>673 N.E.2d 910 (1996); <em>State v. Shanley, </em>20 S.D. 18, 104 N.W. 522 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The Supreme Court of California extensively discussed the issue of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d for attempt crimes in <em>People v. Bland, </em>28 Cal.4th 313, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107 (2002). That case involved a multiple shooting in which the intended victim was killed and two bystanders received nonfatal injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 1110. The Supreme Court of California declined to apply the theory of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d in considering whether the evidence' was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s convictions of attempted first-degree murder of the bystanders. <em>Id. </em>The California court held that \u201cto be guilty of attempted murder, the defendant must intend to kill the alleged victim, not someone else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117. In other words, \u201c[sjomeone who intends to kill only one person and attempts unsuccessfully to do so, is guilty of attempted murder of the intended victim, but not the others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Drawing from this Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Ford, </em>the California court examined the potential pitfalls of applying the doctrine to \u201cinchoate crimes,\u201d including the fact that attempted murder does not require a physical injury to the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1117\u2014 18 (citing <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 715-16, 625 A.2d at 1000). The court wondered, therefore, how a court or prosecuting authority might determine \u201cto whom the defendant\u2019s intent should be transferred\u201d when a bystander suffers no physical injury. <em>Id. </em>at 1117. The court stated that \u201c[tjhis concern is real\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">The world contains many people a murderous assailant does not intend to kill. Obviously, intent to kill one person cannot transfer to the entire world. But how can a jury rationally decide which of many persons the defendant did not intend to kill were attempted murder victims on a transferred intent theory? To how many unintended persons can an intent to kill be transferred? Just as acts with implied malice constitute murder of anyone actually killed, but not attempted murder of others, so, too, acts with the intent to kill one person constitute murder of anyone actually killed, but not attempted murder of others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1118. The <em>Bland </em>court also recognized that its limit on \u201ctransferred intent\u201d did not preclude the prosecution of the defendant for the injury caused to the unintended victim. For example, in California, the defendant \u201cmight be guilty of crimes such as assault with a deadly weapon or firing at an occupied vehicle,\u201d and the prosecution can use the theory of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d to establish a specific intent with respect to a bystander. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The most compelling reason why we reject the doctrine of transferred intent as applied to crimes of attempt is that it is not necessary to make \u201ca whole crime out of two halves by joining the intent as to one victim with the harm caused to another victim,\u201d the purpose for which it was conceived. <em>Ford, </em>330 Md. at 712, 625 A.2d at 998. When the unintended victim has not suffered a fatal injury, the defendant already has committed a completed crime against the intended victim, and the seriousness of that crime is as great as if the intent were transferred to the unintended victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Further, although not in this case, a defendant may be convicted of a crime against an unintended victim with the use of \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d and without the use of \u201ctransferred intent.\u201d Such a defendant also may be convicted of criminal battery, and as Judge Moylan suggested in <em>Harvey v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 401, 430, 681 A.2d 628, 643 (1996), \u201cthe crime of reckless endangerment is also available to pick up much of the slack and to make resort to the transferred intent doctrine less compelling.\u201d There is little, if any, utility in extending the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d to inchoate crimes such as attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">.

Harrison did not challenge this holding in his petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. Harrison phrased his two questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">1. Is an intent to kill the named victim a factual and legal prerequisite to a conviction of attempted murder even where the theoiy is one of \"concurrent\u201d intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">2. May a conviction for attempted second-degree murder of an unintended victim be sustained on the theory that stipulated facts could support a finding of concurrent intent to kill the intended and unintended victims where the Statement of Facts in support of the conviction states that the defendant shot the victim accidentally, while aiming at another?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. The question of evidentiary sufficiency is properly before us. After the prosecutor narrated the statement of agreed facts, Harrison made a generalized motion for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied. Had his case been tried before a jury, in order to preserve issues of evidentiary sufficiency on appeal, Harrison would have had to make his motion by \"stat[ing] with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-324(a); <em>Tull v. State, </em>230 Md. 152, 186 A.2d 205 (1962); <em>Fraidin v.

Maryland Rule 8-131(c) requires that, \u201c[wjhen an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(c). Thus, where a defendant has been convicted in a nonjury trial, preserving the issue of evidentiary sufficiency does not depend on a motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See Nicholson v. State, </em>229 Md. 123, 125, 182 A.2d 31, 32 (1962) (\"The trial was before the court; consequently it was not necessary to make a motion for a judgment of acquittal in order to preserve the right to full appellate review.\u201d). This is so even when, as in the instant case, the State has proceeded on an agreed statement of facts. <em>See Barnes v.

Harrison was not charged with the crime of attempted murder against Valentine, Harrison's primary target, and the State has not argued that Harrison's conviction should be sustained on that basis.

It is not disputed that petitioner fired six shots from his .38 caliber handgun at a person known as Valentine, missed him and instead struck a bystander, James Cook. Attempted second degree murder requires that petitioner had a specific intent to kill. Although petitioner did not in fact have a specific intent to kill Cook, the State did prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a specific intent to kill Valentine. I believe that intent is \u201ctransferred\u201d to Cook, and the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict under the doctrine of transferred intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In my view, the doctrine of transferred intent is applicable to attempted murder cases where the unintended victim is injured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Poe v.

As these cases reason, so long as there is evidence of an intent to kill, it makes no difference that someone other than the intended victim was killed or injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The majority employs the lack of necessity argument in rejecting the doctrine of transferred intent in the context of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>attempt, stating that \u201c[t]he most compelling reason why we reject the doctrine of transferred intent as applied to crimes of attempt is that it is not necessary to make \u2018a whole crime out of two halves by joining the intent as to one victim with the harm caused to another victim.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 508 (citations omitted). The majority reasons that \u201c[w]hen the unintended victim has not suffered a fatal injury, the defendant already has committed a completed crime against the intended victim, and the seriousness of that crime is as great as if the intent were transferred to the unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508. In addition, rationalizing that there is little utility in \u201cextending\u201d the doctrine of transferred intent, the majority concludes that although not in this case, \u201cconcurrent intent\u201d rather than transferred intent will apply to defendants who commit crimes against unintended victims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The majority\u2019s reasoning is incomplete and flawed. First, the majority adds an artificial requirement of <em>death </em>of the unintended victim to the transferred intent doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, Maryland has repudiated the reasoning that simply because the defendant has committed a <em>completed </em>crime against the intended victim the doctrine does not apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the notion that the doctrine is unnecessary because concurrent intent or other crimes are available to the State is wrong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>particularly in this case. Most likely, because concurrent intent was not applicable, and transferred intent does not apply, petitioner will escape punishment for the harm he inflicted upon Mr. Cook.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is evident in the mandate, as the current case was not remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Transferred intent is a common law doctrine which has long been a part of the law in Maryland. <em>See State v. Wilson, </em>313 Md. 600, 546 A.2d 1041 (1988); <em>Gladden v. State, </em>273 Md. 383, 330 A.2d 176 (1974). The classic application, or the so-called standard application, of transferred intent is where the defendant, <em>A </em>intends to kill <em>B, </em>shoots but misses, and kills <em>C. </em>In that situation, \u201cthe state of mind which one has when about to commit a crime upon one person is considered by law to exist and to be equally applicable although the intended act affects another person.\u201d <em>Gladden, </em>273 Md. at 404, 330 A.2d at 188. Judge O\u2019Donnell, writing for the Court in <em>Gladden, </em>explained further that \u201cif one intends injury to the person of another under circumstances in which such a mental element consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tutes <em>mens rea, </em>and in the effort to accomplish this end he inflicts harm upon a person other than the one intended, he is guilty of the same kind of crime as if his aim had been more accurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 3.12(d) (1986, 2003 Supp.) (explaining transferred intent to mean that \u201cwhere <em>A </em>aims at <em>B </em>but misses, hitting C \u2014 it is the view of the criminal law that <em>A </em>is just as guilty as if his aim had been accurate. Thus where <em>A </em>aims at <em>B </em>with a murderous intent to kill, but because of a bad aim he hits and kills <em>C, A </em>is uniformly held guilty of the murder of <em>C </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">After today\u2019s decision, the doctrine of transferred intent will still be a part of Maryland law, albeit more limited in its application. The question arises in this case as to whether transferred intent is applicable when <em>C </em>does not die but is injured. There is an ongoing debate around the country, within the courts and commentators, as to the applicability of the doctrine of transferred intent. Commentators and courts have described the doctrine as \u201cdefective,\u201d a \u201ccurious survival of the antique law,\u201d and one having no proper place in the criminal law. <em>See </em>Anthony M. Dillof, <em>Transferred Intent: An Inquiry into the Nature of Criminal Culpability, </em>1 Buff.Crim. L.Rev. 501, 502-03 (1998). Despite the views of detractors, a \u201croughly equal number of commentators ... have approved of the doctrine and its result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In my view, the doctrine of transferred intent should apply to the crime of attempted murder, for example, when a person, <em>A </em>intentionally shoots a gun at <em>B, </em>intending to kill <em>B, </em>and because of bad aim or luck, hits but does not kill, or even misses, <em>B, </em>and strikes and injures <em>C. See Poe, </em>341 Md. at 539, 671 A.2d at 509 (Raker J., concurring, joined by Rodowsky and Karwacki, J.J.). <em>A </em>should not escape punishment for the act committed against <em>C </em>simply because that person had bad aim or good luck. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">This Court addressed the question of whether transferred intent applies to attempted murder in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>and, noting specifically the split in jurisdictions around the country as to the applicability of transferred intent, we \u201calign[ed] ourselves with the numerous jurisdictions which have applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the transferred intent doctrine <em>to </em>specific intent crimes including attempted murder.\u201d 313 Md. at 607, 546 A.2d at 1044. In <em>Wilson, </em>the intended target, Brown, was not harmed physically, and the unintended victim, Kent, was struck with the bullets but did not die. <em>See id. </em>at 601-02, 546 A.2d at 1042. The defendant was charged with attempted murder of both the intended target and the unintended target. <em>See id. </em>at 602, 546 A.2d at 1042. We made clear that the doctrine of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d was not limited to homicide cases but extends to all situations where a defendant\u2019s intended act \u201c \u2018affects\u2019 or \u2018inflicts harm upon\u2019 an unintended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 546 A.2d at 1043 (citations omitted). The Court reasoned that a necessary element of murder is malice and that inasmuch as the State proved the malice element by establishing Wilson\u2019s specific intent to kill Brown, Wilson would have been guilty of premeditated murder had the unintended victim Kent died. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the elements of attempted murder were satisfied when Kent survived. <em>Wilson, </em>in my view, was decided and reasoned correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Subsequent to <em>Wilson, </em>the doctrine of transferred intent took a sharp and sudden turn, beginning with the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. 682, 625 A.2d 984 (1993), and resulting in the conclusion today. The majority attempts to recount the life and limitations of the doctrine of transferred intent in Maryland, but does so in a selective manner. The Court omits the shift in reasoning from <em>Ford </em>to <em>Poe, </em>a change which has been described as \u201cresult-oriented.\u201d <em>See </em>Note, <em>Confusing the Doctrine of Transferred Intent, </em>56 Md. L.Rev. 744, 744 (1997). <em>See also, </em>Mitchell Keiter, <em>With Malice Toward All: The Increased Lethality of Violence Reshapes Transferred Intent and Attempted Murder Law, </em>38 U.S.F. L.Rev. 261, 280 (2004) (discussing <em>Ford, </em>noting that \u201c[t]he <em>Ford </em>court faced the dual task of repudiating the reasoning of a precedent that had authorized replicated intent for attempted murder, while preserving that case\u2019s result of multiple attempted murder convictions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The doctrine of transferred intent in Maryland was set out, and judicially embraced, in <em>Gladden. </em>The Court looked at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cclassic\u201d doctrine of transferred intent, and held that when an individual Mils one person but actually intended to Mil another, transferred intent applies. The <em>Gladden </em>Court pointed out that under the common law, the doctrine was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfG\">\u201cSir William Blackstone, in 4 Commentaries on the Laws of England (Cooley, 3d ed., 1884), at 201 stated the common law rule to be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u2018Thus if one shoots at A and misses <em>him, </em>but Mils B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case where one lays poison for A; and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him; this is likewise murder.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">273 Md. at 391-92, 330 A.2d at 181. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cIn Clark and Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes \u00a7 10.06 (6th ed., 1958), at 578, the rule is stated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar9\">\u2018Whenever an accountable man kills another intentionally, he is guilty of murder with express malice unless the Mlling is justifiable or excusable, or unless there are such circumstances of provocation as will reduce the homicide to manslaughter. This principle is applied when a man kills one person when he intended to kill another. For example, if a man shoots at one person with intent to kill him, and unintentionally kills another, or sets poison for one person and another drinks it and dies, it is murder with express malice of the person killed, though he is a friend.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">Although admittedly the doctrine is of \u2018ancient vintage,\u2019 we do not agree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that under modern statutory classifications it is a \u2018curious survival of the antique law\u2019 requiring its rejection. It has lost none of its patina by its application over the centuries down unto modern times; its viability is recognized by its current acceptance and application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 330 A.2d at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\"><em>State v. Wilson </em>followed, and applied <em>Gladden. </em>The <em>Wilson </em>Court determined that the doctrine of transferred intent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>not limited solely to completed homicides. Following a review of public policy, history, and the applicability of <em>stare decisis, </em>the Court held that transferred intent applies to the crime of attempted murder. <em>See Wilson, </em>313 Md. at 609, 546 A.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Next came <em>Ford, </em>the basis of the majority\u2019s holding. In my view, the <em>Ford </em>opinion, as it relates to transferred intent, is no longer, if it ever was, of persuasive value. In that case, a bare majority of the Court, in pure <em>dicta, </em>and in what the Court conceded was a \u201csomewhat collateral issue,\u201d <em>Ford v. State, </em>330 Md. at 708, 625 A.2d at 996, announced that \u201c[wjhere the crime intended has <em>actually been committed </em>against the intended victim, transferred intent is unnecessary and should not be applied to acts against unintended victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 625 A.2d at 998 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that transferred intent did not apply to attempted murder, noting, however, that the conclusion was at odds with the recent holding of <em>State v. Wilson. See id. </em>at 713, 625 A.2d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Notably, Judge Chasanow, writing for the majority, did not limit the gratuitous discussion to the applicability of transferred intent to completed homicides, but went on to state that transferred intent did not apply where the crime against the intended victim was \u201ccomplete.\u201d The Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">\u201cThe underlying rationale for the doctrine also suggests that transferred intent should apply only when, without the doctrine, the defendant could not be convicted of the crime at issue because the mental and physical elements do not concur as to either the intended or the actual victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 711, 625 A.2d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Three judges of the Court disagreed with this reasoning. Judge McAuliffe, joined by Judges Rodowsky and Karwaeki, concurred in the result, yet declined to join the court\u2019s <em>dicta </em>pertaining to transferred intent. In particular, Judge McAuliffe, characterizing the Court\u2019s limitation of the doctrine as unnecessary and ill-advised, rejected the majority\u2019s statement that the doctrine of transferred intent could not be applied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cwhere the crime intended has actually been committed against the intended victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 625 A.2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Under the <em>Ford </em>rationale, where the intended and unintended victims died, the doctrine of transferred intent is not applicable because the intended crime was completed. <em>Ford </em>relied heavily on <em>People v. Birreuta, </em>162 Cal.App.3d 454, 208 Cal.Rptr. 635 (1984), the California intermediate appellate court opinion which has since been repudiated in California, as well as every other court in the country considering the issue. <em>See People v. Bland, </em>28 Cal.4th 313, 121 Cal.Rptr.2d 546, 48 P.3d 1107, 1113-1115 (2002) (noting that the conclusion in <em>Birreuta </em>was incorrect, disapproving <em>People v. Birreuta </em>to the extent it holds that intent to kill does not transfer to an unintended homicide victim even if the intended target is killed, and holding that intent to kill transfers to an unintended homicide victim even if the intended person is killed); <em>State v. Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 630 A.2d 593, 598-599 (1993) (expressly disagreeing with Birreuta). Even Maryland has since rejected this limitation on the doctrine. <em>Compare Ford </em>with <em>Poe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The next significant case in Maryland to address transferred intent was <em>Poe v. State. </em>Again, in pure <em>dicta, </em>rejecting transferred intent to attempted murder, Judge Chasanow, writing for the majority, explained, and without admitting as much, backpedaled from the <em>Ford </em>rationale that transferred intent would apply only to cases where the intended crime was not completed. Instead, calling <em>Poe </em>\u201ca classic case of transferred intent,\u201d 341 Md. at 529, 671 A.2d at 503, the majority somehow reasoned that the doctrine <em>did </em>apply, even though the crime of attempted murder was complete when Poe fired the gun at Ms. Poe, hitting, but failing to kill her. <em>See id. </em>at 528-29, 671 A.2d at 503. Thus, when a defendant, intending to kill one person, shoots and wounds that person, but the bullet passes through the intended victim and kills an unintended victim, the doctrine is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In a student note, <em>Poe v. State: The Court of Appeals of Maryland Limits the Applicability of the Doctrine of Trans</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>ferred Intent, </em>27 U. Balt. L.Rev. 167 (1997), the author, Daniel J. Curry, traces the doctrine of transferred intent in Maryland. He concludes that \u201ca defendant who attempts to kill their intended victim but instead injures an unintended victim should be held liable under transferred intent for attempted murder of the unintended, injured victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. Discussing the majority and concurring opinions in <em>Poe, </em>the perceptive author concluded that \u201cJudge Raker\u2019s reasoning is more sound than the majority\u2019s because it does not preclude the use of the doctrine in attempted murder prosecutions. Judge Raker\u2019s clarification was in tune with the elements of the doctrine as it is commonly applied.\u201d Id. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">I reiterate my predication in <em>Poe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cIf the majority\u2019s opinion is interpreted to preclude any use of the doctrine of transferred intent in attempted murder prosecutions, the effect of the decision will be to substantially increase the difficulty of prosecuting criminals for the harm inflicted on innocent bystanders. ... Without transferred intent, the State will be required to offer separate proof of intent for each victim, e.g., by demonstrating \u2018depraved heart [or concurrent intent].\u2019 While firing a \u2018hail of bullets\u2019 at a person on a busy street may be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a depraved heart, numerous factual situations may arise where it will be difficult to demonstrate recklessness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">341 Md. at 539-40, 671 A.2d at 509. The instant case demonstrates just such a situation. Today\u2019s ruling has rewarded petitioner for his bad aim, and will likely result in similar rewards for others in the future.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. The theory underlying the doctrine of transferred intent was well stated in the case of <em>People v. Scott, </em>14 Cal.4th 544, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 178, 927 P.2d 288 (1996), explaining that intent is not <em>actually </em>transferred. The California Supreme Court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\"The legal fiction of transferring a defendant\u2019s intent helps illustrate why, as a theoretical matter, a defendant can be convicted of murder when she did not intend to kill the person <em>actually killed. </em>The transferred intent doctrine does not, however, denote an actual \u2018transfer\u2019 of \u2018intent\u2019 from the intended victim to the unintended victim. Rather, as applied here, it connotes a <em>policy </em>\u2014 that a defendant who shoots at an intended victim with intent to kill but misses and hits a bystander instead should be subject to the same criminal liability that would have been imposed had he hit his intended mark. It is the policy underlying the doctrine, rather than its literal meaning, that compels the conclusion that a transferred intent instruction was properly given in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 292 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">. Today the Court criticizes the use of transferred intent in attempted murder by stating that the charge does not require the victim to suffer physical injury, and thus, the doctrine could result in an endless number of attempted murder charges against a defendant. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 507-08. This is not a necessary conclusion. As I have previously noted, \"the correct interpretation is that transferred intent should not apply to attempted murder if no one is injured.\u201d <em>Poe v.

Despite the absence of required elements of the definition, an actor may be held liable for the offense if a doctrine serves to impute the absent elements. Such a doctrine does not alter the definition of an offense but rather provides an alternative means of establishing the required elements, or at least an alternative means of treating the defendant <em>as if </em>the required elements were satisfied. For the most part, the principles underlying imputation reflect concerns beyond those of the offense at hand. A single doctrine of imputation may apply to a range of offenses or to all offenses. As a group, instances of imputed liability play as significant a role in criminal law theory as do general defenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 675.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
