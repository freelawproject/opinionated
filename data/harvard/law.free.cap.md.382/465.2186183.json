Watson, the respondent, violated Rules 1.4, Communication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.15, Safekeeping Property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 8.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Misconduct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812.

The alleged violations were committed during the course of the respondent\u2019s representation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Darrill Winder and his minor children in their personal injury claims arising out of a motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">We referred the case to the Honorable M. Brooke Murdock, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, for hearing. <em>See </em>Rule 16-757. Although served with process, the respondent did not file an answer, prompting the entry of an order of default. Following a hearing on the merits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at which the respondent neither appeared, nor participated and in which testimony was elicited and exhibits considered from the petitioner, the hearing court made findings of fact, <em>see </em>Rule 16-757(c),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and drew conclusions of law, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\n<em>\u201cFindings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201cBarry K. Watson (hereinafter \u2018the Respondent\u2019) was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 23, 1987. Throughout the period of the representation and events which are the subject of these findings, the Respondent maintained an office for the practice of law as a sole practitioner in Baltimore City.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cIn July 2001, the Respondent assumed representation of Darrill Winder and Mr. Winder\u2019s three minor children, Quashawn, Shacora and Tyneshia, (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u2018the Winders\u2019), in connection with their personal injury claims arising from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on August 9, 2000. The Winders originally had been represented by the law firm of Hassan, Hassan &amp; Tuchman, P.A. (\u2018the Hassan firm\u2019). Prior to July 2001, the Hassan firm had received Personal Injury Protection (PIP) payments on behalf of each of the Winders and deposited such funds for safekeeping in the firm\u2019s attorney escrow account. After being advised in July 2001 that the Winders had retained the Respondent as their new attorney, the Hassan firm transferred the escrowed PIP funds to the Respondent by the issuance of four checks drawn on the Hassan firm\u2019s attorney escrow account. Each of the checks was made payable to \u2018Barry Watson Escrow Account.\u2019 The four checks were issued in the following amounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Check No. Amount For (Client)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">37852 $869.56 Quashawn Winder</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">37853 893.23 Tyneshia Winder</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">37854 682.19 Darrill Winder</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">37855 877.04 Shacora Winder</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u201cOn or about July 17, 2001, the Respondent picked up the four checks from the Hassan firm along with the representation files for the Winders. In July 2001 and at all times thereafter, the Respondent maintained no attorney trust or escrow account in which client funds could be appropriately safeguarded. Shortly after obtaining the four escrow account checks issued by the Hassan firm, the Respondent cashed those checks or deposited the checks in a personal bank account. In either case, the Respondent did not deposit and safeguard the funds as trust money entrusted to him to hold for the benefit of the Winders or another beneficial owner. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-301(d). The Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>knowingly and willfully appropriated the Winders\u2019 PIP monies totaling $3,322.02 for his personal use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u201cAs of July 2001, the Respondent commenced representation of the Winders with respect to their claims against the allegedly negligent third party or parties responsible for their injuries. In October 2001, the Respondent agreed to negotiated settlements of the Winders\u2019 claims. The claims were settled jointly with Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) and Safeco Insurance Company, which insured the two vehicles involved in the accident. The Winders had been passengers in the vehicle insured by MAIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u201cIn October 2001, the Respondent received a total of eight settlement checks, four issued by each insurance carrier. Each of the four MAIF checks was issued October 18, 2001 and was made payable jointly to the claimant and the Respondent, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Check No. Amount Claimant</p>\n<p id=\"Act\">H10695 $1,500.00 Darrill Winder</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">H10696 750.00 Tyneshia Winder *</p>\n<p id=\"A9W\">H10697 1,000.00 Shacom Winder *</p>\n<p id=\"A1e6\">H10698 750.00 Quashawn Winder *</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">* (The checks issued for the three minors were made payable jointly to Dana Taylor, as parent and/or guardian of each child, and Barry K. Watson, Atty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">\u201cEach of the four Safeco checks was issued [on] October 23, 2001 and was made payable to the claimant \u2018c/o Barry (or Barry Keith) Watson,\u2019 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">Check No. Amount Claimant</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\">0668152 $1,500.00 Darrill Winder</p>\n<p id=\"ALQ\">0668153 750.00 Tyneshia Winder</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">0668154 1,000.00 Sharma Winder</p>\n<p id=\"Anfe\">0668155 750.00 Quashawn Winder</p>\n<p id=\"b501-27\">\u201cThe combined total amount of the eight settlement checks was $8,000.00. The Respondent forged the endorsements of his clients in order to negotiate all eight checks and retained all of the proceeds therefrom for himself. The Respondent did not deposit and safeguard the Winders\u2019 settlement funds as trust money. He knowingly and willfully appropriated such funds for his personal use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cFor a considerable period of time following the settlements, extending into mid-2002, the Respondent tried to conceal his actions by misrepresenting to Darrill Winder and Mr. Winder\u2019s wife, Dana Winder (a/k/a Dana Taylor), that he had not received any of the settlement checks. In September 2002, the Respondent turned over the Winders\u2019 representation files to Darrill and Dana Winder and admitted to cashing the insurance settlement checks issued by MAIF and Safeco.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u201cThe Respondent has not repaid any of the misappropriated PIP monies and settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u201cThis court concludes that the Respondent, upon being retained in July 2001 to represent Darrill Winder and Mr. Winder\u2019s three minor children, Quashawn, Shacora and Tyneshia, and while representing them thereafter, engaged in professional misconduct as defined in Maryland Rule 16-701(i) and Rule 8.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC), as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812. The Respondent failed to keep the clients reasonably informed about the status of the representation and in fact knowingly misled Mr. and Mrs. Winder about the status in order to conceal his misappropriation/theft of client funds. The Respondent\u2019s actions violated the communication requirements of MRPC 1.4, as well as the prohibition against engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, MRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u201cBy receiving and accepting funds for the benefit of clients or third persons when he did not maintain an attorney trust account for the deposit of such funds, the Respondent violated the following Maryland Rules set forth in Title 16, Chapter 600:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cRule 16-603 Duty to Maintain Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cAn attorney or the attorney\u2019s law firm shall maintain one or more attorney trust accounts for the deposit of funds received from any source for the intended benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>clients or third persons. The account or accounts shall be maintained in this State, in the District of Columbia, or in a state contiguous to this State, and shall be with an approved financial institution. Unless an attorney maintains such an account, or is a member of or employed by a law firm that maintains such an account, an attorney may not receive and accept funds as an attorney from any source intended in whole or in part for the benefit of a client or third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\u201cRule 16-604 Trust Account \u2014 Required Deposits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise permitted by rule or other law, all funds, including cash, received and accepted by an attorney or law firm in this State from a client or third person to be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person, unless received as payment of fees owed the attorney by the client or in reimbursement for expenses properly advanced on behalf of the client, shall be deposited in an attorney trust account in an approved financial institution. This Rule does not apply to an instrument received by an attorney or law firm that is made payable solely to a client or third person and is transmitted directly to the client or third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u201cThe Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a) by not holding the Winders\u2019 PIP monies and settlement funds separate from his own property and by not otherwise safeguarding the Winders\u2019 client funds. He violated MRPC 1.15(b) by faffing to notify his clients upon receiving funds in which they had an interest, by failing to deliver to the clients funds to which they were entitled and by not rendering a full accounting of all client funds he obtained as the Winders\u2019 attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u201cThe Respondent knowingly and willfully misused trust money entrusted to him for the benefit of the Winders. Such conduct violated \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. The Respondent engaged in criminal acts reflecting adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, in violation of MRPC 8.4(b). The Respondent\u2019s criminal acts include, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>are not necessarily limited to, theft (Md.Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 7-104), fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary (\u00a7 7-113) and counterfeiting of private instruments and documents (\u00a7 8-601). The Respondent\u2019s criminal activities also establish violations of MRPC 8.4(c) &amp; (d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Neither the petitioner nor the respondent filed exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing court. As we have seen, the respondent did not participate in these proceedings. The petitioner has filed Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation for Sanction, in which it urges the respondent\u2019s disbarment. In support of that recommendation, it references the hearing court\u2019s finding that the respondent \u201cmisappropriated funds he obtained in his capacity as an attorney entrusted with clients\u2019 personal injury settlement checks,\u201d as well as personal injury protection funds transferred to him by prior counsel, forging the clients\u2019 endorsements to accomplish that result, and relies on <em>Attorney Griev.

Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 668, 846 A.2d 428, 432 (2004); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hayes, </em>367 Md. 504, 510, 789 A.2d 119, 123 (2002); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991). Moreover, our application of the general rule has been consistent: \u201cdisbarment will inevitably follow any unmitigated misappropriation of client, or any third party\u2019s funds[.j\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hayes, </em>367 Md. 504, 512-13, 789 A.2d 119, 124 (2002), and the cases therein cited. This is in line with the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1986). Standard 5.11 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cDisbarment is generally appropriate when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c(a) a lawyer engages in serious criminal conduct a necessary element of which includes intentional interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, or theft; or the sale, distribution or importation of controlled substances; or the intentional killing of another; or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>attempt or conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit any of these offenses; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201c(b) a lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Our cases also are clear that \u201cthe burden is on the respondent to demonstrate \u2014 in Maryland, the burden of establishing factual matters in a defense must be carried by a \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 <em>[Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.] Powell, </em>328 Md. [276,] 288, 614 A.2d [102,] 109 [(1992)]; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

As we have seen, the respondent has made no submission and, indeed, has not participated at all in these proceedings. Consequently, the respondent certainly has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a less severe sanction than that recommended should be imposed in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Given the hearing court\u2019s findings, the only appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST BARRY K.
