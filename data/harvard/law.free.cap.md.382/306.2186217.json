Although many states, such as California in 1979, preceded Maryland in recognizing the use of DRRAs or their equivalents, our Legislature lingered until 1995 before enacting \u00a7 13.01 (\u201cDevelopment Rights and Responsibilities Agreements\u201d) of Article 66B (\u201cLand Use\u201d) of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The legislation seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>be the result of the balancing of developers\u2019 and property owners\u2019 desires for a larger measure of certainty than that offered by proceeding to market through the traditional development processes, while risking the monetary investment to develop their property, against local governments\u2019 desire to receive greater public benefits on a more predictable schedule than might otherwise be attainable through the traditional processes. <em>See generally, </em>Brad K. Schwartz, <em>Development Agreements: Contracting for Vested Rights, </em>28 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev 719 (2001); David L. Callies and Julie A. Tappendorf, <em>Unconstitutional Land Development Conditions and The Development Agreement Solution: Bargaining For Public Facilities After Nollan and Dolan, </em>51 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 663 (2001); John J. Delaney, <em>Development Agreements: The Road From Prohibition to \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal!,\u201d </em>25 Urb. Law. 49 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">As explained in the amicus brief of the National Association of Home Builders filed in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201c[A] central purpose of the development agreement is to vest development rights in the landowner or developer in exchange for the dedication and funding of public facilities. A vested right allows development of a proposed use of land to proceed even when subsequent changes in zoning regulations would render the proposed use impermissible....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cDevelopment agreements are public contracts between a municipality and a property owner or developer, and are executed pursuant to state law as part of the development approval process. Such agreements can be executed in conjunction with the rezoning of land, at a post-zoning stage of the development review process (such as subdivision or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>site plan review), or at the time of permit approval. Aside from developers and builders, [local governments] find these agreements advantageous as sources of funding for major infrastructure, and as an assurance for the timely provision of needed public facilities and amenities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Amicus brief at <em>2-4 </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The present case does not call for us to scrutinize the validity of \u00a7 13.01 of Article 66B or even of the execution of the particular DRRA that instigated the litigation. Rather, this appeal touches upon an important, but tangential threshold issue, which necessitates that we determine the correct path to be followed by a person or entity, not a party to a DRRA, but who feels aggrieved by the execution of the agreement, in obtaining scrutiny of the legal bona fides of the DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">On 17 September 2002, a DRRA was entered into by K. Hovnanian at Kent Island, L.L.C., (\u201cHovnanian\u201d) and the County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County (\u201cthe County Commissioners\u201d). Shortly thereafter, the Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation Association, Inc., and seven individual plaintiffs (collectively \u201cthe Conservation Association\u201d) filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, naming Hovnanian and the Commissioners as defendants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to the effect that the DRRA was invalid. In response, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss urging that the Conservation Association failed to exhaust available, exclusive administrative remedies before seeking judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The Circuit Court entered judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor on 25 February 2003, preeminently holding in its declaratory judgment that the Conservation Association failed to follow the statutory procedure for appeals of administrative decisions to the Board of Appeals for Queen Anne\u2019s County. The result was dismissal of the Complaint because the Conservation Association, having missed the deadline for noting such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>an administrative appeal, could not now perfect one. The Conservation Association appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We, on our initiative and before the appeal could be decided in the intermediate appellate court, issued a writ of certiorari to determine whether the Circuit Court properly dismissed the Complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief based on the Conservation Association\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Queen Ann\u2019s Conservation v. County Commissioners, </em>379 Md. 224, 841 A.2d 339 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Appellants, the Conservation Association, present the following two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">I. Where Queen Anne\u2019s County has no administrative remedy available to challenge a developer\u2019s rights and responsibilities agreement by appeal to the Queen Anne\u2019s County Board of Appeals, is such a challenge properly brought in a declaratory action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">II. Is an administrative appeal from a developer\u2019s rights and responsibilities agreement mandated by Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08, which applies to \u201czoning actions\u201d of a local legislative body?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">We hold that Appellants, in pursuing a challenge to the execution of the DRRA in this case, were first required to file an appeal to the Board of Appeals and obtain a final administrative decision prior to seeking judicial review in the Circuit Court. Therefore, we shall affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment dismissing this action for Appellants\u2019 failure to exhaust an available and exclusive administrative remedy. Accordingly, we need not address the second question raised by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Hovnanian is the developer of a proposed \u201cactive adult, age-restricted community\u201d on Kent Island in Queen Anne\u2019s County. The 560-acre community is to be known as Four Seasons at Kent Island (\u201cFour Seasons\u201d) and would consist of 1,350 residential units, an assisted living facility, and recreational uses. The Four Seasons property is zoned, in the vernacular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of the Queen Anne County zoning ordinance, Stevensville Master Planned Development Zone and Chester Master Planned Development Zone. The property is identified in both the Chester Community Plan of 1997 and the Stevensville Community Plan of 1998 as a \u201cPlanned Growth Area\u201d and was \u201cpre-mapped\u201d to receive a Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Growth Allocation. The uses sought by Hovnanian were permitted ones generally under the existing zoning, but subject to subdivision and site plan review and approval processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A. Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Hovnanian submitted an application to the Queen Anne\u2019s County Planning Commission (the Planning Commission) for Concept/Sketch Plan approval for Four Seasons in June 1999. The application was reviewed by Queen Anne\u2019s County planning and public work officials, Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission staff, and various other State and County departments and agencies. On 26 April 2000, the Planning Commission approved the Concept/Sketch Plan. Hovnanian next filed a petition with the County Commissioners requesting Growth Allocation approval to change the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Land Use Designations on the property. The petition requested that roughly 293.25 acres be redesignated from the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area designation of Resource Conservation Area to Intense Development Area, and roughly 79.55 acres be redesignated from Limited Development Area to Intense Development Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Following a public hearing before it on 13 July 2000, the Planning Commission recommended that the County Commissioners approve Hovnanian\u2019s request for Growth Allocation, subject to certain conditions, one of which was that Hovnanian enter into a DRRA with the County before final plan approval. On 6 December 2000, after yet another public hearing, the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission endorsed the Petition for Growth Allocation, also with certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The County Commissioners conducted another public hearing on 27 February 2001. As a result, the County Commissioners made substantial and detailed findings of fact concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ing Hovnanian\u2019s request for Growth Allocation. On 10 April 2001, the County Commissioners approved the redesignation of the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Land Use Designations of the Four Seasons property, subject to conditions, including the execution of a DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">On 14 June 2001, the Planning Commission reviewed and approved an amended Concept/Sketch Plan for the Four Seasons, which had been revised to reflect the later conditions imposed by the Planning Commission, the Critical Area Commission, and the County Commissioners during the Growth Allocation process. On 20 August 2001, the County Commissioners adopted ordinances that required a DRRA as a condition of the Growth Allocation approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Ultimately, on 20 May 2002, Hovnanian filed a Petition for a DRRA, pursuant to the enabling legislation in Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Article 66B \u00a7 13.01<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>menting provisions of Queen Anne\u2019s County Code (\u201cQACC\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 18-1301 through 1311.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The draft DRRA was vetted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>through a series of hearings before the Planning Commission and the County Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">On 11 July 2002, the Planning Commission considered the proposed DRRA at a public hearing. At the hearing, the Planning Commission indicated that there were certain technical issues that yet needed to be addressed, but concluded nonetheless that the proposed DRRA was consistent with the 2002 Comprehensive Plan for Queen Anne\u2019s County, as well as the applicable Stevensville and Chester Community Master Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The County Commissioners held a public hearing on the proposed DRRA on 6 August 2002. Following the public hearing, the proposed DRRA was modified based on comments from all the previous hearings. On 17 September 2002, a final DRRA was executed by Hovnanian and the County Commissioners. In pertinent part, the DRRA: (1) established limitations on allowable development, including limitations on density and intensity; (2) established detailed requirements concerning public improvements to be financed by Hovnanian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>including a dedication of parkland, construction of park facilities, purchase of off-site parkland, construction and reconstruction of public roads and paths, and construction of public facilities both on-site and off-site; (3) established timing for water and sewer allocation; (4) required substantial cash payments to the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department and to the County; and (5) froze the laws and regulations governing the use, density or intensity of the development as of the date of the execution of the Agreement for the duration of the Agreement. The DRRA was recorded on 18 September 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">B. Circuit Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Conservation Association filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief with the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County on 8 October 2002, asserting an array of legal defects with regard to the DRRA. The Conservation Association requested a declaration that the DRRA was an illegal contract violative of a prohibition against conditional use zoning; that the DRRA was illegal contract zoning; that the DRRA was violative of constitutional due process because it created preferences for Hovnanian\u2019s project denied to other developers under the law; that the process leading to approval and execution of the DRRA violated the hearing requirements of \u00a7 13.01(j)(2) of Article 66B because certain provisions were inserted in the final draft which did not appear in the earlier versions that were the subject of public hearings; and, that the DRRA violated the County\u2019s existing moratorium on new development and, thus, rendered the moratorium a special law contrary to Article III, \u00a7 33 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Hovnanian and the County Commissioners filed a Motion to Dismiss, under Maryland Rule 2-322, arguing, among other things, that the Conservation Association failed to exhaust available administrative remedies by not appealing to the Board of Appeals for Queen Anne County. After briefing and oral argument on 25 February 2003, the Circuit Court dismissed the Complaint, reasoning preeminently that the Conservation Association should have appealed the County Commissioners\u2019 approval and execution of the DRRA to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>County Board of Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d), as required by Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Article 66B \u00a7 4.07 and QACC \u00a7\u00a7 18-1-174 through 18-1-180. The Board is to \u201chear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative officer in the enforcement of [Art. 66B] or of any ordinance adopted under this article.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Art. 66B \u00a7 4.07(d)(1). Similarly, QACC \u00a7 18-l-175(a) provides that \u201cthe Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that ... there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland or this subtitle....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Circuit Court concluded that, when the County Commissioners approved and executed the DRRA, it acted collectively as an \u201cadministrative officer,\u201d i.e., as the \u201cpublic principal\u201d contemplated in the DRRA enabling legislation, defined as \u201cthe governmental entity of a jurisdiction that has been granted the authority to enter agreements under ... this section.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B \u00a7 13.01(a)(4). The administrative process of appealing to the Board, therefore, was available to the Conservation Association and a necessary step in the process of seeking redress on its claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Circuit Court also considered Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08, which provides for immediate judicial review by a circuit court of a \u201czoning action of a local legislative body.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B \u00a7 4.08(a)(1). The court concluded, however, that because the County Commissioners had acted administratively as a statutory \u201cpublic principal\u201d when it executed the DRRA, it did not act as a \u201clocal legislative body,\u201d a prerequisite to immediate judicial review under Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Alternatively, it seems, the court also concluded that \u201cif no distinction is made between the exercise of the county\u2019s powers as a governing body and its powers as public principal, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>it is viewed as \u2018a local legislative body\u2019 in both instances, the result would be direct review by this Court under \u00a7 4.08.\u201d In other words, Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01, in the Circuit Court\u2019s view, might countenance different methods of review. In either event, however, because the Conservation Association sought neither an administrative appeal to the Board of Appeals nor judicial review pursuant to Maryland Rules 7-201 through 7-209, dismissal of the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court in dismissing this case for Appellants\u2019 failure to exhaust their available administrative remedies. The Conservation Association\u2019s proper recourse in the present case was an administrative appeal to the Board of Appeals under Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07 and, if aggrieved by the Board of Appeals\u2019s final action, a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">As alluded to earlier, Queen Anne\u2019s County is a Code home rule county within the purview of Article 25B of the Maryland Code. Article 66B of the Maryland Code, governing land use, applies to Code counties and requires the legislative bodies of such counties to \u201cprovide for the appointment of a board of appeals.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.07(a)(1). Each board of appeals possesses expressly delegated general powers, including the power to \u201c[h]ear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative officer in the enforcement of this article [i.e., Art. 66B] or of any ordinance adopted under this article.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Miller v. Pinto, </em>305 Md. 396, 403 n. 4, 504 A.2d 1140, 1143 n. 4 (1986), we stated that \u201cthe local legislative body in a code county is required to enact local laws authorizing the county\u2019s board of appeals to exercise the powers provided by \u00a7 4.07(d) of Article 66B.\u201d Accordingly, the County Commissioners enacted an ordinance establishing the Board of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>peals of Queen Anne\u2019s County. QACC \u00a7 18-l-174(a). The establishing ordinance states that \u201cthe Board shall have the powers and duties provided in Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland and in this subtitle.\u201d QACC \u00a7 18 \u2014 1\u2014174(b). Mirroring the delegation of powers in Article 66B, the County Commissioners granted the Board \u201cthe power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that: (i) there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d QACC \u00a7 18 \u2014 1\u2014175(a)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">A. \u201cAdministrative Officer\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The Conservation Association contends that the County Commissioners did not act as an \u201cadministrative official\u201d because its determination of the DRRA\u2019s contents was a fundamentally legislative, rather than an administrative act. In particular, the Conservation Association points to the DRRA\u2019s \u201cdescription of the conditions, terms, restrictions or other requirements determined by the governing body of the local jurisdiction to be necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare,\u201d as being the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the agreement. Md.Code (1957, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(f)(ix). The Conservation Association concludes that a determination by the governing body of the local jurisdiction as to what terms, conditions, restrictions or other requirements are necessary to ensure the public health is the \u201cvery essence\u201d of the legislative function performed by local elected officials. We disagree with this analysis for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">First, the negotiation of terms protective of public health, safety, or welfare, in a contract entered into by a local government body is a discretionary executive act, not a legislative one. <em>See Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., Inc., </em>341 Md. 366, 390, 671 A.2d 1, 12 (1996) (\u201cWhen the executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>branch of the county government, in carrying out the laws and functions of government, enters into a contract, such action constitutes the exercise of executive discretion.\u201d). A DRRA is not an ordinance or legislation as those terms are commonly understood; rather, it is a contract whose purpose is to vest rights under zoning laws and regulations, in consideration of enhanced public benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Second, the \u201cpublic principal,\u201d not the \u201cgoverning body,\u201d has the principal responsibility and authority under the DRRA statute to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Md. Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01. As we shall explain, the County Commissioners was acting as the \u201cpublic principal,\u201d i.e., acting in its executive and administrative capacities, when it approved and executed the DRRA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As a general matter, \u201cit long has been recognized in Maryland that County Commissioners in much of their functioning act as administrators or in an executive capacity.\u201d <em>City of Bowie v. County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>258 Md. 454, 461, 267 A.2d 172, 176 (1970). It is recognized that the protean nature of a board of county commissioners makes it \u201ca unique body\u201d and \u201csomewhat of a hybrid.\u201d <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 133, 142, 481 A.2d 513, 518 (1984). We have noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">County Commissioners are outgrowths of the old Levy Courts originally established by the Act of 1794, Chapter 53. These courts were composed of the Justices of the Peace of the several counties. Their duties were to meet and to adjust the ordinary and necessary expenses of their counties, and to impose an assessment or rate on property to defray county charges. During the course of the succeeding fifty years the name \u201cCounty Commissioners\u201d came into existence. It was first recognized in the underlying law of the state in the Constitution of 1851, Article 7, Section 8. In that constitution it was provided that the commissioners should exercise only such powers and duties as the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ture should from time to time prescribe. When the present Constitution of 1867 was adopted, Article VII, Section I, provided that the power and duties of County Commissioners should be such \u201cas now or may be hereafter prescribed by Law.\u201d Until the constitution of 1867, County Commissioners were simply administrative officers in charge of county finances, and taking care of the public roads. After the constitution of 1867 these powers could be broadened by legislative authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Cox v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel County, </em>181 Md. 428, 433-34, 31 A.2d 179, 182 (1943) (citations omitted). A board of county commissioners functions as the county government and \u201cis the county body politic. In performing its various functions, it exercises legislative, quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial authority, sometimes in combination.\u201d <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>60 Md.App. at 144, 481 A.2d at 518. A board of county commissioners can, for example, control county property and roads, enact county ordinances, enforce building codes, borrow money and issue bonds \u2014 all \u201cin addition to their authority under Art. 66B of the Maryland Code to enact, administer, and enforce zoning and land use laws.\u201d <em>H. Manny Holtz, </em>60 Md.App. at 143, 481 A.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As the present case illustrates, the County Commissioners\u2019 particular exercise of its distinct roles in a given situation determines the appeal rights of those affected. We have held, for example, that a statute that authorized appeal to a circuit court from \u201can assessment made by the county commissioners\u201d did not authorize an appeal from a tax valuation by a board of county commissioners sitting as the county board of control and review. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>116 Md. 220, 226, 81 A. 520, 522 (1911). Although the same individuals composed the two boards, we reasoned that \u201ctheir duties are as separate and distinct in the respective capacities in which they act, as if they were different individuals.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel.

The County Commissioners in Queen Anne\u2019s County exercise the administrative authority of the public principal with respect to DRRAs. QACC \u00a7 18-1302.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01 enables the \u201cpublic principal\u201d to perform a series of essentially administrative tasks that include: \u00a7 13.01(c) (accepting the petition of a property owner or its representatives for a DRRA); \u00a7 13.01(d) (holding a hearing on the petition); \u00a7\u00a7 13.01(b)(2) and 13.01(e) (executing the DRRA after obtaining the local planning commission\u2019s approval); \u00a7 13.01(h) (amending the DRRA, if desired, by mutual consent and after public hearing); \u00a7 13.01(f) (either terminating the DRRA by mutual consent or, \u201cif essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare,\u201d suspending or terminating the DRRA after a public hearing). The Queen Anne\u2019s County Code, tracking Maryland Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01, assigns this same series of administrative functions of the \u201cpublic principal\u201d to the County Commissioners: QACC \u00a7 18-1303 (accepting the petition of a property owner for a DRRA); \u00a7 18-1306 (holding a hearing on the petition); \u00a7\u00a7 18-1302 and 18-1305 (executing the DRRA after obtaining the local planning commission\u2019s approval); \u00a7\u00a7 18-1307(a) (amending the DRRA, if desired, by mutual consent and after public hearing); and \u00a7 18-1308 (either terminating the DRRA by mutual consent or, if \u201cessential to ensure the public health, safety, welfare,\u201d suspending or terminating the DRRA after a public hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Subsection (b) of Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01 divides authority for the creation of DRRAs into two parts. Under Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01(b)(1), the governing body of a county (in the present case the County Commissioners) is given power to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201c(i) By ordinance, establish procedures and requirements for the consideration and execution of agreements; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3tj\">\u201c(ii) Delegate all or part of the authority established under the ordinance to a public principal within the jurisdiction of the governing body.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">These powers of the governing body are circumscribed by statutory direction that the powers of the governing body are \u201cSubject to subsections (c) through (l) of this section.\u201d Under Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01(b)(2), a \u201cpublic principal\u201d is given power to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201c(i) Execute agreements for real property located within the jurisdiction of the governing body with a person having a legal or equitable interest in the real property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3ZI\">\u201c(ii) Include a federal, State, or local government or unit as an additional party to the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The distinction between the legislative powers of the governing body and the executive and administrative powers of the public principal is important. The governing body has no power with respect to the actual operation of the statute. Aside from those matters listed in \u00a7 13.01(b)(2) above, the governing body may only and co-extensively with the public principal, \u201cafter a public hearing ... suspend or terminate an agreement upon determination that such is \u2018essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare.\u2019 \u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 RepLVol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(j). Otherwise, the governing body has no authority with respect to any particular DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The public principal, on the other hand, is defined as \u201cthe governmental entity of a jurisdiction that has been granted the authority to enter agreements under ... this section.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(a)(5). Sole power to negotiate, execute, and enforce agreements lies with the public principal. Petitions to enter into agreements are made to the public principal; and the required public hearing is conducted by the public principal. In any particular case, the only limitations on the public principal\u2019s authority is to follow general procedures adopted by the governing body and a requirement \u2014 unrelated to the governing body or its legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tive functions \u2014 that all agreements be determined by the Planning Commission to be \u201cconsistent with the plan of the jurisdiction.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 RepLVoL), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(e). Further evidence of the distinction, and the autonomy of the public principal, lies in Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01(m) which states, \u201cthis section does not require the adoption of an ordinance by a governing body.\u201d This can only be read as applying to agreements, because an earlier provision, specifically requires that procedures be established \u201cby ordinance.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01(b)(l)(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The County Commissioners in the present case successively wore two different hats and performed a legislative action followed by an administrative/executive action. The test to determine when action is legislative and when executive or administrative is \u201cwhether the [action] is one making a new law \u2014 an enactment of general application prescribing a new plan or policy \u2014 or is one which merely looks to or facilitates the administration, execution or implementation of a law already in force and effect.\u201d <em>City of Bowie, </em>258 Md. at 463-64, 267 A.2d at 177 (citations omitted). Initially, the County Commissioners acted legislatively, as a governing body under Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01(b)(1), by authorizing DRRAs in Queen Anne\u2019s County through enactment of Subtitle 13 of the Land Use and Development Title of the Queen Anne\u2019s County Code. In enacting Subtitle 13, the County Commissioners reserved to themselves the role of the \u201cpublic principal\u201d under Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 13.01, with its concomitant powers to conduct hearings on, enter into, execute, and enforce DRRAs. Subsequently, the County Commissioners signed off on the DRRA in its administrative and executive role as the \u201cpublic principal.\u201d The County Commissioners\u2019 approval was the act of an \u201cadministrative officer\u201d or \u201cadministrative official\u201d under the Maryland and County Codes, respectively, because \u201cthe term \u2018administrative official\u2019 is most reasonably read as embracing whatever administrative mechanism a local jurisdiction in Maryland sets up to enforce its planning and zoning laws and ordinances, including a multi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>member body....\u201d <em>See Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>92 Md.App. 659, 672, 610 A.2d 314, 320 (1992) (holding that the term \u201can administrative official\u201d in \u00a7 4.07(d) includes the Kent County Planning Commission) (citation omitted); <em>Howard Research &amp; Dev. Corp. v. Concerned Citizens for Columbia Concept, </em>297 Md. 357, 366-67, 466 A.2d 31, 35-36 (1983) (holding that a five-member Planning Board constituted the \u201cadministrative official\u201d whose decisions were subject to appeal to the Howard County Board of Appeals); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1957, 2001 RepLVol.), Art. 1, \u00a7 8 (stating the rule of construction when interpreting the Code is that \u201cthe singular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">B. The Scope of the Board\u2019s Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Conservation Association also contends that QACC \u00a7 18-1-175 contemplates that aggrieved persons may appeal to the Board only from decisions of \u201cthe Planning Director or any other employee of the Department of Planning and Zoning.\u201d QACC \u00a7 18 \u2014 1\u2014179(c). This kind of limiting argument was raised to no avail by the appellees in <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point. </em>We agree with the Court of Special Appeals reasoning in <em>Wharf a,t Handy\u2019s Point </em>and apply it to the present case. <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, </em>92 Md.App. at 670-73, 610 A.2d at 319-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, </em>an issue arose as to whether the term \u201cadministrative official\u201d included the Kent County Planning Commission, within the meaning of the statute requiring county boards of appeals to hear and decide appeals from administrative officials. Pursuant to the authority granted to it in Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d), the County Commissioners of Kent County provided in its zoning ordinance that the Board of Appeals shall have the power \u201c[t]o hear and decide appeals of any decision or determinations made by the Administrator in the enforcement and administration of this Ordinance.\u201d Ordinance, Art. IX, \u00a7 2.1. The zoning ordinance defined the \u201cAdministrator\u201d as \u201c[t]he Zoning Administrator of Kent County.\u201d Appellees there argued that \u201can administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tive official\u201d in Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) should not be construed to include the Kent County Planning Commission. The Court of Special Appeals quoted the Attorney General\u2019s conclusion that \u201con the whole, we think the term \u2018administrative official\u2019 is most reasonably read as embracing whatever administrative mechanism a local jurisdiction in Maryland sets up to enforce its planning and zoning laws and ordinances, including a multimember body such as a local planning commission.\u201d <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, </em>92 Md.App. at 672, 610 A.2d at 320 (quoting 64 Op. Atty Gen. 349, 355 n. 4 (1979)). The intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201cregardless of what was intended by the County Commissioners\u201d in the local ordinance, the more broadly drafted Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) took precedence, and invested the local board of appeals with authority to hear appeals from the Kent County Planning Commission, as well as the Zoning Administrator. <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, </em>92 Md.App. at 670-73, 610 A.2d at 319-20. Furthermore, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s interpretation of the overriding authority of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d), is consistent with the 1971 amendment of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07.1971 Md. Laws, Chap. 793. The 1971 revision of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07 broadened its scope, empowering local boards \u201cto act on matters arising out of the enforcement of any part of Article 66B or an ordinance passed under any of the subtitles of Article 66B.\u201d 64 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 349, 351 (1979). In addition, our conclusion that Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07 overrides the reference in QACC \u00a7 18-1-175 to \u201cthe Planning Director\u201d is consistent with the established principle that in cases of conflict between local and State enactments, the State statute \u201cmust prevail.\u201d <em>Boulden v. Mayor and Comm\u2019rs of Town of Elkton, </em>311 Md. 411, 415, 535 A.2d 477, 479 (1988) (finding that Article 66B, \u00a7 4.08 overrode local ordinance limiting right of appeal from the board of appeals). The Board has the general power to decide an appeal involving an \u201cerror in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official.\u201d QACC \u00a7 18-1-175(a)(1)\u00ae. The Board\u2019s general powers refer to \u201can administrative official\u201d (not limited to the Planning Director) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>encompass the entirety of Article 66B (not simply the Planning Director\u2019s role in the administration of zoning issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Accordingly, under the authority of Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07, the Board is the proper body to hear and decide in the first instance an appeal from the County Commissioner\u2019s administrative/executive actions in negotiating and executing the DRRA with Hovnanian. The Conservation Association\u2019s failure to avail itself of this appeal to the Board means that the Conservation Association failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. As exclusive or primary administrative remedies must be exhausted before judicial relief is sought, the present litigation could not be maintained and must be dismissed. <em>See Brown v. Fire and Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>375 Md. 661, 669, 826 A.2d 525, 530 (2003) (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine enforces the notion that an administrative agency should have the opportunity to exercise its expertise first to resolve an issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
