Khalifa\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to review her multiple convictions and sentences of incarceration for violating former Maryland Code, Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 RepLVol.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as the current, amended version of that statute, Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>convictions arose from Khalifa\u2019s role in the abduction and detention of her grandson, Adam Shannon, who was born in the United States and now resides in Egypt, thousands of miles away from his father and lawful custodian, Michael Shannon. Khalifa challenges her convictions and sentences on three grounds: (1) courts in the State of Maryland lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear the prosecution of certain counts against her; (2) her convictions and sentences violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights; and (3) her multiple sentences are \u201cconstitutionally defective\u201d because the indictment charged the same offense in multiple counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Khalifa (hereinafter \u201cPetitioner\u201d) and her adult daughter, Nermeen Khalifa Shannon (hereinafter \u201cNermeen\u201d), are citizens of Egypt, where Nermeen was raised and educated. In 1989, upon reaching the age of 21, Nermeen moved to the United States and settled in Maryland. In July of 1995, while living in Maryland, Nermeen met Michael Shannon, and, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>March 3, 1996, the two were married and took up residence in Millersville in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On February 9, 1997, Nermeen gave birth to their first son, Adam Shannon. Nermeen and Michael separated in January of 2000, and Nermeen moved to an apartment in Baltimore County. As a result of attempts to reconcile several months later, their second child, Jason Shannon, was born on January 10, 2001. Nermeen and Michael\u2019s reconciliation attempts ended in February of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On February 27, 2001, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County issued a \u201cConsent Order\u201d granting to Michael \u201clegal and primary physical care and custody\u201d of Adam. Under the order, Nermeen was afforded visitation with Adam, including up to three non-consecutive weeks of unsupervised visitation during the months of June, July, and August. The order also granted to Nermeen \u201clegal and primary physical care and custody\u201d of Jason, with whom Michael had \u201creasonable rights of visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">On August 18, 2001, Petitioner arrived in the United States from Egypt and stayed at Nermeen\u2019s Baltimore County apartment. Petitioner, who allegedly had a copy of the custody order, asked Michael if Nermeen\u2019s week of unsupervised visitation with Adam could correspond with Petitioner\u2019s visit to the United States. Petitioner explained to Michael that she wanted to take Nermeen, Adam, and Jason to New York to visit a relative, Waeil El Bayar, whose wife had recently given birth. Michael agreed, with the specific condition that Adam and Jason return to Maryland on Sunday, August 26. According to Michael, Petitioner promised to return the children to Nermeen\u2019s apartment by 6:00 p.m., Sunday, August 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Neimeen\u2019s neighbor and babysitter, Christa Mayo, stated that she last babysat Nermeen\u2019s children on Thursday, August 23, 2001. Nermeen had told Christa that she no longer needed babysitting services because she was moving to Egypt with the financial and logistical support of Petitioner. Nermeen explained to Christa that the move was a secret because \u201c[t]hey had an upcoming court case regarding custody [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>that she wanted to leave before that and no one was to know that they were going.\u201d About a month earlier, at Nermeen\u2019s request, Christa had taken Adam to have his passport photograph taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On August 23 and for a short time on August 24, Christa saw a moving truck outside of Nermeen\u2019s apartment, and she observed Petitioner \u201cdirecting the movers\u201d as they walked in and out of the apartment. According to Christa, Petitioner seemed \u201cvery dominant\u201d and \u201cin control,\u201d and, when she was with her daughter, Petitioner appeared \u201cin charge.\u201d Another of Nermeen\u2019s neighbors, Lynda Leight, who observed Petitioner on August 24, noted that Petitioner \u201cseemed to be very forceful\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d in the way she interacted with Nermeen. The property manager, Michael Nabors, observed the moving truck outside of Nermeen\u2019s apartment on August 24 and had a similar impression of Petitioner, recalling that she \u201cwas telling the [movers] what they should and shouldn\u2019t be doing in the truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">When Christa encountered Nermeen outside of her apartment on August 24, Nermeen gave Christa her apartment keys to return to the rental office after Christa had taken whatever she wanted of the items left behind in Nermeen\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Petitioner, Nermeen, Adam, and Jason arrived at El Bayar\u2019s house in New York on Friday, August 24. According to El Bayar, after spending one night at his house, his visitors, on August 25, traveled to the airport in a rented car and, using airline tickets that El Bayar had purchased for them at Nermeen\u2019s request several days earlier, flew to Egypt.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Before leaving Maryland, Nermeen provided Michael with three telephone numbers to reach her and the children while they were in New York. On August 24, Michael called New York and spoke with Petitioner, Nermeen, and Adam. Michael called New York again on August 25 and spoke with Nermeen and Adam. On August 26, however, the day Michael expected the children to return to Maryland, Michael was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>reach Nermeen and the children at any of the telephone numbers he was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">At around 4:00 p.m. that day, Michael drove to Nermeen\u2019s apartment and found that it \u201chad been cleaned out.\u201d He noticed that the \u201cmajor furniture,\u201d the boys\u2019 clothes, the entertainment center, and the television were missing. Michael immediately called the police, who described him as \u201cextremely distraught\u201d and \u201cnearly hysterical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On Tuesday, August 28, Michael called Petitioner\u2019s residence in Cairo, Egypt, and Petitioner answered the phone. Petitioner informed Michael that Adam and Jason were with her and that Nermeen was elsewhere in Egypt under a doctor\u2019s care. Petitioner initially did not allow Michael to speak with Adam. When Michael specifically requested the return of the children, Petitioner refused and stated that they would be back in a couple of weeks. Petitioner, according to Michael, explained that she had not told Michael of the children\u2019s travel to Egypt because, had he known, he would have stopped them or had them arrested. Later that day, Michael again called Petitioner\u2019s number in Egypt and was able to speak to Adam. Although Michael has spoken with Adam by phone consistently, Michael has not seen his oldest son since Adam left the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">While Adam and Jason have lived in Egypt, officials from the United States Embassy there have conducted three \u201cwelfare and whereabouts\u201d visits of the boys at Petitioner\u2019s residence in Cairo. During the first visit on October 2, 2001, Petitioner, her husband, Nermeen, Adam, and Jason were present. On February 27, 2002, when the embassy officials conducted the second visit, the children were accompanied by Nermeen and her sister. On the third visit, which took place on August 7, 2002, Nermeen was with her children and, this time, joined by her sister and niece. During all of the visits, the children appeared to the embassy officials to be living at Petitioner\u2019s home in Cairo.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In the evening of August 28, 2001, the District Court of Maryland sitting in Anne Arundel County issued a warrant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the arrest of Petitioner and charged her with child abduction and accessory to child abduction of Adam in violation of Section 9-805 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.). The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, on August 29, 2001, ordered Nermeen to \u201cimmediately return\u201d Adam \u201cto the care and custody of Michael Shannon.\u201d On September 11, 2001, the circuit court granted the \u201csole legal and physical care and custody\u201d of Jason to Michael and ordered Nermeen to \u201cimmediately return\u201d him to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Petitioner was arrested in May of 2002, when she returned to the United States with her husband to visit their property in San Diego, California. In August of 2002, the State of Maryland issued a revised criminal indictment, charging Petitioner with fifteen counts \u2014 ten counts of violating Maryland Code, Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article and five counts of conspiracy to violate that statute. All of the counts related to Petitioner\u2019s role in the alleged abduction, detention, and harboring of Adam. Because amendments to Section 9-305 and the related penalty provisions of Section 9-307 became effective on October 1, 2001, the State charged Petitioner in separate counts for conduct occurring before and after that date. In particular, of the ten Counts alleging violations of Section 9-305, Counts 1 through 6 charged Petitioner for conduct occurring between August and September of 2001. Counts 11 through 13, alleging conspiracy, also charged Petitioner for conduct that took place between August and September of 2001. The balance of the charges (Counts 7 though 10 and Counts 14 through 15) alleged that Petitioner committed offenses after October 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>After waiving her right to jury trial, Petitioner was tried in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County before the Honorable Nancy Davis-Loomis. Judge Davis-Loomis presided over the four-day trial and, on January 21, 2003, found Petitioner guilty on ten counts and rendered the following verdicts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Count 3: August 2001 through September 2001, harbor child outside of this State \u2014 Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Count 4: August 2001 through September 2001, accessory to abduct child outside of this State \u2014 Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Count 5: August 2001 through September 2001, accessory to detain child outside of this State \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">Count 8: October 2001 through May 2002, harbor child outside of the United States \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">Count 9: October 2001 through May 2002, accessory to detain child outside of the United States- \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">Count 11: August 2001, conspire to commit child abduction outside of this State \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">Count 12: August 2001 through September 2001, conspire to commit detaining child outside of this State \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Count 13: August 2001 through September 2001 conspire to commit harboring child outside of this State \u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Count 14: October 2001 through May 2002, conspire to commit detaining child outside of the United States\u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">Count 15: October 2001 through May 2002, conspire to commit harboring child outside of the United States\u2014 Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">For purposes of sentencing, Judge Davis-Loomis merged Count 3 into Count 5, Count 8 into Count 9, Count 13 into Count 12, and Count 15 into Count 14. She imposed a $15,000 fine and a total of ten years of imprisonment, divided among the various counts as follows: one year of imprisonment on Count 4 (accessory to child abduction outside this State); one year consecutive on Count 5 (accessory to detain a child outside of this State); three years consecutive on Count 9 (accessory to detain a child outside of the United States); one year consecutive on Count 11 (conspiracy to abduct); one year consecutive on Count 12 (conspiracy to detain outside this State); and three years consecutive on Count 14 (conspiracy to detain outside of the United States). A three-judge sentence review panel decreased Petitioner\u2019s fine to $5,000 and, by ordering her sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently instead of consecutively, limited the total prison sentence to three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, merged all of the conspiracy counts but otherwise affirmed Petitioner\u2019s remaining convictions and sentences. The court held that Anne Arundel County had territorial jurisdiction to prosecute the alleged harboring and detention of Adam because those acts \u201cdeprived Michael in Maryland of custody of his son, which was an essential element of the crimes of harboring and detaining a child.\u201d The court further held that Petitioner\u2019s convictions under the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305 did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Petitioner\u2019s offenses, in the court\u2019s view, were \u201ccontinuing in nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>punishable \u2018day by day.\u2019\u201d According to the court, if the Petitioner had detained Adam outside of the United States after October 1, 2001, the effective date of the statute, she violated the provisions of that statute, and \u201cthe State could prosecute her accordingly.\u201d With respect to Petitioner\u2019s claim that the indictment was multiplicative, the Court of Special Appeals decided against merging her sentences for accessory to abduction, accessory to detain outside of Maryland, and accessory to detain outside the United States. As the court reasoned, \u201c[ajbduction differs from detention in that it includes the element of taking, and the two detention charges differ from one another in their requisite place of detention.\u201d The court also decided, however, upon the State\u2019s concession, that all of the sentences for conspiracy do merge, recognizing that \u201conly one sentence can be imposed for a single common law conspiracy no matter how many criminal acts the conspirators have agreed to commit.\u201d The court held that, because \u201cthe offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty merges into the offense carrying the greater penalty,\u201d the one-year sentences under Counts 11 and 12 merged into Count 14, which carried a three-year sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">As a result of the all of the proceedings below, Petitioner had convictions with concurrent sentences on four counts: one year of imprisonment on Count 4 (accessory to child abduction outside of this State); one year on Count 5 (accessory to detain a child outside of this State); three years on Count 9 (accessory to detain a child outside of the United States); and three years on Count 14 (conspiracy to detain a child outside of the United States). Contesting the constitutionality and lawfulness of these convictions and sentences, Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>880 Md. 230, 844 A.2d 427 (2004), to address the following three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>1. What is the territorial jurisdiction for a violation of Md.Code Ann. Family Law Art. \u00a7 9-805 with respect to the crimes of detaining and/or harboring a child outside of the State of Maryland?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">2. What impact does the <em>ex post facto </em>clause have on the legislative changes to Md.Code Ann. Family Law Art. \u00a7 9-305 and its increased penalties?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">3. What impact do the doctrines of constitutional double jeopardy, the common law doctrine of merger, and the rule of lenity have on Md.Code Ann. Family Law Art. \u00a7 9-305?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">For reasons discussed below, we hold that the State had territorial jurisdiction to prosecute Petitioner for detaining a child outside of the State of Maryland and that Petitioner\u2019s convictions and sentences do not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights. We further hold that, except for Count 5 (accessory to detain a child outside of this State), which merges into Count 9 (accessory to detain a child outside of the United States) for purposes of sentencing, no further modifications to Petitioner\u2019s sentences are necessary because, under the required evidence test, the offenses of accessory to child abduction, accessory to child detention, and conspiracy to commit child detention contain distinct elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">A trial judge is vested with very broad discretion when sentencing a criminal defendant, so long as the sentence is based upon findings consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Triggs v. State, </em>382 Md. 27, 39, 852 A.2d 114, 122 (2004) (citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 199, 772 A.2d 273, 277 (2001)); <em>see also Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, at \u2014, 124 S.Ct. 2531, at 2538-39, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, at \u2014, 2004 WL 1402697, at *6 (2004). Ordinarily, we review the judge\u2019s sentencing judgment on three recognized grounds: \u201c(1) whether the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment or violates other constitutional requirements; (2) whether the sentencing judge was motivated by ill will, prejudice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>other impermissible considerations; and (3) whether the sentence is within statutory limits.\u201d <em>Triggs, </em>382 Md. 27, 39, 852 A.2d 114, 122 (quoting <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 516, 671 A.2d 495, 496 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In this case, Petitioner claims her multiple sentences are violations of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights as well as a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. As we explained in <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">When a claim is based upon a violation of a constitutional right it is our obligation to make an independent constitutional appraisal from the entire record. But this Court is not a finder of facts; we do not judge the credibility of the witnesses nor do we initially weigh the evidence to determine the facts underlying the constitutional claim. It is the function of the trial court to ascertain the circumstances on which the constitutional claim is based. So, in making our independent appraisal, we accept the findings of the trial judge as to what are the underlying facts unless he is clearly in error. We then re-weigh the facts as accepted in order to determine the ultimate mixed question of law and fact, namely, was there a violation of a constitutional right as claimed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Id. at 697-98, 496 A.2d at 1080 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 221, 792 A.2d 1160, 1166 (2002) (citing <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 432, 769 A.2d 879, 883 (2001)); <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 526, 784 A.2d 1102, 1106 (2001). Therefore, with respect to Petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims, although we do not engage in <em>de novo </em>fact-finding, our application of the law to the facts is <em>de novo. See Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282-83, 753 A.2d 519, 525 (2000) (stating that, with regard to a Fourth Amendment question, \u201cthis Court makes an independent determination of whether the State has violated an individual\u2019s constitutional rights by applying the law to the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Territorial jurisdiction is a factual issue for the trier of fact. <em>State v. Butler, </em>353 Md. 67, 79-80, 724 A.2d 657, 663 (1999) (holding that \u201cwhen evidence exists that the crime may have been committed outside Maryland\u2019s territorial jurisdiction and a defendant disputes the territorial jurisdiction of the Maryland courts to try him or her, the issue of where the crime was committed is fact-dependent and thus for the trier of fact\u201d). When the issue is in dispute, the State has the burden to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the crime was committed within the geographic limits of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 724 A.2d at 665. Consequently, because the issue of territorial jurisdiction is factual and the trial judge acted as the trier of fact in this case, we defer to her determination of territorial jurisdiction unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See Smallwood v. State, </em>343 Md. 97, 104, 680 A.2d 512, 515 (1996) (stating that, \u201c[t]o evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence in a non-jury trial,\u201d \u201cwe will not set aside the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous\u201d) (citing <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535, 573 A.2d 831, 833-34 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A. Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The State charged Petitioner with committing violations of Section 9-305 before and after its amendments became effective on October 1, 2001. Before October of 2001, Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article prohibited participation in the abduction, detention, or harboring of a child \u201coutside of this State.\u201d The former statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">If a child is under the age of 16 years, a relative who knows that another person is the lawful custodian of the child may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">(1) abduct, take, or carry away the child from the lawful custodian to a place outside of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">(2) having acquired lawful possession of the child, detain the child outside of this State for more than 48 hours after the lawful custodian demands that the child be returned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>(3) harbor or hide the child outside of this State knowing that possession of the child was obtained by another relative in violation of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">(4) act as an accessory to an act prohibited by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 Repl.

Subsection (a) addresses the prohibited conduct (abduction, detention, harboring, and acting as an accessory) resulting in the child entering or being held \u201cin another state.\u201d Subsection (b) prohibits that conduct when the child is taken or kept \u201coutside of the United States.\u201d After the amendments, the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If a child is under the age of 16 years, a relative who knows that another person is the lawful custodian of the child may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">(1) abduct, take, or carry away the child from the lawful custodian to a place in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">(2) having acquired lawful possession of the child, detain the child in another state for more than 48 hours after the lawful custodian demands that the child be returned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">(3) harbor or hide the child in another state knowing that possession of the child was obtained by another relative in violation of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">(4) act as an accessory to an act prohibited by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(b) <em>Additional restrictions. </em>\u2014 If a child is under the age of 16 years, a relative who knows that another person is the lawful custodian of the child may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">(1) abduct, take, or carry away the child from the lawful custodian to a place that is outside of the United States or a territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">(2) having acquired lawful possession of the child, detain the child in a place that is outside the United States or a territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for more than 48 hours after the lawful custodian demands that the child be returned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(3) harbor or hide the child in a place that is outside of the United States or a territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico knowing that possession of the child was obtained by another relative in violation of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">(4) act as an accessory to an act prohibited by this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 RepLVol., 2002 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The primary significance of the change to Section 9-305 is revealed in the penalty provisions of Section 9-307, which also changed on October 1, 2001. Although the maximum penalty for violating Section 9-305(a) (\u201cin another state\u201d) remained one year of imprisonment with a $1,000 fine, due to the amendment, the maximum penalty for violating Section 9-305(b) (\u201coutside of the United States\u201d) is three years of imprisonment with a $5,000 fine.

Territorial Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We first dispose of Petitioner\u2019s claim that the State lacked territorial jurisdiction to prosecute Counts 8, 9, 14, and 15, all of which alleged that Petitioner violated Section 9-305 after October 1, 2001. Petitioner points out that she was in Egypt, \u201ca sovereign foreign nation,\u201d by October 1, 2001, when she committed the acts that allegedly constituted harboring, detention, and conspiracy. She argues that she cannot be convicted in Maryland for a crime committed outside the borders of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The State responds that it had jurisdiction to prosecute Petitioner because her conduct, which resulted in depriving Michael Shannon of the lawful custody of his son, had its effect in Maryland. The State contends that the result of Petitioner\u2019s conduct \u201cforms an essential ingredient\u201d of the offenses charged and, therefore, without the deprivation of lawful custody in Maryland, \u201cthere simply would be no crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We have stated that \u201cit is well-settled in Maryland that a court must have territorial jurisdiction over a criminal defendant to exercise its jurisdiction, or power, over that defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Butler, </em>353 Md. at 78, 724 A.2d at 662. The general rule under common law is that a state has territorial jurisdiction over a defendant when the crime is committed within the State\u2019s \u201cterritorial limits.\u201d <em>State v. Cain, </em>360 Md. 205, 212, 757 A.2d 142, 145 (2000); <em>Pennington v. State, </em>308 Md. 727, 730, 521 A.2d 1216, 1217 (1987); <em>see also Wright v. State, </em>339 Md. 399, 404, 663 A.2d 590, 592 (1995). Therefore, ordinarily, \u201c[a] person cannot be convicted here for crimes committed in another state.\u201d <em>West v. State, </em>369 Md. 150, 158, 797 A.2d 1278, 1282 (2002) quoting <em>Butler, </em>353 Md. at 72-73, 724 A.2d at 660 (quoting <em>Bowen v. State, </em>206 Md. 368, 375, 111 A.2d 844, 847 (1955)); <em>Cain, </em>360 Md. at 214-15, 757 A.2d at 146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In describing the concept of territorial jurisdiction where different elements of a crime have occurred in different states, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The common law rule concerning territorial jurisdiction, which is adhered to in Maryland, does not permit prosecution of an offense in every jurisdiction in which any element of the offense takes place. Instead, the common law rule generally focuses on one element, which is deemed \u201cessential\u201d or \u201ckey\u201d or \u201cvital\u201d or the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the offense, and the offense may be prosecuted only in a jurisdiction where that essential or key element takes place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>West, </em>369 Md. at 158-59, 797 A.2d at 1283; <em>see Wright, </em>339 Md. at 404, 663 A.2d at 592 (stating that the traditional rule of territorial jurisdiction is that \u201ca state will exercise jurisdiction over a crime only if some conduct or effect constituting a part of that crime was committed within the state\u201d). Thus, we have held that Maryland does not have territorial jurisdiction as to the crimes of first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, unless \u201cthe specifically proscribed harmful physical contact\u201d (the key or essential element of those offenses) took place in Maryland. <em>West, </em>369 Md. at 162, 797 A.2d at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nonetheless, \u201cunder certain circumstances, the defendant\u2019s presence is not required in a court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction if ... the intended result or an essential element of his or her crime lies in Maryland.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>353 Md. at 74, 724 A.2d at 660. Regarding the offense of obstruction of justice, for example, territorial jurisdiction lies in this State even when \u201call of the affirmative acts were committed\u201d outside of Maryland because \u201c[t]he gravamen of the crime [is] the intended result in Maryland.\u201d <em>Pennington, </em>308 Md. at 733, 735, 521 A.2d at 1219, 1220; <em>see also West, </em>369 Md. at 161, 797 A.2d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>Trindle v. State, </em>326 Md. 25, 602 A.2d 1232 (1992), we expounded on these principles as they applied to former Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article, the same statute at issue in this case. Trindle\u2019s ex-wife, Alexa Matthai, lived in Kent County with their children. Trindle picked up the children in Wilmington, Delaware for a scheduled period of visitation to be spent in Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 602 A.2d at 1233. Unbeknownst to Matthai, who was the children\u2019s lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>custodian, Trindle and his new wife, Sharon Marcus, took the children and traveled to Amman, Jordan, where the children were kept without Matthai\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 602 A.2d at 1233-34. When Trindle and Marcus returned to the United States after having been deported from Jordan, they were tried and convicted in the Circuit Court for Kent County for child abduction in violation of former Section 9-305 of the Family Law Article. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 602 A.2d at 1234. Although Trindle\u2019s appeal was rendered moot when he died prior to his case being argued, Marcus argued on appeal that the Circuit Court did not have territorial jurisdiction to hear her prosecution, because none of her conduct took place in Maryland. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We disagreed, holding instead that the Maryland court had territorial jurisdiction over the child abduction charge against Marcus. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Marcus\u2019s conduct ... consisted of knowingly secreting and harboring Matthai\u2019s children with the intent to deprive Matthai of the custody, care and control of those children. It is clear that the intended result of that conduct, i.e. depriving Matthai of custody, forms an essential ingredient of her offense and had its effect in Kent County, Maryland, although the acts which produced that result took place outside of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 32, 602 A.2d at 1235. We also reviewed the law of territorial jurisdiction in other states and were persuaded by those courts that embraced the view that \u201cchild abduction or custody interference prosecutions can be heard in the state where the parental custody has been deprived by acts or omissions which occurred outside the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 602 A.2d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The case before us does not differ materially from the circumstances in <em>Trindle. </em>Like the appellant in <em>Trindle, </em>Petitioner intended to deprive a parent of lawful custody in the State of Maryland. Although her involvement in the conspiracy, detention, and harboring may have taken place well beyond the borders of this State, the intended consequences of those acts reached Maryland, where Michael was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>deprived of the lawful custody of his son. As we recognized in <em>Trindle, </em>the intentional deprivation of lawful custody \u201cforms an essential ingredient\u201d of the crimes prohibited under Section 9-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Furthermore, the bases for territorial jurisdiction in the present case are more cogent than in <em>Trindle, </em>where the child\u2019s abduction began in Delaware. Unlike <em>Trindle, </em>Petitioner\u2019s initial criminal acts (the child abduction and conspiracy), which facilitated the detention and harboring of Adam in Egypt, occurred in Maryland. For these reasons, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County had territorial jurisdiction over the prosecution of Petitioner\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">C. <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Petitioner maintains that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States and Maryland Constitutions bar her prosecution under the amended Section 9-305. The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, Petitioner argues, prohibits her prosecution under the amended statute inasmuch as her crimes were committed and <em>completed </em>before the effective date of the statutory amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The State contends that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause does not bar Petitioner\u2019s convictions under the amended \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305. The State claims that Petitioner was prosecuted for conduct occurring after the effective date of the amended statute and, therefore, the increased penalties were properly applied. That is, the State argues, Petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted continuing offenses that were punishable day to day and, when Petitioner failed to return the children after the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305 became effective, she exposed herself to prosecution under the amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States provides in part that \u201c[n]o State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law....\u201d Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, in more specific terms, also prohibits the passage of <em>ex post facto </em>laws: \u201cThat retrospective Laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such Laws, and by them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; wherefore, no <em>ex post facto </em>Law ought to be made; nor any retrospective oath or restriction be imposed, or required.\u201d The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights have been viewed generally to have the \u201csame meaning\u201d and are thus to be construed <em>in pari materia. Evans v. State, </em>2004 WL 1635610, *\u2014; <em>Watkins v. Secretary, Dept. of Public Safety, </em>377 Md. 34, 48, 831 A.2d 1079, 1087 (2003); <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 136-37, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994) (citing <em>Booth v.

Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 28, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, 23 (1981). As the Supreme Court has explained recently, \u201cthe <em>{Ex Post Facto </em>] Clause protects liberty by preventing governments from enacting statutes with \u2018manifestly <em>unjust and oppressive </em>\u2019 retroactive effects.\u201d <em>Stogner v. California, </em>539 U.S. 607,\u2014, 123 S.Ct. 2446, 2449, 156 L.Ed.2d 544, \u2014 (2003) (quoting <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dali.) 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798)). Justice Chase\u2019s opinion in <em>Calder v. Bull, </em>regarded by the <em>Stogner </em>Court as \u201can authoritative account on the scope of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause,\u201d enumerated the types of laws that contravene the <em>ex post facto </em>proscription:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2nd. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3rd. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Id. </em>at \u2014 , 123 S.Ct. at <em>2450, </em>156 L.Ed.2d at \u2014 (quoting <em>Colder, </em>at 390-91, 1 L.Ed. at 648) (internal emphasis omitted); <em>see also Evans, </em>2004 WL 1635610, *\u2014; <em>Lomax v. Warden, Md. Correctional Training Ctr., </em>356 Md. 569, 576, 741 A.2d 476, 480 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In accordance with these principles, \u201c[t]wo critical elements must be present for a criminal or penal law to be <em>ex post facto: </em>it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.\u201d <em>Frost, </em>336 Md. at 136, 647 A.2d at 112 (quoting <em>Weaver, </em>450 U.S. at 29, 101 S.Ct. at 964, 67 L.Ed.2d at 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The amended Section 9-305, on its face, certainly does not contain either of these elements. As applied to Petitioner as well, the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305 gave \u201cfair warning\u201d of its effect and, therefore, cannot be considered \u201cmanifestly unjust and oppressive.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d provisions were not applied to any conduct that Petitioner engaged in before the amendments became effective. Rather, as the indictment expressly states, Petitioner was charged, and later convicted, under the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305 for violations occurring from October 2001 through May 2002 \u2014 after the statute\u2019s effective date. All conduct that the State alleged occurred before the October 1 effective date was charged under the \u201cold\u201d Section 9-305 and subject to the corresponding penalties under the \u201cold\u201d Section 9-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that her criminal acts were completed prior to October 1, 2001 is unavailing. Petitioner was convicted under the \u201cnew\u201d statute on Count 9 (accessory to detain a child outside of the United States) and on Count 14 (conspiracy to detain a child outside of the United States). Although both of the crimes underlying these counts began before October 1, they are nonetheless continuing offenses that did not cease prior to that date. Consequently, as we explain, Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated when the State charged her and the trial court convicted and sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>her under the amended provisions of Sections 9-305 and 9-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have noted, a continuing offense is a \u201ctransaction or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse ... no matter how long in time it may occupy.... It is an offense which continues day by day.\u201d <em>Beatty v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 627, 635, 468 A.2d 663, 667 (1983) (citing Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law, </em>14th ed. \u00a7 59). We have stated that \u201c[o]rdinarily, a continuing offense is marked by a continuing duty in the defendant to do an act which he fails to do. The offense continues as long as the duty persists, and there is a failure to perform that duty.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, </em>282 Md. 385, 390, 384 A.2d 456, 459 (1978). A \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d also has been described as generally \u201cone that involves a prolonged course of conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Ventura, </em>72 F.3d 277, 281 (2d Cir.1995). The California Supreme Court explained the concept of a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Most crimes are instantaneous since they are committed as soon as every element is satisfied. Some crimes, however, are not terminated by a single act or circumstance but are committed as long as the proscribed conduct continues. Each day brings \u201ca renewal of the original crime or the repeated commission of new offenses.\u201d The distinction is critical because it determines the application of many legal principles such as the statute of limitations period, venue, jurisdiction, sentencing, double jeopardy, and, as here, the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\"><em>Wright v. Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.4th 521, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 322, 936 P.2d 101, 103 (1997) citing <em>Toussie v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 112, 119, 90 S.Ct. 858, 862, 25 L.Ed.2d 156 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The application of new statutes to continuing offenses ordinarily presents no <em>ex post facto </em>concerns if the charged criminal conduct continued beyond the law\u2019s effective date. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated, \u201cthe Ex Post Facto clause is not violated by application of a statute to an enterprise that began prior to, but continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>after, the effective date of [the statute].\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>79 F.3d 223, 229 (2d Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Kramer, </em>955 F.2d 479, 485 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cIt is well settled that the ex post facto clause is not applicable to offenses which began before the effective date of a statute and continue thereafter.\u201d); <em>People v. Grant, </em>20 Cal.4th 150, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 973 P.2d 72, 77 (1999) (\u201cWhere an offense is of a continuing nature, and the conduct continues after the enactment of a statute, that statute may be applied without violating the ex post facto prohibition.\u201d) (quoting <em>People v. Palacios, </em>56 Cal. App.4th 252, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 318, 320 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Whether a particular crime constitutes a continuing offense is primarily a question of statutory interpretation. <em>Wright, </em>63 Cal.Rptr.2d 322, 936 P.2d at 104 (citing <em>Toussie, </em>397 U.S. at 115, 90 S.Ct. at 860, 25 L.Ed.2d at 161). Although the express statutory language may provide an answer, equally important to the determination is whether \u201cthe nature of the crime involved is such that [the Legislature] must assuredly have intended that it be treated as a continuing one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The concept of \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d has embraced such crimes as embezzlement, <em>State v. Thang, </em>188 Minn. 224, 246 N.W. 891 (1933), bigamy, <em>Cox v. State, </em>117 Ala. 103, 23 So. 806 (1898), nuisance, <em>State v. Dry Fork R. Co., </em>50 W.Va. 235, 40 S.E. 447 (1901), and the repeated failure to pay taxes, <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>255 F.3d 1256 (10th Cir.2001). Courts also have determined that \u201ccontinuing offenses\u201d include failing to register as a sex offender, <em>Arizona v. Helmer, </em>203 Ariz. 309, 53 P.3d 1153, 1155 (2002), and being a deported alien found in the United States, <em>United States v. Ramirez-Valencia, </em>202 F.3d 1106, 1110 (9th Cir.2000). We have held that the crime of failing to pay child support is a continuing offense. <em>State v. James, </em>203 Md. 113, 119, 100 A.2d 12, 14 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The crime of conspiracy is perhaps the classic example of a \u201ccontinuing offense.\u201d <em>See e.g., United States v. Hersh, </em>297 F.3d 1233, 1244 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1124 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cSince conspiracy is a continuous crime, a statute increasing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>penalty for a conspiracy beginning before the date of enactment but continuing afterwards does not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.\u201d); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>42 F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201c[According to our precedents, continuing offenses such as conspiracy and bank fraud do not run afoul of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause if the criminal offenses continue after the relevant statute becomes effective.\u201d); <em>United States v. Baresh, </em>790 F.2d 392, 404 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201c[B]ecause conspiracy is a continuing crime, a statute increasing the penalty for a conspiracy beginning before the date of enactment but continuing afterwards does not offend the <em>[Ex Post Facto </em>Clause].\u201d); <em>United States v. Campanale, </em>518 F.2d 352, 365 (9th Cir.1975) (\u201cIt is well established that a statute increasing a penalty with respect to a criminal conspiracy which commenced prior to, but was continued beyond the effective date of the statute, is not <em>ex post, facto </em>as to that crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Likewise, the crime of detaining a child under Section 9-305 constitutes a continuing offense. Although the statutory language does not expressly describe the crime as such, detention is, by its very nature, continuous. Words in a statute are generally given their \u201cnatural and usual meaning.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1246 (2001); <em>Brown v. State, </em>311 Md. 426, 435, 535 A.2d 485, 489 (1988) (stating that \u201cwords in a statute are generally given their common and ordinary meaning\u201d). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cdetention\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or fact of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.1999). This definition describes continuous conduct in the sense that the detention \u201cachieves no finality\u201d until the victim is released or dies. <em>See United States v. Cores, </em>356 U.S. 405, 409, 78 S.Ct. 875, 878, 2 L.Ed.2d 873, 877 (1958); <em>cf. State v. Stouffer, </em>352 Md. 97, 116, 721 A.2d 207, 217 (1998) (describing kidnapping as a \u201ccontinuing crime, remaining in effect until the hostage is safely released\u201d). The crime carries on at least until the offender takes action to return the child to the care of the lawful custodian or the child achieves the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The court in <em>People v. Caruso, 152 </em>Ill.App.3d 1074, 105 Ill.Dec. 821, 504 N.E.2d 1339 (1987) reached a similar conclusion. In that case, the defendant, Caruso, was charged with the statutory offenses of child abduction and unlawful restraint involving his two children. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. Caruso argued before the appellate court that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause barred the child abduction count because the abduction occurred in 1977, before the child abduction statute was enacted in 1978 and subsequently amended in 1984. <em>Id. </em>at 1340^11. The court, however, accepted the State\u2019s argument that \u201cthe offense of child abduction, as charged in the indictments at issue here, is for the detention of the children, a continuing act, and is therefore not based on the initial taking before the child abduction statute was enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Defendant is not being prosecuted for the abduction or detention of the children prior to the enactment of the statute. He is charged with detaining the children on December 24, 1984, a date after enactment of the child abduction statute and after the effective date of the 1984 amendment to this statute. Although the detention of the children also occurred before the enactment of the law, the statute was alleged to be violated by the continued detention of the children after passage of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1341. Based on this reasoning, the court concluded that \u201cneither the statute as amended nor the indictments apply to events occurring before the enactment of the statute, and the law is not facially or as applied violative of the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of the United States or Illinois constitutions.\u201d <em>Id.; see also People v. Westman, </em>262 Mich.App. 184, 685 N.W.2d 423 (2004) (relying on an unpublished appellate opinion in which the court held that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation where parental kidnapping continued after the effective date of the amended statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The charges against Petitioner under the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305 alleged conduct committed after the effective date of the statute. The amended law, therefore, only \u201coperates solely with respect to subsequent conduct\u201d and does not \u201cchange[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the legal consequences of acts <em>completed </em>before its effective date.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>63 Cal.Rptr.2d 322, 936 P.2d at 107 (citation omitted). The detention and conspiracy continued through and after the amended Sections 9-305 and 9-307 became effective. Petitioner\u2019s crimes, for purposes of prosecution, terminated only after she was taken into custody. By assisting in the criminal efforts to confine Adam after October 1, 2001, Petitioner violated the new statute, and, hence, her convictions under the amended statute do not offend the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses of the United States Constitution and Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">D. Multiplicity</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Challenging her multiple sentences, Petitioner invokes the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and the common-law rule of merger. She claims that the indictment impermissibly charged the same offense in multiple counts when, in her view, \u201cthere can be but one violation\u201d and \u201cbut one sentence for a violation of [Section] 9-305.\u201d She maintains further that the legislative intent is ambiguous as to whether Section 9-305 permits multiple punishment and, therefore, under the rule of lenity, she should have received a single sentence of no more than one year imprisonment for a single violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In response, the State argues that the indictment was not multiplicative because it charged Petitioner with committing separate and distinct types of conduct prohibited by Section 9-305. According to the State, the convictions should not merge for purposes of sentencing because each offense for which Petitioner was convicted contains a distinct element that the others do not. Therefore, under the State\u2019s position, Petitioner was properly convicted of violating the \u201cnew\u201d Sections 9-305(b), for which the trial judge properly imposed a three-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"> The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the States, provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>in jeopardy of life or limb.... \u201d <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 796, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 (1969); <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 101, 497 A.2d 1129, 1130 (1985). The Double Jeopardy Clause forbids multiple convictions and sentences for the same offense. <em>Holbrook, </em>364 Md. at 369, 772 A.2d at 1248; <em>Nightingale v.

State, supra, </em>321 Md. at 617, 583 A.2d at 1059, quoting <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>307 Md. 501, 517, 515 A.2d 465, 473 (1986). Stated another way, the required evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other does not, there is no merger under the required evidence test even though both offenses are based upon the same act or acts. But, where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other, and where both offenses are based on the same act or acts ... merger follows. <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 317-318, 593 A.2d at 673, quoting in part <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 267, 353 A.2d 240, 246-47 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">332 Md. at 391-92, 631 A.2d at 456-57 (internal quotations marks omitted). The required evidence test is the \u201cthreshold\u201d test and, if it is met, merger follows as a matter of course. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 631 A.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">If, however, the required evidence test is not fulfilled because the offenses in question have distinct or separate elements, we move to a separate inquiry: whether the principle of statutory construction known as the rule of lenity requires merger. <em>Holbrook, </em>364 Md. at 373, 772 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>1251. The rule of lenity allows us to avoid \u201cinterpret[ting] a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525, 529 (1990)). As it is a principle of statutory construction, the rule of lenity applies where both offenses are statutory in nature or where one offense is statutory and the other is a derivative of common law. <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d at 529. Judge Cole, on behalf of the Court in <em>Monoker v. State, </em>explained the operation of the rule of lenity succinctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMEW\">Even though two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, there are nevertheless times when the offenses will not be punished separately. Two crimes created by legislative enactment may not be punished separately if the legislature intended the offenses to be punished by one sentence.... [I]f we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">321 Md. at 222, 582 A.2d at 529. When offenses merge under the rule of lenity, \u201cthe offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty ordinarily merges into the offense carrying the greater maximum penalty.\u201d <em>Miles v. State, </em>349 Md. 215, 229, 707 A.2d 841, 848 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Petitioner was sentenced for convictions on four counts: Count 4 (accessory to child abduction), Count 5 (accessory to child detention outside of this State), Count 9 (accessory to child detention outside of the United States), and Count 14 (conspiracy to child detention outside of the United States). We must determine, therefore, under the required evidence test and the rule of lenity, whether any of these offenses constitute the same offense and must be merged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The elements of the crimes of child abduction and child detention are not the same under Section 9-805. Child abduction under the \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d Sections 9-305 has the following elements: (1) a child under 16 years of age; (2) a relative who is not the lawful custodian of the child; (3) the relative knows that he or she is not the lawful custodian; (4) the relative abducts, takes, or carries away the child from the lawful custodian; (5) to a place outside this State. Child detention, on the other hand, requires: (1) a child under 16 years of age; (2) a relative who is not the lawful custodian of the child; (3) the relative knows that he or she is not the lawful custodian; (4) the non-custodial relative acquires lawful possession of the child; (5) the custodian demands the child\u2019s return; (6) the non-custodial relative detains the child; (7) the detention lasts for 48 hours after the demand was made; and (8) the detention occurs outside of this State. Although both offenses of child abduction and child detention share elements 1 through 3 as well as the territorial elements (outside of this State), child detention does not require any abduction, taking or carrying away. The offense of child abduction, on the other-hand, does not require lawful possession, a return demand, detention, and 48-hour lapse of time. These two offenses possess several distinct elements; therefore, they do not merge under the required evidence test.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Nor do the abduction and detention convictions merge under the rule of lenity. Under Section 9-305, the legislature unambiguously set out under different subsections several separate categories of prohibited conduct, including child abduction and detention. Child abduction and detention describe two completely different acts: one involving the initial taking of the child and the other involving the child\u2019s confine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ment after the lawful custodian has made a demand for the child\u2019s return. The mere fact that, in this case, an abduction preceded the eventual detention of Adam does not suggest that the legislature intended the two crimes to be punished together. Rather, we believe that the General Assembly meant child abduction and child detention to constitute separately punishable offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Turning to the conspiracy count, we note that a substantive offense is generally distinct from the crime of conspiracy to commit the offense. <em>See Gmndison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 759, 506 A.2d 580, 617 (1986); <em>accord Apostoledes v. State, </em>323 Md. 456, 461-63, 593 A.2d 1117, 1120-21 (1991); <em>Cooper v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 257, 271, 737 A.2d 613, 620 (1999) (citing <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832, 834 (1988)). We have summarized the elements of a conspiracy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">A criminal conspiracy consists of the combination of two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means. The essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement. The agreement need not be formal or spoken, provided there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design. In Maryland, the crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, and no overt act in furtherance of the agreement need be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-7\"><em>Townes, </em>314 Md. at 75, 548 A.2d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In <em>Grandison, </em>we rejected the argument that a charge of conspiracy to murder should merge with a charge of murder based on the defendant\u2019s role as an accessory before the fact. 305 Md. at 759, 506 A.2d at 617. Explaining the distinct elements of the conspiracy and the completed crime, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">It is clear that the substantive crime of murder is distinct from the crime of conspiracy to commit murder. The argument is made here, however, that since Grandison\u2019s murder conviction was based on his being an accessory before the fact, his conviction for conspiracy to murder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the murder conviction should merge. What Grandison overlooks simply is that accessoryship is not a substantive crime but merely the mechanism by which culpability for the substantive crime is incurred. A completed crime is a necessary element. With conspiracy to murder, on the other hand, once the agreement to murder has been made, the crime is complete without any further action. In short, each of these crimes requires an element distinct from the other. Conspiracy to murder requires an agreement, while murder, regardless of whether one is convicted as an accessory or a principal, requires the completed crime. Thus it is apparent that the conspiracy to murder is a separate and distinct crime from the substantive crime itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The same distinctions apply with respect to the crimes of conspiracy to detain a child and accessory to detain a child. At the moment when one unlawfully agrees to detain a child in violation of Section 9-305, the continuing crime of conspiracy has been committed. No further action is necessary. For one to act as an accessory to the continuing offense of child detention, though, no unlawful agreement is required, but the child must have been detained for at least 48 hours after the custodial parent demanded the child\u2019s return. In other words, unlike for a conviction of conspiracy, the crime of accessory to child detention requires actual detention of a child that violates the provisions of Section 9-305. Because of the distinct elements of the two crimes, it is clear that the legislature intended Petitioner\u2019s conspiracy to be punished as well as her role in the actual detention. Additionally, we have identified no statutory ambiguity that would compel the merger of the conspiracy and child detention counts. The two offenses, consequently, do not merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">As for the two child detention counts spanning different time periods, we reach a different conclusion. When Section 9-305 was amended on October 1, 2001, the Legislature altered only the territorial element of the offense of child detention. Pre-amendment Section 9-305 criminalized the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>of child detention \u201coutside of this State.\u201d After October 1, 2001, Section 9-305(a) prohibited child detention in \u201canother state,\u201d while Section 9-305(b) prohibited such conduct \u201coutside of the United States.\u201d Petitioner was convicted and sentenced separately for detaining Adam from August through September of 2001 \u201coutside of this State\u201d and for detaining Adam from October of 2001 through May of 2002 \u201coutside of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">An application of the required evidence test demonstrates that child detention outside of this State is a lesser included offense of child detention outside of the United States. First of all, the child detention, although it continued day by day, was not separately punishable daily, unless, quite possibly, some intervening event occurred. As Petitioner continually assisted in confining Adam to her residence in Egypt, she did not commit a new offense each day but rather a single offense that continued throughout the duration of that detention. In proving that single offense, the State had the burden to prove the territorial element of \u201coutside of the United States\u201d to show a violation of the \u201cnew\u201d Section 9-305. To prove the charge that Petitioner violated the \u201cold\u201d Section 9-305, the State had to prove detention \u201coutside of this State.\u201d Proving detention outside of the United States, however, also necessarily requires proving detention \u201coutside of this State.\u201d Thus, under the circumstances in this case, Petitioner could not have committed child detention outside of the United States without having also committed child detention outside of this State. Because all of the elements of Count 5 (child detention outside of this State) are included in the offense charged under Count 9 (child detention outside of the United States), the former merges into the latter. <em>See Lancaster, </em>332 Md. at 401, 631 A.2d at 461 (holding that two offenses merged because proof of one necessarily required proof of the other); <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 617, 583 A.2d 1056, 1059 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
