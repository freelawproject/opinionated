Some of the limited partners, who believed compliance with the capital call was financially unwise, wrote to the general partner to inform him of their intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>withdraw from the partnership before the capital call became due. The general partner responded that the limited partners could not withdraw from the partnership and would be in default should they fail to comply with the capital call, the due date for which the general partner accelerated to a point in time prior to the announced effective date of the withdrawal of the pertinent limited partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The limited partners who wished to withdraw filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that they had a statutory right to withdraw from East Park and an injunction barring enforcement of the capital call. The Circuit Court ultimately entered judgment in favor of the limited partners. This appeal followed in which we consider a number of issues of first impression concerning Maryland partnership law. Although we agree with the Circuit Court\u2019s (1) application to the facts of this case of Maryland\u2019s Uniform Partnership Act, instead of Maryland\u2019s Revised Uniform Partnership Act; (2) conclusion that the limited partners possessed a statutory right to withdraw; and (3) declaration that the general partner, in accelerating the capital call and failing to investigate alternative financing, breached his fiduciary duty and acted in bad faith, we disagree with its determination that an assignment of a partnership interest in violation of an anti-assignment clause is valid and enforceable and, in this instance, caused East Park\u2019s dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In 1969, the Trinity Joint Venture Limited Partnership (\u201cTrinity\u201d) was formed in Maryland to develop commercially-zoned property on Crain Highway in Glen Burnie. In 1974, Trinity admitted Joseph M. Della Ratta (\u201cDella Ratta\u201d) as a general partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On 21 December 1981, an amended partnership agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) was executed under which Della Ratta became Trinity\u2019s sole general partner. Della Ratta also was one of the partnership\u2019s thirteen limited partners. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Agreement was amended on 4 May 1992 to change the name of the partnership to East Park. A further amendment was executed on 1 June 1992 substituting as limited partners the widows (Barbara A. Larkin, Rosemary Krupnik, and Valeree Sass) of three deceased limited partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">East Park developed a shopping center on its Glen Burnie property that, over time, grew to include 205,000 square feet of retail space. In 1992, East Park obtained $9,000,000 in financing secured by a mortgage on the shopping center (the \u201cAegon Loan\u201d). The Aegon Loan provided for interest at the rate of 9.875% per annum and had a due date of 1 January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In December 2001, Della Ratta, a legal resident of Florida, created the Della Ratta Intangible Asset Management Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) in order to avoid a Florida tax on intangible assets. When Della Ratta\u2019s accountant prepared East Park\u2019s 2001 tax returns, he showed no ownership interest for Joseph M. Della Ratta. Instead, the K-l Schedules reflected that all of Della Ratta\u2019s ownership interest in East Park had been transferred to the Trust. After the tax returns were brought to his attention during the course of the present litigation, Della Ratta argued that this purported transfer was a mistake and filed amended returns correcting the alleged mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">By letter dated 1 March 2002, Della Ratta informed East Park\u2019s limited partners that the Aegon Loan would be due on 3 February 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The letter stated that the loan balance of $7,528,499 could not be repaid by East Park\u2019s cash reserves and that a capital call would be due on 30 September 2002. Each limited partner would be required to contribute his or her pro-rata share of the Aegon Loan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Some of the limited partners met with Della Ratta on 15 March 2002 to discuss the capital call. According to the meeting minutes, some limited partners were concerned about meeting the capital call. Refinancing the Aegon Loan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>suggested as an alternative. Della Ratta stated that he would contact lenders and try to get a commitment for a loan. By his own admission, Della Ratta thereafter failed to explore refinancing options.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">After the 15 March meeting, Barbara Larkin, Valerie Sass, Rosemary Krupnick, and the Charles L. Helferstay Residuary Trust (the \u201cWithdrawing Partners\u201d or \u201cAppellees\u201d) each gave written notice to Della Ratta purporting to exercise their statutory right to withdraw from East Park, pursuant to Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-603(b) of the Corporations and Associations Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each Withdrawing Partner\u2019s withdrawal would be effective on 29 September 2002, giving more than the six months notice required by \u00a7 10-603(b). The Withdrawing Partners\u2019 attorney subsequently wrote to Della Ratta to inform him that, pursuant to Md.Code (1975, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-604 of the Corporations and Associations Article,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> each Withdrawing Partner asserted entitlement to the fair value of her or its interest in East Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Della Ratta wrote to the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 counsel on 3 April 2002 claiming that \u00a7 10-603(b) was inapplicable because the Agreement specified when the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 capital could be removed from the partnership and the Withdrawing Partners were not so entitled under the circumstances. After further communications, on 10 May 2002, Della Ratta again wrote to the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 counsel and extended a settlement offer good for ten days. He stated that if the settlement offer was not accepted, the capital call would be accelerated and due on 1 September 2002. Della Ratta claimed that a default by the Withdrawing Partners in meeting the call would result in forfeiture of their interests in East Park.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Withdrawing Partners collectively owned a 20.797% interest in East Park. In order to meet the capital call, the Withdrawing Partners were obligated to contribute a total of approximately $1,126,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In addition, in his correspondence Della Ratta suggested that the East Park partners might face additional capital calls in the future. Although as the sole general partner Della Ratta exclusively controlled any cash distributions from East Park to the partners, he gave no indication that he planned to make distributions in the future. Indeed, for a number of years the limited partners realized no net income from their investment in East Park. Given these circumstances, the Withdrawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Partners believed that further out-of-pocket investment in East Park was unwise. For some limited partners, satisfying the capital call also would have been a serious financial hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">On 24 May 2002, the Withdrawing Partners filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking a declaratory judgement that they properly had withdrawn from East Park and were entitled to the fair value of their East Park partnership interests. They also sought an injunction barring enforcement of the capital call. East Park, Della Ratta, other limited partners, and purported assignees of East Park interests (collectively, the \u201cRemaining Partners\u201d or \u201cAppellants\u201d) were named as defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Withdrawing Partners amended their complaint approximately two months later to add a count seeking a declaratory judgment that East Park was dissolved in December 2001 when Della Ratta purportedly transferred his interest to the Trust. On the same day, the Withdrawing Partners filed an amended motion for summary judgment on the issues of East Park\u2019s purported dissolution and the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 purported statutory right of withdrawal, together with a motion for a preliminary injunction to stay enforcement of the capital call claimed due on 1 September 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Circuit Court, by an order of 30 August 2002, granted partial summary judgment to the Withdrawing Partners, ruling that the Withdrawing Partners had a statutory right to withdraw from East Park. The Circuit Court also issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the capital call pending a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">A bench trial on liability was held from 22 January through 24 January 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On 28 March 2003, the Circuit Court issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>an opinion and order (1) declaring that Della Ratta\u2019s assignment to the Trust effected his withdrawal as general partner and triggered East Park\u2019s dissolution; (2) ordering East Park to wind up its business and distribute its assets to the partners; and (3) permanently enjoining enforcement of the capital call against the Withdrawing Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On 21 May 2003, the Circuit Court stayed, pending final judgment and appeal, all aspects of its 28 March order, other than the permanent injunction barring enforcement of the capital call. Because the Circuit Court\u2019s determination that East Park had been dissolved made moot its prior order that the Withdrawing Partners properly exercised a statutory right of withdrawal, there was no trial on the question of relief. On 28 July 2003, the Circuit Court issued its final judgment: (1) declaring that East Park was dissolved; (2) ordering East Park wound up and its assets distributed to its partners; and (3) continuing the permanent injunction barring enforcement of the capital call.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The Remaining Partners filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While the appeal was pending and before the intermediate appellate court could decide the case, the Withdrawing Partners filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. On 11 February 2004, we issued the writ, <em>Della Ratta v. Larkin, </em>379 Md. 225, 841 A.2d 339 (2004), to consider the following questions, which we have slightly rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the Uniform' Partnership Act, not the Revised Uniform Partnership Act, as enacted in Maryland, governs the outcome of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred in finding that Della Ratta transferred his general partner interest in East Park to a trust and thereby caused the dissolution of the limited partnership?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">III. Whether the Circuit Court erred in finding that the Withdrawing Partners had a statutory right to withdraw from East Park pursuant to \u00a7 10-603(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>IV. Whether the Circuit Court properly enjoined enforcement of the capital call based on its findings that Della Ratta did not have the authority to unilaterally issue the capital call, and that Della Ratta breached his fiduciary duties as general partner when he issued, then advanced the due date of, the capital call?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">When reviewing a case tried without a jury, we review the case on both the law and the evidence. Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c) (2004 Repl.Vol.). We will not set aside a Circuit Court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, and we must give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn addition, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party ... and decide not whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact were correct, but only whether they were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 394, 761 A.2d 899, 911 (2000) (quoting <em>Urban Site Venture II Ltd. Partnership v. Levering Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>340 Md. 223, 229-230, 665 A.2d 1062, 1065 (1995)) (citations omitted). The clearly erroneous standard does not apply to our review of a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, which we review <em>de novo. See Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 372, 765 A.2d 587, 593 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">When reviewing a grant of a motion for summary judgment, our task is to determine whether any genuine dispute of material fact was shown to exist and, if not, whether the Circuit Court was legally correct. <em>See Beatty v. Trail-master Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993). A trial judge\u2019s grant of injunctive relief, however, unless infected by an erroneous legal conclusion, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Colandrea, </em>361 Md. at 394, 761 A.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Maryland enacted the Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cUPA\u201d) in 1916, <em>Creel v. Lilly, </em>854 Md. 77, 87, 729 A.2d 385, 391 (1999), and it governed partnerships for more than eighty years. Effective 1 July 1998, Maryland enacted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cRUPA\u201d), Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9A-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Corporations and Associations Article. The Circuit Court in the present case concluded that UPA, not RUPA, applied to these facts. We agree, concluding that the Legislature did not intend RUPA to have a retrospective reach so as to apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The general rule is that the partnership agreement governs the relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership. <em>Creel, </em>354 Md. at 87, 729 A.2d at 391. Where applicable statutes are concerned, East Park, as a limited partnership, is governed in the first instance by Maryland\u2019s Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (\u201cRULPA\u201d), Md.Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Corporations and Associations Article, which took effect in 1982. Limited partnerships also were governed by UPA, Md.Code (1975, 1999 ReplVol.), \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Corporations and Associations Article, except where its provisions were modified by or inconsistent with RULPA. \u00a7 10-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In adopting RUPA, the Legislature clearly sought to eliminate some of UPA\u2019s harsh provisions. <em>Creel, </em>354 Md. at 91, 729 A.2d at 393. Finalized in 1994 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, RUPA represents a complete rewriting of UPA and effectuates changes in seven major areas. <em>See generally </em>Robert W. Hillman et al., <em>The Revised Uniform Partnership Act, </em>introductory cmt. (2003 ed.). Among several changes relevant to the present case, RUPA contains a completely new and controversial articulation of a partner\u2019s fiduciary duties. <em>Id. </em>Unlike UPA, which coexisted with the common law, RUPA attempts to displace the common law and define the fiduciary duties of partners entirely by statute. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 404. Moreover, RUPA narrowly defines the fiduciary duties of partners and downgrades the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>common-law fiduciary duty of good faith to the status of a non-fiduciary \u201cobligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, determining which Act applies is important and may prove dispositive to the outcome of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Upon its enaction in 1998, RUPA did not immediately replace UPA for all partnerships. RUPA contains a phase-in provision, \u00a7 9A-1204, which caused RUPA and UPA to coexist until 31 December 2002. <em>Creel, </em>354 Md. at 81, 729 A.2d at 387. Section 9A-1204 determines the applicability of the respective Acts, providing in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">(a) <em>Before January 1, 2003. </em>\u2014 Before January 1, 2003, this title governs only a partnership formed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">(1) On or after July 1, 1998, unless that partnership is continuing the business of a dissolved partnership under \u00a7 9A-601 of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">(2) Before July 1, 1998, that elects, as provided by subsection (c), to be governed by this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">(b) <em>After December 31, 2002. </em>\u2014 After December 31, 2002, this title governs all partnerships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">(c) <em>Election before January 1, 2003. </em>\u2014 Before January 1, 2003, a partnership voluntarily may elect, in the manner provided in its partnership agreement or by law for amending the partnership agreement, to be governed by this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The Circuit Court applied UPA based on three determinations: (1) East Park came into existence prior to 1 July 1998; (2) East Park did not elect to be governed by RUPA as provided in \u00a7 9A-1204(c); and (3) all of the events which gave rise to this litigation occurred prior to 31 December 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The Remaining Partners contend that UPA ceased to have any effect on 1 January 2003 and that RUPA should have been applied to reach an outcome in this case. They point to the fact that the Legislature added a termination provision to UPA, \u00a7 9-1001(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\"><em>Termination. </em>\u2014 [UPA] shall terminate and be of no effect after December 31, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Although the Circuit Court in the present case conducted the trial and entered final judgment after 1 January 2003, the time period during which the East Park dispute arose determines which Act applies. \u201c... [A] statute, though applied only in legal proceedings subsequent to its effective date and in that sense, at least, prospective, is, when applied so as to determine the legal significance of acts or events that occurred prior to its effective date, applied retroactively.\u201d <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 855 A.2d 364 (2004) (No. 125, September Term, 2003) (slip op. at 12-13, filed 30 July 2004) (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 289-90, 829 A.2d 611, 618-19 (2003)). Because the events at issue in the present case occurred prior to 1 January 2003, RUPA\u2019s application to this dispute among East Park\u2019s partners would be a retrospective one.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In determining whether a statute may be given retroactive effect, we engage in a two-part analysis. <em>Evans, </em>slip op. at 12. First, we must determine whether the Legislature intended the statute to have the kind of retroactive effect that is asserted. <em>Id. </em>Statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless the Legislature \u201cclearly expresses an intent that the statute apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we conclude that the Legislature intended for the statute to have retroactive effect, we must then examine whether such effect would contravene a constitutional right or prohibition, for example, impairing vested rights or violating the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>See Evans, </em>slip op. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In the present case, to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent regarding retroactive application, we look to RUPA\u2019s applicability provision, \u00a7 9A-1204, and UPA\u2019s termination provision, \u00a7 9-1001. As we stated in <em>Bank of America v. Stine, </em>379 Md. 76, 85-86, 839 A.2d 727, 732-33 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">\"... \u2018[W]hen the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, ... [we read it in context, together with the other statutes] on the same subject, harmonizing them to the extent possible.... \u2019 <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 196, 204, 760 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>1087, 1091 (2000).... [W]e will presume that \u2018the Legislature\u2019 intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law\u201d <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 234 (2003)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In the UPA-RUPA coexistence scheme adopted by the Legislature we find no clear legislative intent to have RUPA retroactively apply to the circumstances of the present case. Read together, \u00a7 9A-1204 and \u00a7 9-1001 merely make clear the date on which the UPA-RUPA coexistence scheme ceased to exist. Had the Legislature intended RUPA to govern events such as evolved regarding East Park during 2002, it could have provided so in a number of ways. Instead, the Legislature chose, as codified at \u00a7 9A-1204(c), to give East Park the option to bring itself under RUPA for activities occurring during the transition period. East Park did not exercise that option.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Moreover, but of lesser significance, we agree with the Circuit Court and the Withdrawing Partners that the phrase \u201cshall govern,\u201d found several times in \u00a7 9A-1204, intimates prospective application and refers to future partner conduct. The conduct at issue here occurred during 2002. Section 9A-1204(a) makes clear that RUPA would <em>not </em>govern East Park\u2019s partners\u2019 conduct during 2002 unless they so elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">An extensive search for cases in other jurisdictions which may have addressed this question did not yield much; however, the scant authority discovered supports our conclusion that RUPA generally was not intended to have retrospective reach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>BT-I v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>United States, </em>75 Cal.App.4th 1406, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 811 (1999), the California Court of Appeal applied California\u2019s then-repealed UPA in a decision filed nearly a year after California\u2019s RUPA took effect as to all partnerships. 89 Cal.Rptr.2d at 815 n. 4. Although the California Court of Appeal did not employ retrospectivity analysis or explicitly discuss California\u2019s UPA-RUPA coexistence scheme, it nevertheless applied UPA because the partnership at issue was formed before RUPA took full effect and had not elected to be governed by the Revised Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In a subsequent case, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, applying California partnership law, also determined that California\u2019s UPA should be applied subsequent to its repeal. <em>See In re Tsurukawa, </em>287 B.R. 515, 521 n. 6 (9th Cir.BAP 2002). Because the partnership completed its business and the appellee filed its complaint before RUPA took full effect, and the partnership had not elected to be governed by RUPA, the court concluded that UPA applied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The coexistence scheme and the specific language employed by the Maryland Legislature support, rather than rebut, RUPA\u2019s prospective application only. Accordingly, because the Legislature did not express clearly its intention to effect retroactive application, RUPA does not apply and UPA, where applicable, applies to this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The Circuit Court ordered East Park to wind up its affairs and distribute its assets to the partners pursuant to a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>sion that Della Ratta caused East Park\u2019s dissolution in December 2001. The trial judge based this conclusion on his finding that Della Ratta assigned his interest in East Park to the Trust, which had the effect of his withdrawal as East Park\u2019s sole general partner. In light of the Agreement\u2019s anti-assignment clause, and the specific, limited remedy sought by the Withdrawing Partners, we hold that any assignment or attempted assignment of the general partner\u2019s interest was void at its inception and could not have resulted in Della Ratta\u2019s withdrawal or East Park\u2019s dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Under RULPA, a partnership interest in a limited partnership is assignable unless otherwise provided by the partnership agreement. \u00a7 10-702. Article 11(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he General Partner shall not assign, mortgage, or sell his share in the Partnership.... \u201d The parties and the Circuit Court agree that Della Ratta\u2019s purported assignment to the Trust was therefore improper. The dispute is over a specific legal effect of that improper assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">RULPA is silent regarding the legal ramifications of an assignment in contravention of a limited partnership agreement\u2019s anti-assignment clause. Because \u00a7 10-702 is a \u201cdefault rule\u201d and subject to modification by the partnership agreement, the Agreement\u2019s anti-assignment provision should be given effect. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-702. A partnership is a contractual relationship to which the principles of contract law are fully applicable. <em>Klein v. Weiss, </em>284 Md. 36, 63, 395 A.2d 126, 141 (1978). In determining the meaning of contractual language, we objectively interpret the language and, where the language is unambiguous, give effect to its plain meaning. <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>363 Md. 232, 250-51, 768 A.2d 620, 630 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In their amended complaint, the Withdrawing Partners essentially sought a declaration that the Agreement allows an assignment to destroy the partnership. The Agreement, however, is unambiguous in stating that the assignment, mortgage, or sale of a general partner\u2019s interest is prohibited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>objective meaning and purpose of this prohibition is to prevent the general partner from unilaterally altering East Park\u2019s partnership structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In general, we have adopted the rule that an assignment in violation of an anti-assignment clause is invalid and unenforceable. <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Panda-Brandywine, L.P., </em>375 Md. 185, 203, 825 A.2d 462, 472 (2003). We now apply that rule in the context of a limited partnership agreement and, in light of the specific and limited remedy sought by the Withdrawing Partners, hold that Della Ratta\u2019s purported assignment was invalid and unenforceable from its inception. Because there was no effective assignment, Della Ratta did not withdraw and East Park was not dissolved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s declarations that Della Ratta\u2019s assignment implicitly was enforceable, that he withdrew as general partner, and that East Park was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Circuit Court concluded that the Withdrawing Partners had a statutory right to withdraw from East Park. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">RULPA specifically addresses whether a limited partner may withdraw from a limited partnership. \u00a7 10-603 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">(a) <em>When specified by agreement. </em>\u2014 A limited partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at the time or on the happening of events specified in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement does not specify the time or the events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>withdraw, a limited partner may not withdraw before the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">(b) <em>When not specified by agreement. </em>\u2014 A limited partner may withdraw on not less than 6 months\u2019 prior written notice to each general partner at the general partner\u2019s address on the books of the limited partnership if the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(1) The limited partnership was formed before October 1, 1998;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(2) On October 1, 1998, the partnership agreement of the limited partnership did not specify in writing the time or the events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw or a definite time for the dissolution and the winding up of the limited partnership; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">(3) The limited partnership did not amend its partnership agreement on or after October 1, 1998 to specify in writing the time or the events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw or a definite time for the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Section 10-603(b) sets forth conditions which must be satisfied in order for a limited partner to exercise a statutory right to withdraw. We first examine the words of the statute and if, giving them their plain and ordinary meaning, the statute is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ends. <em>Stine, </em>379 Md. at 85, 839 A.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The Withdrawing Partners gave Della Ratta more than six months written notice of their withdrawal and thus satisfied \u00a7 10-603(b). In addition, East Park was formed before 1 October 1998, and the Agreement was not amended on or after that date to specify the time or events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw, satisfying \u00a7\u00a7 10-603(b)(l) &amp; (3), respectively. Of critical importance to the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 position, \u00a7 10-603(b)(2) also must be shown to be satisfied. If the Agreement specified the time or the events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw, then the Circuit Court was incorrect that the Withdrawing Partners had a statutory right to withdraw. In that event, \u00a7 10-603(a) controls and the Withdraw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ing Partners only may withdraw in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">To determine whether \u00a7 10-603(b)(2) was satisfied requires interpretation of the partnership agreement. The Remaining Partners point to four Agreement provisions which they contend specify the time or events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw, thus satisfying \u00a7 10-603(b)(2). Article 11(d) allows a limited partner to transfer his or her interest to limited categories of relatives, subject to the other partners\u2019 right of first refusal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Article 11(f) provides a mechanism to handle a partner\u2019s incompetency or bankruptcy and grants the other partners the right to buy-out the incompetent or bankrupt partner\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Article ll(k) allows a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>partner to pledge his or her partnership interest as security for a loan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Should that partner incur a lien on his interest, the other partners may act against that partnership interest pursuant to Article 11(d). Article 13 concerns a limited partner\u2019s failure to satisfy a capital call or comply with an Agreement covenant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the event of such failure, the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>partner is deemed in default and his or her partnership interest sold to the other partners or a third-party selected by the general partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">These Agreement provisions primarily preserve certain rights for the partnership vis-\u00e1-vis consanguinity limits on the transferability of a partner\u2019s interest, and for the remaining partners as regards a partner who declares bankruptcy, suffers a lien, or falls into default. The word \u201cwithdrawal,\u201d as used in \u00a7 10-603, connotes more, we think.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Our construction of the word \u201cwithdrawal\u201d comes from our review of \u00a7\u00a7 10-402, 10-602, <em>&amp; </em>10-604. Section 10-402 defines the \u201cevents of withdrawal\u201d of a general partner and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>A person ceases to be a general partner of a limited partnership upon the happening of any of the following events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">(1) The person\u2019s withdrawal from the limited partnership as provided in \u00a7 10-602 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">(2) The person\u2019s removal as a general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">(3) Unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement or with the consent of all partners, the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">(i) Making an assignment for the benefit of creditors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">(ii) Filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">(in) Being adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or having entered against him an order or relief in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">\u00a7 10-602 relates to a general partner\u2019s withdrawal and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">A general partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at any time by giving written notice to the other partners, but if the withdrawal notice violates the partnership agreement, the limited partnership may recover from the \"withdrawing general partner damages for breach of the partnership agreement and offset the damages against the amount otherwise distributable to the withdrawing general partner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">\u00a7 10-604 concerns distributions upon the withdrawal of a partner and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, on \"withdrawal any withdrawing partner is entitled to receive any distribution to which the partner is entitled under the partnership agreement and, if not other provided in the partnership agreement, the partner is entitled to receive, within a reasonable time after withdrawal, the fair value of the partner\u2019s partnership interest in the limited partnership as of the date of withdrawal, based on the partner\u2019s right to share in distributions from the limited partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">Because these provisions are part of RULPA\u2019s statutory scheme, we presume that the Legislature intended them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law. <em>Stine, </em>379 Md. at 85-86, 839 A.2d at 732-33. Accordingly, the term \u201cwithdrawal\u201d must have a consistent meaning in all three sections. In addition, that meaning should not render another part of the statute meaningless or nugatory. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 839 A.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Section 10-602 is the general-partner counterpart to \u00a7 10-603. In defining the events of withdrawal of a general partner, \u00a7 10^02 lists not only \u00a7 10-602, but also a general partner\u2019s removal, bankruptcy, or insolvency. If the word \u201cwithdrawal\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 10-602 and 10-603 were to encompass the Agreement\u2019s removal, bankruptcy, and insolvency provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 10-402(2) &amp; (3) would be rendered redundant and meaningless. \u201cWithdrawal\u201d cannot be as broad as the Remaining Partners urge.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Moreover, \u201cwithdrawal\u201d must have a consistent meaning in \u00a7\u00a7 10-603 &amp; 10-604. The distribution upon withdrawal referred to in \u00a7 10-604 would be paid by the partnership, not by a third-party purchaser or individual partners. This must be the same type of withdrawal contemplated by the Legislature in \u00a7 10-603. Harmonized, \u00a7\u00a7 10-603 &amp; 10-604 essentially allow a partner to \u201ccash out\u201d his or her equity before the partnership terminates. That is a different scenario than the events provided for in Agreement sections 11(d), 11(f), ll(k), and 13 where a partner would receive payment from a third-party or other partners. We conclude that the Agreement, within the meaning of \u00a7 10-603(a), does not undertake to specify the time or the events on the occurrence of which a limited partner may withdraw from East Park. We hold that the Withdrawing Partners had a statutory right to withdraw from East Park and affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The Circuit Court determined that Della Ratta did not have the authority to issue the capital call in controversy here and that, even if he were imbued with such authority, advancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the due date, under these circumstances, was a breach of his fiduciary duty as general partner and in bad faith. Because we agree with the Circuit Court that Della Ratta breached his fiduciary duty and acted in bad faith, we shall assume, without deciding, he had the authority to issue the capital call.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">To determine whether Della Ratta\u2019s actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith we undertake a two-stage review. First, we review for clear error the Circuit Court\u2019s underlying findings of fact, leaving them undisturbed if supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Colandrea, </em>361 Md. at 394, 761 A.2d at 911. Second, applying a <em>de novo </em>standard, we must determine whether the trial judge correctly concluded that the facts, as he found them to be, legally constituted a breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith. <em>See Miller, </em>362 Md. at 372, 765 A.2d at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The Circuit Court found that \u201ca significant motivation for Della Ratta issuing the capital call was to squeeze out some of the limited partners.\u201d The trial judge did not believe Della Ratta\u2019s testimony regarding his motivation for issuing the capital call and found Della Ratta\u2019s actions to be \u201ccompletely self-serving.\u201d In addition, the Circuit Court found that Della Ratta advanced the date of the capital call in order to \u201cout-maneuver\u201d the Withdrawing Partners and block them from exercising their statutory right to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Circuit Court further found that Della Ratta\u2019s failure to explore alternatives \u201cless oppressive\u201d than the capital call showed a lack of good faith, particularly because such options were readily available at the time. Expert testimony adduced before the trial court established that financing was available at historically low rates and that refinancing would have been prudent and typical in East Park\u2019s business under the circumstances. Nevertheless, Della Ratta never explored refinancing even though he told the limited partners he would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We conclude that the Circuit Court\u2019s findings of fact were supported by the record and not clearly erroneous. The trial judge\u2019s findings largely were based on credibility determinations which ordinarily will not be disturbed by an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>court. In addition, the written correspondence between Della Ratta and the Withdrawing Partners tends to confirm the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions by demonstrating, in Della Ratta\u2019s own words, his advancement of the capital call due date in response to the Withdrawing Partners\u2019 withdrawal notice. We note that the Remaining Partners did not point to in their briefs any evidence contradicting the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusions. Indeed, they did not challenge the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The partnership relationship is a fiduciary one, a relation of trust. <em>Allen v. Steinberg, </em>244 Md. 119, 128, 223 A.2d 240, 246 (1966). Managing or general partners particularly owe a fiduciary duty to inactive partners. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the partnership relationship carries with it the requirement of utmost good faith and loyalty. <em>Herring v. Offutt, </em>266 Md. 593, 597, 295 A.2d 876, 879 (1972). As Justice Cardozo, then Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cMany forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm\u2019s length are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties. A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the \u2018disintegrating erosion\u2019 of particular exceptions____Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANRR\"><em>Meinhard v. Salmon, </em>249 N.Y. 458, 164 N.E. 545 (1928) (quoted in <em>Herring, </em>266 Md. at 597, 295 A.2d at 879).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The Remaining Partners analogize the present case to one occurring in a corporate setting and then rely on <em>Lerner v. Lemer Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 750 A.2d 709 (2000), in which the Court of Special Appeals held that a reverse stock split which had the effect of eliminating a minority shareholder was proper and justified. Although we have analogized the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>tionship between general and limited partners to that between corporate directors and shareholders, <em>Klein, </em>284 Md. at 59, 395 A.2d at 139, we find the Remaining Partners\u2019 reliance on <em>Lemer </em>inapt here. In <em>Lemer, </em>the force-out of the minority shareholder was preceded by twelve years of internal conflict and dissension. 132 Md.App. at 49, 750 A.2d 709. The corporation had spent over $2,000,000 in legal fees to resolve disputes with the minority shareholder and the time spent in litigation had diverted executive officers from managing the corporation. <em>Id. </em>These facts, which surely influenced the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the force-out was lawful, are much different than the facts presented here. Della Ratta did not act to force-out the Withdrawing Partners in response to a longstanding or resource-draining dispute among the partners. Rather, the singular dispute at issue here arose only after Della Ratta issued the capital call and tried to force-out the Withdrawing Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The Remaining Partners also ask us to apply the business judgment rule, an accepted principle applied to corporate matters, as part of Maryland partnership law. That rule, codified at Md.Code (1975, 1999 RepLVoL), \u00a7 2-405.1 of the Corporations and Associations Article, insulates business decisions made by those lawfully in charge of corporate decision-making from judicial review, absent a showing that the officers or directors acted fraudulently or in bad faith. <em>See NAACP v. Golding, </em>342 Md. 663, 673, 679 A.2d 554, 559 (1996). We need not decide here whether the business judgment rule applies to partnerships. Even if we were to apply it as requested, the business judgment rule requires that the decision maker act in good faith and on an informed basis. <em>See Yost v. Early, 87 </em>Md.App. 364, 377, 589 A.2d 1291 (1991). As found by the Circuit Court, Della Ratta acted in bad faith and was not fully informed of alternative business possibilities because he did not explore, despite saying he would, refinancing options for the Aegon Loan. Indeed, the Circuit Court did not find credible Della Ratta\u2019s purported business reasons for issuing the capital call in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>We affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s decision that Della Ratta breached his fiduciary duty to the Withdrawing Partners and acted in bad faith.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the sole general partner, Della Ratta owed a high fiduciary duty to the Withdrawing Partners, all of whom were inactive limited partners. Della Ratta\u2019s decision not to pursue refinancing options after assuring the Withdrawing Partners he would, and his decision to force-out the Withdrawing Partners and place them into default, did not comport with his fiduciary duty and were in bad faith. Moreover, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the Remaining Partners from enforcing the capital call.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Although it is not entirely clear from the record, it appears that the Circuit Court\u2019s final judgment was based in part upon its finding that Della Ratta assigned his East Park interest and thereby caused the partnership\u2019s dissolution. Pursuant to those findings, the Circuit Court ordered East Park to wind up its business affairs and distribute its assets to the partners. Because we find that conclusion regarding dissolution to be erroneous, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">.

The Withdrawing Partners suggest that an assignor is estopped from challenging the validity of his assignment and enforcing an anti-assignment clause. We need not decide that question. As the Remaining Partners point out, Della Ratta is not alone in challenging his purported assignment. Several other East Park partners seek* enforcement of the anti-assignment clause. They were not parties to the assignment and did not waive the anti-assignment clause.

Although we have concluded that UPA, not RUPA, applies to the present case, we note without deciding that Della Ratta\u2019s actions may have been unlawful under either Act. The Remaining Partners contend that RUPA lowers the standard to which a general partner must conform his conduct. Even if we were to accept that contention, under RUPA, general partners nonetheless must discharge their duties and \"exercise any rights <em>consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d </em>\u00a7 9A-404(d) (emphasis added).
