We find no error in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On Sunday morning, September 16, 2001, David Triggs (hereinafter \u201cPetitioner\u201d) made the first of dozens <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of calls to his ex-wife, Pamela Triggs (hereinafter \u201cMrs. Triggs\u201d), who lived in Montgomery County, in violation of a protective order prohibiting him from having any contact with her. When he made many of the calls, which continued over a four-day period, Petitioner threatened to rape and murder his ex-wife and murder their three children, who were with him during a scheduled visitation when he called.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Petitioner and Mrs. Triggs were married for almost seven and a half years when they divorced on March 1, 2002. They had three children together, who were eight, six, and four at the time of their divorce. Petitioner\u2019s four-day \u201creign of terror,\u201d as Judge Ann S. Harrington, Circuit Court for Montgomery County, called it, was the culmination of a long history of a troubled relationship filled with domestic abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In her victim impact statement, Mrs. Triggs described some of Petitioner\u2019s controlling and abusive behavior that occurred over the course of their marriage and during the period at issue during this case. According to Mrs. Triggs, Petitioner, in the past, had held electric hedge clippers to her throat, pointed a gun to her head, fired a gun at her, and raped her four times. In 1996, she obtained her first protective order after Petitioner shot at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>When Mrs. Triggs attempted to leave her husband, Petitioner harassed her friends who were helping her, causing them to get peace orders against him. Petitioner also harassed Mrs. Triggs at work and threatened to kill her co-workers, which resulted in her place of work closing for two days and hiring security for three weeks. Mrs. Triggs claims she \u201clost [her] job because of him.\u201d In addition, the couple lost their home and Mrs. Triggs\u2019s credit record was ruined when Petitioner refused to sign the papers to sell their home, telling the realtor he preferred to have the home foreclosed so as to \u201cdestroy\u201d Mrs. Triggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Mrs. Triggs also described how Petitioner verbally abused her and attempted to control her every move and thought. He dictated the types of clothes she could wear (\u201cno sweatpants or baggy clothes allowed\u201d), taped her telephone calls, removed her car radio, and disabled her car on several occasions. During the month before they separated, he would wake her up every time she 'fell asleep, \u201callowing only one hour a night.\u201d After they separated, Mrs. Triggs related how Petitioner would tell the children to \u201ctell mommy her cement shoes are coming,\u201d \u201ctell mommy I am going to cut her head off,\u201d \u201ctell mommy she doesn\u2019t have long to live,\u201d and \u201ctell mommy I\u2019m watching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">On September 26, 2000, Mrs. Triggs obtained her second order of protection from the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County. She stated she was afraid for her life because her husband had shot at her in the past and sought the order because he \u201cwanted her to get an apartment and prostitute herself to support the family\u201d and threatened to \u201cburn her like a witch on a stick\u201d if she did not comply. The court issued an order, effective for one year, requiring Petitioner to refrain from threatening or abusing Mrs. Triggs and to begin counseling immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">On March 28, 2001, the court amended the September 26 protective order pursuant to Mrs. Triggs\u2019s emergency motion to modify the order, ordering, among other things, that Petitioner have \u201cno contact\u201d with Mrs. Triggs, that he could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>take the children out of the state or out of school \u201cif it was not his scheduled time,\u201d and that he must abide by a two-week visitation schedule requiring him to pick up his children from school on Friday and drop them off at school on Monday. One month later, in April 2001, Petitioner violated the protective order by banging on Mrs. Triggs\u2019s door in the middle of the night. Mrs. Triggs called the police, who arrested Petitioner when he tried to flee the apartment complex in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">While he was in jail awaiting trial, Petitioner sent numerous letters to his children containing disturbing references to Mrs. Triggs and their marriage. Mrs. Triggs filed a complaint about the letters with the police commissioner because she feared for her and her children\u2019s personal safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On July 28, 2001, Petitioner was convicted for violating the March 28 amended protective order. He was sentenced to 90 days in the Montgomery County Detention Center, with 36 days suspended and credit for 54 days, and one year of supervised probation. He was ordered, again, to have no contact with Mrs. Triggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In mid-September 2001, a bench warrant was issued from the Circuit Court for Petitioner\u2019s arrest because Petitioner was telling his children that he wanted to put his wife in \u201ccement shoes.\u201d Because of a technical problem with the warrant, however, the Sheriffs Office for Montgomery County could not arrest Petitioner before he picked up his children on September 14, 2001, for his scheduled two-week visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">On September 16, 2001, at approximately 11:45 on Sunday morning, Petitioner made the first of more than fifty calls occurring over a four-day period to Mrs. Triggs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>called Mrs. Triggs while she was at home alone in her apartment in Gaithersburg. After Mrs. Triggs reminded Petitioner that he should not be calling her because of the protective order, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about a piece of paper, are you going to talk to me, you need to talk to me.\u201d When she did not respond, he continued saying, \u201cGod dammit, Pamela, these children are dead by the end of this weekend. I don\u2019t want them, I want you, but I will kill them.\u201d Mrs. Triggs hung up and called the police immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Three Gaithersburg police officers arrived at Mrs. Triggs\u2019s house in response to her call. While she waited for the police, the phone rang about six times with the \u201cCaller-ID\u201d showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s name and number. When the police arrived, she handed her phone to Officer Chris Vance, who listened to the messages that Petitioner had left. Officer Vance testified that the messages contained, threats that \u201cif she [didn\u2019t] call him back, he [would] kill the kids.\u201d After being advised by the police that it was not safe for her to remain at home, Mrs. Triggs went to a friend\u2019s house. Officer Vance subsequently requested a warrant for Petitioner\u2019s arrest, which was issued late that afternoon. Petitioner continued to call Mrs. Triggs\u2019s phone and leave messages, making a total of fourteen calls that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On Monday morning, September 17, 2001, Mrs. Triggs met with the Fugitive Division of the Sheriffs Office to assist them in their efforts to find Petitioner. Petitioner made four calls to Mrs. Triggs on Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On Tuesday, September 18, 2001, Petitioner made a total of twelve calls to Mrs. Triggs. At one point, he claimed he was giving one of their sons \u201cAmbient,\u201d a sleeping pill. He also asked Mrs. Triggs, who is a nurse, \u201cwhat does it mean when your respirations only get to one ... when your breathing, respirations are only one a minute.\u201d He also threatened to \u201cbreak [the children\u2019s] arms and their legs and then their neck.\u201d In another recorded call, he stated, \u201cIn about two hours I\u2019m going to call you with an interstate number or an exit number off of 270 where I\u2019m going to leave something for you, or somebody.\u201d In yet another recorded call, he told her that she was \u201cdown by one\u201d child and \u201cthat will leave only two.\u201d He also told her that he was \u201cgetting a very itchy trigger finger.\u201d In still yet another recorded call, he said \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t care what [the] court orders, what laws or whatever you\u2019ve got. It makes no difference to me ... I\u2019m either going to be dead or in jail, and that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">At approximately nine or ten at night on September 18, while several sheriffs deputies waited with Mrs. Triggs at her home, Petitioner called and demanded that she meet him at a designated location. Petitioner said that Mrs. Triggs \u201chad to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>jump through hoops of fire to get to [her] kids and [her] first hoop was going to be this place, Good Time Auto.\u201d He told her to be at the auto shop by 11:00 p.m. Mrs. Triggs decided to meet him as he requested as part of a plan with the Sheriffs Office to locate Petitioner and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Mrs. Triggs, however, did not meet Petitioner at the auto shop because the officers decided it was unsafe for her to do so because \u201cthe buildings were dark and there were two men standing outside.\u201d When she did not meet him there, he called again, after midnight. When Mrs. Triggs told Petitioner she was afraid of meeting him, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you yet.\u201d Petitioner then told Mrs. Triggs that, waiting for her at Good Time Auto, were \u201cfour men ... and they are there to rape you while I listen on the other phone to you scream.\u201d Mrs. Triggs then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">He said that he was going to beat me, and he was going to torture me, and then he was going to rape me and then he would kill me, and then he was going to shove his cock in my mouth. And he said that if I didn\u2019t do it, he said I would never see my children while I was alive, he kept telling me, \u201cMake no bones about it, you are dead tonight, you will die tonight, it\u2019s up to you whether or not you see your children before you do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Petitioner then called again, telling Mrs. Triggs that he still wanted her to go to Good Time Auto. When she told him that she was in a \u201csafe place,\u201d Petitioner became \u201cvery upset\u201d and his voice went \u201cflat.\u201d He then said, \u201cWell, now you need to pick one.\u201d \u201cPick one child to die, it is time for another one to die, you need to pick one.\u201d Mrs. Triggs, who now was being encouraged by the deputies to continue talking with Petitioner because they had been able to trace his cell phone to Ocean City, said that she could not pick a child and tried to get him to talk about other things. Mrs. Triggs testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">He kept saying, \u201cOh, well, if you can\u2019t pick one, I will.\u201d And he got my daughter on the phone and she was kind of real sleepy, she is like, \u201cMommy?\u201d And I am like, \u201cHi, baby.\u201d And she is like, \u201cMommy?\u201d And I am like, \u201cAre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>you okay?\u201d And he goes, \u201cUh, uh, uh, say goodbye to mommy forever.\u201d And I heard her scream.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Mrs. Triggs testified that she was so hysterical that she could not get back on the phone with Petitioner anymore. Petitioner called again, leaving a message. Sargent Maxwell Uy listened to the message and testified that Petitioner said, \u201cI hope you know a good orthopaedic surgeon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">At this point, Petitioner had been located in Ocean City, and officers there were negotiating with him to try to get him to release the children. Petitioner was apprehended on September 19, 2001, and Mrs. Triggs\u2019s children were returned to her physically unharmed later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">During the period of September 16 to September 19, while Petitioner was calling Mrs. Triggs, he also called and threatened his mother, grandmother, sisters, and nieces and nephews, who, because they lived near Ocean City, were escorted to the police department for their own safety. While he was in jail for the second time awaiting trial, Petitioner sent numerous letters to his children and to his sister that contained disturbing references about Mrs. Triggs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">On October 18, 2001, Petitioner was indicted by the State on the following forty-three charges: one count of telephone misuse,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thirty counts of violating a protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>order,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> four counts of harassment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and eight counts of telephone threats.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>note 2 for a chart of the calls that were charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>During a pre-trial hearing, Judge Harrington of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, heard, among other things, Petitioner\u2019s motion to strike duplicitous counts. Petitioner argued that the telephone misuse charge and the harassment charges were the same and that the thirty counts of violating a protective order were duplicitous because they constituted a course of conduct instead of \u201cseparate incidents.\u201d The court denied his motion, noting that the \u201cState in its assertion has some technical or record procedure to identify each and every call, there is a time when a connection occurs, there is a time when a connection disconnects____If it constitutes a violation of law, regardless of how brief it is, if it can be verified and proven, so be it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Following a jury trial, Petitioner was convicted of thirty of the forty-three counts: one count of telephone misuse, four counts of harassment, seven counts of telephone threats, and eighteen counts of violating a protective order. At the sentencing hearing, conducted about two months after the trial, the court sentenced Petitioner to three-years imprisonment for the telephone misuse conviction, consecutive six month sentences for each of the harassment and telephone threat convictions, and consecutive one-year sentences totaling eighteen years for each violation of a protective order conviction. The sentences resulted in a term of imprisonment totaling twenty-six years and six months. When she imposed the sentence, Judge Harrington stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">It is ... extremely significant to me that these offenses occurred when you were already on probation for violating a protective order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">There is evidence before me that you have said that you have no regard for any court order that the Court might put in place and no regard for any law that might be enacted because you are simply not going to adhere to it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>I don\u2019t know how you got the information as to where Ms. Triggs was now located but I think it\u2019s apparent in letters you sent even after being convicted of these offenses, that you had that information and you were using your knowledge of it when everybody had gone to great lengths on the State\u2019s side to try to keep you from knowing that, to further torment her with your ability to control where she goes and what she does even when you are confined....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">I think clearly there is an obsession there that nothing that the Court or the laws ... have been able to dislodge....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">the concern for me in formulating a sentence in this case is really the aspect of protection, not rehabilitation, not general deterrence, but protection for the family involved in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the sentences for harassment and telephone threats and affirmed the eighteen convictions and sentences for violating a protective order. With respect to the harassment and telephone threats, the court concluded that Petitioner was punished for the same conduct under Section 32-19A of the Montgomery County Code, regarding harassment, and Section 555A of Article 27 of the Maryland Code, regarding telephone threats. Applying <em>Miles v. State, </em>349 Md. 215, 707 A.2d 841 (1998), the intermediate appellate court determined that the sentences for harassment and telephone threats merged under the rule of lenity because the county ordinance did not \u201cclearly indicate an intent of cumulative punishment when the conduct also violated another statute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">With respect to the eighteen counts of violating a protective order, the Court of Special Appeals observed that Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article provides penalties \u201cfor each offense\u201d of violating a protective order. \u201cBecause each call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>constituted a separate \u2018offense,\u2019 \u201d the court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s eighteen convictions for violating a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Triggs v. State, </em>379 Md. 225, 841 A.2d 340 (2004), which presented the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Where Petitioner was convicted of harassing and threatening his wife, by telephone, over a period of two days, was it error to impose separate, one-year, consecutive sentences as to each of eighteen convictions under the Family Law statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Although Petitioner frames his question in terms of the multiple sentences only and does not address the multiple offenses and convictions, he maintained at oral argument, and the State likewise conceded this point, that his argument necessarily implicates what we have called the \u201cunit of prosecution,\u201d which arises in the context of determining whether the charging of multiple offenses is appropriate. Our focus in this opinion, thus, is the unit of prosecution the General Assembly intended in order to trigger the penalty provisions for violating a protective order. When a protective order requires an abuser to have \u201cno contact\u201d with a victim, we conclude that repeated calls constitute separate acts and therefore separate offenses for the purposes of the sentencing provisions requiring penalties \u201cfor each offense\u201d in Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">When sentencing criminal defendants, \u201c[i]t is well settled that \u2018[a] judge is vested with very broad discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 199, 772 A.2d 273, 277 (2001)(quoting <em>Poe v. State, </em>341 Md. 523, 531, 671 A.2d 501, 505 (1996)). \u201cThe judge is accorded this broad latitude to best accomplish the objectives of sentencing \u2014 punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 772 A.2d at 277 (quoting <em>State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 679, 602 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1992)). Maryland recognizes three grounds for appellate review of sentences: \u201c(1) whether the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment or violates other constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>requirements; (2) whether the sentencing judge was motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; and (3) whether the sentence is within statutory limits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 772 A.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 516, 671 A.2d 495, 496 (1996)); <em>see also Jennings v. State, </em>339 Md. 675, 682-84, 664 A.2d 903, 907 (1995). In this case, in order to determine whether Petitioner\u2019s sentence was legal we must determine what unit of prosecution the Legislature intended when it established the crime of violating a protective order. We apply \u201cour normal rules of statutory construction in determinating the legislative intent regarding the proper unit of prosecution and the appropriate unit of punishment in respect to violations of any criminal statute.\u201d <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 478, 842 A.2d 743, 747 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Petitioner does not maintain that his sentence is unconstitutional or that Judge Harrington was motivated by ill-will or prejudice; rather, he contends that it was error to impose separate, one-year sentences under the Family Law Article because the penalty provisions for violating a protective order under the statute are ambiguous. In such an instance, he maintains, merging the offenses is required under the rule of lenity, a rule of statutory construction that turns multiple offenses into a single course of conduct when it is uncertain as to whether the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Describing the calls as occurring in \u201cflurries\u201d or \u201cclusters\u201d because some of the calls occurred within minutes of each other, Petitioner also urges that the phone calls should be punished in the aggregate rather than as separate calls. He notes that, under the telephone misuse statute, \u201charassing or threatening telephone calls are punished in the aggregate.\u201d He maintains that the legislative history of the domestic violence statute, which includes the protective order procedure, reflects a focus on protecting victims from domestic abuse and \u201cnot on lengthy incarceration for each one in a flurry of telephone calls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The State argues that the protective order statute is plain and unambiguous, noting that the statute states that a person who violates a protective order is subject to conviction and sentence, \u201cfor each offense.\u201d Because there is no ambiguity, the State maintains that the eighteen separate offenses do not merge under the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">If there is ambiguity in the statute, the State contends, separate sentences are permissible given the statute\u2019s legislative history. Because the purpose of the statute is to protect victims of domestic violence from further abuse, the State maintains that punishing an abuser for each call he makes in violation of the statute is appropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State also argues that treating separate calls as a \u201cflurry\u201d would undermine the purpose of the statute because such an interpretation would give an abuser a \u201cpass\u201d to \u201ccall ... 15, 20, 100 more times in the day and say whatever [he wants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article establishes the crime of violating a protective order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">(a) A person who fails to comply with the relief granted in an ex parte order under \u00a7 4 \u2014 505(a)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subtitle, or in a protective order under \u00a7 4-506(d)(l), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subtitle, is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject, for each offense, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">(1) for a first offense, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days or both; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">(2) for a second or subsequent offense, a fine not exceeding $2,500 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Code, \u00a7 4-509 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Petitioner argues that the rule of lenity applies because it is not clear the General Assembly intended in Section 4-509 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>allow courts to impose consecutive one-year sentences for violating a protective order when the violations consisted of separate calls occurring within relatively close periods of time. The issue in this case thus turns on whether repeated calls constitute separate acts for the purposes of the sentencing provisions requiring penalties \u201cfor each offense\u201d in Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> In <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 692, 827 A.2d 68, 76 (2003), we explained that determining whether the Legislature intended \u201cmultiple sentences for the same offense lturn[s] on the unit of prosecution of the offense and this is ordinarily determined by reference to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 323, 558 A.2d 715, 719-20 (1989)(explaining that, in cases involving multiple punishment, \u201ccumulative sentences for the same offense may under some circumstances be imposed\u201d when specifically authorized by the legislature). We analyze the unit of prosecution when we are faced with multiple punishments deriving from a single statutory provision. <em>Purnell, </em>375 Md. at 692, 827 A.2d at 76.

Law\u2019s Protections, </em>Wash. Post, Feb. 10, 1992, at Dl.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The General Assembly has continued to strengthen the domestic violence statute. In 1994, for example, the General Assembly added a provision allowing a police officer to arrest an abuser without a warrant. 1994 Md. Laws, ch. 728. In 1995, the General Assembly allowed the court to waive filing fees for the issuance of a temporary ex parte order or a protective order. 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 9. In 1996, the General Assembly provided that a law enforcement officer may remove a firearm from a domestic violence scene. 1996 Md. Laws, ch. 561. In 1997, the General Assembly increased the available relief period that may be granted from 200 days to 12 months. 1997 Md. Laws, ch. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>In 1998, the General Assembly increased the fine for violating a protective order from $500 to $1000 and adopted separate penalties for the first violation and second and subsequent violations. 1998 Md. Laws, ch. 685. When the 1998 legislation was first proposed, House Bill 339 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">(a) A person who fails to comply with the relief granted in ... a protective order ... is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject, for each offense, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 3 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhRo\">According to the House Floor Report, one of the purposes of the bill was to make violating a protective order an offense \u201cover which the District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit court.\u201d The report also notes that, because the terms of imprisonment would be increased, the defendant would have a right to demand a jury trial. Floor Report, H.B. 339 (1998). In addition, \u201cthe proposed increases in the maximum penalties are designed to deter potential violations of an ex parte or protective order.\u201d The purpose of the law was described initially as \u201cincreasing the amount of the fine and the term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">House Bill 339 was amended, however, in a way that established multiple penalties for each offense of violating a protective order. 1998 Md. Laws, ch. 685. The capped fine of $10,000 and maximum punishment of three years was changed to an approach that more clearly penalized the abuser for each offense. After the amendment, Section 4-509 established the current penalty scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">(a) A person who fails to comply with the relief granted in ... a protective order ... is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject, for each offense, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">(1) <em>for a first offense, </em>a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days or both; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">(2) <em>for a second or subsequent offense, </em>a fine not exceeding $2,500 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">1998 Md. Laws, ch. 685 (emphasis added). Finally, the Revised Fiscal Note for House Bill 339 stated that \u201c[t]his amended bill increases the penalties for violation of a domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>violence order.\u201d The note also observed that \u201c[gjeneral fund revenues could increase or decrease under the bill\u2019s alteration of the monetary penalty provision, depending upon the number of convictions and fines imposed.... \u201d Revised Fiscal Note, H.B. 839 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Our exploration of Section 4-509 reveals that the provision unambiguously provides that a person who violates a protective order may receive cumulative penalties for separate offenses. Not only does the statute use the phrase \u201cfor each offense,\u201d it also establishes subsequent penalties based on the number of times an abuser violates a protective order. Section 4-509 plainly and unambiguously contemplates that a person may be subject to multiple convictions for the multiple offenses of violating a single protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Section 4-509, however, does not define what an \u201coffense\u201d consists of under the Family Law Article. Section 4-506(d), however, of the Family Law Article provides what kind of relief may be included in a final protective order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>to determine whether an offense has been committed in violation of a protective order, a court must review what the protective order required. <em>See Cobum, </em>342 Md. at 254, 674 A.2d at 956 (describing the process for petitioning for a protective order and the different types of relief a court may order). For example, a court may order, among other things, an abuser to stay away from the victim and to have no contact with that victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In this case, after amending the September 26 protective order, the court ordered that Petitioner have \u201cno contact\u201d with Mrs. Triggs <em>\u201cin person or by any other manner, </em>including contact at her residence, place of employment [and the like]\u201d (emphasis added). Additionally, in order to ensure that Petitioner not contact Mrs. Triggs, the court required him to pick up and drop off his children at school, rather than at home, when he had them for visitation every two weeks. The court also designated Mrs. Triggs\u2019s father to serve as an intermediary between Mrs. Triggs and Petitioner should Petitioner need to \u201crelay messages\u201d to Mrs. Triggs in case of an emergency. Finally, the court required the children to call their father twice a week instead of permitting Petitioner to call them. Pursuant to Section 4-506, therefore, Petitioner clearly was ordered to have no contact whatsoever with Mrs. Triggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We have no difficulty concluding that each call constituted prohibited contact and, thus, was a separate and distinct \u201coffense\u201d for the purposes of the penalty provisions in Section 4-509. As our review of the domestic violence statute\u2019s legislative history indicates, the Maryland domestic violence statute reveals a strong legislative intent to protect victims. <em>See Coburn, </em>342 Md. at 252, 674 A.2d at 955 (explaining that the purpose of the domestic violence statute more generally \u201cis to protect and \u2018aid victims of domestic abuse by providing an immediate and effective remedy\u2019 \u201d)(quoting <em>Barbee v. Barbee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>311 Md. 620, 623, 537 A.2d 224, 225 (1988)). In fact, when we construe the statutory language authorizing protective orders within the context of the domestic violence statute\u2019s overall scheme, we discern a clear legislative intent to define each incident of domestic violence as a separate and punishable act. In Section 4-501, for example, \u201cabuse\u201d under the domestic violence statute is defined as <em>\u201cany </em>of the following acts\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">(i) an <em>act </em>that causes serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">(ii) an <em>act </em>that places a person eligible for relief in fear of imminent serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">(iii) assault in any degree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">(iv) rape or sexual offense as defined by Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 462 through 464C of the Code or attempted rape or sexual offense in any degree; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">(v) false imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 4-501 of the Family Law Article (1984, 1999 Rep. Vol.)(emphasis added). In <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 265, 604 A.2d 483, 487 (1992), we explained that \u201c[w]e have ... construed the use of the word \u2018any\u2019 in a criminal statute to mean \u2018every\u2019 and to support a legislative intent authorizing multiple convictions.\u201d As it thus takes only one act under Section 4-501 to constitute abuse under the domestic violence statute in order for a court to issue a protective order, <em>see Katsenelenbogen, </em>365 Md. at 134-35, 775 A.2d at 1256-57 (upholding a trial court\u2019s decision that one instance of shoving constituted \u201cabuse\u201d under the act in order to issue a protective order), it follows that it should take only one act, such as a telephone call, to constitute an \u201coffense\u201d in violation of a protective order under Section 4-509, particularly given that the provision mandates penalties \u201cfor <em>each </em>offense\u201d and authorizes multiple convictions. Such an approach is not only logically sound but is also consistent with the statute\u2019s overall scheme to protect victims of domestic violence. By holding that each separate call constitutes contact in violation of a protective order, we are effectuating the purpose of the domestic violence statute, a statute clearly designed to prevent abuse and protect victims of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In <em>State v. McGee, </em>135 N.M. 73, 84 P.3d 690, 693 (2003), the Court of Appeals of New Mexico concluded that each phone call constituted a separate instance of prohibited contact in violation of a protective order. In <em>McGee, </em>the defendant received six consecutive sentences for four violations of a protective order on February 16, 2000, and two other violations occurring on October 2, 2000. <em>Id. </em>at 695. Arguing that he engaged in \u201ca single course of conduct\u201d on two occasions when he made calls in violation of a protective order on two days, the defendant, further, argued he should be \u201csentenced once for each course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The New Mexico intermediate appellate court disagreed, observing that \u201cthe order of protection clearly and unambiguously ordered Defendant not to \u2018contact\u2019 Victim\u201d and that \u201c[t]he legislature has made its intent clear that each violation will be punished separately.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696. Notably, the court reached this conclusion based on penalty language that arguably is less clear than Maryland\u2019s penalty provision, which, unlike the New Mexico statute, clearly mandates penalties \u201cfor each offense.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Similarly, in <em>Walker v. Walker, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York concluded that separate and consecutive sentences could be imposed for \u201ceach separate and distinct\u201d violation of a protective order. 86 N.Y.2d 624, 635 N.Y.S.2d 152, 658 N.E.2d 1025, 1026, (1995).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Walker, </em>while he was jailed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the defendant sent three written communications to his wife in violation of a protective order requiring that he have no contact with his wife. <em>Id. </em>The Family Court sentenced him to three consecutive six-month incarcerations, one for each violation of the protective order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute penalizing the violation of a protective order \u201callow[ed] a maximum of six months\u2019 incarceration only, regardless of the number of willful acts of disobedience against the same order,\u201d the Court of Appeals observed that, under the defendant\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">[A] violator already penalized for willfully failing to obey an order of protection would garner immunity from further official sanction for persistent, separate violations. Such an approach is in no way compelled or warranted by the governing statutes, sentencing principles or reasonable statutory analysis. Its incongruous and untenable result would also constitute an invitation to violate and no incentive to obey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1027 (citation omitted). The court went on to observe that the fact that the defendant \u201cdisobeyed the court\u2019s order from jail serves only to underscore the need for an effective judicial option for appropriate punishment and deterrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without strict enforcement, in the court\u2019s view, the \u201ccore purpose\u201d of the domestic violence statute to protect victims of domestic violence would be frustrated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>We also expressly reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that the statute anticipates that a \u201csingle course of conduct\u201d such as a \u201cflurry\u201d of calls occurring within seconds or minutes of each other should be treated as one offense under the rule of lenity. We first observe that Petitioner\u2019s contention that he was just pressing the redial button is somewhat disingenuous. Although some of the calls for which he was convicted were separated by a minute or minutes, see <em>supra </em>note 2, many of the calls were separated by more than twenty minutes. In fact, in the first call he made to his wife, Petitioner\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about a piece of paper\u201d \u2014 indicates he was doing much more than passively pressing redial: he was intentionally and deliberately contacting his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Moreover, we reject the implication underlying Petitioner\u2019s \u201cflurry\u201d argument that somehow the repeated calls were less violative of the protective order precisely because there were so many of them and because some of them occurred close in time to each other. In fact, as we stated in <em>Boozer:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">The courts of this country have had little difficulty in concluding that separate acts resulting in separate insults to the person of the victim may be separately charged and punished even though they occur in close proximity to each other and even though they are part of a single criminal episode or transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 105, 497 A.2d at 1132 (determining that a defendant may be subject to multiple charges arising out of the same criminal sexual course of conduct); <em>see also Harrell v. State, </em>88 Wis.2d 546, 277 N.W.2d 462, 464-69 (1979)(concluding that, where a defendant was convicted of two counts of rape when twenty-five minutes transpired between acts of sexual intercourse, each act was \u201canalytically separated by considerations of fact and time\u201d and noting that \u201c[e]ach act [was] a further denigration of the victim\u2019s integrity\u201d). As the Court of Appeals of New York observed, if \u201ca violator [of a protective order] already penalized for willfully failing to obey an order of protection would garner immunity from further official sanction for persistent, separate violations,\u201d the result would be \u201can invitation to violate and no incentive to obey.\u201d <em>Walker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>635 </em>N.Y.S.2d 152, 658 N.E.2d at 1027. Because we believe the General Assembly created a penalty scheme in Section 4-509 to give abusers a disincentive to violate protective orders, we reject Petitioner\u2019s \u201cflurry\u201d argument for this reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We conclude that repeated calls constitute separate acts for the purposes of the sentencing provisions requiring penalties \u201cfor each offense\u201d in Section 4-509 of the Family Law Article. In this case, Petitioner received eighteen sentences because he willfully and deliberately flouted an order of protection eighteen times by making eighteen calls in violation of a protective order requiring that he have no contact with Mrs. Triggs. Judge Harrington did not err because Petitioner was convicted of eighteen distinct offenses and because the eighteen sentences Petitioner received were authorized by the penalty provisions of the domestic violence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-9\">.

Because Petitioner made separate phone calls at different times, the State had to prove each separate call and time in order to prove that he made each call in violation of the protective order. Thus, although Petitioner refers to the required evidence test in his argument, the required evidence test would not preclude separate sentences for separate offenses under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">.
