It may be seriously doubted that the jury ever arrived at the question of the responsibility of the undisclosed principal, Susan, and it may very well have been that the jury found the issue of fact as to the making of <em>any </em>agreement in favor <em>of </em>the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">Upon the argument of this motion stress was laid upon claimed error in certain portions of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">\u201cGreat caution should be exercised by a trial judge in setting aside a verdict for error in his instructions to the jury, and he should do so only when entirely satisfied that his error is unmistakable, and unquestionably harmful.\u201d <em>Jackiewicz vs. United Illuminating Co., </em>106 Conn. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Therefore, the motion to set aside this verdict is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
