The commissioner finds in part that on or about November 10, 1938, the claimant entered into a written contract with the employer-respondent for the installation of weather-stripping for an agreed price; that during the course of such work the claimant found that certain window cords in the windows being repaired by him were broken and needed replacement; that he telephoned an authorized representative of the employer-respondent, advising him of such condition, whereupon it was agreed that the claimant should install new window cords wherever he felt the same to be necessary throughout the entire house for the agreed rate of seventy-five cents per hour, the cord to be furnished by the employer-respondent; that the claimant claimed that the removal of the old weather-stripping was no part of his original contract fo.r the installation of weather-stripping and that the removal of the old weather-stripping was made necessary only because of the fact that a new window cord had to be installed in the window in question; that the claimant was injured in removing such old weather-stripping; that as part of the original contract all old weather-stripping was to be removed from all windows before the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>put on the new weather'Stripping; that the claimant, in connec' tion with his contract concerning the weather'Stripping, con' tracted to do the work according to his own methods and with' out being subject to the control of the employer-respondent except as to the result of his work, and that at the time he re' ceived his injury he was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">If there is evidence to legally support the finding of the com' missioner, then it cannot be modified by this court. \u201cSuch appeals are heard by the Superior Court upon the record filed by the commissioner in that court. The Superior Court does not retry the facts nor hear evidence. It considers no evidence other than that certified to it by the commissioner, and then for the limited purpose of determining whether or not the finding should be corrected, or whether there was any evidence to sup' port in law the conclusions reached. It cannot review the con' elusions of the commissioner when these depend upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. Its power in the correction of the finding of the commissioner is analogous to, and its method of correcting the finding similar to, the power and method of the Supreme Court of Errors in cor' recting the findings of the Superior Court.\u201d Practice Book (1934) \u00a7256.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">I quote briefly from a transcript of the evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cCommissioner \u2014 Mr. Clough, you say that it was while you were in Mrs. Bartlett\u2019s apartment, I think, that you noticed there were some window cords needing replacement? A \u2014 No, not in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Commissioner \u2014 In whose apartment? A \u2014 The first apart' ment here, in Killam\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Commissioner \u2014 And you noticed there were window cords and things necessary to be done and you called Mr. Leddy? A \u2014 I think I did, two or three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">Commissioner \u2014 You told him that you needed some cord and you had to fix the window casings? A \u2014 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">Commissioner \u2014 Did he come up to see? A \u2014 He sent his man who was in the office with the cord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Commissioner \u2014 I mean did Mr. Leddy come down? A \u2014 No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">Commissioner \u2014 So Mr. Leddy did not come down to see what was to be done? A \u2014 No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Commissioner \u2014 He did not come down and look over the windows and tell you not only what was to be done but how it was to be done? A \u2014 No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Commissioner \u2014 Did the man he sent down with the cord go through the house with you? A \u2014 No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">Commissioner \u2014 In other words, what it really amounted to is this, as I gather it; you talked with Mr. Leddy and you told him that as you went through the house there were window cords \u25a0necessary and the casings had to be fixed? A- \u2014 That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">Commissioner \u2014 -He told you to go ahead and do it? A \u2014 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">Commissioner \u2014 He did not supervise it and control it in any way? A \u2014 The only thing Mr. Leddy called me about some back windows and the janitor came around and said Mr. Leddy wanted me to fix one back door and some windows while you were on the job. He said anything they ask you for fix it. So I did several things that were not in line with the weather-stripping work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">Commissioner \u2014 Did Mr. Leddy, while you were on the job, or any one representing Mr. Leddy, go down and tell you what to do or how to do it? A \u2014 No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">Commissioner \u2014 Did anybody go down in any way and direct to any extent the work you did? A \u2014 Not while I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">Commissioner \u2014 So you had the complete run of the job? A \u2014 Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">Our Supreme Court of Errors has recently defined the term \"independent contractor.\u201d \u201cOne is an employee if the employer has the right to direct what work shall be done and when and how it shall be done, or in other words, has the general \u25a0control over what work shall be done and how. The independent contractor contracts to produce a given result by methods under his own control, while the employee contracts to produce a given result subject to the lawful orders and control of the employer in the means and methods used; these point in :some degree to the duty of service to the employer.\u201d <em>Cumbo vs. McGurk, Inc., </em>124 Conn. 433, 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The appeal of the claimant is denied and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
