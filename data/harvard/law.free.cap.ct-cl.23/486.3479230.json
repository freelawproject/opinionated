The Quartermaster-General decided adversely to the claim, and transmitted it to the accounting officers of the Treasury. On the 14th June, 1879, the Third Auditor disallowed the claim, and the Second Comptroller concurred. But on the 20th July, 1886, the Second Comptroller ordered that the case be opened, because of newly-discovered evidence produced by the claimant; and on the 13th August, 1886, the Secretary of the Treasury transmitted it to this court under the Revised Statutes, \u00a7 1063.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">The court below dismisses the claimant\u2019s petition without an opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">The decision of the court below is affirmed.
