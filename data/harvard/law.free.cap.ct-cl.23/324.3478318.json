The court overruled the motion, holding that the accounting officers might still adjust the claim, and hence that it was not barred as a Congressional case within the intent of the Bowman Act. (See 20 O. Cls. R., 119, where the motion is reported.) The panics then proceeded to take depositions and finally submitted the case on voluminous proofs and an extended argument. No findings of fact were filed, but the facts on which the court based its present decision are stated, generally, in its opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-7\"><em>Mr. James Lowndes </em>and <em>Mr. Linden Kent </em>for the claimant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-8\"><em>Mr. W.

For six years thereafter this court had jurisdiction under section 1059 of the Revised Statutes <em>u </em>to hear and determine <em>\u201d </em>the matters in dispute between the claimant and the Government; but section 1069 provides that such claims, unless presented to the court <em>\u201c </em>within six years after the claim first accrues, * <em>* </em>* shall be forever barred.\u201d The claim was not presented to the court within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">The accounting officers of the Treasury Department are not authorized to adjust unliquidated damages of this nature, and the claim was not presented there.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">It was before the Secretary of War, but the alleged damages were not calculated nor paid by him, but were rejected prior to 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The last clause of section 3 of the Bowman Act provides that tbis court shall not <em>u </em>have jurisdiction of any claim against the United States which is now (March 3, 1883) barred by virtue of the provisions of any law of the United States\u201d (act of March 3, 1883, 22 Stat.
