On the hearing, the counsel for the Government raised the question of jurisdiction. The court went no further than the petition of the claimant, the principal allegations of which are quoted in its opinion. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-8\"><em>Mr. James B.

Section 1069 of the Revised Statutes provides that all claims cognizable by the Court of Claims shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court within six years after the claim first accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Section 3 of the <em>Bowman Act </em>(22 Sta-t. L., 485), excludes from the jurisdiction of the court under that act \u201cany claim against the United States which is now. (March 3, 1883) barred by virtue of the provisions of any law of the United States. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">It is contended by the claimant that his claim was excluded from the jurisdiction of the court by the <em>Act July </em>4,1864 (13 Stat. L., 381). That act, however, applies only to \u201cclaims growing out of the destruction or appropriation of, or damage to, property by the Army or Navy engaged in the suppression of the rebellion, \u201d but does not extend to express contracts. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>13 Wall., 623; <em>Green\u2019s Case 18 C. </em>Cls. R., 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">As the court has no jurisdiction of the claim under the Bowman Act, the claimant\u2019s petition must be dismissed. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
