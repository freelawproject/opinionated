Bollins and Pres-brey for the payment of $10,000 on account of their claims as attorneys for the Eastern Band of Cherokees, with other enclosures relating to the same matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-11\">\u201c The claim above mentioned is based upon two contracts, bearing date May 15, 1874: One executed by John Boss as chief and the other by Sawuooka and twenty-one others, described as chiefs and headmen of said band.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-12\">\u201cAn attentive examination of the contracts and the circumstances under which the same were executed has raised very grave doubts in my mind whether they are sufficient to bind the Eastern Band of Cherokees collectively in any form. But without stopping to determine that question, I find these contracts are prepared in separate clauses, each referring to subjects more or less distinct in their character, in all of which Mr. Bollins undertook to perform services at a uniform rate of compensation for the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-13\">\u201cBy the provisions of the act of Congress of May 21,1872, these contracts must be <em>1 </em>approved in writing thereon by the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs\u2019 before they can have any force or validity whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-14\">\u201c Each contract, if duly executed, was an entire thing, and could not be altered without th\u00e9 assent of both parties. The approval required by the statute above mentioned is of the contract as made by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-15\">\u201c The approval of a <em>part </em>of the contract only would be in effect the substitution of a new agreement for that made by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-16\">\u201c I find that the only approval of the contracts in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was of that part designated as the 6th clause. This was not an approval of the contracts made by the parties, and therefore the contra\u00e9is are wholly void, for want of approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-3\">\u201cBut, still further, the services provided for in the 6th clause and claimed to have been rendered by Messrs. Rollins and Pres-brey for the Indians were performed in suits pending at the time the contracts bear date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-4\">\u201c These actions were brought by the United States for the benefit of the Indians in the Circuit Court of the U. S. for the western district of North Carolina, under the 11th section of the act of July 15, 1870, by which act the United States undertook to institute and prosecute such suit. No good reason is perceived under the circumstances mentioned i'or permitting these Indians to incur large liabilities in the prosecution of such suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">\u201c Finally, I am fully satisfied from a careful examination of the whole case that the claimants, Messrs.

I am therefore unable to concur in your recommendation that they be paid the sum of $9,600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">\u201c I return herewith the enclosures enumerated in your communication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">\u201c I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\">\u201c2.

Stat., \u00a7 2103) provides the means by which and only by which contracts such as that in question shall be executed, and no claim for services such as those alleged to have been rendered by the claimant is legal or enforceable except under a contract executed in accordance with said statute and duly approved.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b142-8\">Richardson, Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">This case was transmitted to the court by the Secretary of the Interior, under the provisions of the second section of the &lt;\u00a3 <em>Bowman Act \u201d </em>of 1883, chapter 110 (22 Stat. L., 486), which authorizes the head of any Executive Department to transmit to the Court of Claims any claim or matter pending therein which may involve controverted questions of law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">It is urged on the part of the defendants that the controversy involved in the case was finally determined and settled by a former Secretary of the Interior, and could not be re-opened, reexamined, and reconsidered by his successor in office, and that this court can do no more under such a transmission than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>make a- finding to that effect, and to decide and report to the Secretary of the Interior for his guidance and action that the matter is <em>res judicata </em>and he has no further jurisdiction therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">It has long been held in the Executive Departments that when a claim or controversy between the United States and individuals therein pending has once been fully considered, and final action and determination had thereon by any executive officer having jurisdiction of the same, it can not be re-opened, set aside, and a different result ordered by any successor of such officer, except for fraud, manifest error on the face of the proceedings, such as a mathematical miscalculation or newly discovered evidence, presented within a reasonable time and under such circumstances as would be a sufficient cause for granting a new trial in a court of law. This ruling and practice of the Departments has been approved elsewhere and has been sustained by the courts. (9 Opin. Att\u2019y. Gen., 34; 12 id., 172-358; 14 id., 387, 450; 14 id., 275; 15 Pet., 401; <em>Lavalette's Case, </em>1 O. Ols. R., 147; <em>Jackson's </em>Case, 19 id., 504; <em>State of Illinois Case, </em>20 id., 342; <em>McKee\u2019s Case, </em>12 id., 560; <em>Day's Case </em>21 id., 264, and the opinion of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, reported by Senator and Judge David Davis, quoted in Jackson\u2019s Case above referred to.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">But it has never been doubted that any public officer in the Departments may correct his own errors, and open, reconsider, and reverse in whole or in part any case decided by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">It appears that the present controversy arose when Mr. Delano was Secretary of the Interior. The claimants presented an account for $42,236.77, which was examined and reported upon by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and other officers of the Department, and when it reached the Secretary he made upon it the following indorsement (Finding IV):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cDep\u2019t or the Interior, <em>Sept. </em>20,1875.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201cThe within account is hereby allowed for $5,200, in accordance with the action of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the recommendation of the Board of Indian Commissioners, without prejudice to the parties to claim a balance to be still due them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201cC. Delano, Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">This certainly was not a final determination of the merits of the claim, but left the same open for future adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Subsequently the matter was again considered, reported upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, then Mr. Secretary Chandler, recommending the additional payment of $9,500. Upon that report and recommendation, the Secretary, on the 24th of November, 18T5, in a communication set out in fall at the end of the fourth finding, decided that the contract with the Indians upon which the claim was founded had never been legally approved by the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs, as required by law, and that he was satisfied that claimants \u201chad already been paid all that they would justly be entitled to receive for the services rendered by them in behalf of the Eastern Band of Cherokees, or any individual thereof, if those \u25a0contracts had been duly executed and approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Within a few months after that decision, on the 27 th of July, 187G, while Mr. Chandler was still Secretary, the Acting Secretary addressed a letter to the Attorney-G-eneral, set out in full in Finding Y, in which, after stating the proceedings of the Department down to November 24, 1875, when Secretary Chandler disposed of the matter by his letter of that date, he says: \u201cSince that date the Secretary has ordered the case reopened, and granted a rehearing to said claimants. Their claim is now pending before him for decision. I therefore desire your opinion upon the following questions,\u201d then and there propounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Acting Secretary was, for the time being and in this matter, the lawful head of the Department, and his action in referring the case to the Attorney-General, with the statement that the Secretary had ordered it to be re-opened and had granted a rehearing, is conclusive proof of that fact, whether it was done by himself or by order of Secretary Chandler, either in writing or orally. It was so regarded by Secretary Teller, who treated it as pending and unfinished business, and after giving some consideration to it, finally transferred it to this court under the Bowman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In onr opinion the case was not <em>res judicata, </em>but was pending when so transmitted, and we are required to pass upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The defendants contend that the sixth article of the contract upon which this elaim is founded, although approved as required by Revised Statutes, section 2103, the approval was not warranted by law and is of no force, because, as they argue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tbe whole contract of six articles was an entirety and could be approved or disapproved in whole and not in separate parts. This question first arose in the Interior Department under the administration of Secretary Chandler, and, with other questions upon the same and another contract between the parties, not material to this case, was referred to the Attorney-General for his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The Attorney-General, in an opinion approved by him, and written and signed by Solicitor-General Phillips, replied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201c In answer to the first question, I have to say that the above contract with Boss <em>was duly approved. </em>Eollins contracted <em>to do six distinct things upon-a consideration apportioned to </em>each. The authorities hoid, uniformly, I believe, that such a contract is <em>separable. </em>Therefore, in case it needs approval or ratification, this may be limited to one of such things alone, or to more than one, or may extend to all, with the effect of validating the contract for the part approved and no more. (15 Opin. Att\u2019y-Gen., 589.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">It is sufficient to say that we concur in these views, and hold the contract to have been legally approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The defendants further object that John Eoss, the principal' chief, who executed the contract on the part Of the Indians, was without authority to agree to the provisions of the sixth article, and so that article is not binding upon the Indians.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The resolutions of the council, set out in Finding I, do not seem to cover exactly the matters contained in the sixth article of the contract, but the principal chief, Eoss, in mating the contract, did not rely wholly upon those resolutions, but claimed in the contract itself to act \u201cfor and on behalf of the Eastern Band of the Cfterokees, and <em>by virtue of his authority as chief of said band.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">What were the powers and duties of the chief of the band do not appear in the case, and we have no means of knowing whether or not he exceeded his authority. But in view of the fact that his authority was recognized by the district judge of the western district of North Carolina, before whom this contract was executed, as required by law, and that the contract was approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior, and that his authority was never questioned in all the controversies between the parties while the case was long pending in the Interior Department, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that the Indians have had the benefit of the claimants\u2019 services and ar\u00e9 enjoying the fruits of their labor under the contract, we are constrained to hold that his authority is sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The principal controversy between the parties in the Interior Department related <em>to </em>the value of the lands acquired for the Indians. That we have established by the findings; and no question of law arises thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The opinion of the court is that the claimants are entitled to the sum of $10,176.77 beyond what has been paid to them. The clerk will certify these findings, conclusion of law, and this opinion to the Secretary of the Interior for his guidance and action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
