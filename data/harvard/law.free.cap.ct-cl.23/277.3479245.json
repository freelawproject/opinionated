The <em>French Spoliation Act, </em>1885 (\u00a7 3), requires this court to <em>\u201cexamine and determine\u201d \u201cvalidity,\u201d \u201camount,\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cpresent ownership.\u201d </em>Present ownership is not established by the mere production of letters of administration of a person bearing the same name taken out ninety years after the event. The administrator must prove that the deceased whose estate he administered in 1886 was the person who suffered loss in 1796. The nature and sufficiency of the proof will depend on time, jilace, and circumstance, but must be sufficient to satisfy a reasonable mind that the decedent was the veritable claimant who suffered the loss complained of. [Reaffirmed in the cases of the Hiram, <em>post. </em>]</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b298-9\">IV. The French Spoliation Act provides that claimants shall \u201c <em>apply by petition\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1), and that <em>\u201cnotice of all petitions\u201d </em>shall be served on the Attorney-General. (\u00a7 4); the Revised Statutes provide that\u201ct7ie <em>petition shall be verified\u201d </em>by the <em>\u201cclaimant, Ms agent or attorney\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1072), and the rules of the court that <em>\u201c if the petition be verified by the attorney\u201d \u201cor agent,\u201d \u201capower of attorney authorizing him to malee the verification must be filed with it \u201d </em>(Rule 12). The administrator of an underwriter can not avoid those provisions by filing a motion to intervene in the suit of another person. He must come in by a supplemental petition, duly verified.

The ship Betsey, of Salem, cleared from that port for -Canton, China, some time in the year 1799, but with orders from the owners for Batavia, Manilla, or Canton. The vessel went to Batavia and discharged cargo, and then sailed from that port bound home, with a cargo of coffee, pepper, cloves, camphor, tea, and other articles of merchandise. On the 14th of March, 1800, in longitude 57 west, latitude 21\u00b0 IB north, the Bet-sey was captured by the French corvette La Bergere and carried into Cayenne, where she was condemned by the commercial court of the colony. The decree of condemnation recites the examination of the captain of the ship and some of the crew; also that the conduct of the Betsey had been suspicious when hailed; that she had endeavored to elude search ; that she carried 14 guns, 6 of which were iron and 8 wood; also a chest of muskets and ammunition. The master in his examination stated that the 6 cannon, the chest of muskets, and other munitions of war were carried merely for self-defense in the Straits of Sunda, and that all ships which made the voyage to India are generally armed for self-defense. The grounds of condemnation set forth in the decree are as follows: That the Betsey was cleared from Salem precisely under the circumstances under which the President of the United States delivered to American ships commissions of war for taking French ships; that she, under vain pretexts, was armed with 0 cannon and provided with munitions of war for attack and defense; that her maneuver to escape a search, customary and authorized by law, when met by the corvette La Bergbre, rendered her suspicious of being hostile property masked under the American flag; that the crew-list is informal and contrary to the provisions of the regulations of the 23d July, 1704, 21st October, 1744, and 26th July, 1778, concerning navigation in time of war; that the Americans are less excusable than any other nation for infringing them, since they prescribed in a particular and positive manner not only by the treaty of 6th February, 1778, but also by the decree of the Executive Directory of France, that-an addition or modification which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>been placed on the back of the crew-list of the Betsey was a. violation of form and manifest infraction of the treaty; that American ships have attacked and captured French ships, even those of the Government; and that they have been furnished with commissions of war from the President of the United States, and continue to insult the French flag.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">II. The Betsey was a duly registered vessel, measuring 218 tons, built at Wells, in the State of Massachusetts, in the year 1795, and owned by Samuel Gray, of Salem, together with William Gray, jr., Josiah Orne, and Sylvanus Gray, of Boston, as appears by the register November 26, 1796. On February 16, 1799, Josiah Obear was indorsed on the register as master; in the place of Josiah Orne.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">III.

The value of the ship was $8,175 ; the value of the owners\u2019 portion of the cargo $32,156; the freight earnings of the vessel for the voyage $7,333.33. Amounting in all to $47,66433.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The master, Josiah Obear, also had an adventure upon the ship on his own account, consisting of pepper, camphor, and like merchandise for which he had paid at Batavia $3,430.58, and another adventure of the same kind of merchandise on behalf of some of his officers and crew of $645.
