Defendant\u2019s only contention on appeal is that the People\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude one prospective juror evidenced a discriminatory intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in violation of his equal protection rights <em>(see Batson v Kentucky, </em>476 US 79 [1986]).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The transcript of the proceedings reflects that after the second round of jury selection, the People used two peremptory challenges to exclude juror Nos. 3 and 13, the only two black jurors in that particular panel of 18 prospective jurors. At this time, defendant registered an unspecified \u201cchallenge\u201d to the prosecution\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge only as to juror No. 3. Without ruling on whether defendant had made a prima facie case, County Court asked the prosecutor to explain her reasons for excluding this juror. The prosecutor explained that due to responses to certain specified questions, she believed this juror was not sufficiently mature to properly weigh the facts in this case, and that she had excused a nonblack juror for similar reasons <em>(see People v Kern, </em>75 NY2d 638, 650 [1990], <em>cert denied </em>498 US 824 [1990]; <em>People v Starks, </em>238 AD2d 621, 622 [1997], <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 836 [1997]; <em>cf. People v Burroughs, </em>295 AD2d 959 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 534 [2002]). Defense counsel merely noted his continued objection to the exclusion of this juror but did not argue that the prosecution\u2019s challenge was pretextual, despite an unrestricted opportunity to be heard, and the court denied his challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Although a prima facie showing of discrimination can be made based on the challenge of only one juror <em>(see People v Smocum, </em>99 NY2d 418, 422 [2003]; <em>People v Henderson, </em>305 AD2d 940, 940 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>100 NY2d 582 [2003]), here defendant failed to allege facts or circumstances sufficient to raise an inference that the prosecutor exercised the peremptory challenge for a discriminatory purpose and, therefore, he did not satisfy the first step of the <em>Batson </em>analysis <em>(see People v Henderson, supra </em>at 941). Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, which does not have to be persuasive or plausible <em>(see People v Starks, supra </em>at 622), but need only be \u201cfacially permissible\u201d <em>(People v Smocum, supra </em>at 422), was race neutral and, therefore, overcame any inference of discrimination, satisfying the People\u2019s burden of production under step two of the <em>Batson </em>analysis <em>(see People v Dorsey, </em>3 AD3d 590, 591 [2004]; <em>People v Dolphy, </em>257 AD2d 681, 683 [1999], <em>lv denied </em>93 NY2d 872 [1999]; <em>People v Starks, supra). </em>As defense counsel failed to further respond, he did not meet his ultimate burden of showing that the reasons given were merely a pretext for intentional discrimination <em>(see People v Williams, </em>306 AD2d 691, 692 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>1 NY3d 582 [2003]), and we discern no basis upon which to disagree with County Court\u2019s determination that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were race neutral and not pretextual <em>(see People v Smocum, supra </em>at 422).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Cardona, P.J., Crew III, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur.
