Because we find that Rodriguez waived the issue of her removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">In 1984, Rodriguez, a Colombian native, entered the United States as a nonimmi-grant visitor. On April 12, 1990, she married Andre Collier, a United States citizen. The next month, Collier filed an 1-130 visa petition on his wife\u2019s behalf. Apparently, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) never acted on Collier\u2019s petition. During the pendency of the visa petition, INS granted Rodriguez permission to travel to Colombia on two occasions: once in 1991 for a month, and again in 1997. It appears that when she returned to the United States in 1997 following her visit to Colombia, she did not have a valid immigrant visa or other valid admission document in her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">On May 21, 2002, twelve years after Collier\u2019s I-\u00cd30 petition was filed, the INS denied the petition and terminated Rodriguez\u2019s parole status on the ground that her marriage to Collier was not \u201cvalid.\u201d INS also placed Rodriguez in removal proceedings, charging her with violations of: (1) being an alien who attempted to procure an immigration benefit by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i); and (2) being an alien who, at the time of application for admission, lacked possession of a valid entry document, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">On April 15, 2003, Collier filed a second 1-130 petition. On July 16, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, having taken over the duties of the INS) denied the application. At her removal hearing on December 16, 2004, Rodriguez denied the allegation that she sought to procure a visa by fraud, instead claiming a <em>bona fide </em>marriage to Collier, but she did not contest the charge that she attempted to reenter the country without a valid entry document, the \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">On August 25, 2005, the IJ determined Rodriguez was removable on both grounds as charged by DHS. On January 26, 2006, Rodriguez appealed to the BIA, challenging <em>only </em>the finding that she entered into a sham marriage. On July 10, 2007, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Rodriguez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">Both parties agree that on August 27, 1997, the day Rodriguez attempted to return to the United States after her second trip to Colombia, she did not possess a valid entry document. Because Rodriguez has not contested this finding in her BIA appeal, she has failed to administratively exhaust the issue, and moreover, she does not appeal that ground for removal in this court. She has, therefore, waived it. <em>See United States v. Newsom, </em>452 F.3d 593, 607 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">It is unnecessary to discuss the merits of Rodriguez\u2019s issue regarding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), the marriage claim, because any resolution of that issue would afford no meaningful relief, as she is separately removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
