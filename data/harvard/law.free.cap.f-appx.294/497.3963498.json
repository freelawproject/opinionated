In his complaint, Butler alleged deliberate indifference to his medical needs as the result of a delay in providing medical care for injuries sustained in Telfair State Prison on February 10, 2007, prior to his transfer to Gwinnett County Detention Center. He asserted that he repeatedly requested medical attention, but was not seen until March 6, 2007, and that this delay resulted in physical, mental, and emotional injuries, forcing him to miss out on meals and daily routines. He further alleged that the defendants failed to monitor and treat his high blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, concluding that although there was a delay in medical care, Butler had not shown how any underlying injury had been made worse by the delay or that any defendant knew that a delay would be a serious detriment to Butler. The court noted that Butler was treated numerous times to control his blood pressure, his injuries were examined, and he received medication for pain. The court also denied Butler\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, filed three months after the court dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">On appeal, Butler argues that the district court erred dismissing his complaint because he sufficiently pleaded facts which established deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. He contends that the complaint stated that he received no treatment for his medical condition until March 6, 2007, and that his high blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>pressure was not properly monitored. Butler asserts that the district court erred by holding he suffered no injuries due to the delay in treatment, explaining the lack of blood pressure monitoring led to his suffering a stroke.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the district court shall review, as soon as possible, a prisoner\u2019s complaint in a civil action against a government entity, in order to dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1). We review the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>taking as true the allegations in the complaint. <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2001). We liberally construes <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344,1350 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003). Deliberate indifference contains both an objective and subjective component. <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff first must demonstrate an \u201cobjectively serious medical need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A serious medical need is \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Further, the medical need must be one that poses a substantial risk of serious harm if left unattended. <em>Id. </em>Once a serious medical need is shown, a plaintiff must establish that \u201cthe prison official acted with deliberate indifference to that need.\u201d <em>Bozeman v. Orum, </em>422 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Deliberate indifference requires \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1245 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">A \u201csimple difference in medical opinion\u201d does not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Waldrop v. Evans, </em>871 F.2d 1030, 1033 (11th Cir.1989). \u201c[T]he question of whether governmental actors should have employed additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment \u2018is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment\u2019 and therefore not an appropriate basis for grounding liability under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Adams v. Poag, </em>61 F.3d 1537, 1545 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). In addition, \u201cthe official may escape liability for known risks \u2018if [he] responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chandler v. Crosby, </em>379 F.3d 1278,1290 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">We have stated that \u201ca suit against a public official in his official capacity is considered a suit against the local governmental entity he represents.\u201d <em>Vineyard v. County of Murray, Ga., </em>990 F.2d 1207, 1210 n. 3 (11th Cir.1993). As such, the plaintiff must show that a policy or custom of the governmental entity played a part in the alleged constitutional violation. <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 361-62, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991). There is no <em>respondeat superior </em>liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Harris v. Ostrout, </em>65 F.3d 912, 917 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In the instant case, Butler has failed to state a claim against the defendants in their individual capacities because the defendants responded reasonably to Butler\u2019s symptoms, and the alleged failure to prevent his alleged stroke is insufficient, in and of itself, to establish deliberate indifference. Butler also failed to state a claim against the defendants in their official capacities as he failed to allege his delay in treatment was part of a government policy or custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Butler also argues that the district court erred denying his motion to amend his complaint. We review \u201cthe denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1300 (11th Cir.2003). Leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Generally, a party should be given at least one opportunity to amend before the district court dismisses the complaint with prejudice. <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). The district court, however, need not \u201callow an amendment (1) where there has been undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed; (2) where allowing amendment would cause undue prejudice to the opposing pai\u2019ty; or (3) where amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Butler\u2019s amended complaint only identified previously unnamed defendants and did not address the merits of his claims; thus, the proposed amendments were futile. Moreover, the motion for leave to file an amended complaint was filed more than three months after the district court conducted its frivolity review. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion denying Butler\u2019s motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-14\">. We reject Butler\u2019s argument that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal. Because the district court ruled on all claims and pending motions, there was a final decision, and we have jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. In his original complaint, Butler did not allege that he suffered a stroke as the result of the delay in medical treatment. He makes this claim for the first time in his amended complaint, filed after the district court dismissed his original complaint, and in his appellate brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
