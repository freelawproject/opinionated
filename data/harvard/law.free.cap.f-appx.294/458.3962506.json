No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214. The district court granted a certificate of appealability to address \u201cwhether [Mogford\u2019s] motion to mitigate under 3.800(c) of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure tolled the one year statute of limitations for his petition of writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and if so, whether an oral order denying the motion was not sufficient to re-start the period of limitations.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a petition as barred by the statute of limitation. <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000). The Act provides a one year statute of limitation that begins to run after the latest of four events, which includes \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). That period can be tolled for \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). To qualify as an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review,\u201d a pleading must actually seek \u201creview\u201d by making a good faith request for legal relief from the court. <em>Sibley v. Culliver, </em>377 F.3d 1196,1200-01 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Mogford\u2019s argument that his post-conviction motion tolled the statute of limitation is foreclosed by our precedent. Mog-ford moved to reduce his sentence based on assistance he provided to the government, his lack of a violent criminal record, and \u201csentence manipulation\u201d by the prosecutor. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800(c). Mog-ford\u2019s motion, which was a plea for leniency and was not a challenge to the legality of his sentence, did not toll the limitation period. <em>See Alexander v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Cow., </em>523 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2008). The district court correctly concluded that Mogford\u2019s petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
