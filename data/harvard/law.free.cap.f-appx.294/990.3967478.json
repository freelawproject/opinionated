Officer Lopez seeks qualified immunity from the \u00a7 1983 claim, and the City and Officer Lopez seek governmental immunity from the state-law claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">On the afternoon of November 4, 2004, Carter went to Sergio Jewelry Store to pick up her grandson\u2019s diamond earrings. Upon learning that a diamond was missing from one of the earrings, Carter began to argue with the owner about who was responsible for the missing diamond. The argument became heated, and someone eventually called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">Officer Lopez was the second police officer to arrive at the jewelry store. As he entered the store, he saw Carter \u201cscreaming at the store owner,\u201d asked her \u201cat least twice to calm down [and] step outside\u201d and told her if she did not calm down he would arrest her for disorderly conduct. JA 127-28. Carter concedes that she \u201cmight have ... gotten loud\u201d but denies that he asked her to step outside. JA 76. At some point, Carter approached Officer Lopez and asked him what nationality he was. While she says she was concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to speak English,\u201d JA 74, he says her statement was more pointed: \u201c[A]re you Mexican[?] I\u2019m not going anywhere [with] you.\u201d JA 128. Officer Lopez then told Carter he was arresting her, led her out to the parking lot, handcuffed her and drove her to the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Carter filed a complaint that included (1) a \u00a7 1988 claim alleging excessive force by Officer Lopez, (2) a \u00a7 1983 claim against the City alleging \u201cfailure to adequately discipline, train, screen, supervise, transfer, counsel or otherwise direct or control police officers,\u201d JA 36, (3) a state-law claim against Officer Lopez and the City for gross negligence and (4) a state-law claim against Officer Lopez and the City for assault and battery. Officer Lopez and the City filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity from the \u00a7 1983 claims and seeking governmental immunity from the state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The district court dismissed Carter\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the City but denied the motion for summary judgment as to the \u00a7 1983 claim against Officer Lopez and the state-law claims against the City and Officer Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">To overcome the defense of qualified immunity, a plaintiff asserting a constitutional tort claim against a police officer must show that (1) \u201cthe officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right\u201d and (2) \u201cthe right was clearly established\u201d at the time of the officer\u2019s actions. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). An officer\u2019s use of force violates the Fourth Amendment \u201cif it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151. In the context of an arrest, we consider three factors in assessing the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s actions: \u201c[1] the severity of the crime at issue, [2] whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and [3] whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). At the summary-judgment stage, we review the facts \u201cin the light most favorable to\u201d the non-moving party, which \u201cusually means adopting ... the plaintiffs version of the facts.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774-75, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">Much of Officer Lopez\u2019s argument on appeal takes aim at the district court\u2019s reading of the appropriate factual inferences in this case. Yet we have no authority to review such arguments at this stage in the case. <em>See Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 307, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995). As we have said before, our jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals from an order denying qualified immunity to a government official \u201cdoes not extend to appeals that merely quibble with the district court\u2019s reading of the factual record.\u201d <em>Leary v. Livingston County, </em>528 F.3d 438, 441 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our interlocutory jurisdiction, in other words, extends only to <em>legal </em>arguments \u2014 that, for example, plaintiffs\u2019 fact-supported allegations, as construed in her favor, do not state a constitutional claim or that they do not state a clearly established constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">In addition to challenging the district court\u2019s assessment of the proper factual inferences that can be drawn from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>record, Officer Lopez invokes what appears to be a slight modification of the <em>Johnson </em>rule. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Scott, </em>he argues that a videotape of the incident and an MRI \u201cblatantly contradict\u201d Carter\u2019s factual allegations. One premise of this argument appears to be correct. Appellate judges are free to trust their eyes when a videotape unequivocally shows what happened during an encounter with the police and unequivocally contradicts the claimant\u2019s version of events. As <em>Scott </em>explains: \u201cWhen opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1776. While <em>Scott </em>did not discuss <em>Johnson, </em>it held that a videotape \u201cquite clearly contradict[ed]\u201d the plaintiffs story about whether excessive force was used during a police chase, then proceeded to grant qualified immunity to the officer defendant in the course of resolving the interlocutory appeal before it. <em>Id. </em>at 1775.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Since <em>Scott, </em>we have agreed with the Third Circuit \u201cthat <em>Scott </em>represents \u2018the outer limit of the principle of <em>Johnson v. Jones[\\\\ </em>where the trial court\u2019s determination that a fact is subject to reasonable dispute is blatantly and demonstrably false, a court of appeals may say so, even on interlocutory review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wysong v. City of Heath, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 848, 853 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Blaylock v. City of Philadelphia, </em>504 F.3d 405, 414 (3d Cir.2007)). As we concluded in <em>Wysong, </em>the Third Circuit\u2019s approach represents a \u201cprincipled way to read <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Scott </em>together and to correct the rare \u2018blatan[t] and demonstrable]\u2019 error without allowing <em>Scott </em>to swallow <em>Johnson.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The problem for Officer Lopez is that his record-supported evidence, including the videotape, does not \u201cblatantly contradict\u201d Carter\u2019s description of what happened inside the store. And it does not even purport to cover, much less contradict, the excessive-force allegations regarding activities outside of the store. Once it is established that this evidence does not \u201cblatantly contradict\u201d Carter\u2019s version of the facts, that leaves Officer Lopez only with quibbles over the district court\u2019s reading of the summary-judgment record, which we do not have authority to second guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">For similar reasons, we reject Officer Lopez\u2019s related argument that \u201cMRI evidence presented by [Officer Lopez] blatantly contradict[s] Carter\u2019s claim that she sustained a \u2018retorn rotator cuff and two discs in her neck.\u2019 \u201d Br. at 21. As best we can tell, it is not even clear that the MRI evidence is materially inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s report provided by Carter. Nowhere in the report does it indicate that \u201cCarter\u2019s medical and physical problems were long standing and predate the incident,\u201d as Officer Lopez asserts. Br. at 21. But more importantly, Officer Lopez misreads <em>Scott. </em>That decision does <em>not </em>stand for the proposition that a court should grant summary judgment if the moving party merely presents conflicting evidence. On the contrary, the existence of a material factual dispute makes denial of summary judgment a court\u2019s only appropriate response. <em>Scott </em>stands only for the narrow proposition that summary judgment is appropriate when one party\u2019s story \u201cis blatantly contradicted by the record, so <em>that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d </em>127 S.Ct. at 1776 (emphasis added). Officer Lopez at most presented evidence that cast doubt on Carter\u2019s version of the facts. That is hardly enough for us to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>that \u201cno reasonable jury\u201d could find that Carter was injured, and it does not overcome <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>prohibition on appellate second guessing of the appropriate infer-enees to draw from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The City and Officer Lopez make two arguments in support of their motion for summary judgment on Carter\u2019s state-law claims: (1) that there is no evidence of an \u201cobjective injury,\u201d Br. at 25, and (2) that the district court erred in rejecting their assertion of governmental immunity as an issue \u201cadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\u201d JA 245. But the \u201cobjective injury\u201d argument is no more convincing in the state-law context than it was in the \u00a7 1983 context: It simply represents a disagreement with the district court\u2019s reading of the summary-judgment record, a contention over which we do not have jurisdiction at this stage. And even if they were right that the district court erred in rejecting their claim as having been \u201cadverted to in a perfunctory manner,\u201d which does not seem to be the case, they still have failed to show that they are entitled to governmental immunity on the state-law claims. The same material-fact disputes that doom Officer Lopez\u2019s qualified-immunity claim doom their governmental-immunity claims \u2014 at least in the context of summary judgment. To the extent that the City could argue that a different standard governs its governmental-immunity claims, it has not done so on appeal. Instead, the City has simply sought relief on precisely the same grounds as Officer Lopez \u2014 which, as we have shown, are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AXR7\">The City of Wyoming separately argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Carter\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the City. But the district court <em>granted </em>the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this claim. Because the City cannot appeal a victory, there is nothing more to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
