Velde, a bankruptcy trustee for the District of Minnesota, appeals the decision of the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reversing and vacating prior decisions of the bankruptcy court in three adversary proceedings. The trustee contends that four bank checks received by Hans Reinhardt, Flywheel Grain, LLP and Howard Steinmetz in replacement of four dishonored checks were payments made within the ninety-day period prior to the filing a bankruptcy and were thus prohibited preferences under the Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 547(b). Because we conclude the replacement checks resulted in the release of banks\u2019 security interest in collateral, each bank check constitutes a contemporaneous exchange for new value falling within an exception to the trustee\u2019s avoidance powers as set forth in <em>Velde v. Kirsch, </em>543 F.3d 469 (8th Cir. 2008), issued contemporaneously with this opinion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">On February 3, 2004, an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>against Daniel Miller, the owner of Daniel-son Grain, a crop storage elevator in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. Miller converted the involuntary case to a Chapter 11 proceeding. On September 29, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court converted Miller\u2019s petition back to a Chapter 7 case and appointed David Velde as trustee of Miller\u2019s bankruptcy. The trustee commenced several adversary proceedings, including these cases, to recover the value of checks that Miller issued during the ninety-day period prior to the bankruptcy filing. The facts in each case are similar. In December 2003, Miller issued checks payable to Reinhardt, Steinmetz, and Flywheel Grain. A check in the amount of $100,332.75 payable to Reinhardt and his bank in payment for canola that Reinhardt had delivered to Miller was issued and dishonored by Miller\u2019s bank. It was later partially replaced with a $50,000 bank check which came from funds in Miller\u2019s bank account. Miller had also issued a check in the amount of $12,000 payable to Steinmetz and his bank to pay for wheat that Steinmetz had previously delivered to Miller. When that check was dishonored by Miller\u2019s bank Miller replaced it with a bank check that was drawn on funds paid to the bank by Miller. Miller issued two checks to Flywheel Grain and its bank to pay for grain and soybeans that Flywheel Grain had previously delivered to Miller. These checks were also dishonored and were ultimately replaced with two bank checks totaling $300,000 from funds that were in Miller\u2019s account. The replacement check issued to Reinhardt omitted his bank as a payee but Reinhardt endorsed the check and delivered it to his bank. All the replacement checks were delivered to the payees\u2019 banks and resulted in the extin-guishment of valid crop liens held by the vai\u2019ious banks. Reinhardt, Steinmetz and Flywheel Grain all contend that the release of their banks\u2019 security interests upon receipt of the replacement bank checks constitute contemporaneous exchanges for new value taking the transactions out of the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s avoidance powers. The District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court which had found the payments to be an avoidable preference. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The issue presented is whether a trustee may avoid a pre-bankruptcy transaction pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 547 (1993) where a debtor issues a replacement check jointly payable to a creditor and his bank for one previously issued and dishonored or whether a contemporaneous exchange for value occurs when the bank releases a perfected security interest in the debtor\u2019s property only after receipt of payment from the second check. For the reasons set forth in our opinion issued today in <em>Velde v. Kirsch, </em>543 F.3d 469 (8th Cir. 2008), the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-23\">. The Honorable Richard H.
