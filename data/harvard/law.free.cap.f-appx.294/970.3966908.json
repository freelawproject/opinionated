Dixon, Louisiana prisoner # 457741, seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Dixon is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-19\">Dixon argues that the district court erred by determining that many of his claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations because he was told that he could not file a complaint against a correctional facility or its officers until after he left the facility. The statute of limitations, however, began running when Dixon knew the facts that supported his claims. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995). To the extent that Dixon is implicitly arguing that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled, his argument is without merit as ignorance of legal rights and time limitations is not a basis for equitably tolling a statute of limitations. <em>See Barrow v. New Orleans S.S. Ass\u2019n, </em>932 F.2d 473, 478 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-20\">Dixon filed his complaint, at the earliest, on January 27, 2007. The applicable limitations period in Louisiana is one year. La. Civ.Code art. 3492; <em>Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794-95 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the district court did not err by ruling that Dixon\u2019s claims accruing prior to January 27, 2006, were barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Elzy, </em>868 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>794-95. Dixon has not shown that the district court\u2019s dismissal of many of his claims as barred by the statute of limitations presents a nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Dixon additionally reiterates factual allegations he made in the district court regarding both claims that were barred by the statute of limitations and claims that were not barred by the statute of limitations. Dixon, however, does not provide legal argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing the claims that were not barred by the statute of limitations. As Dixon does not address the district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing these claims, he has waived any challenge he could bring to the dismissal of these claims. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">For the first time on appeal, Dixon alleges that defendants William Savage and Lieutenant Jackson beat him on December 20, 2006, and that Lt. Jackson struck him across the face and slammed him into a wall on December 28, 2006. As these claims were not raised in the district court, they cannot be considered on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Dixon previously accumulated a strike. <em>See Dixon v. State of Louisiana, </em>No. 06-179-A (M.D.La. May 31, 2006) (unpublished). As Dixon has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b996-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
