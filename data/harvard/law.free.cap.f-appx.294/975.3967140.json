Gaffney, on behalf of their minor children, Plaintiffs Amanda Rose Gaffney and Rebecca Ann Gaffney (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing, <em>sua sponte, </em>their case against State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d) for failure to properly allege a right of action. For the following reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">In this case, arising in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Plaintiffs Amanda Rose Gaffney and Rebecca Ann Gaffney, the minor children of State Farm policyholders James L. Gaffney, III and Lena Turner Gaffney, seek damages from State Farm pursuant to La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:1220. Plaintiffs allege that on August 29, 2005, the winds of Hurricane Katrina damaged their family residence, which their parents owned and State Farm insured under a policy on which their parents were the named insureds. They further allege that State Farm, despite having been \u201cpresented with due proofs [sic] of claim of the windstorm damage\u201d and documentation of the extent of loss to their parents\u2019 house, \u201cfailed to tender the limits of the coverages\u201d for which their parents paid. Accordingly, they seek damages under La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:1220(B)(5), which provides for the recovery of general and special damages by insureds when an insurer \u201c[f]ail[s] to pay the amount of any claim due any person insured by the contract within sixty days after receipt of satisfactory proof of loss from the claimant when such failure is arbitrary, capricious, or without probable cause.\u201d Plaintiffs further assert that they \u201care insureds under the policy issued by the defendant, being residents of the household of the named insured thereunder.\u201d State Farm disputes that Plaintiffs are \u201cinsureds\u201d under the policy; it contends that only the <em>named </em>insureds \u2014 James and Lena Gaffney \u2014 are insureds under the policy, and that therefore only they could possibly maintain an action against it under \u00a7 22:1220(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Plaintiffs filed their petition in the Louisiana Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans on August 30, 2007. On October 30, 2007, State Farm successfully removed the case, on the basis of diversity, to the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana and filed its answer with that court. On January 15, 2008, Plaintiffs moved to transfer venue, continue the trial date, and consolidate their case with one that their parents filed against State Farm seeking to recover insurance benefits from State Farm for the same damage to the residence alleged in the instant suit. State Farm opposed the motion. The district court, on February 7, 2008, after considering Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the case in a one-page order, finding that Plaintiffs have no right of action. Plaintiffs appeal the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">We have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Sw. Bell Tel., LP v. City of Houston, </em>529 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2008). We must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and we will affirm a 12(b)(6) dismissal only \u201cif we determine that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts or any possible theory that he could prove consistent with the allegations in the complaint.\u201d <em>Audler v. CBC Innovis Inc., </em>519 F.3d 239, 247 (5th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Because this case is in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, we must follow Louisiana\u2019s substantive law. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Ashland Chem. Inc. v. Barco Inc., </em>123 F.3d 261, 265 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Before considering the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we must first assess the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>priety of the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 case. This court has on numerous occasions recognized the inherent authority of a district court to dismiss a complaint on its own motion for failure to state a claim. <em>See, e.g., Carroll v. Fort James Corp., </em>470 F.3d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Shawnee Int\u2019l, N.V. v. Hondo Drilling Co., </em>742 F.2d 234, 236 (5th Cir.1984). However, this power is not unlimited. We have consistently held that a district court can dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>only \u201c \u2018as long as the procedure employed is fair.\u2019\u201d <em>Carroll, </em>470 F.3d at 1177 (quoting <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998)); <em>see also </em>5B Charles Allen Wright &amp; Arthur Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1357 (3d ed.2004). Although we have stopped short of enunciating a bright-line rule, we have \u201c \u2018suggested that fairness in this context requires both notice of the court\u2019s intention [to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>] and an opportunity to respond.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lozano v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, </em>489 F.3d 636, 643 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Carroll, </em>470 F.3d at 1177).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Even if a district court fails to provide notice to the plaintiff prior to dismissal, however, we will affirm if the plaintiff has alleged his \u201cbest case\u201d and the dismissal was otherwise proper. <em>Lozano, </em>489 F.3d at 643; <em>Bazrowx, </em>136 F.3d at 1054 (citing <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 792-93 (5th Cir.1986)). We have recognized that \u201c[a]t some point a court must decide that a plaintiff has had fair opportunity to make his case; if, after that time, a cause of action has not been established, the court should finally dismiss the suit.\u201d <em>Jac-quez, </em>801 F.2d at 792. Thus, in <em>Jacquez, </em>a case involving a \u00a7 1983 action, we directed the dismissal of the plaintiffs case after the plaintiff filed a deficient complaint that, in subsequent pleadings, he simply repeatedly claimed was adequate. <em>Id. </em>We cautioned, however, that \u201c[dismissing an action after giving the plaintiff only one opportunity to state his case is ordinarily unjustified.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">In the instant case, the district court denied Plaintiffs both notice that it might <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss their case and an opportunity to respond. The district court dismissed this case in an order addressing Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Transfer, Motion to Continue Trial Date and Other Dates, and Motion to Consolidate, which State Farm had opposed. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the district court notified any party that it was considering dismissal, neither party briefed the issue, and Plaintiffs were not given an opportunity to amend their complaint to cure any deficiencies that the district court thought warranted dismissal. Moreover, based upon the record before us, we cannot say that Plaintiffs, who were not given a chance to amend their complaint or file subsequent pleadings addressing the merits of their case, were able to plead their \u201cbest case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 case without prior notice and without providing Plaintiffs an opportunity to respond or plead their \u201cbest case.\u201d Therefore, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
