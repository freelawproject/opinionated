She made admissions regarding the existence of the marijuana growing enterprise to Drug Enforcement Administration agent Wayne Andrews, to which he testified at trial. Co-defendants Roberto Valle and Lorenzo Valera also testified against her, implicating her directly in the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues that her convictions should be overturned because of the admission of some testimony from Agent Andrews and because the government impermissibly vouched for the testimony of government witnesses and co-conspirators, Valle and Valera when they testified about their plea agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Westry, </em>524 F.3d 1198, 1214 (11th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(no. 08-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>5343) (July 15, 2008). We review alleged Confrontation Clause violations for harmless error. <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270,1286 (11th Cir.2006). However, arguments not presented to the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>526 F.3d 691, 704 (11th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(no. 08-5564) (July 28, 2008). To show such error, the appellant must establish \u201c(1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affects [his] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Essentially, the appellant must show that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <em>Id. </em>In the district court, Gonzalez neither objected to any of the testimony that she now challenges, nor raised any of the arguments she now advances. Accordingly, our review is for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Considering this record, including the testimony indicating her ownership, residence, possession of the marijuana plants and incriminating statements, we find no reversible error. Gonzalez argues that Andrews\u2019 testimony constituted hearsay, impermissible opinion testimony and violated the Confrontation Clause and the rules of evidence. She further argues that Andrews\u2019s conclusion regarding her knowledge of the conspiracy was an opinion and violated Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). Finally, she argues that the use of Andrews as a fact and opinion witness resulted in the jury giving undue weight to his testimony. The essence of Andrews\u2019s testimony established the background of the investigation\u2019s commencement and relayed what Gonzalez herself told him during questioning. It did not violate Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). As to the testimony from Roberto Valle and Lorenzo Valera, we find no reversible error in Gonzalez\u2019 claim that the government improperly elicited testimony concerning their plea agreements and sentencing reductions and improperly ensured the truthfulness of their testimony. Prosecutors are not prohibited from entering a plea agreement into evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>89 F.3d 1443, 1457 (11th Cir.1996). We have held that questioning regarding plea agreement requirements regarding truthfulness and the possibility of perjury charges to be proper. <em>Id. </em>Where a prosecutor questions witnesses regarding the truth-telling portions of their plea agreement or brings out the fact that the agreements stated they were subject to perjury penalties, the prosecutor is not vouching. <em>United States v. Cano, </em>289 F.3d 1354, 1365-66 (11th Cir.2002). The government\u2019s questioning of Valle and Valera did not constitute impermissible vouching as questions pertaining to the requirement to be truthful and the penalties for perjury are permissible. We do dot find plain error. Moreover, having found no reversible error, there is no cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
