Abrams denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xu Rui Dong a.k.a. Xui Rui Dong, </em>No. A 98 374 967 (B.I.A. Nov. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 374 967 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 1, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The agency properly found that Dong failed to meet his burden of demonstrating eligibility for the relief he sought. Dong was not entitled to asylum based solely on his girlfriend\u2019s alleged forced abortion because this Court has held that the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), does not extend automatically to partners (legally related or otherwise) of individuals who have been forced to undergo such a procedure. <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). As the BIA noted, in order to establish eligibility for relief on family planning grounds, a partner must demonstrate past persecution based on his own \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d or a well-founded fear that he will be subject to persecution for such resistance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">In <em>In re S-L-L-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1 (B.I.A.2006), the BIA defined \u201cresistance\u201d in the context of coercive family planning to cover \u201ca wide range of circumstances, including expressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family planning law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Here, Dong\u2019s alleged efforts to hide with his girlfriend did not constitute \u201cresistance\u201d because hiding is not an \u201covert form[] of resistance,\u201d but instead an effort to avoid the policy\u2019s requirements by concealing an unauthorized pregnancy. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Moreover, impregnating his girlfriend, who subsequently was forced to have an abortion, was not alone an act of resistance. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313 (citing <em>Ru Jian Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 (5th Cir.2004)). Dong never asserted that he expressed opposition to China\u2019s family planning policy or that he ever confronted family planning officials in an effort to prevent them from taking his girlfriend for an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Because Dong was unable to establish eligibility for asylum, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief because these claims were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148,156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
