He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that, by order entered on August 26, 2008, the district court granted Mills\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as to two counts of conviction. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Mills\u2019 case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
