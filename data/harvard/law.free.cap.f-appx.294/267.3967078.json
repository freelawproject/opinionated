In <em>Baker, </em>63 F.3d 1478, 1488-89 (9th Cir.1995), we clarified that the CCTA is one such applicable limitation. Defendants attempt to rely on <em>Mahoney v. Idaho, </em>96 Idaho 59, 524 P.2d 187 (1974), for the proposition that a state cannot tax on-reservation sales of cigarettes, but shortly after <em>Mahoney, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state \u201cmay impose at least \u2018minimal\u2019 burdens on the Indian retailer to aid in enforcing and collecting the tax\u201d on non-Indians. <em>Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, </em>447 U.S. 134, 151, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980). Therefore, even assuming <em>ar-guendo </em>that defendants complied with the Coeur d\u2019Alene taxation and licensing requirements, this would not excuse violations of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">Nor does 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301, finding that \u201cIndian tribes retain the right to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights,\u201d preclude the applicability of the CCTA. <em>Baker </em>rejected this argument, holding that \u201cthe CCTA does not restrict trading in cigarettes; it makes it a crime to fail to pay applicable state taxes on cigarettes subject to tax.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>63 F.3d at 1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>United States v. Smiskin, </em>487 F.3d 1260, 1264 (9th Cir. 2007), holding that the CCTA did not apply to the Yakama Tribe because that \u201cwould abrogate the rights guaranteed by Indian treaties,\u201d is misplaced. The Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe is not a signatory to any treaty containing language analogous to that discussed in <em>Smiskin. </em>Rather, the treaty language cited by Defendants states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>only that the Coeur d\u2019Alene \u201cpromise that all white persons shall travel through their country unmolested, and that no Indians hostile to the United States shall be allowed within the limits of them country.\u201d Unlike the Yakama Treaty of 1855 discussed in <em>Smiskin, </em>this language does not guarantee the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe any rights that might be infringed upon by a state\u2019s pre-notification requirement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Neither Washington state law nor the CCTA is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>Baker </em>put defendants on notice that the CCTA applies to Indians, that it classifies unapproved, unstamped cigarettes as contraband, that federal law does not preempt Washington\u2019s cigarette tax scheme, and that dealers\u2019 \u201cknowledge of cigarette taxing requirements can be presumed.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>63 F.3d at 1486-87, 1490, 1492. Defendants\u2019 claim that it was unclear whether Washington law required wholesalers to give pre-notification is also unavailing because Defendants provided no evidence that they were licensed as wholesalers under Washington state law. Wash.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 82.24.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Defendants\u2019 argument that no predicate act exists because the incident of tax and pre-notification obligation fall upon the first taxable event in Washington is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gord, </em>77 F.3d 1192, 1194 (9th Cir.1996). <em>Gord </em>rejected the argument that the CCTA only prohibits possession of unstamped cigarettes if taxes are due, concluding instead that unstamped cigarettes are contraband under the CCTA unless they both \u201cwere preapproved by the Washington Department of Revenue and were sold to Native Americans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As noted in <em>Baker, </em>although Washington\u2019s tax scheme \u201cdoes not impose any tax on reservation Indians,\u201d it does impose the \u201cpermissible, minor burden\u201d on Indian retailers of \u201cprepay[ing] taxes to be collected from their non-Indian consumers.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>63 F.3d at 1491.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Finally, defendants argue that they had no duty to pre-notify or to collect Washington state tax because they did not conduct business in Washington and did not participate in transporting the cigarettes into Washington. Participation in all elements of a predicate act, however, is not necessary to show a conspiracy. <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 52, 63, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997). <em>Salinas </em>holds that a \u201cconspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the substantive offense,\u201d noting that \u201c[i]f conspirators have a plan which calls for some conspirators to perpetrate the crime and others to provide support, the supporters are as guilty as the perpetrators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64,118 S.Ct. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\"><em>Salinas </em>noted that even a person \u201cincapable of committing the substantive offense\u201d can be liable for conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 118 S.Ct. 469. All that is necessary to support a conspiracy conviction under <em>Salinas </em>is that the conspirator \u201cintend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive criminal offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 118 S.Ct. 469. Defendants\u2019 conduct need not have taken place in the State of Washington to fulfill this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\">. The CCTA prohibits shipping, transporting, receiving, possessing, selling, distributing, or purchasing contraband cigarettes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. Contraband cigarettes are defined as more than 10,000 cigarettes that \"bear no evidence of the payment of applicable State or local cigarette taxes in the State or locality where such cigarettes are found, if the State or local government requires a stamp....\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2341. Under Washington state law, cigarette packages must bear stamps indicating that taxes have been paid. Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 82.24.030. Native Americans may purchase unstamped cigarettes for resale to Native Americans if they obtain pre-approval from the Washington Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 458-20-192. In the absence of preapproval, \"unstamped cigarettes destined for sale to reservation Indians are contraband.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>63 F.3d 1478, 1487 (9th Cir.1995) (citing Wash.
