As Solorzano has not challenged the denial of his request for withholding of removal, any such challenge is abandoned. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Solorzano argues that, as a member and leader of a labor union formed to collect past wages from his employer, Transpac Central America, he is a member of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for purposes of an application for asylum. He also argues that the BIA erroneously foreclosed him from refugee status due to his failure to turn to Guatemalan authorities for protection from Transpac\u2019s death threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Solorzano was not a refugee. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b); <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69 (BIA 2007). We therefore do not address Solorzano\u2019s second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
