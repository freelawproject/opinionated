We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We find that the revocation sentence of 14 months in prison is not unreasonable. First, the sentence was within both the statutory limits and the Chapter 7 advisory Guidelines range of 8-14 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (authorizing up to 2-year prison term upon revocation of supervised release where original offense was Class C felony); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (range for Grade C violation with Category VI criminal history is 8-14 months in prison). Second, in sentencing Pratt, the district court considered appropriate factors, including Pratt\u2019s history and characteristics, the circumstances of his offense, and the need for deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2), (a)(4)(B), \u00a7 3583(e) (permitting imposition of revocation sentence after consideration of certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors); <em>United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 (8th Cir.2006) (district court need not mechanically list every \u00a7 3553(a) consideration when sentencing defendant upon revocation of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
