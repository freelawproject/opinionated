(CIT), and its unknown agents, personally and in their official capacities. The Flynns sought $336,273,000, plus clear title to real property on which CIT holds a mortgage, based on allegations that CIT violated their rights to be treated equally under the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed the Flynns\u2019 equal protection and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 constitutional claims against CIT, a private party, for failure to allege state action. The claims against CIT\u2019s unknown agents were dismissed because the complaint did not allege any actions by unknown individuals on which to base a right of recovery. The district court granted CIT\u2019s second motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), finding that the Flynns\u2019 amended complaint failed to comply with the pleading standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and in the court\u2019s order for a more definite statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-19\">The Flynns argue that the district court erred in dismissing their equal protection and Section 1983 claims. They argue that CIT acts under color of law because of its relation with the SEC. They argue that the district court failed to recognize that CIT\u2019s relationship with the SEC is essentially symbiotic. The Flynns\u2019 legal argument is not tied to an allegation of facts that such a nexus exists between CIT and the SEC as to transform CIT\u2019s actions into state action. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim. <em>See Norris v. Hearst Trust, </em>500 F.3d 454, 464 (5th Cir. 2007) <em>ide novo </em>review); <em>Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1999) (state action requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">The Flynns argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims against the known and unknown agents of CIT. They state that they cannot locate the cases they were relying upon for this issue. Claims not adequately argued in the brief are deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>Yohey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). This issue was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Flynns argue that the district court erred in dismissing their breach of contract claim for failure to state a claim. They argue that the district court erred in dismissing the claim on the \u2022 pleadings. They contend that they did not understand what the district court was expecting them to say in the amended complaint. They argue that the main issue is that the agreement was violated, and they have a right to a remedy. They contend that them complaint gave \u201cenough factual matter to suggest the allegations.\u201d They argue that their short and plain statement of the claim raises a breach of contract issue, and that the exhibits attached to the complaint support the claim that the defendant violated the agreement. They refer us to the former standard \u201cthat a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The \u201cno set of facts\u201d standard was recently rejected by the Supreme Court as overly favorable to deficient complaints. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1968-69 &amp; n. 8, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A Federal Rule of Civil Procedure requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). While a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations to survive a motion to dismiss, factual allegations must support that a right to relief is neither speculative nor merely a conclusion. <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. In the \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d section of their amended complaint, the Flynns allege that CIT breached specific provisions of a \u201cSettlement And Release Agreement\u201d between the parties. They do not, however, allege sufficient facts to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, although the Flynns argue that the exhibits attached to their original complaint support that CIT violated the agreement, they do not allege how those exhibits substantiate them breach of contract claim. The district court did not err in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
