A certificate of appealability was granted on whether Powell was entitled to mandatory supervised release, thereby creating a liberty interest in the process he received at the disciplinary hearing. The respondent asserts that Powell was entitled to mandatory supervised release and that the case should be remanded in light of <em>Teague v. Quarterman, </em>482 F.3d 769, 773 (5th Cir. 2007). The respondent has also filed a motion to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The respondent\u2019s motion to remand is GRANTED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Powell\u2019s due process claim is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for it to consider the merits of Powell\u2019s due process claim regarding the loss of good time credit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
