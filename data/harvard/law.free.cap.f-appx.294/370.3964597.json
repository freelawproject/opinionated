We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the events that occurred to Widjaja in Indonesia do not rise to the level of past persecution, <em>see id. </em>at 1016-17. In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of a well-founded fear of persecution, because even as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>member of a disfavored group, Widjaja has failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on his Chinese ethnicity. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Lastly, the record does not establish that Widjaja demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178-81 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We do not consider withholding of removal or protection under Convention Against Torture because Widjaja failed to raise these claims in his opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256,1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b396-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
