Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 338-39 (9th Cir.1995), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because the one beating Pelle endured in Indonesia did not rise to the level of past persecution, <em>see id. </em>at 339. Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Pelle failed to prove that he could not reasonably relocate in Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(i). And even if assuming the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004) applies to withholding of removal, Pelle has not demonstrated a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that it is not more likely than not that Pelle will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">We lack jurisdiction to review Pelle\u2019s due process claim because he failed to exhaust it before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b371-14\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
