Nov. 21, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. It is undisputed that Lin\u2019s motion was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA also properly found that Lin\u2019s motion did not qualify for the changed country conditions exception to the time limitation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). While Lin argued in her motion to reopen that the birth of her two children was previously unavailable evidence, the birth of U.S. citizen children constitutes a change in personal circumstances and is not evidence of changed conditions in China. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">On appeal, Lin argues that the BIA erred by giving no weight to a notice she submitted from the Yingqian Village Committee and by failing to articulate her evidentiary burden. However, the BIA provided three independent reasons for why it gave the notice diminished weight: (1) the notice was unduly vague; (2) a letter from Lin\u2019s father omitted any reference to the notice despite the fact that the notice was addressed to him; and (3) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in the underlying proceeding \u201ccasts doubt\u201d on the authenticity of the notice. Because the weight afforded to evidence is generally left to the agency\u2019s discretion, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s decision to accord the notice no probative value. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, the BIA properly took note of the IJ\u2019s prior adverse credibility determination in evaluating the evidence Lin submitted with her motion. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 234. Finally, there is no merit to Lin\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to articulate the correct evidentiary burden where the BIA devoted an entire paragraph to discussing what an applicant must demonstrate in order to prevail on an untimely motion to reopen and where it cited to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. The BIA also denied Lin's motion as a matter of discretion. However, we need not reach that part of the BIA's decision where its other findings alone were sufficient. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-105, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
