Roth, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b655-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">Defendant-appellant Sonny Szeto appeals from a sentence imposed by the District Court following his guilty plea to using an interstate facility to engage in sexual activity with a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), and possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). On March 6, 2007, the District Court sentenced Szeto to a term of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment and a lifetime of supervised release. On appeal, Szeto claims that (1) the District Court committed error when it determined that his sentence should be enhanced two levels for exercising undue influence over the eleven-year-old victim; and (2) that the District Court\u2019s imposition of a 168-month sentence was unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history, though we revisit key portions of that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">Szeto argued that because the victim initiated some of the Instant Message chats and telephone calls, and because she had sent him pictures of herself using a WebCam, the victim\u2019s behavior was volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>tary, and accordingly his influence over her did not \u201ccompromise[ ] the voluntariness of [the victim]\u2019s behavior.\u201d Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2G1.3 cmt. n. 3. At the sentencing hearing, Judge Hall noted that the Sentencing Guidelines have created a rebuttable presumption of undue influence in situations in which the participant is at least ten years older than the minor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which applied in the instant case. The District Court then found, after articulating its thorough analysis of the record, that Szeto had not defeated the presumption of undue influence. After fully considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the District Court sentenced Szeto to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 the bottom of the range provided by the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">An application of a provision of the Sentencing Guideline that hinges on a District Court\u2019s factual determinations will be reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>426 F.3d 556, 562 (2d Cir.2005). Upon a review of the record, we find no error \u2014 much less clear error \u2014 in the District Court\u2019s determination that Szeto exercised undue influence over his eleven-year-old victim. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As. to the claim that Szeto\u2019s sentence was unreasonable, we note that reasonableness review is meant to be the same review we undertake for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Again, upon a review of the record, we find no error \u2014 much less an abuse of discretion \u2014 in the District Court\u2019s sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Upon a review of the record and the arguments of counsel, we reject defendant\u2019s remaining arguments as lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">We reject all of defendant\u2019s claims on appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\">. Section 2G1.3, Application Note 3 reads, in part: \u201cIn a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
