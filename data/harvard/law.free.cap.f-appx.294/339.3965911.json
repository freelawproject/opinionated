Soltero, </em>510 F.3d 858, 864-65 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-23\">Vega also contends the sentence in the written judgment conflicted with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence in two respects. <em>See United States v. Munoz-Dela Rosa, </em>495 F.2d 253, 256 (9th Cir.1974) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-24\">First, Vega contends the sentence in the written judgment conflicted with the oral pronouncement of sentence because the district court did not orally announce the conditions under which it authorized limited disclosure of the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), whereas the written judgment in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>eluded such a provision. The district court\u2019s authorization of limited disclosure of the PSR is not part of Vega\u2019s sentence such that the district court was required to announce the disclosure conditions. Rather, the disclosure provision in the written judgment served as an order of the court setting forth the circumstances under which the district court consented to limited disclosure of its own confidential record, the PSR. <em>See </em>C.D. Cal.Crim. R. 32-3.5. The district court could have authorized such disclosure by separate written order without announcing such an order at sentencing. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering such an order, which was reasonably related to Vega\u2019s drug treatment. <em>See United States v. Stoterau, </em>524 F.3d 988, 1011 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Second, Vega contends condition 6 of his supervised release in the written judgment conflicts with condition 6 as pronounced orally. Condition 6 as orally imposed at sentencing ordered Vega to \u201cpay the special assessment in accordance with this judgment\u2019s orders pertaining to such payment,\u201d while the written judgment ordered Vega to \u201cpay the special assessment <em>and fine </em>in accordance with this judgment\u2019s orders pertaining to such payment.\u201d (emphasis added). The \u201cjudgment\u2019s orders,\u201d however, imposed no fine; thus, we interpret condition 6 to require Vega to pay only the special assessment. Remand to the district court to strike \u201cand fine\u201d from condition 6 is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-25\">.
