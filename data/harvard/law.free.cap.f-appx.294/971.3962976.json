SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">Robert Ellis was injured in the course of his employment on a construction project in Mississippi. The relationships between the relevant parties can be summarized briefly. The property on which the construction took place was owned by Landings Associates (\u201cLandings\u201d), which hired The Mitchell Company (\u201cMitchell\u201d) as general contractor; Mitchell hired defendant Trustmark Builders (\u201cTrustmark\u201d) as a subcontractor, and Trustmark hired Rusty Stevens, Ellis\u2019s immediate employer, as a sub-subcontractor. Ellis was injured when he fell from a lifting apparatus constructed by Scotty Jones, an employee of Trust-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">Landings, Mitchell, and Trustmark are incorporated in Alabama and have their principal places of business there. Ellis had worked for Stevens in Alabama for some months before his injury. Alabama is also the state of residence of Jones and Stevens and the state in which Stevens had obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Though Ellis has in fact received compensation for his injuries under the Alabama Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, he sought additional damages in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-15\">Whether Ellis\u2019s suit may proceed depends on whether the Alabama or Mississippi workers\u2019 compensation system applies. The Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-1 <em>et seq., </em>provides an exclusive remedy for employment-related injuries occurring within its ambit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This precludes in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>jured employees from seeking additional remedies, such as in tort, from them employers or co-employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In contrast, Alabama permits tort suits in workers\u2019 compensation cases even where the injured employee has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The district court, deciding that Mississippi law applies, granted summary judgment to Trustmark. Ellis appeals, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, see Potter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 881, 888 (5th Cir.1996), and affirm \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Here, where the parties appear to be in agreement on all relevant facts, we proceed to consider the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">The question of which state\u2019s law applies is one of choice of law, and, as a federal court sitting in diversity, the district court was required to apply Mississippi choice-of-law rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mississippi follows the choice-of-law rules set out in the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law (\u201cRestatement\u201d), also known as the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d or \u201cmost substantial contacts\u201d approach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Using that method, a Mississippi court, and thus the district court, must apply the law of the state with \u201cthe most significant relationship\u201d (as determined through an elaborate balancing test) to the case\u2019s subject matter,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> unless there is an applicable statutory directive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court correctly noted all this but erred in concluding that the Mississippi Code contains such a directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">The \u201cExtraterritorial Provisions\u201d of the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, on which the district court focused its attention, address the application of that law to \u201cemployee[s] who [have] been hired or [are] regularly employed outside of [Mississippi] and [their] employer[s]\u201d while the employees are \u201ctemporarily within [Mississippi] doing work for [their] employees].\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-109(3). That provision continues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-18\">Any employee who has been hired or is regularly employed outside of this state and his employer shall be exempted from the provisions of this chapter while such employee is temporarily within this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>state doing work for his employer if such employer has furnished workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage under the workmen\u2019s compensation or similar laws for a state other than this state so as to cover such employee\u2019s employment while in this state, provided the extraterritorial provisions of this chapter are recognized in such other state and provided employers and employees who are covered in this state are likewise exempted from the application of the workmen\u2019s compensation or similar laws of such other state. The benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation or similar laws of such other state shall be the exclusive remedy against such employer for any injury, whether resulting in death or not, received by such employee while working for such employer in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The district court, citing <em>LaDew v. LaBorde, </em>216 Miss. 598, 63 So.2d 56 (1953),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <em>Roynon v. Janet\u2019s Cleaning Service, </em>70 Md.App. 554, 521 A.2d 1271 (1987) (applying Maryland\u2019s virtually identical statute), interpreted this language as creating a free-standing statutory framework to govern choice of law in workers\u2019 compensation cases such as this. According to the district court, \u00a7 71-3-109(3) requires that the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Law be applied to injured workers such as Ellis when two conditions are met: First, the employer must \u201cfurnish workmen\u2019s compensation insurance coverage under the workmen\u2019s compensation or similar laws for a state other than this state so as to cover such employee\u2019s employment while in [Mississippi].\u201d Second, the extraterritorial provisions of the Mississippi statute must be \u201crecognized\u201d by the other state whose coverage the employer elects to provide. <em>See </em>\u00a7 71-3-109(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Where this test is satisfied, under the district court\u2019s reading, the other state\u2019s law takes precedence over Mississippi\u2019s. The district court found that Ellis did not meet the test. Though Stevens provided Alabama workers\u2019 compensation to Ellis, the court decided that the Alabama statute does not \u201crecognize\u201d the extraterritorial provisions of Mississippi law set out in \u00a7 71-3-109(3), so the Mississippi law would not yield to Alabama\u2019s, and, because Mississippi\u2019s law does not permit Ellis\u2019s suit, the court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">To the extent that the district court followed the test set out in <em>LaDew, </em>it seems to have done so correctly. The <em>LaDew </em>court, however, employed that test only after its initial choice-of-law analysis showed that Mississippi law applied in the first place.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court made that explicit in <em>Dueitt v. Williams, </em>764 F.2d 1180, 1182 (5th Cir.1985), baldly stating that \u201cthe statute [\u00a7 71-3-109(3) ] is not one governing conflict of laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">In other words, \u00a7 71-3-109(3) is not a statutory directive that takes the place of Mississippi\u2019s ordinary choice-of-law rules, which remain antecedent to application of \u00a7 71-3-109(3). Therefore, before the district court may consider \u00a7 71-3-109(3), it must find that Mississippi choice-of-law rules direct it to apply Mississippi law. If consideration of those choice-of-law rules directs the district court to Alabama law, then \u00a7 71-3-109(3) is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>The district court did not consider Mississippi choice-of-law rules at all, instead focusing exclusively on the statute. The parties have discussed Mississippi choice of law in their briefs, but the district court is the better forum for deciding their competing arguments. We therefore VACATE and REMAND with instruction that the district court consider whether Mississippi or Alabama law applies and for other proceedings as appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
