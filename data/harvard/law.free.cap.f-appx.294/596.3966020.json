BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">A federal grand jury indicted Ramey on two counts of knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). The indictment identified Ramey\u2019s prior felony as an October 6, 1997 Alabama conviction for first degree theft of property. Ramey pled guilty to one of the two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Ramey had ten prior convictions, including, <em>inter alia, </em>an Alabama conviction for second degree burglary and two Alabama convictions for third-degree burglary. The PSI recommended that Ramey be classified as an armed career criminal due to these three burglary convictions. Thus, as an armed career criminal, the PSI assigned Ramey an offense level of 33, pursuant to US.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(3)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After further adjustments were made, the PSI\u2019s total offense level was 30. With a criminal history category of VI, the PSI calculated an advisory guidelines range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-20\">Ramey did not dispute the existence of the three Alabama burglary convictions. Nor did he dispute the factual accuracy of the PSI. Rather, Ramey objected to his classification as a armed career criminal on Sixth Amendment grounds because his pri- or burglary convictions were not charged in his indictment. Ramey also argued that his prior Alabama burglary convictions could not be classified as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA without impermissible factfinding by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-21\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Ramey\u2019s objections, adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations and determined that the applicable advisory guidelines range was 180 to 210 months\u2019 impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>onment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Ramey\u2019s Alabama burglary convictions qualified as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of the ACCA and imposed an 180-month sentence. Ramey appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On appeal, Ramey argues that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because his prior burglary convictions were neither charged in his indictment nor admitted in his guilty plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Ramey acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Even after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker-, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>549 U.S. 941, 127 S.Ct. 335, 166 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); <em>United, States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Additionally, we note that at sentencing the district court did not resolve any disputed facts related to Ramey\u2019s prior con-vietions. Ramey did not dispute the factual accuracy of the portions of the PSI that listed his prior convictions. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,1330 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that there is no statutory <em>Booker </em>error where the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts in the PSI to which the defendant did not object at sentencing). Therefore, the district court did not err by enhancing Ra-mey\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Ramey also contends that his two Alabama third-degree burglary convictions cannot be classified categorically as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The ACCA applies to defendants who have three prior convictions for either violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). One of the crimes designated a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is burglary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). To determine whether a conviction is for a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d courts use a \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking only to the \u201cfact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201ca person has been convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>of burglary for purposes of [an ACCA] enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with the intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. at 2158.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Alabama third-degree burglary statute under which Ramey was convicted states that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the third degree if he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-7-7(a). This language is virtually identical to the <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s definition of burglary under the ACCA. Accordingly, we conclude that Ra-mey\u2019s Alabama third-degree burglary convictions constitute violent felonies under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Ramey argues that the Alabama Supreme Court and commentary in the Alabama Code indicates that Alabama interprets its third-degree burglary statute to include offenses that are not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d as defined by Alabama law. However, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Taylor, </em>whether the burglary conviction is a violent felony is a question of federal law and does not \u201cdepend on the definition adopted by the State of conviction.\u201d 495 U.S. at 590, 110 S.Ct. at 2154. Thus, the district court properly classified Ramey\u2019s third-degree burglary convictions as violent felonies under federal law and applied the ACCA\u2019s sentencing enhancement to Ramey\u2019s advisory guidelines calculations and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-14\">. Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), a defendant is subject to a mandatory minimum 15 year sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Additionally, a defendant\u2019s base offense level under the advisory sentencing guidelines is increased. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a)-(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. Because, under the ACCA, Ramey was subject to a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence, Ramey's guideline range of 168 to 210 months became 180 to 210 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a timely raised Sixth Amendment challenge to an enhanced sentence. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\">. Ramey does not argue that the district court consulted improper sources of evidence in determining that his prior third-degree burglary convictions qualified for purposes of the ACCA and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (limiting the types of evidence a district court can consider to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies under the ACCA). Ramey does argue, however, that the district court improperly found facts about his prior convictions, i.e., whether his felonies were violent or were committed on different occasions. Ramey\u2019s argument that <em>Shepard </em>bars judge-made findings about the factual nature of the prior convictions already has been rejected by this Court. <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1274-76 (explaining that it is \"implicit in the <em>Shepard </em>rule\u201d that district courts may make a finding as to the nature of the prior conviction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">. We \"consider! ] <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction is a 'violent felony\u2019 for purposes of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v.
