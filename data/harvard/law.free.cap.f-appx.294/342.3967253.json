We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-24\">Where it is unclear whether the BIA conducted a <em>de novo </em>review, the court will \u201clook to the IJ\u2019s oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels the result, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-25\">The agency denied Lu\u2019s asylum claim as time-barred. Lu does not challenge this finding in her opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-26\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Lu failed to establish past perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cution, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003), and that it was more likely than not she would be persecuted if returned to China. <em>See Hox-ha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Lu did not show it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122-23 (9th Cir.2004). In addition, we reject Lu\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to discuss country conditions evidence when denying CAT relief, because the IJ specifically referenced the record in concluding Lu had not met her burden. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 744 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b369-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
