Godwin argues that the district court erred by applying an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. He asserts that there was insufficient evidence that he was involved in the burglary that resulted in the theft of the firearm he possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>A \u201cdistrict court may adopt facts contained in a PSR without inquiry, so long as the facts have an adequate evidentiary basis and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). The presentence report (PSR) relied on investigations by the Jefferson Parish Sheriffs Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which included a statement from another participant in the burglary describing Godwin\u2019s role in that offense. This court has held that even uncorroborated hearsay evidence is sufficiently reliable for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. West, </em>58 F.3d 133, 138 (5th Cir. 1995). Godwin did not present sufficient evidence to rebut the facts stated in the PSR. It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that the information in the PSR is materially untrue, <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 248 (5th Cir.2005), and absent rebuttal evidence, the district court is entitled to rely on the facts stated in the PSR. <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005). As the district court\u2019s factual determination was not implausible in light of the record as a whole, Godwin has not shown that the district court clearly erred by applying the enhancement. <em>See Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
