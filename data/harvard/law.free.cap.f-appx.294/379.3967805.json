Vega contends the IJ erred in determining he was ineligible for: (1) withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); (2) deferral of removal under CAT; and (3) former INA \u00a7 212(c) relief, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). We dismiss the petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction and deny the petition for review in part on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">1. We lack jurisdiction over Vega\u2019s withholding of removal claim. The IJ denied withholding of removal because Vega\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c)(1) constituted a \u201cparticularly serious crime,\u201d which results in the mandatory denial of withholding of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(d)(2). The determination whether a crime is \u201cparticularly serious\u201d is committed to the IJ\u2019s discretion. <em>Un-uakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir.2005). We lack jurisdiction over such discretionary determinations, unless the petitioner raises a question of law or a constitutional challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination. <em>Afridi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.2006). Vega does not raise such legal or constitutional claim and instead asks this court solely to reweigh the evidence to hold his conviction does not constitute a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d This is insufficient to vest this court with jurisdiction over his withholding of removal claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">2. We have jurisdiction to review Vega\u2019s deferral of removal claim under CAT, because his conviction of a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d does not render him ineligible for deferral of removal. <em>See Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 n. 2 (9th Cir.2008). The IJ found although Vega\u2019s brothers were killed in a land dispute with a neighboring family, Vega remained in Guatemala for thirteen years afterwards without being harmed. The IJ further found Vega could relocate within Guatemala to avoid any harm from the neighboring family. Thus, the IJ held Vega failed to show it was more likely than not he would be tortured in Guatemala or that such torture would be \u201ccommitted by the government or forces the government is either \u2018unable or unwilling\u2019 to control.\u201d <em>See Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir.2000). We hold substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determinations. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 442 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">3. We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief. The IJ denied \u00a7 212(c) relief to Vega on two alternative grounds: (1) Vega abandoned his \u00a7 212(c) claim for failure to file a timely Form 1-191 (Application for Advance Permission to Return to Unrelinquished Domicile); and (2) Vega is statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Before the BIA, Vega contested only the IJ\u2019s holding that he is statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, but did not appeal the IJ\u2019s alternative holding that he had abandoned his \u00a7 212(c) claim. This constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, which deprives us of jurisdiction over his \u00a7 212(c) claim. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b405-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
