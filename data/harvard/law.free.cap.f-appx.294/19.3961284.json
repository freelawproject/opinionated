Johnson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Johnson that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Johnson failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-20\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Am, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Johnson has waived appellate review by failing to timely file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the underlying appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-21\">Johnson also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in its denial of Johnson\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, and therefore affirm. <em>See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm\u2019rs, </em>945 F.2d 716, 724 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
