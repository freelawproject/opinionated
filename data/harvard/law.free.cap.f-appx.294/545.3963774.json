Jasmin\u2019s sole contention is that in finding he qualified as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by considering prior convictions that were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury. Jasmin concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), forecloses his challenge. He argues, however, that later Supreme Court decisions seem to have called into question the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and raises his objection in order to preserve it for further review in the event that the Supreme Court overrules <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-21\">The objection is duly noted and preserved in case the Supreme Court changes the law in the future. In the meantime, we have to follow the law on this issue as it is. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-53, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 1978, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (instructing that Supreme Court \u201cdecisions remain binding precedent until [it] see[s] fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
