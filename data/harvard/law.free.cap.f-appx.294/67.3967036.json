Counsel for Blackmon has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal and conceding that the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 when it accepted Blackmon\u2019s guilty plea. Blackmon has filed pro se supplemental opening and reply briefs claiming that his attorney was ineffective, that his sentence should not have been enhanced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000), and that his conviction violates the Sixth Amendment because the indictment to which he pled guilty charged him with possession of fifty grams \u201cor more\u201d of cocaine base. The Government has filed a brief responding to Black-mon\u2019s pro se supplemental opening brief. Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. After a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing at which Blackmon admitted his guilt and attested that his plea was knowing and voluntary, the district court sentenced Blackmon to the statutory minimum of life in prison based on prior convictions admitted to by him in his plea agreement. Because Blackmon did not dispute that he absconded for nearly three and a half years after entering his guilty plea, thereby triggering the imposition of the enhanced penalty pursuant to the terms of his plea agreement, his mandatory life sentence was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Farrior, </em>535 F.3d 210, 224 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cA statutorily required sentence ... is <em>per se </em>reasonable.\u201d); <em>see also Burgess v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 1577-80, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008) (holding that a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is \u201can offense punishable by more than one year,\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (2000), regardless of whether the state of conviction classified the particular offense as a misdemeanor or felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Although Blackmon purports to have withdrawn his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his pro se supplemental reply brief, we find that ineffective assistance is not apparent on the record. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (holding that for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be established, a defendant must show that but for counsel\u2019s error, the outcome of his proceedings would have been different). Accordingly, should he wish to do so, Blackmon may raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">We also conclude that Blackmon\u2019s conviction does not violate the Sixth Amendment because his indictment does not charge a precise quantity of cocaine. The relevant statute requires only 50 grams to support a conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). Blackmon\u2019s indictment charged responsibility for \u201c50 grams or more\u201d of cocaine base. Greater specificity was not required since Blackmon needed to admit responsibility for only 50 grams, and he in fact stipulated to responsibility for 163 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>counsel inform Blackmon in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Blackmon requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may motion this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Blackmon. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
