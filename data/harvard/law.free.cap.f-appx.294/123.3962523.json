INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). Under the substantial evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The evidence does not compel a conclusion that petitioners suffered past persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion or that it is more likely than not that they will suffer such persecution if they are returned to India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(i), (ii); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.1997). Further, petitioners cannot meet the more demanding standard for withholding of removal given that they cannot satisfy the standard for asylum. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, 37 </em>F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). As to relief under the CAT, petitioners failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion that they were not eligible for relief under the CAT in their brief. Accordingly, the issue is waived. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir. 2007). The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
