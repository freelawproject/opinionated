On appeal, Calixte argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on the advisory sentencing guidelines and failed to give adequate consideration to, and analysis of, factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Calixte argues that the district court\u2019s failure to give proper consideration to \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the history and characteristics of the defendant, is reflected by the fact that the district court did not sentence him below the advisory guidelines range despite his presentation of mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">We review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-64, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-67, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We will reverse only for abuse of discretion, giving deference to the district court. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the Guidelines, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The Supreme Court has suggested that a sentence is substantively unreasonable if it is not supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Section 3553(a) provides that district courts must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the applicable Guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (6) protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court followed the proper sentencing procedures by treating the guidelines as advisory and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because Calixte\u2019s sentence is no greater than necessary to fulfill the statutory purposes of sentencing, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to impose a below-guidelines sentence. Accordingly, we affirm Calixte\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
