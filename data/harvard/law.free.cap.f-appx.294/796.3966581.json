Hatfield was sentenced to a total of 138 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising various issues for review. In a pro se supplemental brief, Hatfield joined in those issues raised by counsel and raised additional grounds for review. The Government elected not to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Hatfield first contends that his counsel provided ineffective assistance. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is generally not cognizable on direct appeal, but should instead be asserted in a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). However, we have recognized an exception to the general rule when \u201cit \u2018conclusively appears\u2019 from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir. 1994)). Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective, Hatfield\u2019s claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Next, Hatfield contends that the district court erred by refusing his motion for the appointment of an expert to review audio recordings admitted by the Government, which he believed had been edited or otherwise tampered with. \u201cIndigent defendants are entitled by law to money for investigative and expert services that are \u2018necessary for adequate representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hartsell, </em>127 F.3d 343, 349 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(1) (2000)). We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the necessity of expert services for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo show reversible error in a district court\u2019s refusal to appoint an expert, a defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s refusal was prejudicial to his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Perrera, </em>842 F.2d 73, 77 (4th Cir.1988) (per curiam). As Hatfield failed to offer any evidence in support of his motion for the appointment of an expert, or alternatively establish that his case was prejudiced in any manner by the denial, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Hatfield further contends that the search of his person and trailer were improper and the evidence obtained pursuant thereto should have been suppressed. We previously held in the Government\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s suppression of evidence that an unannounced entry by deputy sheriffs into Hatfield\u2019s residence was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Hatfield, </em>365 F.3d 332, 338-41 (4th Cir. 2004). That holding is now the law of the case, and, since Hatfield has not alleged any of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine, he may not relitigate that issue in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Aramo-ny, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Finally, Hatfield contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime (Count Thirteen) under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, we consider whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We review both direct and circumstantial evidence, and permit the \u201cgovern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>merit the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Hatfield argues that even if he \u201callegedly accepted the gun\u201d in payment for a controlled substance, he did not \u201cuse\u201d it as contemplated by the ordinary meaning of the word in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The facts of this case are very similar to those in <em>Watson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 579, 582, 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 472 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction for use of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, which was predicated on the defendant\u2019s receipt of the firearm in exchange for drugs. As in <em>Watson, </em>the basis for the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) charge here was Hatfield\u2019s receipt of the firearm in trade for a controlled substance. Therefore, even construing the facts in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case. While we affirm Hatfield\u2019s convictions on Count One and Counts Four through Twelve, we reverse Hatfield\u2019s conviction on Count Thirteen based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Watson. We </em>remand to the district court for further proceedings. Additionally, we grant Hatfield\u2019s motion to withdraw his motion to dismiss the federal indictment and deny his remaining motions. We also deny Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, but grant the motion as to the request for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
