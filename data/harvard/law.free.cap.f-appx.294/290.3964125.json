We deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal must be upheld if \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481, 112 S.Ct. at 815. When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817. The substantial evidence standard also applies to credibility determinations. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 933 (9th Cir.2004). That includes determinations that corroborative evidence was available. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4). However, when a determination is based upon credibility, \u201c \u2018a specific, cogent reason\u2019 \u201d for disbelieving the alien must be offered. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194,1199 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">We have reviewed the record and are satisfied that the BIA\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Wang had not suffered past persecution; evidence of her claim of fear of future persecution was uncorroborated;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and her credibility was doubtful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>accepted, the evidence was insufficient to compel a determination that there was a clear probability<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that she would be persecuted should she return to China.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Wang moved the BIA to reopen<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so that she could establish her right to adjustment of status due to her marriage to a United States citizen during the proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the BIA denied the motion because she did not file it within the requisite ninety-day period. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c) (7) (C) (i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also Dela Cruz, Jr. v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 946, 949 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2002); <em>cf. Kalilu v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 777, 779-80 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (timely motion to reopen). To the extent that Wang intends to suggest that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen sua sponte,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we lack jurisdiction to consider that.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-13\">. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The BIA also denied her application for asylum, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158; United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted Dec. 10, 1984, Treaty Doc.

Wang suggests that the immigration judge was biased because when he denied asylum, he referred to the fact that she obtained her entry visa by fraud. However, because she was not attempting to escape persecution, no error or bias was shown. <em>Cf.
