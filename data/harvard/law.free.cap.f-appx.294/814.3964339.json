The parties consented to trial before a magistrate judge, who, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that the insurer breached its duties. This appeal primarily focuses on the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Holmes-Redding Builders, Inc., is a homebuilder, which sold a house to Kevin and Sharon Twomey in 2000. The sales contract included a limited warranty for the home administered by Home Owners Management Enterprises, Inc. (HOME). Warranty Underwriters Insurance Co. (WUIC) issued the warranty. In the event that Holmes-Redding failed to fulfill its warranty obligations, the warranty provided that HOME/WUIC would perform those obligations. The warranty also imposed reimbursement obligations on Holmes-Redding for amounts spent by HOME/WUIC to satisfy Holmes-Red-ding\u2019s warranty obligations. Holmes-Red-ding also had a commercial general liability policy (CGL policy) issued by Mid-Continent Casualty Co.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">The Twomeys\u2019 house experienced structural and cosmetic damages that resulted from construction defects. Unable to reach a resolution with Holmes-Redding, the Twomeys sued Holmes-Redding and others in state court for negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations, and fraud. The Twomeys also filed a claim under the warranty. The Twomeys eventually added HOME and WUIC as defendants, alleging they breached their warranty obligations. HOME and WUIC asserted a cross-claim against Holmes-Redding for reimbursement under the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-19\">Holmes-Redding notified Mid-Continent of the Twomeys\u2019 lawsuit. Mid-Continent concluded that the Twomeys\u2019 claims fell outside the scope of the CGL policy, and declined to defend or indemnify Holmes-Redding. Holmes-Redding engaged counsel on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-20\">The Twomeys\u2019 claims against Holmes-Redding, HOME, and WUIC were referred to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled in the Twomeys\u2019 favor, awarding them $218,000 in \u201crepair cost\u201d damages, $70,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees, and $49,915 in expert and arbitration fees. The arbitrator ruled that WUIC was obligated under the warranty to pay any portion of the \u201crepair cost\u201d damages that Holmes-Redding did not pay. The state trial court confirmed the arbitration award. Mid-Continent did not indemnify Holmes-Redding.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>HOME paid the \u201crepair cost\u201d damages plus interest to the Twomeys. According to the parties, the remaining awards for attorneys\u2019 fees and expert and arbitration fees remain unpaid. HOME and WUIC\u2019s cross-claim for reimbursement against Holmes-Redding was severed from the Twomey lawsuit. HOME and WUIC prevailed on that claim, and obtained a state court judgment holding Holmes-Redding liable for the amounts paid to the Twom-eys as well as for other expenses incurred. HOME, WUIC, and Holmes-Redding settled, with Holmes-Redding agreeing to assign to HOME its claims against Mid-Continent.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">HOME, as Holmes-Redding\u2019s assignee, sued Mid-Continent for breach of contract in September 2004. HOME asserted that Mid-Continent breached its duty to defend Holmes-Redding and that Mid-Continent had a duty to indemnify Holmes-Redding for the full amount of the arbitration award. HOME also sought prejudgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The parties consented to trial and judgment by a magistrate, with appeal being taken directly to this court. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the magistrate ruled for HOME on all of its claims. The magistrate awarded HOME $135,521.01 for Mid-Continent\u2019s breach of its duty to defend Holmes-Redding; $337,915 for the Twomeys\u2019 arbitration award, which includes both the \u201crepair costs\u201d damages HOME paid and the remaining unpaid amounts; $135,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees for this lawsuit; and $68,637.48 in prejudgment interest. Mid-Continent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, all of the evidence introduced and all of the factual inferences from the evidence are viewed in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and all reasonable doubts about the facts should be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review the interpretation of an insurance contract <em>de </em>novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As this is a diversity case, we apply Texas substantive law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">The CGL policy provides that Mid-Continent \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d The policy then provides, in pertinent part, that it applies to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d that \u201cis caused by an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d The policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">Mid-Continent initially urged that it had neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify Holmes-Redding because a claim of defective construction that dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>aged only the insured\u2019s work falls outside of the CGL policy\u2019s scope. This is because such a claim is not one for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d as those terms are used in the policy. Mid-Continent noted in its opening brief that this court had certified questions to the Texas Supreme Court on this issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The Texas Supreme Court answered our questions in <em>Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Casualty Co.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court \u201cconclude[d] that allegations of unintended construction defects may constitute an \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018occurrence\u2019 under the CGL policy and that allegations of damage to or loss of use of the home itself may also constitute \u2018property damage\u2019 sufficient to trigger the duty to defend under a CGL policy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court did not reach the duty to indemnify because \u201cthat duty is not triggered by allegations but rather by proof at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\"><em>Lamar Homes </em>controls the disposition of this issue. Mid-Continent conceded its duty to defend during oral argument in light of <em>Lamar Homes. </em>We affirm the award of damages for Mid-Continent\u2019s breach of its duty to defend, and turn our attention to Mid-Continent\u2019s other duty to indemnify issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Mid-Continent contests its duty to indemnify on several other grounds. We note initially that Mid-Continent acknowledges that the CGL policy is a liability contract. \u201cIn a liability contract, the insurer agrees to cover <em>liability </em>for damages. If the insured is liable, the insurance company must pay the damages.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn the event a judgment is rendered against the insured, the insurer\u2019s liability to pay attaches at that time. The obligation to pay continues until the judgment is satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, unlike under an indemnity policy, Holmes-Redding did not have to pay the judgment in order to trigger Mid-Continent\u2019s duty to indemnify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">Mid-Continent first argues that under the CGL policy, its duty to indemnify is limited to sums that an insured is \u201clegally obligated to pay.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Mid-Continent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>tends that this court in <em>Data Specialties, Inc. v. Transcontinental Insurance Co.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>held that under Texas law, the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d means obligated as a matter of tort law, not as a matter of contract. Mid-Continent says that, while the Twomeys pursued both tort and contract claims against Holmes-Redding, the arbitrator based its award only on breach of contract. Thus, Mid-Continent urges, it has no duty to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Mid-Continent did not raise this below. We generally do not consider arguments that are urged for the first time on appeal, and we do not do so here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Mid-Continent next contends that, because HOME paid the \u201crepair cost\u201d portion of the arbitration award, it \u201cextinguished\u201d Holmes-Redding\u2019s liability to the Twomeys. This is because the one-satisfaction rule prevents the Twomeys from recovering those damages a second time from Holmes-Redding. Thus, because Holmes-Redding cannot be forced to pay these amounts to the Twomeys, neither it nor HOME as its assignee had a claim against Mid-Continent for indemnification of those amounts. Neither the parties nor the magistrate cite to any cases that are on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">We are not persuaded by this argument. The central reason is that HOME\u2019S payment did not absolve Holmes-Redding of its legal responsibility for the damages. In its role here, HOME was only secondarily liable for the judgment the Twomeys won. HOME was not Holmes-Redding\u2019s insurer, and its payment to the Twomeys did not indemnify Holmes-Redding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Holmes-Redding was legally obligated to reimburse HOME for the amounts expended on its behalf. This obligation was confirmed by the state trial court, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>entered judgment against Holmes-Red-ding in favor of HOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The Fourth Circuit long ago rejected an \u201cextinguishment\u201d argument similar to Mid-Continent\u2019s.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There, the insured had been hired to construct a manufacturing plant for a company. A person was \u201cinjured by coming into contact with a high voltage electrical current carried by wires maintained by the [insured], which had negligently failed to provide proper safeguards against the danger.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The injured party obtained a judgment against the insured and the company that had hired the insured. The company paid the judgment under threat of execution. The contract between the company and the insured provided that the insured would indemnify the company, and the company deducted the amount it had paid to satisfy the judgment from what it owed to the insured under the construction contract. The insured then sought to recover the amount the company withheld from its insurer, which denied coverage. While the insurer admitted there would be coverage had the injured party enforced the judgment against the insured directly or \u201chad by legal process collected\u201d the judgment from the insured, the insurer argued that payment of the judgment by the company had \u201cextinguished\u201d its liability under the policy. The Fourth Circuit disagreed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">[T]he fact that judgment was obtained against the [company] can make no difference, for the primary liability established by the judgment was that of the [insured] and there can be no question but that, upon payment of the judgment, the [company], being only secondarily liable, had the right to recover against the [insured] for any amount paid thereunder. The liability of the [insured] established by the judgment was not extinguished, therefore, by the payment made by the [company] but the right to enforce it was transferred to the [company]. As the [insured] remained liable for the amount of the judgment, it can make no difference with respect to the coverage of the policy that the liability was payable by the [insured] to the [company] rather than to [the injured person],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">... The position of the [insurer] comes to this: that it is absolved of its obligation to pay the liability imposed by law upon the [insured] because that liability, although it has in fact been paid by the [insured], has been enforced through collection from another whom the [insured] was bound at law to reimburse. We know of no principle of law which would sustain this position.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"aar-dedup-0\">We, too, \u201care not impressed by the argument.\u201d While Mid-Continent is right that the Twomeys could not collect the \u201crepair cost\u201d damages a second time, its \u201cextin-guishment\u201d argument falters because Holmes-Redding was still liable for the damages caused by its negligence. The proper question is whether that liability was covered by the policy, that is, whether there was property damage caused by an occurrence and which is not subject to an exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Mid-Continent argues that the \u201ccontractual liability\u201d exclusion, also referred to as exclusion b, relieves it of any duty to indemnify based on Holmes-Red-ding\u2019s obligations to HOME. The exclusion provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-11\">This insurance does not apply to: \u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>This exclusion does not apply to liability for damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">(1) That the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">(2) Assumed in a contract or agreement that is an \u201cinsured contract....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Mid-Continent argues that Holmes-Red-ding assumed liability to reimburse HOME through the warranty agreement, and therefore, this exclusion is directly applicable. Mid-Continent contends that neither exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Assuming that the exclusion is applicable, which is not without doubt given our and other courts\u2019 construction of it and similar exclusions,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we conclude that an exception applies. Although Holmes-Red-ding was contractually obligated to reimburse HOME, Holmes-Redding would have been liable to HOME in the absence of the warranty. We have explained that \u201cTexas courts liberally apply the doctrine of legal subrogation in instances when one person involuntarily pays the debt for which another person is primarily liable.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Texas Supreme Court has recently explained that \u201cequitable (or legal) subrogation does not depend on contract but arises in every instance in which one person, not acting voluntarily, has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable and which in equity should have been paid by the latter.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, as the United States Supreme Court opined, \u201cthere are few doctrines better established than that a surety who pays the debt of another is entitled to all the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>person he paid to enforce his right to be reimbursed.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We think that Holmes-Redding would have been liable to HOME under the theory of legal subrogation. \u2018When, as here, liability could be imposed pursuant to either a contractual indemnity provision or a generally applicable legal principle, the contractual liability exclusion will not bar coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-Kl\">Accordingly, we reject Mid-Continent\u2019s \u201cextinguishment\u201d argument under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Mid-Continent next argues that it has no duty to indemnify Holmes-Redding for the unpaid portions of the arbitrator\u2019s award. Its argument is essentially that \u201cthe Twomeys, having a direct right to recover from Mid-Continent under the policies as judgment creditors of Holmes-Redding, can still attempt to collect the unpaid portions of the judgment from Mid-Continent after Mid-Continent pays those amounts to Home.\u201d This \u201ccontinued existence of a risk of double payment,\u201d Mid-Continent says, means that HOME cannot collect the unpaid portions of the arbitration award. Mid-Continent cites no authority for this proposition. In any event, Mid-Continent cannot be said to have raised this argument below,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and we will not wade into it for the first time now.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">In a final shift, Mid-Continent urges that, if its no duty to indemnify arguments fail, \u201cthen the indemnity portion of the case should be remanded for trial based on the standards of <em>Lamar Homes.\u201d </em>This is because \u201c[t]his case was decided by the trial court on summary judgment without the benefit of guidance from the Texas Supreme Court on the occurrence issue,\u201d that is, the meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Mid-Continent completely fails to explain how the magistrate\u2019s interpretation of \u201coccurrence\u201d differs from that in <em>Lamar Homes. </em>The magistrate concluded that negligent construction can constitute an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and in essence looked to whether the damage caused by the insured\u2019s negligent acts was unintended and unexpected.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Lamar Homes </em>concludes that negligent construction can constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and explains that \u201ca deliberate act, performed negligently, is an accident if the effect is not the intended or expected result; that is, the result would have been different had the deliberate act been performed correctly.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In other words, \u201ca claim does not involve an accident or occurrence when either direct allegations purport that the insured intended the injury (which is presumed in cases of intentional tort) or circumstances confirm that the resulting damage was the natural and expected result of the insured\u2019s actions, that is, was highly probable whether the insured was negligent or not.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">As we see no material difference between the two, and as Mid-Continent points to none, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">We have no occasion to consider Mid-Continent\u2019s arguments regarding prejudgment interest and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this suit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
