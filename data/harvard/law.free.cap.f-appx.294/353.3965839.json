We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The IJ denied Umar\u2019s asylum application as time-barred. Umar does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Umar has not provided sufficient evidence that he has been, or is likely to be, specifically' targeted for persecution, <em>see Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1178-81, and his general fear of harassment, discrimination, and sporadic violence is insufficient to render him eligible for withholding of removal, <em>see id.; see also Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). The record does not compel the conclusion that Umar established a pattern or practice of persecution against Seventh Day Adventists in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1178-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of CAT relief because Umar did not show it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100,1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b380-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
