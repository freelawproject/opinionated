We agree with the district court that, because Gingras\u2019s complaint was silent as to the capacity in which he was suing defendants, his complaint was properly construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>asserting only official-capacity claims, <em>see Baker v. Chisom, </em>501 F.3d 920, 923 (8th Cir.2007) (noting that if plaintiffs complaint is silent about capacity in which he is suing defendant, court interprets complaint as including only official-capacity claims), and, as such, those claims failed, <em>see Robb v. Hungerbeeler, </em>370 F.3d 735, 739 (8th Cir.2004) (official-capacity suit is treated as suit against entity); <em>Ware v. Jackson County, Mo., </em>150 F.3d 873, 880 (8th Cir.1998) (plaintiff may establish municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 by proving his constitutional rights were violated by action pursuant to policy or by misconduct so pervasive as to constitute custom); <em>Morstad v. Dep\u2019t of Corr. and Rehab., </em>147 F.3d 741, 743 (8th Cir.1998) (Eleventh Amendment bars suit against state or state officials acting in official capacities). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-29\">. The Honorable Karen E.
