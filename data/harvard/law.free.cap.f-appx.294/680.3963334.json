The allegations all involve Defendants\u2019 alleged misuse of a network of workers compensation providers developed by Plaintiffs. A jury awarded Plaintiffs $682,431 on their breach of contract claim with regard to unpaid fees, $2,640,000 on their breach of contract claim with regard to the confidentiality provisions, $2,640,000 for their claim under the ITSA, and $1,820,000 in punitive damages under the ITSA. Plaintiffs subsequently moved for judgment on the verdict, prejudgment interest, and attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial. After all these motions were resolved in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, Defendants appealed to our Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">For substantially the reasons given by the District Court, we AFFIRM the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
