We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 924 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-26\">The agency denied Pangalila\u2019s asylum application claim as time-barred. Pangali-la does not challenge this finding in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-27\">With respect to withholding of removal, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Pangalila did not suffer past persecution because he was never harmed in Indonesia. <em>See Hakeem, v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 817 (9th Cir.2001). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>more, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael </em>applies to a withholding of removal claim by an Indonesian Christian, Pangalila has not established a clear probability of future persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003). Lastly, the record does not compel the conclusion that Pangalila demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution against Indonesian Christians. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Accordingly, Pangalila\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Pan-galila has not established it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439. F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b383-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
