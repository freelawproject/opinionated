Because the district court did not clearly err in its findings that the vessel was seaworthy and the negligence of the captain was not within the privity or knowledge of the owner, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">McFerren contends that the vessel was unseaworthy for having inadequate equipment and an incompetent crew and the accident was within the privity or knowledge of Backcountry, but we disagree. The findings of the district court that the vessel \u201cwas outfitted with all safety equipment that was required by the U.S. Coast Guard for bay and in-shore use\u201d and that the licensed and experienced captain was competent are supported by the record. The findings of the district court that the accident was caused by the captain\u2019s navigational error, which was not within the privity or knowledge of the owner, is also not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The judgment of limitation of liability in favor of Backcountry is</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
