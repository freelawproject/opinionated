The district court denied Carroll\u2019s application, and Carroll now appeals. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-26\">The SCRA gives courts discretion to grant servicemembers relief from certain contracts entered into prior to their military service. 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 591. Carroll, an Army reservist, filed an application for relief from her obligations under mortgage contracts with Option One Mortgage Corporation (\u201cOption One\u201d) and Homecomings Financial Network (\u201cHomecomings\u201d). The district court docketed the filing as an application for \u201cOther Miscellaneous Relief\u2019 on the miscellaneous docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>The district court held an initial hearing with Carroll, during which the court instructed Carroll to contact her creditors regarding the application. The district court subsequently held four additional conferences and heard arguments from Carroll and representatives of Option One and Homecomings. During the third conference, the district court instructed Carroll to provide previously-requested financial information by the fourth conference on June 29, 2006, or the court was \u201cgoing to have to consider a sanction.\u201d Carroll sent the financial information on the morning of June 29, 2006. During the fourth conference, the court heard arguments on both the timing of the requested information and the merits of Carroll\u2019s application, and then advised Carroll that the court was \u201cgoing to have to deny the relief [she was] requesting.\u201d The court subsequently entered a \u201cMemorandum and Order\u201d denying Carroll\u2019s application for discretionary relief under the SCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The current dispute centers on the characterization of this final action. Carroll contends that the district court dismissed her case via sanctions. As such, Carroll contends that the court abused its discretion by not imposing lesser sanctions prior to dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Trinity Marine Group, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 894, 898 (5th Cir.1997) (explaining that \u201cdismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction that deprives the litigant of the opportunity to pursue his claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">However, Carroll incorrectly characterizes the district court\u2019s action. The court\u2019s order did not in fact dismiss Carroll\u2019s case \u2014 no <em>case </em>was ever filed. Rather, Carroll filed an application for discretionary relief that was set on the miscellaneous docket. Matters filed on the miscellaneous docket are \u201cancillary and supplementary proceedings not defined as civil actions.\u201d <em>Matter of Search of 4330 North 35th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, </em>142 F.R.D. 161, 163-64 (E.D.Wis.1992) (citations omitted). Moreover, no sanctions were ever imposed. After the court mentioned the possibility of sanctions during the third conference, sanctions were never discussed again. The Order did identify Carroll\u2019s \u201cprior unwillingness to provide financial information\u201d as one factor in the court\u2019s decision to deny Carroll\u2019s application, but this was never referred to as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Thus, it is incorrect to characterize this matter as a dismissal based on sanctions. Although the district court may have contributed to the confusion by periodically referring to \u201cdismissal\u201d and unnecessarily entering a subsequent \u201cFinal Judgment,\u201d the overall posture of the case is clear: Carroll filed a solitary application for Other Miscellaneous Relief, which the district court denied following several hearings on the merits. Accordingly, Carroll\u2019s present arguments and supporting authorities\u2014 which address the extreme sanction of dismissal in the context of a civil case \u2014 are inapposite. Carroll is in fact appealing the denial of her application for discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Under the anticipatory-relief provision of the SCRA, an applicant is entitled to one noticed hearing to show that her ability to meet her obligations \u201chas been materially affected by reason of military service.\u201d 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 591. The court then has discretion to grant relief. <em>Id. </em>Here, Carroll received at least five hearings on the merits, after which the court exercised its discretion and denied Carroll\u2019s application. Because Carroll makes no arguments as to how the denial of her application was an abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
