We deny Liberty\u2019s petition for review..</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">When the question before this court is whether an agency has properly interpreted and applied its own regulations, the reviewing court must give the agency\u2019s interpretation \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>See Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994). This court must defer to the Secretary\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its regulations so long as it is not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].\u201d <em>See id. </em>Moreover, this court will defer to the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact if they are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e) (2000). Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a particular conclusion. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>See Shively v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 987, 989 (4th Cir.1984) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We find the record contains evidence that a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Liberty did not comply with agency regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, neither the ALJ nor the Secretary abused their discretion in upholding the imposition of CMPs. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 488.438(\u00e9) (2008). We therefore deny Liberty\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-17\">. We have jurisdiction to consider Liberty\u2019s petition pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-5\">. We reject Liberty's assertion that the Secretary lacks authority to issue citations for violations involving motor vehicles. Because 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(1) (2008) speaks of the residents\u2019 <em>environment, </em>it is to be interpreted as broadly as is necessary to protect residents in all locations under the facility\u2019s control, in-eluding facility vehicles. It would be incongruous to hold that residents travel at their own risk when the facility to which they have entrusted their care transports them off-site.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
