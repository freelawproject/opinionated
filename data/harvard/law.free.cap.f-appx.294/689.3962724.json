NEWMAN, Hon. RALPH K. WINTER and Hon. GUIDO CALABRESI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b715-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">Defendant appeals a conviction for crimes relating to possession of crack cocaine and of a firearm. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of the case, its procedural history, and the scope of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">I. Admission of a Tape Recorded Prison Telephone Conversation</p>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">Defendant argues that admission of a recorded telephone conversation between himself and an unknown speaker, not available in court, violated his constitutional confrontation right. Because of the strength of the other evidence against Defendant, any conceivable error in admitting the recorded telephone conversation was harmless. <em>See United States v. Vitale, </em>459 F.3d 190, 195 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that Confrontation Clause issues are subject to harmless error analysis); <em>United States v. Colombo, </em>909 F.2d 711, 714 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cThe strength of the government\u2019s case against the defendant is probably the most critical factor in determining whether an error affected the verdict.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-19\">II. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b715-20\">Defendant argues that his case should be remanded for resentencing in compliance with the retroactive application of changes in the Guidelines pertaining to crack cocaine. Defendant\u2019s offense level, however, was set not by U.S.C.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the amended provision, but rather by U.S.C.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because of his status as a career offender. <em>Cf. United States v. Ogman, </em>535 F.3d 108, 108 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (holding that it is not necessary to remand for resentencing under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), when a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cwas not the result of the 100-tol powder to crack ratio, but rather resulted from his status as a <em>career offender </em>under U.S.C.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">We nevertheless observe, and the Government concedes, that the District Court may have been influenced by the relevant mandatory minimum when determining sentence. In light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Whitley, </em>529 F.3d 150 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>(2d Cir.2008), clarifying the correct construction of the mandatory minimum applicable to the case before us, we believe that the District Court should have the opportunity to determine whether to resentence, now fully informed of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Whitley. See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103,117-18 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We have considered all of Defendant-Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding his conviction and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the conviction is AFFIRMED and we REMAND.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
