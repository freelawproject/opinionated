United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that Cody\u2019s resentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. The record demonstrates that the district court properly calculated Cody\u2019s sentencing range, acknowledged that it considered the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sufficiently explained its reasoning for the resentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-12\">. This is the second time we have considered an appeal of this case. In the first appeal, a panel of this court, in an unpublished decision, affirmed Cody's convictions, but vacated his sentences on Counts 1 and 2, in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Cody, </em>136 Fed.Appx. 297 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
