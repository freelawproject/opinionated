Vance appeals from the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to twenty-four months imprisonment after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Vance violated the terms of his supervised release by committing domestic assault on his wife. Vance challenges the revocation, contending that he was denied the right to confront the witness against him in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments when, after his wife invoked the marital privilege, the court admitted hearsay statements made by Vance\u2019s wife concerning the assault. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause does not permit the introduction of out-of-court testimonial evidence unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Vance asserts that, under this ruling, he was entitled to confront the witness against him at the revocation hearing. The <em>Crawford </em>holding does not apply to supervised release revocations because they are not \u201ccriminal prosecutions\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>446 F.3d 688, 691-92 (7th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Rondeau, </em>430 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The district court\u2019s decision to admit hearsay evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Mohr, </em>318 F.3d 613, 618 (4th Cir.2003). Hearsay evidence must be \u201cdemonstrably reliable\u201d to be admissible. <em>United States v. McCallum, 677 </em>F.2d 1024, 1026 (4th Cir.1982). We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the materials submitted in the joint appendix, particularly the transcript of the hearing. We conclude that the hearsay evidence was sufficiently reliable and therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
