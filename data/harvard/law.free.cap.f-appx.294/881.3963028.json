Bardell appeals his sentence of 57 months of imprisonment imposed following his guilty plea conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight. Bardell contends that his conduct, throwing a loaded gun behind a bar where people were standing, did not warrant the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-24\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s conduct constituted reckless endangerment under \u00a7 3C1.2 for clear error. <em>See United States v. Lugman, </em>130 F.3d 113, 115-16 (5th Cir. 1997). Section 3C1.2 provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he \u201crecklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d Reckless refers to a situation in which the defendant \u201cwas aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.\u201d \u00a7 2A1.4, comment, (n.l) (cross-referenced in \u00a7 3C1.2, comment, (n.2).).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-25\">The applicability of \u00a7 3C1.2 is not limited \u201cto situations resulting in actual harm or manifesting extremely dangerous conduct by a defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 323 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Villanueva, </em>69 Fed.Appx. 657 (5th Cir.2003) (finding that a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 was proper where the defendant threw a bag containing methamphetamine onto a public sidewalk while fleeing from police because anyone, including a child, could have picked up the methamphetamine and ingested it). Bardell has not shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>\u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
