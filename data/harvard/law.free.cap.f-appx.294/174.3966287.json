Melgar conceded that his conviction for indecency with a child rendered him deportable on two grounds, for his having committed a crime involving moral turpitude and for his having committed an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Melgar\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s determination are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 367-68 (5th Cir.2007), and <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir.2007). His petition for review is thus DENIED in part. The BIA had authority to issue an order of removal; however, Melgar should be granted an opportunity to apply for an adjustment of status before the Immigration Judge, as he reasonably relied on the Immigration Judge\u2019s grant of \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Avilez-Granados, </em>481 F.3d at 872-73. The petition is thus GRANTED in part and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
