Brown, </em>504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir.2007). Dismissal is proper where plaintiffs \u201clack ... a cognizable legal theory\u201d or fail to allege \u201csufficient facts ... under a cognizable legal theory.\u201d <em>Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep\u2019t, </em>901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.1990). However, \u201c[cjonclusory allegations and unreasonable inferences ... are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>504 F.3d at 910. <em>See also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955,167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">1. We accept plaintiffs\u2019 market definition because market definition is essentially a question of fact. <em>Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Res., Inc., </em>838 F.2d 360, 363 (9th Cir.1988). Each defendant has a monopoly in the relevant market for purposes of this appeal \u2014 the wholesale market for its own credit data for use in tri-merged Mortgage Credit Reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">2. It is undisputed that the source of defendants\u2019 monopoly power in the wholesale market is the tri-merged requirement adopted by the Government Sponsored Entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d). The independent resellers have no direct control over the tri-merged requirement. Nor do they allege facts showing that their advocacy has been effective at getting the GSEs to seriously contemplate abandoning the tri-merged requirement. The resellers\u2019 lack of influence is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 theory that defendants are perpetuating the requirement \u2014 and with it their monopolies \u2014 by driving independent resellers out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">3. Nor can plaintiffs attribute the continued existence of the requirement to defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations, because plaintiffs themselves point to publicly available studies showing that defendants\u2019 raw credit data is highly inaccurate. <em>See Am. Profl Testing Serv., Inc. v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal &amp; Profl Publ\u2019ns, Inc., </em>108 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">4. The pleadings also fail to provide a basis for proving antitrust injury. Plaintiffs don\u2019t want to enter the wholesale market and don\u2019t identify any other potential entrant. <em>See Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>509 U.S. 209, 222, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 125 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>168 (1993); <em>In re Dual-Deck Video Cassette Recorder Antitrust Litig., </em>11 F.3d 1460, 1465-66 (9th Cir.1993). The other harms plaintiffs allege suffering would only constitute an antitrust injury if their willful monopoly maintenance theories were viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
