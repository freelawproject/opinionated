Rosales argues that the district court committed significant procedural error by failing to adequately explain the sentence it chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Rosales did not assert his claim of procedural error in the district court. Accordingly, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing a district court\u2019s sentencing decision, this court must first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-25 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-20\">A sentencing judge is required only to \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rosales has shown no procedural error by the district court because the record reflects that the court considered Rosales\u2019s mitigation arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">Rosales also argues that although his was a within-guidelines sentence, it should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court recognized that certain Guidelines do not take account of empirical data and national experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-26\">Although <em>Kimbrough </em>made clear that a district court may, in certain cases, conclude that the Guidelines fail properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s considerations and may disagree with guidelines policy, it does not follow that a district court abuses its discretion when it concludes, as the district court did here, that the Guidelines are appropriate. This court recently rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Rosales also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Rosales\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Rosales has not demonstrated that his sentence was an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
