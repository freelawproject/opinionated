On appeal, he argued, among other things, that his sentence was unreasonable. We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>507 F.3d 877 (5th Cir. 2007). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Gall v. United </em>States,U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) . <em>See Sanchez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2428, 171 L.Ed.2d 227 (2008) . We need reconsider only the sentencing issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-26\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision, whether \u201cinside or outside the Guidelines range,\u201d under an \u201cabuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Our role is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-27\">first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-28\">Sanchez does not argue that there was any procedural error, nor can we find any. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Instead, he argues that the sentence itself was unreasonable in light of his age, criminal history, and chance of recidivism. The judge sentenced Sanchez to 151 months of imprisonment, at the bottom of the Guidelines range, and expressly noted that he knew the sentence would be difficult for Sanchez because he was fifty years old. The judge found the sentence, however, to be appropriate and reasonable given the amount of drugs involved and the objectives of punishment, general deterrence, and incapacitation. The judge took into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining that a sentence of 151 months was warranted. This ease is very similar to our remand decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rod\u00f1guez, </em>where we found a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was reasonable in light of <em>Gall. </em>530 F.3d 381 (5th Cir.2008). After giving this case the further consideration required in light of <em>Gall, </em>we likewise \u201cremain convinced that affirmance of the sentence is called for and that <em>Gall </em>does not call for any other result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. For the foregoing reasons, as well as for the reasons stated in our earlier opinion, 507 F.3d 877, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
