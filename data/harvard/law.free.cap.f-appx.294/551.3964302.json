Because Perez qualified for relief under the safety-valve provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a), the district court sentenced Perez below the five-year statutory minimum sentence and at the low-end of his applicable guideline range. On appeal, Perez contends that: (1) the district court erred in calculating his applicable guideline range; and (2) his sentence was unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the court applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s guideline calculations. <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201cWe review a properly preserved claim of <em>Booker </em>error de novo....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">First, we find no merit to Perez\u2019s contention that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>calculating his guideline range. A defendant qualifies for relief under the safety-valve provision in \u00a7 5C1.2(a) if he is convicted under, <em>inter alia, </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and satisfies five specified criteria. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (providing the same). Subject to \u00a7 501.2(b), if a defendant meets these requirements, \u201cthe court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a). However, \u00a7 501.2(b) provides in full: \u201cIn the case of a defendant (1) who meets the criteria set forth in subsection (a) ; and (2) for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years, the offense level applicable from Chapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) shall be not less than level 17.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Although the district court sentenced Perez to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 below the 5-year statutory minimum and at the low-end of his applicable guideline range\u2014 Perez nonetheless contends that the district court erred in calculating his applicable guideline range. He argues that his base offense level of 16 should have been lowered by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b) and 2 levels under the safety-valve reduction in \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(ll), giving him a total offense level of 11. Perez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the plain language of \u00a7 501.2(b), providing that \u201cthe offense level applicable from Chapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) shall be not less than level 17.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(b). The \u201coffense level\u201d referred to \u00a7 501.2(b) is based on \u201cChapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments)\u201d and, therefore, includes the safety-valve reduction in \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(11) and the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility in \u00a7 3E1.1(a)-(b) . <em>Id.; see United States v. Nunez, </em>209 Fed.Appx. 896, 898 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished opinion) (\u201cThe text of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(b) unambiguously instructs that in these circumstances an offense level of no lower than 17 must be set after Chapter Three is applied.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ker-esztury, </em>293 F.3d 750, 759 n. 21 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 expressly forbids the application of Chapter Three (which includes \u00a7 3E1.1) to yield a result less than offense level 17.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating Perez\u2019s applicable guideline range in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">We also are unpersuaded that the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error in imposing Perez\u2019s sentence. A district court commits error under <em>Booker </em>if its applies the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d). Nonetheless, the district court is still required after <em>Booker </em>to calculate the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range correctly. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Contrary to Perez\u2019s argument, the district court\u2019s proper calculation of his Guidelines range under \u00a7 501.2(b) does not indicate that it believed the range to be binding. Further, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. Accordingly, Perez has not shown that the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error in imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
