Barela was sentenced to concurrent 150-month terms of imprisonment on Counts One and Two and to another concurrent term of 120 months of imprisonment on Count Three. His imprisonment is to be followed by concurrent eight-year terms of supervised release on Counts One and Two and by another concurrent three-year term of supervised release on Count Three. Barela was also ordered to pay $6,000 in fines and $300 in special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">Barela contends that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the chain of custody with respect to four pieces of evidence: a Glock .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun (exh. 3), a Titan .25 caliber semi-automatic handgun (exh. 4), a glass pipe (exh. 46), and a digital scale (exh. 47). When Barela challenged the admission of this evidence below, the Government made the requisite prima facie showing of authenticity. <em>See United States v. Sparks, </em>2 F.3d 574, 582 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Barela\u2019s objection. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>132 F.3d 192, 197 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">Barela also contends that the district court committed plain error when it sentenced him under the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) rather than the 30-year maximum term in (b)(1)(C) for his conviction on Count Two of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine following a prior conviction for a felony drug offense. The district court did in fact commit clear error in sentencing Barela under the higher statutory maximum in subsection (b)(1)(B) because the indictment did not charge \u2014 and the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 that he possessed 50 grams or more of methamphet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>amine with respect to Count Two as required for subsection (b)(1)(B) to apply. <em>See United States v. Randle, </em>304 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2002). However, Barela\u2019s 150-month prison sentence on Count Two did not exceed the statutory maximum of 30 years of imprisonment in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), and Barela did not show that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160, 165 (5th Cir.2000) (affirming on de novo review). Because Barela has not shown plain error, <em>see United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
