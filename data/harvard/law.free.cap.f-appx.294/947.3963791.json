We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Plaintiff alleges that she was sexually assaulted by her manager twice in the same day, first after being lured into a back alley and a second time as she attempted to flee. Plaintiff, after being threatened by the manager not to tell anyone, went home crying, took a shower, and fell asleep. The next morning, afraid to return to work, she went to a different Denny\u2019s location at which she had previously worked. There she reported the incident to two managers. Denny\u2019s corporate management and the police were contacted immediately. As a result, the police arrested her manager that day and Denny\u2019s fired him the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">This Court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as does a district court, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-movant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">The district court assumed without deciding that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the creation of a hostile work environment. It ruled, instead, that even if a hostile work environment existed, Denny\u2019s established the <em>El-lerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense as a matter of law. The <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense requires the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence \u201c(a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">We agree with the district court that Denny\u2019s met its burdens as to prong one. Denny\u2019s took immediate and permanent corrective action by promptly firing Plaintiffs supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-18\">We disagree, however, that Denny\u2019s has met it burden as to prong two. The district court ruled that Denny\u2019s proved that Plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of corrective or preventive measures by not reporting the incidents on the day they occurred to her immediate supervisor or to corporate offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-19\">To the contrary, we find that Plaintiffs actions were reasonable. She left the restaurant on the day of the incident fearing for her safety and for her job security. Afraid to return to work the next day, she reported the incident to managers at another location and they immediately contacted Denny\u2019s corporate offices and the police. Under the circumstances in this case, it would be absurd to require Plaintiff to have immediately returned to the location of the incident in order to report the sexual assault to the perpetrating manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-20\">Moreover, the purpose of the second prong is to curtail employer liability in situations where the employee failed \u201c \u2018to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages\u2019 that result from violations of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, Plaintiffs response did not hamper Denny\u2019s ability to remedy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>situation. The damage had been done in an isolated, yet severe and egregious, incident. Plaintiff brought the incident to light in a safe and effective way and before any additional incidents occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The district court erred in ruling that Plaintiffs response was unreasonable as a matter of law. The district court\u2019s ruling is REVERSED and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings as required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
