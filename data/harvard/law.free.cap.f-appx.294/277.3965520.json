Al-Mousa asserted past persecution and a fear of future persecution in Saudi Arabia on account of his ethnicity or dark skin color. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings that Al-Mousa\u2019s asylum application was time-barred, and that he failed to establish a credible claim for relief. Al-Mousa appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review whether Al-Mousa is excepted from timely asylum filing requirements on the basis of his status as a minor because he failed to raise this argument in the asylum application itself, before the IJ, or in his pro se BIA appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a petitioner fails to exhaust his claim, the issue is waived. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>see also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 819 (9th Cir. 2003). The BIA has not been afforded the opportunity to address the issue thoroughly \u201cenough to convince us that the relevant policy concerns underlying the exhaustion requirement \u2014 that an administrative agency should have a full opportunity to resolve a controversy or correct. its own errors before judicial intervention \u2014 have been satisfied here.\u201d <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2005)(en banc) (quoting <em>Sagermark v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 645, 648 (9th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">We now consider Al-Mousa\u2019s petitions for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which relies on minor errors or omissions and minor inconsistencies between the asylum application and testimony, is unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Hoque v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1190,1194 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The IJ found that Al-Mousa \u201cadmitted\u201d that a portion of his original declaration was false. However, before his testimony, Al-Mousa <em>corrected </em>his declaration, explaining that the attorney who drafted his original statement probably misunderstood him because that attorney spoke a different dialect of Arabic. <em>See, e.g. He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 598 (9th Cir.2003) (unreliable translation can undermine evidence on which an adverse credibility determination is based). Al-Mousa further explained that he was unable to read, and thus unable to check the declaration for accuracy. While detained, Al-Mousa had the statement, which was written in English, read to him in Arabic by a fellow detainee. Noticing the mistranslation, Al-Mousa corrected the declaration to reflect that he had not spoken out about his father\u2019s death outside of the family. He then testified consistently with the corrected statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Al-Mousa was not confronted with, and thus was denied a reasonable opportunity to explain, any perceived inconsistency between his original declaration and his testimony concerning how he identified an officer he was alleged to have assaulted. <em>See, e.g., Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 618 (9th Cir.2004). The record reveals that Al-Mousa had communication difficulty with the attorney who drafted his original declaration and that Al-Mousa consistently testified that he learned the officer\u2019s identity from reading his badge, not from previous encounters.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Al-Mousa also plausibly explained an immaterial inconsistency concerning whether the sum paid to the allegedly assaulted officer in order to be released was a bond payment or a damages payment: Al-Mousa\u2019s father\u2019s friend paid the sum and then-18-year-old Al-Mousa was not privy to the details of the arrangement. Similarly, Al-Mousa also explained an inconsistency concerning whether he was ai\u2019rested at his home or his grandmother\u2019s home: Al-Mousa\u2019s father had two houses, and while his grandmother lived in one, he referred to them both as his home. <em>See Garrovillas v. I.N.S., </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1014 (9th Cir.1998). Finally, the fact that Al-Mousa did not mention his broken nose in his original declaration is an omitted detail \u201cinsufficient to uphold an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Bandari v. I.N.S., </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The IJ credited Al-Mousa\u2019s testimony that he will face 400 lashes if returned to Saudi Arabia, but concluded that such a punishment does not constitute torture. We disagree. We conclude, in light of Al-Mousa\u2019s credible testimony and the documentary evidence in the record establishing the clear probability that Al-Mousa will be persecuted and tortured if returned to Saudi Arabia, that he is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)(1); <em>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). We further necessarily conclude that Al-Mousa is entitled to withholding of removal under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, we grant Al-Mousa\u2019s petition for review and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Our disposition of the withholding issues makes it unnecessary to address Al-Mou-sa\u2019s alternative request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-13\">. The record indicates that Al-Mousa was over the age of twenty-one at the time of his merits hearing before the IJ and his appeal to the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. Contrary to the assertion of the dissent, the IJ's \"factfinding function\u201d does not \"quintessential[ly]\u201d include the ability to make an adverse credibility finding on the basis of a seeming inconsistency readily explained by difficulty in interpretation in a case, as here, where there is a language barrier. <em>See Singh </em>v. <em>INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1021-23 (9th Cir.2002)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b305-15\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"alv-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">I respectfully dissent from the conclusion by the majority that the adverse credibility determination made by the Immigration Judge (IJ) was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">Our parameter in this situation is clear: we must uphold an adverse credibility determination unless the record evidence <em>compels </em>a contrary conclusion. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir. 2006). \u201cA single supported ground for an adverse credibility finding is sufficient if it relates to the basis for petitioner\u2019s alleged fear of persecution and goes to the heart of the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108 (citation, internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). With this standard in mind and even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>assuming that no other basis to support the adverse credibility determination exists, the IJ\u2019s reliance on the dramatic change in Al-Mousa\u2019s declaration adequately supports the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Khalid Al-Mousa\u2019s original declaration, signed February 18, 2004, related that after Saudi Arabian officials caused his father\u2019s death and were not punished severely, he \u201cbegan to speak out about [his] father\u2019s death and how his race led to his killing.\u201d As a result of his speaking out, Al-Mousa declared that \u201c[t]he Saudi Police targeted [him] with beatings, whippings, and false imprisonment to scare [him] into stopping. During these events, the police would scream \u201cnigger,\u201d \u201cslave\u201d or \u201cbastard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In his amended declaration signed September 26, 2005, the day of his hearing, Al-Mousa disavowed the specific and detailed assertions of persecution made in his earlier declaration. Rather than a mere correction to the declaration, Al-Mousa admitted that he \u201cwas only 10 when [his] father died and did not know any details about his death until [he] was 17. [He] did not speak out about [his] father\u2019s death to people outside my father [sic] except for one time. The Saudi police did not target [him] for any beatings because of his father\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Al-Mousa explained his recantation by blaming his attorney for \u201cprobably\u201d misunderstanding him. However, the IJ was not compelled to accept Al-Mousa\u2019s explanation. This is a quintessential factfinding function that should not be hijacked on appellate review. <em>See e.g., Rivera v. Mu-kasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007) (acknowledging that the IJ found the petitioner\u2019s explanations insufficient). The majority seeks to minimize its disregard of the IJ\u2019s finding by concluding that the inconsistency is \u201creadily explained by difficulty in interpretation in a case, as here, where there is a language barrier.\u201d Majority Disposition, page 279 n. 2. However, that is precisely my point. The IJ was not compelled to accept that explanation and the majority cannot substitute its acceptance of that explanation as a basis for granting the petition. <em>See Singh, </em>439 F.3d at 1105 (reflecting our obligation to uphold an adverse credibility determination unless compelled to do otherwise by the record evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">As the IJ noted, Al-Mousa produced absolutely no evidence that the attorney misunderstood him to the extent of the detailed statements included in the declaration, that Al-Mousa complained to the bar association or that Al-Mousa made any effort to obtain a statement from the attorney confirming the misunderstanding. In view of these sound reasons for rejecting Al-Mousa\u2019s weak explanation, I cannot see how a contrary conclusion is compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The majority\u2019s citation to <em>He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593 (9th Cir.2003) is easily discounted. In <em>He, </em>there were contemporaneously documented translation difficulties verified in the record. <em>See id. </em>at 596-97. In this case, we only have the Petitioner\u2019s after-the-fact assertion that his attorney \u201cprobably\u201d misunderstood him. The circumstances are patently different.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Finally, I dissent from the majority\u2019s unsupported conclusion that Al-Mousa is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Without citation to any supporting authority, the majority holds that the criminal punishment that accompanied Al-Mousa\u2019s conviction for assault and battery constitutes torture. Indeed, the regulation defining torture is to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(3) (\u201cTorture does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. Lawful sane-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tions include judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by law, including the death penalty ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Because I conclude that the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, and because punishment imposed as a result of a criminal violation does not constitute torture under the CAT in this case, I would deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
