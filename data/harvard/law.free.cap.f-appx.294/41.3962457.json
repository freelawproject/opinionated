We find that this claim is squarely foreclosed by our decision in <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 512 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Bjecause \u2018persecution\u2019 cannot be based on a fear of psychological harm alone, Niang\u2019s withholding claim fails as a matter of law because it focuses solely on the psychological harm she claims she will suffer if her daughter accompanies her to Senegal and is there subjected to FGM.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-15\"> In her opening brief before this court, Yusuff has failed to raise any challenges to the denial of her requests for asylum, humanitarian asylum, protection under the Convention Against Torture, or voluntary departure. She has therefore waived appellate review of these claims. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004) (finding that failure to raise a challenge in an opening brief results in abandonment of that challenge); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
