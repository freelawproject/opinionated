PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Defendants-appellees in this case were part of a group of law enforcement officers that arrested plaintiff-appellant Jerald Shouse in 2003 at his common-law wife\u2019s house. Mr. Shouse was convicted for trafficking methamphetamine and eventually filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint asserting that the defendants violated his constitutional rights during his arrest. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants-appellees and also denied a motion filed by Mr. Shouse seeking sanctions against Mr. Price\u2019s attorney. Mr. Shouse now appeals those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Mr. Shouse first claimed the defendants\u2019 entry into his wife\u2019s house and his subsequent arrest constituted an unlawful search and seizure. The magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted, determining that the issue had been addressed in state court and Mr. Shouse was therefore barred from re-litigating it in federal court by the fair faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Mr. Shouse next claimed the defendants used excessive force in arresting him. The magistrate judge recommended summary judgment because Mr. Shouse had not presented evidence showing that the defendants were the officers who had committed the complained-of actions, noting that Mr. Shouse\u2019s own filings seemed to show the defendants had not committed those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Finally, Mr. Shouse claimed that his arrest and the removal of his four-year-old son from the home constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress in violation of state law and the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The magistrate judge determined (1) the Eighth Amendment was inapplicable because he had not yet been convicted or incarcerated at the time of the complained-of actions, (2) the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s right to familial association was not violated because \u2014 even if Mr. Shouse could show that one of the defendants was responsible for removing his son from the home \u2014 there was no question removal was in the child\u2019s best-interests, and (3) the Fourth Amendment was not violated in regard to the entry and force used to effectuate his arrest for the reasons set forth in response to the first two claims. The magistrate judge also recommended the district court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. Shouse\u2019s state law claim and deny as deficient his sanction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, entered judgment for defendants on Mr. Shouse\u2019s federal claims, dismissed his state claim without prejudice, and denied his sanction motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">We have jurisdiction over Mr. Shouse\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Butler v. Compton, </em>482 F.3d 1277, 1278 (10th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">When applying this standard, we examine the factual record and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. If there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute, then we must determine if the substantive law was correctly applied by the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Sigmon v. CommunityCare HMO, Inc., </em>284 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (10th Cir.2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). As to the denial of a motion for sanctions, we review the district court\u2019s decision for abuse of its discretion. <em>Gust v. Jones, </em>162 F.3d 587, 598 (10th Cir.1998). \u201cA court abuses its discretion only when it makes a clear error of judgment, exceeds the bounds of permissible choice, or when its decision is arbitrary, capricious or whimsical, or results in a manifestly unreasonable judgment.\u201d <em>Bradford v. Wiggins, </em>516 F.3d 1189, 1194 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Having carefully reviewed the briefs and the record on appeal with these standards in mind, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and denial of Mr. Shouse\u2019s sanction motion for the reasons offered by the magistrate judge in his report and recommendation, as adopted by the district court in its February 8, 2008, order, 2008 WL 360854. Further, because we agree with the district court that this appeal lacks a good faith basis, we DENY Mr. Shouse\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Mr. Shouse is responsible for the immediate payment of the balance of the appellate filing fee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. RApp. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
