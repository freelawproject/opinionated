R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">Anthony Ray Martinez appears <em>pro se </em>and seeks review of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights claims for failure to prosecute. This court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">Mr. Martinez initially set forth three claims against three members of the Denver Sheriffs office \u2014 David Martinez, the Denver Deputy Sheriff, and Sergeants Sullivan and Romero (\u201cthe defendants\u201d). The first two claims concern allegations that David Martinez assaulted Anthony Ray Martinez and that Sergeant Sullivan was deliberately indifferent regarding this assault. The third claim alleged that Sergeant Romero forced Mr. Martinez to occupy a dirty cell. Citing to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the district court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>missed the first two claims. We reversed the dismissal of those claims. <em>Martinez v. Martinez, </em>189 Fed.Appx. 815, 817 (10th Cir.2006). The district court dismissed Mr. Martinez\u2019s third claim for failure to plead exhaustion of administrative remedies. We affirmed that dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On November 26, 2007, plaintiff was ordered to show cause by December 10, 2007, for lack of prosecution and failure to comply with court orders. This show cause order stemmed from Mr. Martinez\u2019s failure to appear at a preliminary pretrial conference and failure to notify the court. Mr. Martinez did not contact the court by the stated deadline. On December 11, 2007, 2007 WL 5704048, the magistrate judge assigned recommended that this case be dismissed without prejudice for lack of prosecution and failure to follow court orders. The recommendation advised the parties that they had \u201c10 days after service of this recommendation to serve and file specific, written objections.\u201d R. at 90, 2-3. Additionally, the recommendation warned that \u201c[a] party\u2019s failure to serve and file specific, written objections waives <em>de novo </em>review of the recommendation by the district judge ... and also waives appellate review of both factual and legal objections.\u201d R. at 90, 2 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On January 3, 2008, Mr. Martinez filed a \u201cNotice to Show Cause for Non-Communication with the Honorable Court.\u201d In this filing, Mr. Martinez explained that he was unable to contact the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">I was ... arrested and taken to the Denver County Jail, and was unable to get to the Q]aw library to prepare the needed documents for the court. I was [ ] taken to the Chyanne [sic] Mountain Re-entry Center where I was put in to Segregation, and once again unable to get to the [l]aw library. I was [ ] transported back to the Denver County Jail where I\u2019ve been in Building 22-C. And now after over 30 days I can complete the motion and send it to the court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">R. at 91,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">On January 8, 2008, 2008 WL 109652, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The order accepting the recommendation stated that \u201cno party has objected to the recommendation\u201d and that the district court \u201cconducted the requisite <em>de novo </em>review of the issues, the record, and the recommendation.\u201d R. at 93, 1. \u201cBased on this review, [the district court] ... concluded that the recommendation is a correct application of the facts and the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court dismissed Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims without prejudice. This order does not mention Mr. Martinez\u2019s filing on January 3, 2008. Mr. Martinez then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">After Mr. Martinez appealed, the magistrate judge denied Mr. Martinez\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which is how he interpreted Mr. Martinez\u2019s January 3, 2008 notice filing. Distinguishing the filing from a substantive response to the show cause order, the judge emphasized that the notice filing only explained that Mr. Martinez did not have access to a law library to prepare court materials, but did not explain that Mr. Martinez did not know of his obligations to the court and the corresponding dates for those obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Although not addressed by either party, we conclude that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to review the dismissal of Mr. Martinez\u2019s action. Section 1291 gives this court \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from the district courts of the United States....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291. The requirement of finality \u201cis to be given a \u2018practical rather than a technical construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moya v. Sehollenbarger, </em>465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>F.3d 444, 449 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sherman v. Am. Fed\u2019n of Musicians, </em>588 F.2d 1313, 1315 (10th Cir.1978)). Thus, a district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice may be final under section 1291. <em>Id. </em>at 448. (\u201c[Tjhat a dismissal was without prejudice does not necessarily make it non final under section 1291.\u201d). As discussed later, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action and plaintiffs complaint were sufficiently final for this court to now exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Petty v. Manpower, Inc., </em>591 F.2d 615, 617 (10th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">There is another potential bar to this court\u2019s substantive review of Mr. Martinez\u2019s appeal. Mr. Martinez failed to file timely, written objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. This court applies a firm waiver rule when a party fails to make timely objections to a magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendation. <em>Morales-Fernandez v. I.N.S., </em>418 F.3d 1116, 1119 (10th Cir.2005). Under this rule, the party waives appellate review of factual and legal questions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">We have recognized three exceptions to the firm waiver rule. First, the rule does not apply if \u201ca <em>pro se </em>litigant has not been informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences of failing to object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Moore v. United States, </em>950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir.1991)). This exception does not require actual knowledge on behalf of the <em>pro se </em>litigant. Instead, this court analyzes whether the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling clearly \u201cattempted to apprise [the litigant] of the consequences of a failure to object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the rule does not apply when the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d require review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Here, the first exception is inapplicable. As stated, the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation clearly stated that Mr. Martinez had 10 days to file written objections and that failure to do so would waive appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Regarding the second exception, this court has compared \u201cinterests of justice\u201d analysis to review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 1120-22. This court has also identified plain error as a third exception to the firm waiver rule, independent from the \u201cinterests of justice exception.\u201d <em>Wardell v. Duncan, </em>470 F.3d 954, 958 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe waiver rule may be suspended when the \u2018interests of justice\u2019 warrant, ... or when the aggrieved party makes the onerous showing required to demonstrate plain error.\u201d) (citations omitted). Regarding the independent \u201cinterests of justice\u201d exception, the court in <em>Wardell </em>cited <em>Wirsching v. Colorado, </em>360 F.3d 1191, 1197-98 (10th Cir.2004). The court in <em>Wirsching </em>applied several \u201cinterests of justice\u201d factors. These included: (1) the reason for the party\u2019s delay in responding to or receiving the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation; (2) whether this explanation was facially plausible; and (3) the <em>pro se </em>litigants prior tenacity in pursuing the claims. <em>Wirsching, </em>360 F.3d at 1198; <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1120 (identifying the <em>Wirsching </em>\u201cinterests of justice\u201d factors as \u201ca <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s effort to comply, the force and plausibility of the explanation for his failure to comply, and the importance of the issues raised\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Here, Mr. Martinez explains his failure to receive and object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation was due to his arrest, incarceration, and change of address. First, it is clear that Mr. Martinez was aware of his obligation to notify the court of his change of address and failed to do so. As the defendants point out, Mr. Martinez previously filed several notices for change of address. While this discredits Mr. Martinez\u2019s contention that he did not receive the recommendation, it bolsters his argument that he was unable to contact the court to object to the recommendation. Mr. Martinez claims he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>arrested on November 23, 2007, three days before the magistrate judge issued the order to show cause and fifteen days before the magistrate judge filed the recommendation. Mr. Martinez claims he was placed in segregation and was unable to work on this case for 30 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This explanation is facially plausible. Similar to the <em>pro se </em>litigant in <em>Wirsching, </em>Mr. Martinez has been an active participant in this case for years. The record indicates that he filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint, responded to several prior orders to show cause, timely appealed a prior order of dismissal, requested extensions of time, and submitted a proposed pretrial order. Failing to object to a recommendation for failure to prosecute is inconsistent with his prior conduct. We also note that Mr. Martinez\u2019s allegations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are \u201cissues of considerable import.\u201d <em>Wirsch-ing, </em>360 F.3d at 1198. Thus, under this standard, the interests of justice support applying an exception to the firm waiver rule and allowing this court to proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">This result would also hold true if we were to apply plain error analysis. Plain error exists \u201cwhen there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1122-23. Thus, this court must determine whether the district court erred by not considering the January 3, 2008 notice when it dismissed Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims for lack of prosecution and failure to follow court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In his appellate filings, Mr. Martinez explains that he did not receive the relevant court orders. The court mailed those orders to an address on Delaware Court. Mr. Martinez argues that his parole officer, Max Winkler, directed him to not go to that address and to avoid contact with a person at that address. Moreover, Mr. Martinez alleges that he was arrested on November 23, 2007 and placed in a segregation unit, where he did not have the ability to contact the court. Mr. Martinez contends that he contacted the court as soon as he was able to do so, noting that he \u201cwould never neglect this case[; he has] worked on it for ... years.\u201d Mr. Martinez contends the district court failed to address the fact that he was arrested, and consequently ignored his inability to contact the court. Mr. Martinez also notes that the district court failed to consider his motion that explained the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The defendants respond that Mr. Martinez did not attempt to timely object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and that Mr. Martinez did not notify the court of his change of address. In support of this argument, the defendants note that \u201cMr. Martinez knew about his obligation ... to notify the Court within ten days after any change of address or telephone number because he had done so on five previous occasions.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 6. Additionally, the defendants point out that Mr. Martinez has not offered any evidence to support his explanation. They characterize his reference to his parole officer\u2019s instructions and lack of ability to contact the court as \u201cimplausible,\u201d noting \u201cMr. Martinez does not claim that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>have access to an envelope and stamp, so all he needed was a pen and piece of paper to send his new address to the court and bring his plight to the Court\u2019s attention but, again, he decided to do nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">This court agrees with Mr. Martinez\u2019s contention that the district court erred when it failed to consider his submitted notice. On January 3, 2008, Mr. Martinez notified the court that he had been arrested and placed in segregation between October 9, 2007 and early December 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After reviewing the issues and the record, however, the district court made no mention of this information. Because the arrest and segregation took place before the magistrate judge issued his recommendation on December 11, 2007 and spanned the time period for Mr. Martinez to object, this information merited at least some discussion. By not addressing Mr. Martinez\u2019s arrest and segregation, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">An error is plain \u201cif it is clear or obvious at the time of the appeal.\u201d <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1124 (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). This court has repeatedly stated that a court should read pro <em>se </em>filings liberally. <em>Wheeler v. C.I.R., </em>528 F.3d 773, 781 (10th Cir. 2008); <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991) (\u201cA pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">At the least, the district court should have acknowledged Mr. Martinez\u2019s January 3, 2008 filing and considered it as a motion for leave to respond out of time. Mr. Martinez indicated that he was unavailable, but was then ready to proceed, stating \u201cafter over 30 days I can complete the motion and send it to the court.\u201d R. at 91, 1. For the district court to ignore this filing and state that \u201c[n]o party has objected to the recommendation\u201d and that the district court \u201cconducted the requisite <em>de novo </em>review of the issues, the record, and the recommendation[ ]\u201d is plain error. R. at 93,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">We must next determine whether the plain error identified affected Mr. Martinez\u2019s substantial rights. On this issue, Mr. Martinez bears the burden of showing \u201c \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u201d Mora<em>les-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1124 (quoting <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 82, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Mr. Martinez is in the awkward position of showing that had the district court considered his January 3, 2008 notice as a motion for leave to file out of time, it would have granted the motion and treated it also as an objection to the recommendation. The district court\u2019s omission of any reference to the January 3, 2008 notice places this court in an equally awkward position of reviewing that omission. The record, however, reveals two prior actions by the district court that allow this court to determine with reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the January 3, 2008 notice, the result would have been different. First, on March 21, 2007, Mr. Martinez filed a \u201cMotion to Show Cause,\u201d stating that he \u201cha[d] been placed into administrative segregation with no means to gain access to the law library, paper or pen.\u201d R. at 47, 1. The district court docketed this as a motion for extension of time. Second, on October 23, 2007, the magistrate judge discharged an order to show cause. The explanation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>magistrate judge considered to \u201cestablish[ ] good cause for [Mr. Martinez\u2019s] failure to appear at the preliminary pretrial conference\u201d was that Mr. Martinez was recently released from incarceration and unable to contact the court due to a holiday. R. at 79, 1. Considering these prior actions by the district court, we conclude there is a reasonable probability that if the district court had properly addressed the January 3, 2008 notice, Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims would not have been dismissed for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Lastly, to show that the district court\u2019s error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, Mr. Martinez must demonstrate \u201cthat allowing his non-constitutional error to stand would be \u2018particularly egregious\u2019 and would constitute a \u2018miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1124 (quoting <em>United States v. Gilkey, </em>118 F.3d 702, 704 (10th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Here, the district court dismissed Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims without prejudice. Generally, \u201ca district court may, without abusing its discretion, [dismiss without prejudice] without attention to any particular procedures.\u201d <em>Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents at Arapahoe County Justice Ctr., </em>492 F.3d 1158, 1162 (10th Cir. 2007). On the other hand, a dismissal without prejudice is effectively a dismissal with prejudice if the statute of limitations has expired on the dismissed claims. <em>Go-colay v. N.M. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>968 F.2d 1017, 1021 (10th Cir.1992). Accordingly, it is necessary to determine if the statute of limitations has expired on Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Mr. Martinez filed his claims on January 31, 2005, identifying incidents that occurred in 2004. These claims allege assault and indifference under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Martinez v. Martinez, </em>189 Fed. Appx. 815, 816 (10th Cir.2006). The statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 claims brought in Colorado \u201cis two years from the time the cause of action accrued.\u201d <em>Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006). The district court dismissed Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims on January 8, 2008. It appears that any attempt by Mr. Martinez to now refile these claims would be barred by the statute of limitations. Consequently, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was effectively a dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Because of the strong preference for resolution of claims on their merits, this court considers a dismissal that effectively defeats a \u201clitigant\u2019s right to redress grievances in the courts\u201d to be \u201ca severe sanction, applicable only in the extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Gocolay, </em>968 F.2d at 1021 (quotations omitted). Such a severe sanction should be applied only in extreme circumstances and \u201cused as a weapon of last, rather than first, resort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). For a court to impose this sanction, it must consider identified factors. These include: \u201c(1) the degree of actual prejudice to the defendant; (2) the amount of interference with the judicial process; (3) the culpability of the litigant; (4) whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal of the action would be a likely sanction for noncompliance; and (5) the efficacy of lesser sanctions.\u201d <em>Nasious, </em>492 F.3d at 1162 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Here, there is no indication that the district court or the magistrate judge considered or applied these factors. Most notably, the district court did not make any finding regarding the culpability of Mr. Martinez. <em>See Gocolay, </em>968 F.2d at 1021 (\u201cForemost, the district court failed to make a finding that [the litigant] willfully or in bad faith violated the court-ordered deposition deadline. Absent a finding of willful disregard or other bad faith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>reversal is required.\u201d). Given that Mr. Martinez notified the court of his situation five days before the court dismissed the case \u2014 reversing its prior efforts to consider such notification to be sufficient to show good cause and warrant an extension of time \u2014 and effectively eliminated his ability to pursue these claims, the dismissal is particularly egregious in that it seriously affects the perceived fairness of the involved judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Thus, Mr. Martinez satisfies the requirements for the application of an exception to the firm waiver rule. The court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Martinez\u2019s action without appreciating the import of his January 3, 2008 notice is likewise an abuse of discretion. <em>See B &amp; B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., </em>252 F.3d 1010, 1012 (8th Cir.2001)(describing analysis for abuse of discretion as \u201cless [ jrigorous\u201d than analysis for plain error); <em>Stuart v. Jackson, </em>24 Fed.Appx. 943, 951 (10th Cir.2001) (describing the plain error standard as \u201cmore rigorous\u201d than the abuse of discretion standard); <em>Rogers v. Andrus Transp. Servs., </em>502 F.3d 1147, 1152 (10th Cir.2007)(citing <em>Nasious, </em>492 F.3d at 1160 for the statement \u201cWe review dismissals under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Martinez\u2019s two claims is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings. Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees is granted. He is reminded, however, that he must continue making partial payments until the filing fee is paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
