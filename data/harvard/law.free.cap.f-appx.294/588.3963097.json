(\u201cCoral\u201d) and Coral\u2019s president, James J. Irby (\u201cIrby\u201d). Appellee Pozzi Window Company (\u201cPozzi\u201d) manufactured the windows in a home that Coral, as a general contractor, constructed. After the homeowner sued Pozzi for water damage due to leakage around the windows, Pozzi cross-claimed against Coral and Irby, asserting that their subcontractor had defectively installed the windows. Coral and Irby settled Pozzi\u2019s claims against them, and as part of the settlement, they assigned their rights under the Policies to Pozzi. Auto-Owners and Pozzi dispute whether the Policies cover Coral\u2019s and Irby\u2019s liability for the repair or replacement of the defectively installed windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The district court concluded that the Policies provided coverage and granted partial summary judgment to Pozzi. The case then proceeded to a jury trial before a magistrate judge on Pozzi\u2019s claims of bad faith and breach of contract \u2014 i.e., breach of the Policies \u2014 and the jury found in Poz-zi\u2019s favor. Auto-Owners appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">After review and oral argument, this Court certified the coverage issue to the Florida Supreme Court. <em>See Pozzi Window Co. v. Auto-Owners Ins., </em>446 F.3d 1178, 1188 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cPozzi </em>J\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The specific question certified to the Florida Supreme Court was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">DOES A STANDARD FORM COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY POLICY WITH PRODUCT COMPLETED OPERATIONS HAZARD COVERAGE, SUCH AS THE POLICIES DESCRIBED HERE, ISSUED TO A GENERAL CONTRACTOR, COVER THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR\u2019S LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY FOR THE COSTS OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE WORK BY ITS SUBCONTRACTOR?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">In answering this certified question, the Florida Supreme Court opined that there \u201cappealed] to be a factual issue as to whether the windows themselves were defective or whether the faulty installation by the Subcontractor caused damage to both the windows and other portions of the completed project.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Pozzi Window Co., </em>984 So.2d 1241, 1247 (Fla.2008). The Florida Supreme Court dubbed this purported factual issue \u201ccritical,\u201d and thus answered the certified question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">If the windows were purchased by the Homeowner and were <em>not </em>defective before being installed, coverage would exist for the cost of repair or replacement of the windows.... However, a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>result would follow if the windows <em>were </em>defective prior to being installed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1243,1248 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The parties have litigated this case as though the only matter at issue was whether coverage would exist under the Policies if the windows were defectively installed \u2014 and <em>not </em>whether coverage would exist if the windows were defective pi\u2019ior to installation. As detailed in <em>Pozzi I, </em>this litigation commenced when Jorge Perez hired Coral and Irby to construct his house. <em>Pozzi I, </em>446 F.3d at 1180. The house included windows manufactured by Pozzi and installed by Coral\u2019s and Irby\u2019s subcontractor, Brian Scott Builders, Inc. (\u201cScott\u201d). <em>Id. </em>After Perez moved into the house, he complained of water damage due to leakage around the windows and filed suit against Pozzi, Coral, and Scott. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In Perez\u2019s lawsuit, Pozzi cross-claimed against Coral and Irby for negligent supervision of Scott during the window installation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Coral and Irby filed claims with Auto-Owners for coverage under the Policies for their liability arising from Pozzi\u2019s claim that the windows were defectively installed, but Auto-Owners responded that the damages sought by Pozzi were not covered. <em>Id. </em>Pozzi ultimately settled its cross-claims against Coral and Irby, and as part of that settlement, Coral and Irby assigned to Pozzi them rights under the Policies, including their claims against Auto-Owners for denying coverage for Pozzi\u2019s original cross-claims that alleged defective installation of the windows. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Pozzi\u2019s cross-claims unambiguously asserted that the damages caused to Perez\u2019s home were the result of Scott\u2019s improper or defective <em>installation </em>of the windows. Amended Cross-Claim \u00b6 14. More importantly, in Auto-Owners\u2019 December 2000 letter denying coverage to Coral and Irby for Pozzi\u2019s cross-claims, Auto-Owners advised as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">In accordance with Florida Law, our policy will not extend coverage for the damages consisting of the defective construction performed by you or by your subcontractors. The costs incurred to remedy the <em>defective installation of windows </em>are not damages covered under your policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">Letter from Auto-Owners to Coral (Dec. 27, 2000) (emphasis added). In other words, from the very beginning of this case, Auto-Owners denied coverage for Pozzi\u2019s cross-claims based solely on the argument that defective work performed by the subcontractor Scott was not covered under the Policies. Auto-Owners never asserted that Pozzi\u2019s claims were not covered due to defects in the windows that existed prior to installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Indeed, even on appeal before this Court, the statement of issues in Auto-Owners\u2019 brief identified one issue and framed the only issue as whether the Policies covered \u201cdamages for repair and replacement <em>due to defective workmanship </em>of the general contractor or its subcontract.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 1 (emphasis added). It is well-settled that an argument not raised or developed on appeal is waived. <em>See McFarlin v. Conseco Servs., LLC, </em>381 F.3d 1251, 1263 (11th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Even assuming <em>arguen-do </em>that Auto-Owners at one time might have raised the argument that the only liability and loss in this case arose from defective manufacture of the windows and that coverage was unavailable under the Policies due to defects in the windows themselves, Auto-Owners did not raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>that issue and thus waived it. The sole issue in this particular case has always been whether, under Florida law, the Policies covered Coral\u2019s and Irby\u2019s liability for repairing and replacing Scott\u2019s defective installation of the windows. <em>See Pozzi I, </em>446 F.3d at 1188. Because the Florida Supreme Court has now answered <em>that </em>question in the affirmative, we affirm the breach-of-contract judgment in Pozzi\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We remand for consideration of whether Pozzi is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, but express no opinion about that issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-12\">. In <em>Pozzi I, </em>this Court also affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s (1) grant of judgment as a matter of law to Auto-Owners on Pozzi's claim of bad faith, and (2) decision to set aside the jury's grant of punitive damages to Pozzi. <em>See Pozzi I, </em>446 F.3d at 1179. Further background can be found in the prior opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 1179-1182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">. Pozzi settled Perez's claims and agreed to remedy the problems with the windows. <em>Poz-zi I, </em>446 F.3d at 1180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-29\">. We note that in 2005, after a joint motion to stay by the parties, the magistrate judge entered an order staying determination of attorney\u2019s fees and costs until this appeal was resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-15\">. The Florida Supreme Court's conclusion that there \u201cappear[ed] to be a factual issue as to whether the windows themselves were defective or whether the faulty installation by the Subcontractor caused damage to both the windows and other portions of the completed project\u201d seems to be based primarily on language in our original <em>Pozzi I </em>opinion. <em>See Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>984 So.2d at 1247 (\u201cThe Eleventh Circuit characterizes the \u2018defective work' in this case in two distinct manners.\u201d). Our opinion in <em>Pozzi I </em>contained at least fourteen references to \"defective work,\u201d but there are two stray references to \"defective windows.\u201d After reviewing the record again and for the reasons already outlined above, we conclude there is no factual dispute in this coverage lawsuit, and the only issue on appeal is whether the Policies covered \"damages for repair and replacement due to defective workmanship of the general contractor or its subcontractor.\" Appellant's Br. at 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
