R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b388-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-20\">Albino Rosas Felipe, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for cancellation of removal. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and constitutional claims. <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s contention regarding continuous presence because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>court generally lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Petitioner contends the IJ violated due process by not allowing him to elaborate on what would happen to his daughter after his removal from the United States. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting [his] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, petitioner failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We are not persuaded that petitioner\u2019s removal would result in the deprivation of his child\u2019s rights. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b388-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
