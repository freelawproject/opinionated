Pursuant to a search warrant, authorities first searched the Hemingway Circle apartment and seized: cocaine, crack cocaine, plastic bags used to package narcotics, measuring utensils commonly used to prepare crack cocaine, a safe containing Louisuis\u2019s driver\u2019s license and Social Security card, a handgun holster, a bulletproof vest bearing Pierre\u2019s fingerprints, a loaded pistol inside a jacket on the floor, an envelope bearing Louisuis\u2019s fingerprints on it, a receipt bearing Louis\u2019s signature, a county jail property release form showing Pierre\u2019s payment of Johnson\u2019s bond, marijuana packaged in plastic bags, a digital scale, two assault rifles, three handguns, ammunition, magazines for a rifle and handgun, and approximately $6,000. Pierre\u2019s fingerprints were on a plastic bag and envelope. Pierre\u2019s and Louisuis\u2019s fingerprints also were on another envelope. Authorities also seized numerous cellular telephones from the apartment. Johnson and Louis were arrested during the search. Authorities then obtained two warrants for Pierre\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Approximately one month later, with an arrest warrant for Pierre, the police entered the apartment on Andrew Drive to serve the arrest warrant on Pierre and also arrested Louisuis who was in the apartment. While there, they observed drugs on the floor of the bedroom in which they found Pierre and Louisuis. This formed the basis for the subsequent search warrant obtained and served on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Appellants raise several arguments on appeal, and we consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">\n<em>JIMMY LOUISUIS,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Louisuis first argues that his conviction for knowingly and intentionally using and maintaining a place at 2615 Andrew Drive, Naples, Florida 34116, for the purpose of distributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 9), must be reversed because the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from that address. He argues that law enforcement officials did not have a search warrant when they entered the Andrew Drive residence at the time of his arrest, and therefore all of the evidence obtained from the residence should have been suppressed. The district court denied the motion, finding that the entry was permitted by exigent circumstances. We need not address whether exigent circumstances existed here because the record reflects that the officers had a warrant to arrest Pierre whom they reasonably believed to be living in the residence and present at the residence at the time. <em>See United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1263 (11th Cir. 2000) (\u201c \u2018[F]or law enforcement officials to enter a residence to execute an arrest warrant for a resident of the premises, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the law enforcement agents, when viewed in the totality, must warrant a reasonable belief that the location to be searched is the suspect\u2019s dwelling, and that the suspect is within the residence at the time of entry.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>44 F.3d 1530, 1535 (11th Cir. 1995))). Moreover, the law enforcement officials did not search the residence at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>time of the entry. They observed drugs in plain view during the arrest and returned thereafter with the requisite warrant to search the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Louisuis next argues that the evidence produced by the government was insufficient to support his convictions because the government did not prove that he knowingly entered into the drug conspiracy alleged in Count One of the indictment but only showed that, at most, he associated with criminals. Additionally, Louisuis argues that there was no proof of a nexus between his constructive possession of the firearms and any drug trafficking offense. The record supports the convictions because the on-going criminal activities \u2014 including Louisuis\u2019s sale of drugs \u2014 and Louisuis\u2019s constructive control over the illicit materials permit the inference that Louisuis was more than just an innocent bystander. As to the firearm count, the recovery of the firearms in close proximity to drugs show a nexus between the possession and the drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Next, Louisuis argues that the district court erroneously failed to dismiss a juror for his inability to focus on the trial. The record indicates that the district court dismissed the juror at Louisuis\u2019s request and, therefore, there is no adverse ruling for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Louisuis also asserts that the cumulative effect of all of the errors alleged in his brief warrants reversal. Because the district did not err as to the issues raised by Louisuis, he was not deprived of a fundamentally fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Finally, Louisuis adopts his codefen-dants\u2019 arguments, which challenge the district court\u2019s determination that it could not consider the crack-cocaine disparity. This conflicts with the intervening Supreme Court decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Thus, we reverse Louisuis\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">\n<em>EXUIS LOUIS,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Louis first argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendants. We find nothing in the record that demonstrates that trying him jointly with his codefendants would result in any specific prejudice to him. Second, Louis argues that government witness Ivane Camille\u2019s testimony was incredible as a matter of law. Camille asserted that her testimony against Louis was not coerced, and she offered plausible explanations for minor inconsistencies between her trial testimony and past statements. Her testimony cannot be deemed incredible as a matter of law, and the district court did not err by allowing the jury to consider her testimony. Third, because Louis has not demonstrated that the evidentiary rulings which he claims were erroneous prejudiced him in any way, those rulings did not deprive him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">As to his sentence. Louis argues that the district court\u2019s determination that it could not consider the crack-cocaine disparity violates <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. We agree. As the government now acknowledges, the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Kimbrough </em>that a district comb could consider the crack-cocaine disparity in fashioning a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we reverse Louis\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">\n<em>JOSEPH JOHNSON,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">Johnson argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions because they did not demonstrate that the firearms were connected with interstate commerce or the drug trafficking offense. Johnson also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the drug and conspiracy convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tions because it did not show that he was part of the trafficking. Testimony from a law enforcement official established the nexus between the firearms and interstate commerce. The discovery of the firearms in close proximity to drugs and Johnson\u2019s movement towards one of them during the arrest link the firearms to the drug trafficking offenses. As to the drug and conspiracy convictions, testimony established that Johnson lived in a residence from which he and his codefendants manufactured and sold crack cocaine. In addition to testimony pertaining to specific sales, evidence found in the residence included drugs and paraphernalia associated with drug distribution. The evidence is sufficient to support Johnson\u2019s convictions on the drug and conspiracy charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">As to his sentence, Johnson argues that the district court erred by sentencing Johnson to life imprisonment based on the enhanced penalty provision for recidivists in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Johnson had previously pled guilty to state felony drug charges. The state court withheld adjudication. Johnson argues that the ease should not count as a qualifying offense for the enhancement provision in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because the state court withheld adjudication. However, this court\u2019s precedent establishes that a state plea of nolo contendr\u00e9 to a felony offense, followed by a withholding of adjudication, constitutes a prior conviction for purposes of the enhanced penalties for recidivists in \u00a7 841(b). <em>See United States v. Mejias, </em>47 F.3d 401, 404 (11th Cir.1995). Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\n<em>ELEX PIERRE,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Elex Pierre only appeals his 211-month sentence for crack and firearms offenses. Because the district court\u2019s finding that it could not consider the crack-cocaine disparity conflicts with the intervening Supreme Court decision in <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575, we reverse Pierre\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions of Louisuis, Louis, Johnson and Pierre, as well as the sentence of Johnson, are AFFIRMED. The sentences of Loui-suis, Louis, and Pierre are REVERSED and REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\">.
