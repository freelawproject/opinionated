California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Perez-Gonzalez has filed a response, requesting that substitute counsel be appointed or, in the alternative, that counsel be relieved and counsel\u2019s brief be stricken. Perez-Gonzalez\u2019s requests are DENIED. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Perez-Gonzalez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Count three of the indictment charged Gonzalez with using, carrying, brandishing, and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Perez-Gonzalez pleaded guilty to count three as set forth in the indictment. The written judgment reflects, however, that Perez-Gonzalez was convicted of possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug-trafficking crime in violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
