Yonta first challenges the finding that he failed to show changed or extraordinary circumstances justifying the untimely filing of his asylum application. We have reviewed Yonta\u2019s claims and conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review them. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2006); <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 510 n. 5 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Al-muhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 747-48 (6th Cir.2006) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">Next, Yonta challenges the finding below that he failed to qualify for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430,104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Yonta did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal. Finally, we uphold the finding below that Yonta failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-19\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-20\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
