He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C.1915(e)(2)(B)(i). He does not, however, challenge the district court\u2019s conclusions that lower federal courts cannot review state parental termination proceedings, that Bowen\u2019s claims are malicious, or that Bowen failed to establish the existence of a conspiracy. These claims are thus deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">Bowen asserts that the district court erred in dismissing as untimely a lawsuit filed in 2003 that challenged the parental termination proceedings. Because He never filed a timely notice of appeal from any judgment in those proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to address his claims. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Bowen also arguably asserts that the district court erred in dismissing the instant lawsuit as untimely. He has failed to establish that the proceeding filed in 2007 was filed within two years of the termination of parental rights in 2001. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">Bowen asserts that the district court erred in denying his postjudgment motion for recusal on the basis of bias. Bowen\u2019s motion was untimely. <em>See United States v. Sanford, </em>157 F.3d 987, 988-89 (5th Cir. 1998). Moreover, Bowen has not made a sufficient showing of an extrajudicial bias by the district court judge that would support recusal. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bowen\u2019s action. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bowen previously accumulated a strike. <em>See Bowen v. Thompson, </em>No. 6:03-CV-037-C (N.D.Tex. July 14, 2003)(unpublished). Because Bowen has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
