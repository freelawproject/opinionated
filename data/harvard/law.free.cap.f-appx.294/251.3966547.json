As a threshold matter, we conclude that Bamberg\u2019s motion to set aside the protective order was civil in nature, and thus his notice of appeal was timely filed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (in civil case, when United States is party, time to file NOA is 60 days after entry of judgment or order being appealed); <em>cf. United States v. Miramontez, </em>995 F.2d 56, 58 (5th Cir. 1993) (defendant\u2019s post-judgment request for disclosure of grand jury transcripts was civil in nature because, inter alia, criminal conviction had long been final and stated purpose of request was need for materials to file civil habeas petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">Upon review, we conclude that the types of issues raised in Hamberg\u2019s motion are more appropriately addressed in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, we modify the district court\u2019s order to be without prejudice, and we affirm the order as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-17\">. The Honorable Rodney S.
