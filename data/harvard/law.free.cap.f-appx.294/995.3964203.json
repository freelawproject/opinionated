The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants because it concluded, inter alia, that plaintiffs could not establish that defendants\u2019 alleged negligence proximately caused the derailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we conclude that issuance of a panel opinion would not serve any jurisprudential purpose. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s well-reasoned decision for the reasons stated in that court\u2019s summary judgment opinion and order of September 18, 2007, 2007 WL 2746673, and its opinion and order of October 29, 2007, 2007 WL 3224235, denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
