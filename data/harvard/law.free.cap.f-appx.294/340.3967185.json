Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Where, as here, the BIA cites <em>Matter of Burbano </em>and does not express any disagreement with any part of the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA is understood to have undertaken an independent review of the record and adopted the IJ\u2019s decision in its entirety. <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037,1040 (9th Cir.2005). Where the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA, and the final agency decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1039; <em>Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In reviewing Chhoeung\u2019s petition for relief, the IJ determined that Chhoeung was statutorily ineligible for relief because he had persecuted others. Subsequent to the IJ and BIA decisions in this case, we decided <em>Miranda Alvarado v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 915 (9th Cir.2006), which established the analytical framework relevant to determining statutory ineligibility for asylum based on a petitioner\u2019s persecution of others. Specifically, <em>Miranda Alvarado </em>requires \u201ca particularized evaluation of both personal involvement and purposeful assistance in order to ascertain culpability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927. Because neither the BIA nor the IJ had the benefit of <em>Miranda Alvarado </em>when the respective agency decisions were issued, and because Chhoeung has a colorable argument for relief under the case, we grant the petition for review and remand for the BIA\u2019s reconsideration of the case in light of <em>Miranda Alvarado. </em>We do not prejudge the results of that inquiry, nor do we place any limits on the scope of the BIA\u2019s reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b366-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
