March 20, 2007), <em>aff'd in part </em>No. A40 015 774 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 14, 2004). The BIA sustained Martinez\u2019s appeal as to the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d)\u2019s finding that he was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under now-repealed section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but dismissed his appeal as to the IJ finding that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ineligible for a waiver as a matter of discretion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues raised in this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to review purely discretionary decisions by the Attorney General, \u201csubject to the exception set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), which restores our jurisdiction to review \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Khan, </em>495 F.3d at 34. A decision granting or denying a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) is one of those discretionary determinations that we do not have jurisdiction to review. <em>See Nethagani v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 150,154, n. 2 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Avendano-Espejo v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir.2006). Jurisdiction is not conferred upon this Court based on the ability of an alien to frame his argument as though it were a constitutional claim or question of law. <em>See Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 243 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding that the petitioner\u2019s \u201ctalismanic invocation of the language of \u2018due process\u2019 \u201d was insufficient to provide the Court with jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s discretionary determination denying a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(d)(11)). This Court must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azo-dedup-1\">study the arguments asserted ... to determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction, or whether it instead raises a \u201cconstitutional claim\u201d or \u201cquestion of law,\u201d in which case the court could exercise jurisdiction to review those particular issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We conclude that no colorable constitutional claim or question of law is raised in this petition. Martinez argues that the immigration judge deprived him of \u201cdue process\u201d by improperly applying the \u201cunusual and outrageous\u201d standard when deciding whether a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility was warranted. To the extent this argument can be construed as a challenge to the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Martinez must demonstrate \u201cunusual or outstanding equities\u201d in his favor to grant a waiver of inadmissibility because his criminal conduct (i.e., a first degree reckless endangerment conviction) was particularly egregious, it is not a col-orable due process argument. Indeed, in support of this contention, Martinez merely argues that the immigration judge focused his inquiry too heavily on the adverse factors impacting Martinez\u2019s application and accorded too little weight to the positive factors. We view this argument as an attempt to \u201cquarrel[] over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices,\u201d and thus, it fails to raise a constitutional claim or question of law, rendering the issues presented in the petition beyond the scope of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329. In any event, the record demonstrates that the IJ and the BIA articulated and applied the correct legal standard, reviewing and balancing all the positive and negative factors in Martinez\u2019s case. <em>See e.g., Res-trepo v. McElroy, </em>369 F.3d 627, 634 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cIn evaluating a 212(c) application, an immigration judge must balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the petition for review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of deportation in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-24\">. Although section 212(c) has been repealed, it nevertheless applies to Martinez because he was convicted of reckless endangerment in the first degree in New York State court prior to the repeal of this section. <em>See Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 33 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
