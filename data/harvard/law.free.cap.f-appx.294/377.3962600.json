Chand also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s order summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>510 F.3d 1059,1062 (9th Cir.2007), we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chand\u2019s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status because Chand \u201cfailed to present evidence sufficient to establish that a grant of adjustment of status would be warranted in the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>See Ahwazi v. INS, </em>751 F.2d 1120, 1123 (9th Cir.1985) (BIA does not abuse its discretion where alien failed to offer new evidence in motion to reopen \u201csuggesting why the BIA should exercise its discretion to adjust [the alien\u2019s] status\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In his opening brief, Chand fails to address, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider or its order summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256,1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Chand\u2019s due process claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"aco-dedup-0\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
