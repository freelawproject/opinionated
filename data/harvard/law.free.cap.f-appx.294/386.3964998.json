Choate claims the defendants violated a multitude of his constitutional rights when they demolished a building that he owned in Seminole and then issued an abatement order with respect to the demolition site. Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>A. Underlying Dispute and the Fire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In 2005, Choate purchased an old church building located at 401 N. Second Street in Seminole, Oklahoma. At the time, the building had been condemned by the city and bore a warning sign indicating that it was in violation of the city\u2019s Housing Code and had been determined to be unsafe. After buying the building, Choate argued with the city\u2019s Office of Code Enforcement (\u201cOCE\u201d) concerning its postings of code violations and designation of the property as a public nuisance. At the same time, he was locked in a dispute with Angela De-Graffenreid, an employee of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (\u201cOG &amp; E\u201d), over her refusal to authorize permanent electrical service to the building absent a certificate of inspection for code compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Meanwhile, on January 7, 2007, much of the building was destroyed in a fire caused by arson. After the fire, the Seminole Fire Department Chief, Roy Edward Lemmings, and his deputy, Bryant Baker, determined that the building\u2019s remains were hazardous to the public. After consulting with the State Fire Marshal, they hired Troy Doner, an independent contractor, to raze the structure completely, which Doner did on January 8. Thereafter, City Manager Steve Saxon issued an abatement order declaring the building\u2019s remains a public nuisance. Choate objected to the order and demanded an administrative hearing, which was held on April 23. When the order was upheld, he appealed the matter further to the Seminole City Council, which, after a special public hearing, also voted to uphold the order. Having exhausted his administrative remedies, Choate then filed this lawsuit seeking injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">In a verified complaint dated July 3, 2007, Choate alleged that Lemmings, Baker, Doner, Saxon, and DeGraffenreid unconstitutionally deprived him of the use of his property in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also brought claims against the State of Oklahoma and the City of Seminole challenging the constitutionality of certain state statutes. After denying a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Choate, the district court granted several motions to dismiss filed by the defendants, ultimately terminating the case in January 2008. Choate\u2019s various appeals, which we consolidated for procedural purposes, are summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\n<em>B. Orders Appealed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\n<em>i. Denial of Preliminary Injunction (07-7100)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">At the same time he filed his complaint, Choate filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking a stay of the city\u2019s abatement order. He argued that disturbing the site of his former building would frustrate the criminal investigation of the arson and prevent him from calculating his own losses. The district court held a hearing on the motion on August 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On September 4, a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation addressing each of the preliminary injunction factors and recommending that Choate\u2019s motion be denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he concluded that Choate had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success as to any of his constitutional claims. With respect to any First Amendment claim that could be inferred from the complaint, the magistrate found nothing to indicate that any of the defendants\u2019 actions were motivated by religious animus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He concluded that Choate\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim would likely fail because it was clear that Choate had availed himself of significant process in resisting the abatement order. The magistrate also concluded that Choate was unlikely to prevail on his substantive due process claim because there was nothing to indicate that the relevant nuisance laws had been applied in a deliberately arbitrary manner. Finally, he concluded that the city\u2019s enforcement of its nuisance laws did not give rise to a claim under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">At the irreparable harm prong of the analysis the magistrate found there had been no showing that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Choate for his alleged injuries. He further held that Choate had been given ample time to do whatever he wished with the property and that it was unnecessary to preserve the debris because the arson investigation was complete. Finally, he held that in addition to the above factors, public safety concerns tipped in favor of the city\u2019s right to enforce the abatement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">On October 17, over Choate\u2019s objections, the district court issued an order affirming and adopting the Report and Recommendation and denying injunctive relief. Choate\u2019s appeal of that order is case no. 07-7100.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">\n<em>ii. Dismissal of Lemmings, Baker, and Saxon (07-7099)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">On November 8, 2007, the district court issued an order granting motions to dismiss filed by Lemmings, Baker, and Saxon on the grounds of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ter discussing the requirements of a qualified immunity defense, the court concluded that Lemmings and Baker exercised discretion in determining that Choate\u2019s building posed a danger to the public and had to be demolished. Likewise, it found that Saxon exercised discretion in declaring the site a public nuisance and issuing the abatement order. And it concluded that those actions did not deprive Choate of his property without due process. The court acknowledged that \u201c \u2018due process ordinarily requires an opportunity for \u201csome kind of hearing\u201d prior to the deprivation of a significant property interest.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. App., doc. 20 at 5 (quoting <em>Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining and Recl. Ass\u2019n, </em>452 U.S. 264, 299, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981)). But it pointed out that a predeprivation hearing is not always required, particularly \u201cwhere the state is confronted with an emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hodel, </em>452 U.S. at 299-300, 101 S.Ct. 2352). The district court thus concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">[b]ecause clear precedent exists allowing the deprivation of property interests without a hearing in emergency situations, it is impossible to say that Baker, Lemmings, and Saxon were objectively unreasonable in believing that their actions were not in violation of any clearly established constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>Id. </em>The court\u2019s decision to grant qualified immunity to the city officials is the subject of Choate\u2019s appeal in case no. 07-7099.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Hi. Dismissal of OCE and DeGraffenreid (08-7010)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On January 14, 2008, the district court issued orders granting motions to dismiss filed by the two remaining defendants, OCE and DeGraffenreid. It held that Choate failed to state a claim against OCE, explaining that under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), a \u00a7 1983 claim against a municipal entity cannot be predicated upon respondeat superior liability. The court explained that to prevail over OCE, Choate would have to \u201cshow \u2018that the unconstitutional actions of an employee were representative of an official policy or custom of the municipal institution, or were carried out by an official with final policy-making authority with respect to the challenged action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>doc. 30 at 3 (quoting <em>Camfield v. Oklahoma City, </em>248 F.3d 1214, 1229 (10th Cir. 2001)). In the district court\u2019s view, Choate\u2019s complaint challenged the actions of individual OCE employees rather than any action taken by OCE as a municipal entity. Furthermore, it found his complaint was devoid of any allegations that those employees acted either pursuant to an official policy or with final policy-making authority. Thus, it concluded Choate had no \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The court rejected Choate\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against DeGraffenreid because it concluded that he failed to allege any state action on her part.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">Choate\u2019s contention is that because OG &amp; E\u2019s refusal to provide him with service was motivated by unwillingness on OG &amp; E\u2019s part to break the law, OG &amp; E\u2019s refusal ... amounts to state action. Under Choate\u2019s theory of the law, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>person choosing to comply with the law \u2014 rather tha[n] break it \u2014 is a state actor for purposes of \u00a7 1983. That is simply not the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Aplt. App., doc. 29 at 3. Choate appeals the dismissals of DeGraffenreid and OCE in case no. 08-7010.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>A. Appellate Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Because of the piecemeal fashion in which Choate initiated these appeals \u2014 filing at least one notice of appeal prematurely \u2014 we have an obligation to satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction. <em>Weise v. Casper, </em>507 F.3d 1260, 1263 n. 2 (10th Cir.2007). Choate filed three notices of appeal in this action, two of them on November 13, 2007, before the district court issued its final order terminating the case. Appellate jurisdiction was proper over his first appeal because it challenged the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">His second notice of appeal challenged the district court\u2019s November 8, 2007, order dismissing Lemmings, Baker, and Saxon. That order was non-final, and therefore not appealable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>see Rekstad v. First Bank Sys., Inc., </em>238 F.3d 1259, 1261 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cAside from a few well-settled exceptions, federal appellate courts have jurisdiction solely over appeals from <em>final </em>decisions\u201d) (quotation omitted). We have held, however, that \u201c[a]n otherwise nonfinal decision becomes final and appealable if the district court adjudicates all remaining claims against all remaining parties before the appellate court acts to dismiss the appeal on the merits for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>B. Willis, C.P.A., Inc. v. BNSF Ry. Corp., </em>531 F.3d 1282,1295 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Here, the district court issued its final orders terminating the case on January 14, 2008, while Choate\u2019s appeal was pending in this court. Under <em>BNSF, </em>that order effectively ripened his premature notice of appeal. We therefore see no impediment to our jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\n<em>B. Denial of Injunctive Relief (07-7100)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Mitchell v. City of Moore, Oklahoma, </em>218 F.3d 1190, 1198 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cUnder this standard, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and review application of legal principals de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Choate\u2019s preliminary injunction motion essentially sought to prevent the city from clearing his property of debris left from the fire and demolition. His arguments on appeal, as before the district court, are difficult to follow but he appears to argue primarily that any clean-up would destroy evidence and hinder his ability to calculate his damages for purposes of this lawsuit. After a hearing, the district court rejected these arguments for reasons that we summarized above. Having reviewed the record, we see no error in the district court\u2019s factual findings or legal reasoning. We therefore affirm its denial of injunctive relief for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, dated September 4, 2007, which was affirmed and adopted by the district court on October 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">\n<em>C. Dismissal of Lemmings, Baker, and Saxon (07-7099)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">The district court dismissed Choate\u2019s claims against Lemmings, Baker, and Saxon under Rule 12(b)(6) because it held those defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. We review this decision de novo. <em>Peterson v. Jensen, </em>371 F.3d 1199, 1202 (10th Cir.2004). That the procedural posture of the dismissal was under Rule 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>rather than Rule 56 is important because \u201c[a]sserting a qualified immunity defense via a Rule 12(b)(6) motion ... subjects the defendant to a more challenging standard of review than would apply on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>371 F.3d at 1201. In <em>Peterson, </em>we explained that \u201c[i]n reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion in the context of qualified immunity, a district court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal has changed somewhat since <em>Peterson, </em>for we now ask whether the specific allegations in the complaint <em>\u201cplausibly support </em>a legal claim for relief.\u201d <em>Alvarado v. KOB-TV, L.L.C., </em>493 F.3d 1210, 1215 n. 2 (10th Cir.2007) (emphasis added). Under either standard, however, we conclude that Choate\u2019s complaint stated a \u00a7 1983 claim against Lemmings, and that the district court therefore erred in granting his motion to dismiss. For reasons explained below, we affirm the dismissals of Baker and Saxon.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Choate alleged that Lemmings violated his due process rights by ordering the demolition of his building immediately after the fire without notice. Lemmings does not dispute taking this action. But he argued in his motion to dismiss that he is entitled to qualified immunity under a long-standing rule that sanctions the deprivation of property without due process in the case of an emergency. <em>See Hodel, </em>452 U.S. at 299-300, 101 S.Ct. 2352 (setting forth the emergency situation exception to the normal pre-deprivation notice and hearing requirements). The district court agreed with Lemmings. At the beginning of its analysis, however, it recognized that Choate had asserted a constitutional violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">The underlying constitutional claim asserted by Plaintiff as the basis for his \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 claims is an alleged deprivation of his right to \u2018use his property under the United States Constitution and its laws, without due process[.]\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Aplt. App., doc. 20 at 4 (quoting Compl. at 5). Nevertheless, the court went on to conclude that \u201c[bjecause clear precedent exists allowing the deprivation of property interests without a hearing in emergency situations, it is impossible to say that ... Lemmings ... [was] objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We agree with the district court that under a certain set of facts Lemmings may have been justified in taking such summary action. As the Supreme Court remarked in <em>Hodel, </em>\u201cdeprivation of property to protect the public health and safety is one of the oldest examples of permissible summary action.\u201d 452 U.S. at 300, 101 S.Ct. 2352 (quotation omitted). The problem with the district court\u2019s analysis is that it erroneously placed the burden on Choate to plead the absence of exigent circumstances, when the onus should have been on Lemmings to show the reasonableness of his belief that immediate demolition was necessary. <em>See Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980) (\u201c[T]his Court has never indicated that qualified immunity is relevant to the existence of plaintiffs cause of action; instead we have described it as a defense available to the official in question.\u201d). The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Gomez </em>that there is no basis for imposing on a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff the obligation to anticipate and plead around the qualified immunity defense. <em>See id. </em>More recently, in the wake of <em>Crawfordr-El v. Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998), this court specifically rejected a heightened pleading standard for civil rights plaintiffs facing the immunity de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>fense. <em>See Currier v. Doran, </em>242 F.3d 905, 916-917 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">A \u00a7 1983 complaint needs but two allegations to state a cause of action: (1) that the plaintiff was deprived of a federal right; and (2) that the person who deprived him acted under color of state law. <em>Gomez, </em>446 U.S. at 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920. Moreover, these allegations need not be pled with specificity. All that is required are \u201csufficient facts, that when taken as true, provide plausible grounds that discovery will reveal evidence to support plaintiffs allegations.\u201d <em>Gann v. Cline, </em>519 F.3d 1090, 1092 (10th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). The district court must accept all well-pleaded allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Viewed under these standards, Choate\u2019s complaint stated a \u00a7 1983 claim against Lemmings. He alleged that after the fire, his building was still standing and that \u201cwithout notice to [him] ... but for alleged safety concerns, Lemmings immediately procured its demolition ... even of the parts not substantially damaged by fire.\u201d Aplt. App., doc. 1 at 4. He also alleged that Lemmings \u201crepresented to [him] and others concerned that [he] was acting under color of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Crediting these allegations as true, and affording the complaint \u201cthe solicitous construction due a <em>pro se </em>filing,\u201d <em>Dudnikov v. Chalk &amp; Vermilion Fine Arts, Inc., </em>514 F.3d 1063,1073 (10th Cir.2008), we can infer from these allegations that Lemmings, acting under color of law, ordered Choate\u2019s building to be demolished without notice or a hearing. We can even infer that he did so despite the lack of exigent circumstances, though we reiterate that the pleading rules did not require Choate to anticipate the immunity defense. <em>Crawford-El, </em>523 U.S. at 595, 118 S.Ct. 1584. It is clear from the district court\u2019s albeit short analysis that it rejected Choate\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Lemmings because the complaint did not plead the absence of the \u201cemergency situation\u201d exception set forth in <em>Hodel. </em>Because Choate was not required to do so, we reverse the district court\u2019s November 8, 2007, order with respect to defendant Lemmings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Turning to Baker and Saxon, the district court held that those defendants were also entitled to qualified immunity with respect to their roles in the demolition of Choate\u2019s building and subsequent abatement order. We need not delve into the qualified immunity analysis here, however, because we conclude that the complaint failed to state a claim as to these defendants. <em>See Mann v. Boatright, </em>477 F.3d 1140, 1145 (10th Cir.2007) (noting our authority to affirm a dismissal on any legal ground supported by the record). As we noted earlier, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must allege facts that could plausibly support the claimed violation of a federal right. With respect to Baker and Saxon, Choate\u2019s complaint fails miserably. His minimal allegations against Saxon amount to nothing more than a charge that Saxon used the administrative process in an attempt to clear the property of debris. And aside from an incomprehensible paragraph concerning an alleged delay on the part of the fire department, the complaint does not even mention Baker. Thus, we conclude as a matter of law that the complaint failed to state a claim as to these defendants, and the district court properly dismissed the claims against them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). We reach the same conclusion with respect to defendant Doner. Choate\u2019s bare allegation that he was the individual who physically demolished the building is simply not sufficient to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u00a7 1988 claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>D. Dismissals of DeGraffenreid and OCE (08-7010)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Finally, we address the dismissals of Angela DeGraffenreid and the Office of Code Enforcement. As we summarized above, the district court dismissed DeGraf-fenreid after concluding that Choate failed to allege state action on her part. It dismissed OCE because it found that Choate\u2019s allegations targeted only individuals, and the Supreme Court has held that a municipality cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983 on a respondeat superior theory for merely employing a tortfeasor. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Upon de novo review, we find no error in its orders dismissing these defendants under Rule 12(b)(6). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of DeGraffenreid\u2019s and OCE\u2019s motions to dismiss for substantially the same reasons stated in its January 14, 2008, orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">For the reasons stated above, in case 07-7100, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying injunctive relief. In case 07-7099, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissals of Baker, Saxon, Doner, and the State of Oklahoma, but we REVERSE the dismissal of Lemmings and REMAND that portion of the action for further proceedings. In case 08-7010, we AFFIRM the dismissals of DeGraffenreid and OCE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-15\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Therefore, we treat this part of the appeal as though it were from a denial of a permanent injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-17\">. Earlier, on October 17, the court had granted separate motions filed by Doner and the State of Oklahoma. Choate did not file notices of appeal as to those orders, as was his practice with the other defendants. Nonetheless, we will treat his docketing statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>which lists 10/17/07 among the dates of the orders appealed from, as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal concerning the dismissals of Doner and the State. <em>See B. Willis, C.P.A., Inc. v. BNSF Ry. Corp., </em>531 F.3d 1282, 1296 (10th Cir.2008) (noting that we may, in limited circumstances, treat a pro se litigant\u2019s docketing statement as a notice of appeal). We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the State\u2019s motion for substantially the same reasons articulated in its order dated October 17, 2007 (district court doc. 83). And we affirm its dismissal of Doner for reasons explained below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">. Choate\u2019s claim against Doner is not helped by his confusing allegation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aes-dedup-0\">Defendant Doner knew or should have known of the ordinary and customary practices of his trade as would protect private property rights, which duties and safeguards he flagrantly ignored or failed to employ when he undertook demolition work without validating questionable representations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-24\">Aplt.
