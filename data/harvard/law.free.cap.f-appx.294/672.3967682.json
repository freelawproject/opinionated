Nelson denying Weng\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ping Weng, </em>No. A97 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>817 064 (B.I.A. Nov. 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 817 064 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 5, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">As a preliminary matter, because Weng failed to sufficiently challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before this Court, we find that any such argument has been waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">I. Untimely Documentary Submissions</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Weng argues that the IJ erred by failing to admit into evidence his late-filed documentary submissions. We review such decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Dedji v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 187, 191 (2d Cir.2008). An IJ abuses his discretion where \u201c(1) his decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding or (2) his decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191-92 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">We find that the IJ did not abuse her discretion by refusing to admit into evidence Weng\u2019s untimely documentary submissions. Weng did not submit his evidence until September 26, 2005, three weeks after the September 5, 2005 deadline set by the IJ pursuant to her authority under the applicable regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c) (\u201cIf an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.\u201d). In <em>Dedji, </em>we held that \u201cwhere an alien has demonstrated good cause for the failure to timely file documents and a likelihood of substantial prejudice from enforcement of the deadline, an IJ may, in the exercise of his informed discretion, depart from the deadline imposed by the relevant local rules.\u201d <em>Dedji, </em>525 F.3d at 192. Here, we cannot find that Weng demonstrated such \u201cgood cause\u201d that the IJ abused her discretion in refusing to admit his evidence. Indeed, Weng testified that he waited until August to request documentary evidence from his relatives because he \u201cwas too busy.\u201d <em>Of id. </em>(finding that the IJ abused his discretion by failing to consider whether a departure from the local rule was warranted where a fire in Dedji\u2019s attorney\u2019s office prevented the timely submission of his documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Because Weng failed to show good cause, we need not decide whether substantial prejudice would result from the enforcement of the deadline. <em>See id. </em>Hence, the IJ did not abuse her discretion by refusing to depart from the deadline she set pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.31(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">II. Adverse Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">We find that, contrary to Weng\u2019s argument, the IJ\u2019s analysis was sufficient to qualify as an \u201cexplicit adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (finding that the IJ\u2019s \u201catypically short oral decision\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>providing reasons for doubting the applicant\u2019s credibility was \u201csufficient to qualify as an \u2018explicit credibility finding.\u2019 \u201d). The IJ found that Weng clearly came to the United States to work, basing that conclusion on Weng\u2019s lack of knowledge and interest in Falun Gong and his actions in the United States. The IJ also found \u201ca fairly serious omission or exaggeration in [Weng\u2019s] claim.\u201d Although the BIA did not address whether the IJ made an explicit credibility determination, its decision does not \u201cindicate that the IJ\u2019s decision was anything else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287-38. We have never found that any \u201cmagic words\u201d are necessary to render an adverse credibility determination. Here, the IJ\u2019s decision is sufficiently explicit to constitute an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Proceeding to the merits of that determination, we conclude that it was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found implausible Weng\u2019s claim that although he came to the United States to practice Falun Gong, he is \u201cjust practicing a little bit\u201d because he spends most of his time working. Weng also testified that he does not practice Falun Gong often because he is waiting until his removal proceedings are over and his \u201clife is more stable.\u201d Based on this testimony, we find no error in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Weng\u2019s reason for coming to the United States was to work-as opposed to practice Falun Gong. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The IJ also correctly noted that while Weng testified that his mother told him that Chinese authorities were still looking for him, his mother\u2019s letter made no such assertion. This omission is substantial when measured against the record as a whole because it undermines Weng\u2019s claim that the police are looking for him in China, and thus his assertion that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Se-caida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Here, when considered as a whole, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 107 (2d Cir.2006). Because the only evidence of a threat to Weng\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-10\">. The IJ set the September 5, 2005 deadline on April 15, 2005, giving Weng over four months to file his documentary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">. The IJ also noted that Weng \u201cknows very little about Falun Gong and clearly has very little interest in the practice of it.\u201d Contrary to Weng\u2019s argument, record evidence supports the IJ's finding. Indeed, Weng testified that he did not have formal Falun Gong training and did not practice Falun Gong in the park often because he would have to \"get up early every morning\u201d and he just \u201cdidn\u2019t do that.\u201d Weng also testified that he practiced by \u201dread[ing] and think[ing]\u201d but that, even though there are more than fifty moves, he only knew a few. Hence, the IJ properly inferred from this testimony that Weng had little interest and understanding about Falun Gong. <em>See Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
