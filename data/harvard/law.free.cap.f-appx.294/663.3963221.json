Abrams denying Zou\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiu Hua Zou, </em>No. A96 389 866 (B.I.A. Aug. 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 389 866 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and emphasizes particular aspects of that decision without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s findings, we \u201cwill review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. U.S. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ found implausible Zou\u2019s claim that her parents repeatedly approached village cadres to acquire land to build a Catholic church when, according to Zou\u2019s own testimony, the practice of Catholicism was illegal in her area. The IJ found it similarly unlikely that Zou and her parents would openly hand out flyers to gain support for their efforts. The IJ\u2019s conclusions regarding these aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Zou\u2019s testimony are not the result of bald speculation but are tethered to the record, <em>i.e., </em>Zou\u2019s own testimony and personal statement. Accordingly, they are entitled to deference. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 16 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The IJ also relied on Zou\u2019s demeanor, noting that she was at times incoherent in response to questions. We similarly afford substantial deference to the IJ\u2019s determination as to a witness\u2019s demeanor, as the IJ was in the best position to observe it. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The IJ also based his determination on Zou\u2019s failure adequately to corroborate her claim that she was a member of a Catholic church either in China or in the United States. Although Zou presented a purported church membership certificate to the IJ and a letter from her parents, the IJ afforded these documents little weight. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342 (noting that the weight to be afforded documentary evidence lies largely within the IJ\u2019s discretion). The IJ found it implausible that Zou\u2019s husband, who knew her in China, had no knowledge of her church membership there, and he noted that \u201c[t]here is no documentation ... from any individual ... independent of [Zou] that would [provide] any information\u201d regarding her alleged attendance at a church either in China or in the United States. As we have held, an applicant\u2019s failure adequately to corroborate her testimony may bear on her credibility, where the absence of corroboration in general makes the applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See id. </em>at 341. Here, having already called Zou\u2019s credibility into question, the IJ reasonably pointed to the absence of corroborating evidence as further support for his adverse credibility determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Zou argues that the IJ erred by relying in part on Zou\u2019s lack of knowledge about the Catholic faith in rendering his adverse credibility determination. <em>See Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cpeople can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets, and ... [these] same people can be persecuted for their religious affiliation\u201d). The record reflects that Zou knows next to nothing about the faith; but we need not decide whether there was error. In any event, remand would not be required because we can confidently predict that the agency would adhere to the same decision on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">In sum, substantial evidence in the record, considered in the aggregate, supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and the resulting determination that Zou failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. Because the only evidence of a threat to Zou\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, moreover, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on Zou\u2019s religion-based claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief, which were predicated on the same facts as her asylum claim. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Zou also argues that the agency erred in denying her CAT claim based on her alleged illegal departure. However, Zou points to no evidence that someone in her particular circumstances will more likely than not face torture in China on the basis of having departed illegally. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Zou\u2019s illegal departure-based CAT claim was also supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Zou\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
