Specifically, Rosales-Martinez contends that the BIA and IJ erred in finding him ineligible for adjustment of status by placing on him the burden of proving that he did not previously misrepresent his citizenship and, in addressing his argument for cancellation of removal, failed to consider adequately the hardship his removal would impose on his U.S. citizen spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8, Rosales-Martinez has the burden of proving that he did not misrepresent his citizenship and thereby render himself inadmissible. <em>See also Blanco v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 714, 720 (9th Cir.2008) (alien challenging ineligibility for relief from removal because he misrepresented his citizenship \u201chas the burden of establishing that he is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Rosales-Martinez\u2019s remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>al did not cause sufficient hardship to his U.S. citizen spouse to warrant cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Martinez-Rosas v.
