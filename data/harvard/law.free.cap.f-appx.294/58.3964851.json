The district court sentenced Gross to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count One, 84 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count Two to run consecutive with Count One, and 300 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count Five to run consecutively to Counts One and Two, for a total term of 646 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">Gross challenges his conviction and sentence, asserting on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Gross contends that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was \u201cconfused\u201d as to his maximum imprisonment exposure. He claims he did not know that the Government\u2019s filing of the notice pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 would have required that the district court impose a life sentence if it found Gross\u2019s prior convictions to be valid and appropriate predicate offenses under \u00a7 3559. As the mandatory life imprisonment requirement under \u00a7 3559 was Gross\u2019s only basis for challenging the validity of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the Government moved to withdraw its notification to seek enhanced penalties, and the court granted the Government\u2019s motion. In its discretion, the district court then declined to impose a life sentence upon Gross, instead sentencing him as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir. 2000). Our review of the record discloses that the district court properly determined that once the Government withdrew its \u00a7 3559 notice, there was no basis for Gross\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, because the only reason Gross proffered to support his motion was his apparent misunderstanding about whether a sentence of life imprisonment would be mandatory. The record reflects that Gross clearly was made aware that, following the Government\u2019s withdrawal of its \u00a7 3559 notice, it remained within the district court\u2019s discretion to sentence him to life imprisonment at the time he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In denying Gross\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, the district court considered the factors set forth in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991), as well as the requirements of Rule 11, and properly determined that the sole basis for Gross\u2019s motion to withdraw was removed when the Government withdrew its \u00a7 3559 notice. Hence, we find that Gross failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supported his request to withdraw his plea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gross\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and affirm Gross\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
