At sentencing, the district court departed upward from the advisory Guidelines pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3 (2007), because Singleton\u2019s criminal history category under-represented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and the likelihood that he would recidivate. Singleton was sentenced to a term of seventy months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the district court speculated that Singleton had likely been involved in additional criminal activity, we are compelled to find the district court\u2019s upward departure was unreasonable and therefore vacate Singleton\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. In the event the sentencing court decides to impose a sentence outside the recommended Guidelines range, the sentencing court \u201cmust consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the [departure].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">If there are no procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). While we may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, we may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify imposing a variant sentence and to its determination regarding the extent of any variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">A district court may depart upward based on the inadequacy of the defendant\u2019s criminal history if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1), p.s. To make that determination, a court may consider prior sentences not used in the criminal history calculation, prior sentences of \u201csubstantially more than one year\u201d comprised of independent crimes committed at different times, prior similar misconduct resolved by civil or administrative adjudication, charges pending at the time of offense, or prior similar conduct that did not result in a conviction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 (a)(3)(A-E).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The district court used Singleton\u2019s history of fraudulent behavior to conclude he had likely engaged in additional criminal conduct not reflected in the criminal history category. We conclude that this finding was unduly speculative and that the court\u2019s reliance on it rendered Singleton\u2019s sentence unreasonable. Because we cannot determine from the record that the finding \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992), we therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
