Chew denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Umar Barrie, </em>No. A 95 474 038 (B.I.A. May 14, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 474 038 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 3, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Muka-sey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. US. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-27\">This Court has held that \u201ca single false document or a single instance of false tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>timony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence.\u201d <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that \u201ceven ancillary evidence sometimes supports\u201d the application of <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>(false in one thing, false in everything)). We have further held that \u201ca finding of fraudulent evidence redounds upon all evidence the probative force of which relies in any part on the credibility of the petitioner\u201d and that \u201cwhere an IJ\u2019s finding of fabrication (supported by substantial evidence) serves as the basis for discrediting other evidence, a reviewing court is in no position to conclude that the discrediting of the remaining evidence is unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this case because it was based on Barrie\u2019s admission that he knowingly lied in his original asylum application regarding both his date of entry and his arrest record and that he knowingly submitted a false affidavit in support of that application. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that the submission of that false evidence rendered his testimony incredible was a proper application of <em>falsus in uno, </em>especially where his entry date and arrest record were material to his eligibility for immigration relief. <em>See id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (b)(2)(ii). Barrie has presented no evidence compelling the conclusion that he testified credibly in light of his prior submission of false evidence. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Because the only evidence that Barrie was likely to be persecuted depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Because Barrie has failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief before this Court, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
