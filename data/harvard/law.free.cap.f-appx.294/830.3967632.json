Najjar argues that, in determining that he did not establish the requisite \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship,\u201d the IJ failed to consider the hardship factors in the aggregate and their cumulative effect. Although this is couched as a legal question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Najjar is asking this court to review the IJ\u2019s hardship determination. We lack jurisdiction to do so. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). We dismiss the petition to the extent that it seeks review from the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Najjar argues that the IJ acted contrary to law by questioning whether his stepchildren are qualifying relatives for cancellation purposes; that the IJ denied his Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair hearing by questioning his good moral character and erred in finding marital fraud; and that the differential treatment of Arabs in immigration courts violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Because Najjar was denied cancellation of removal because he failed to establish the hardship requirement, we do not address whether the IJ erred in questioning whether Najjar met the other requirements. Najjar\u2019s due process and equal protection claims are unavailing. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 439 (5th Cir.2006). The petition is denied as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
