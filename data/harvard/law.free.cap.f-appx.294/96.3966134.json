For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Neal concocted a scam through which he intended to collect millions in worker\u2019s compensation insurance premiums from employers, and then bilk the workers when it came time to pay claims. To pull this off, Neal claimed to be a legitimate broker from an established company with adequate funding and reinsurance. He created shell companies to further his fraud, aliases for fictitious individuals who supposedly ran such companies, and through these companies, underbid legitimate competitors. He created forms for the \u201cpolicies\u201d he issued and collected premiums. Neal hired a third-party administrator, ostensibly to pay claims, but provided it with token funding. Neal also had in place an exit strategy: in the event of a catastrophic claim, he intended to take the money he had collected as premiums and flee the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Additionally, Neal forged the signature of U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn. Neal had previously been convicted of filing false tax returns, for which he served a twenty-seven month term of imprisonment. At the time of the instant offenses, Neal was serving a three-year term of supervised release. A special condition of release prevented Neal from working in the insurance business. To circumvent this, Neal drafted a court document indicating that the condition had been vacated, and affixed Judge Lynn\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Neal sold his bogus worker\u2019s compensation policies to several professional employment organizations (\u201cPEOs\u201d). PEOs provide outsourced employee-related services to businesses, including personnel management, health benefits, and worker\u2019s compensation coverage. In 2006, Neal convinced Employers Consortium Inc. (\u201cECI\u201d), a PEO, to purchase worker\u2019s compensation insurance through him. At the sentencing hearing, Andrew Cory, the former president of ECI, testified that his company had cancelled the worker\u2019s compensation for many of its clients and was in the process of enrolling them in Neal\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation scheme. Specifically, ECI intended to enroll a large client, Doctors Community Health Care (\u201cDoctors Community\u201d), in Neal\u2019s insurance programs. Negotiations were at an advanced stage, but a final contract had not been signed. Had the FBI not informed ECI of the nature of Neal\u2019s fraud, Cory testified that the company would have begun paying premiums on behalf of Doctors Community within days. Prior to the FBI interceding, Neal had collected some $401,170.51 in premiums from the victims of his frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">On October 26, 2006, Neal was indicted for the scam. He was charged with wire fraud and aiding and abetting in Counts 1 through 4, and wire fraud in Counts 5 and 6. Count 7 was a forfeiture charge which was later dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Following indictment, Neal sent numerous letters from prison in which he attempted to coerce testimony from witnesses concerning the scope of the deal with ECI and Doctors Community. Neal wrote to Lawrence Hoover, who had helped Neal to incorporate his bogus companies, stating that if they were able to \u201clift [the ECI deal] off of us, the dollar amount of fraud they have on us is minimal.\u201d According to the testimony of FBI Special Agent Jody Windle, Neal also threatened the life of the Assistant U.S. Attorney prosecuting the ease, attempted to recruit people to continue the scheme after he was arrested, and planned to engage in insurance fraud after serving his sentence. His letters detailed plans to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>have his fingerprints permanently altered, so that he could flee the country and commit frauds with impunity from an offshore location.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Neal pleaded guilty \u2014 without a plea agreement \u2014 to Counts 1 through 6 on April 27, 2007, three days before his trial was to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The presentence investigation report (PSR) attributed to Neal an actual and intended loss of $11,205,084.66. The PSR took the $401,170.51 which Neal had received at the time the FBI interceded, and added to that amount the projected premiums that would have been paid by the PEOs over the course of their one-year policies. The PSR also attributed a loss of $8,000,000 to Neal arising from the insurance policies with ECI on behalf of Doctors Community.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">At sentencing, Neal objected to the loss calculation. After hearing the testimony of Cory and various FBI agents concerning the scope of the fraud and the probable loss had the fraud continued unimpeded, the district court overruled Neal\u2019s objections. The court adopted the PSR and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">I am persuaded ... on the basis of testimony presented today as well as the sentencing exhibits that the intended loss should be used and that the amounts of intended loss used by the probation officer in calculating the Guidelines in the [PSR] are an accurate calculation of the intended loss with the information that is currently available in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The PSR yielded an offense level of 87 and a criminal history category of III, for a Guideline range of 262-327 months. Neal contended that a sentence in this range would be unreasonable in light of the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court noted that it had considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Neal to the statutory maximum of 240 months on each count. The court ordered that the counts were to run consecutively, so as to produce an aggregate sentence of 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Sentencing issues raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). At sentencing, a defendant need not cite specific Guideline provisions, so long as a general objection alerts the sentencing court of the defendant\u2019s disagreement with a particular application. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000). Nevertheless, this circuit adheres to the requirement that defendants must object to error, in order to \u201cencouragfe] informed decision-making and giv[e] the district court an opportunity to correct errors before they are taken up on appeal.\u201d <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. In <em>Ocana, </em>the defendant filed an objection to the use of unadjudicated \u201crelevant conduct\u201d as a basis for an upward adjustment in her offense level. 204 F.3d at 589. The court held that the defendant\u2019s objection \u201cclearly notified\u201d the sentencing court of her disagreement with an upward adjustment under \u00a7 1B1.3 of the Guidelines, notwithstanding her failure to provide a citation to that provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Neal argues that the district court should have applied a three-level downward adjustment to his offense level because his fraud was a \u201cpartially completed offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Neal did not make this argument in his objections to the PSR or at sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The government argues that because Neal first raises this issue on appeal, the court should review for plain error. Neal acknowledges that he did not previously raise the argument. However, he contends that because the sentencing hearing largely focused on the fairness of holding him accountable for the $8,000,000 intended loss to ECI and Doctors Community, he preserved the issue. In the alternative, in the event he has not preserved the issue, he asks the court to apply a \u201cmore searching standard than plain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Loss calculation and the \u201cpartially completed\u201d nature of an offense are distinct matters. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (loss calculation), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 (partially completed offense). It is not reasonable to contend that by challenging the relevance and accuracy of loss calculation under \u00a7 2B1.1, Neal gave the district court an opportunity to consider whether the crime should be treated as a \u201cpartially completed offense\u201d under \u00a7 2X1.1, and correct errors in its calculation of the Guideline range. <em>Cf. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. This is not a case where the defendant merely failed to provide a citation to a given provision, but the district court was \u201cclearly notified\u201d of the substance of the objection. <em>Cf. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d at 589. Therefore, Neal did not raise this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Neal does not persuade when he argues that a \u201cmore searching\u201d standard of review than plain error is appropriate when reviewing a sentence. First, he cites <em>United States v. Brown </em>for the proposition that \u201ccloser scrutiny may also be appropriate when the failure to preserve the precise grounds for error is mitigated by an objection on related grounds.\u201d 555 F.2d 407, 420 (5th Cir.1977) (quotation and internal punctuation omitted). <em>Brown </em>concerned constitutional errors and therefore its ruminations on the level of scrutiny are of diminished salience in the sentencing context. Second, the basic principle of <em>Brown </em>is evident in <em>Ocana: </em>an objection may preserve error despite being phrased in general or non-technical terms, so long as the substance of the objection is reasonably apparent. As discussed above, Neal\u2019s objections to loss calculation simply did not alert the district court to potential arguments under \u00a7 2X1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Neal also cites <em>United States v. Saro, </em>in which a circuit court noted that the interests of finality and judicial economy are lessened when a defendant seeks re-sentencing, as opposed to a new trial. 24 F.3d 283, 287-88 (D.C.Cir.1994). However, in <em>Saro </em>the district court had misapplied the Guidelines, and the appellate court considered only how to apply the plain error standard. <em>See id. </em>As will become apparent, the district court in this case did not misapply the Guidelines\u2014 there was simply no error. Therefore <em>Saro </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">In sum, Neal did not adequately present his \u00a7 2X1.1 objection to the sentencing court. Our review is for plain error. Under this standard, the court \u201cmay correct the sentencing determination only if (1) there is error (and in light of <em>Booker, </em>an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 sentence equates to a finding of error); (2) it is plain; and (3) it affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392. If Neal makes this showing, this court may correct the error, but should not exercise its discretion to do so unless the error \u201cseriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). In determining whether the district court committed an error, the court reviews the application of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and will overturn findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Ikechukwu, </em>492 F.3d 331, 333 (5th Cir. 2007); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). The court treats Guidelines commentary as authoritative, applying the plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the words. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"aod-dedup-0\">A. Partially Completed Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Neal argues that his fraud against ECI and Doctors Community was a \u201cpartially completed offense,\u201d and therefore, the district court should have applied a three-point downward adjustment in his offense level under \u00a7 2X1.1 of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Neal notes that he never obtained a cent of the $8,000,000 in premiums attributed to him under the deal with ECI and Doctors Community. He admits that negotiations were at an advanced stage, but emphasizes that no contract was signed. He also contends that several important events had not yet occurred which would have been essential to Neal\u2019s ability to obtain the premiums: Doctors Community had not signed the deal with ECI; Neal had not yet provided certain documentation to ECI; and \u201cmost importantly, Mr. Neal could have changed his mind and elected not to continue with the fraudulent activity.\u201d The government responds that because Neal pleaded guilty to the completed offense of wire fraud, the adjustment under \u00a7 2X1.1 is <em>per se </em>inapplicable, despite the fact that Neal never received funds under the deal with ECI and Doctors Community. Alternately, the government contends that, under the plain language of \u00a7 2X1.1, this particular fraud was too far along to be considered \u201cpartially completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Wire fraud is complete when a defendant makes a communication to advance what he knows to be a fraudulent scheme. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>504 F.3d 561, 568 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1324, 170 L.Ed.2d 135 (2008); <em>United States v. Lemons, </em>941 F.2d 309, 317-18 (5th Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Tulaner, </em>512 F.3d 576, 580 (9th Cir.2008). Because the <em>actus reus </em>is the communication, whether the defendant actually obtains the funds or property he sought is immaterial to his criminal liability. <em>See United States v. Wharton, </em>320 F.3d 526, 538 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Tulaner, </em>512 F.3d at 580. For sentencing purposes, the offense level for wire fraud is to be determined in accordance with \u00a7 2B1.1 of the Guidelines. When a defendant is prosecuted before realizing the fruits of his frauds, courts must grapple with the proper loss calculation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, app. n. 3(A) (stating that \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss\u201d). Additionally, application note 17 directs the sentencing court to apply \u00a7 2X1.1 in the case of a \u201cpartially completed offense (e.g. an offense involving a completed theft or fraud that is part of a larger, attempted theft or fraud).\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, app. n. 17. This rule applies \u201cwhether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense ... or both.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">The basic rule of \u00a7 2X1.1 is that inchoate offenses (conspiracies, attempts, and solicitations) receive the same base offense level as the substantive offense, \u201cplus any adjustments from such guideline for any intended offense conduct that can be established with reasonable certainty.\u201d \u00a7 2X1.1(a). To illustrate: when a defendant is convicted of an attempt, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>shall decrease the offense level by three points, \u201cunless the defendant completed all the acts the defendant believed necessary for successful completion of the substantive offense or the circumstances demonstrate that the defendant was about to complete all such acts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the language of \u00a7 2X1.1 contemplates situations in which a substantive fraud offense is complete, but is a part of a \u201clarger, attempted theft or fraud.\u201d In such a case, loss is calculated under \u00a7 2B1.1, with a three-level downward adjustment under \u00a7 2X1.1. Conversely, even if the defendant has been convicted of the inchoate offense for theft or fraud (and not the substantive offense), a downward adjustment under \u00a7 2X1.1 is inappropriate if the defendant was close to completing the substantive offense. The Background Commentary to \u00a7 2X1.1 confirms the inference that this adjustment is to be used sparingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">In most prosecutions for conspiracies or attempts, the substantive offense was substantially completed or was interrupted or prevented on the verge of completion by the intercession of law enforcement authorities or the victim. In such cases, no reduction of the offense level is warranted. Sometimes, however, the arrest occurs well before the defendant or any co-conspirator has completed the acts necessary for the substantive offense. Under such circumstances, a reduction of 3 levels is provided under \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(1) or (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Fifth Circuit has never addressed the application of \u00a7 2X1.1 to a wire fraud conviction. The Circuit has applied this particular provision in the context of bank fraud, which, like wire fraud, does not require that a defendant actually obtain any of the targeted money or property. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344; <em>United States v. Oates, </em>122 F.3d 222 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Blackburn, </em>9 F.3d 353 (5th Cir. 1993). However, in this appeal we expressly decline to address whether, and under what circumstances, substantive wire fraud convictions should be eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 2X1.1. Rather, the facts of this case demonstrate that the offense was not \u201cpartially completed\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2X1.1. Cory\u2019s undisputed testimony demonstrated that Neal was within days of receiving the first premium payment on the deal with ECI and Doctors Community.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neal places great weight on the absence of a final signed contract, as well as the assertion that due diligence had not ended when the FBI alerted ECI of the fraud. However, this is of little consequence: Neal had convinced ECI to cancel its clients\u2019 existing worker\u2019s compensation insurance in anticipation of switching over to Neal\u2019s \u201cinsurance.\u201d Moreover, Neal\u2019s suggestion that he might have pulled out of his fraud rings hollow: he attempted to recruit others to continue his scheme after arrest and indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The evidence at sentencing amply demonstrated that Neal was \u201con the verge of completion\u201d of his fraud, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2X1.1 cmt. background, and would have begun receiving worker\u2019s compensation premiums from ECI \u201cbut for apprehension or interruption\u201d by the FBI, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2X1.1 app. n. 4. Thus, Neal\u2019s conduct falls short of meeting the plain language of the application notes to \u00a7 2X1.1. Because there was no error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>on the part of the district court, we reject Neal\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a three-level reduction in his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We now turn to Neal\u2019s argument that his 327-month sentence is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court applies a two-step procedure when l\u2019eview-ing a sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 384-85 (5th Cir.2008). First, the court determines whether the sentencing court has committed a significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the proper Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, or failing to consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when making an individualized assessment of the proper sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the first step reveals no error and the sentence is within the Guideline range, the court then applies a presumption of reasonableness and reviews the sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d at 384-85, 389; <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">For a within-Guidelines sentence, the court may \u201cinfer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2005). A presumption of reasonableness may normally only be overcome if the sentence \u201cfalls so far afoul\u201d of the following standards as to demonstrate that the sentencing court abused its broad discretion: the sentence \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight; (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant factor; or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikono-va, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">First, Neal contends that the sentence grossly overstates the seriousness of the offense. He argues that holding him accountable for over $11,000,000 in actual and intended loss is wholly disproportionate with the true loss he caused, which he calculates to be $151,392.91. He emphasizes that $8,000,000 of the loss attributed to him arises from the deal with ECI and Doctors Community, and is a \u201cspeculative amount.\u201d Neal notes that without the $8,000,000 added to the loss calculation, his Guideline range would have been 210-262 months. Neal argues that because this one figure vastly increased his Guideline range, the 327-month sentence, the maximum under the Guidelines, is unreasonable. Neal provides no authority to show how inclusion of the loss can be proper under \u00a7 2B1.1 of the Guidelines but yield an unreasonable result in light of the seriousness of the offense. It was proper to increase the offense level in light of Neal\u2019s audacious scheme, which had the potential to leave thousands without worker\u2019s compensation insurance. The sentencing court\u2019s consideration of these matters is amply reflected in the record of the sentencing hearing; therefore, the court\u2019s decision to sentence Neal to the high end of the Guideline range was not an abuse of discretion for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">Second, Neal contends that the sentence is greater than necessary to incapacitate him, to deter future crimes (by Neal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>others), or to promote respect for the law. He notes that he will be well over eighty before he serves his full sentence. He contends that the length of his sentence disregards any chance or hope of rehabilitation. Neal notes that he first became involved in criminal enterprises after the age of fifty, when his marriage dissolved and he became severely depressed. While the government agrees that recidivism might generally decline with age, it posits that Neal is different: his criminal activities have all come after age fifty, he demonstrated no intent to give up unlawful activity after indictment, and he even devised future frauds to carry out after he served his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Advanced age does not preclude a long sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1 (\u201cAge (including youth) is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted. Age may be a reason to depart downward in a case in which the defendant is <em>elderly and infirm </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>470 F.3d 1115, 1130-31 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that a sentencing court must explain a decision to grant a downward departure based solely on advanced age), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3002, 168 L.Ed.2d 731 (2007). Here, it is not clear whether the district court considered Neal\u2019s age. However, the court heard evidence not only regarding Neal\u2019s pre-in-dictment conduct, but also his efforts to obstruct justice, coerce witnesses, and continue his scheme after he was indicted. Wfiiile Neal might spend the rest of his life incarcerated, his flagrant disregard for the law suggests that a long sentence is the best way to incapacitate him. His sentence also makes clear that wire fraud is not a victimless crime, but here, had the potential to disrupt the lives of thousands of individuals. Neal\u2019s lengthy sentence demonstrates that such behavior is intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Finally, Neal contends that the sentencing judge did not consider the fact that his guilty plea saved resources by avoiding a lengthy trial. This argument is specious. The government still had to prepare for a lengthy trial because Neal pleaded guilty on the brink of trial, over six months after he was indicted. What is more, the government\u2019s job was complicated by Neal\u2019s efforts to influence witness testimony and threaten those prosecuting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">In sum, the district court committed no significant procedural error and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.
