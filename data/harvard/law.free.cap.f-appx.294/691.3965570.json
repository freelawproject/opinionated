We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d 543 U.S. at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738 \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a challenged sentence is \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review proceeds in two steps: first, we must \u201cascertain whether the sentence was administered without procedural error,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2008); and second, if the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we must \u201cconsider [its] substantive reasonableness,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, by evaluating \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence imposed, <em>id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">We identify neither procedural nor substantive unreasonableness in this case. First, as Phillip himself concedes, his claim of substantive unreasonableness because of a sentencing disparity resulting from fast-track programs in other district courts, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158,164 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cWe join other circuits in holding that a district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable\u201d in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Second, to the extent Phillip asserts procedural error based on the district court\u2019s misapprehension of its authority to consider fast-track disparity in imposing sentence, we are not persuaded. While this Court has not yet addressed the question of \u201cwhether the district court has the authority to impose a non-Guidelines sentence in response to the fast-track sentencing disparity if it deems such a reduced sentence to be warranted,\u201d <em>United States v. Liriano-Blanco, </em>510 F.3d 168, 172 (2d Cir.2007), even assuming we were to resolve the issue in Phillip\u2019s favor, we would not identify error. The record makes plain that the challenged sentence was imposed, not because the district court concluded it lacked authority to consider disparities between its court and fast-track districts, but because it did not think any such disparity warranted a sentencing reduction in this case. <em>See United States v. Hendry, </em>522 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir.2008) (concluding that district court thought consideration of disparity caused by absence of fast-track program in sentencing was not foreclosed by <em>Mejia, </em>but finding such arguments for a sentencing reduction unpersuasive); <em>United States v. Ramirez-Sucar, </em>517 F.3d 69, 70 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that because district court made clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>that it had \u201cno inclination to depart downward based on the availability of fast-track departures in certain other districts,\u201d there was no need to resolve the question left open in <em>Liriano-Blanco </em>regarding district court\u2019s capacity to adjust for disparities created by fast-track).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Third, to the extent Phillips asserts that the district court was obliged to accord the availability of fast-track programs in other districts some weight in applying the parsimony clause, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>this Court in Hendry, </em>522 F.3d 239, recently ruled that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Mejia. </em>In <em>Hendry, </em>we explained \u201cin part why the sentencing disparities resulting from the existence of fast-track districts are not <em>per se </em>unwarranted\u201d and also explained \u201cwhy sentences in fast-track districts cannot be compared with sentences in non-fast-track districts in order to demonstrate that the latter are longer than necessary\u201d as would be required to establishing that the district court violated the parsimony clause. <em>Hendry, </em>522 F.3d at 242 (citing <em>Mejia, </em>461 F.3d at 162).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
