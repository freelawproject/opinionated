We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting a summary judgment motion. <em>See Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 560 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">Mayes argues that the individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because they were aware that the nurses were following an \u201cold\u201d policy which (unlike the newer applicable policy) prohibited the dispensation of non-mandatory medication during lockdown. Even if this court were to assume, arguendo, that Mayes did make a showing of supervisory liability, Mayes failed to make a threshold showing that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835-37, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court thus did not err in granting the individual defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 524-25 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">The district court also did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the defendant state agencies. Under the Eleventh Amendment, federal courts lack jurisdiction to entertain suits in law or equity against a non-consenting state, or a state agency, by its own citizens. <em>In re Soileau, </em>488 F.3d 302, 305 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1220, 170 L.Ed.2d 60 (2008); <em>Martinez v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>300 F.3d 567, 573 (5th Cir.2002). Mayes\u2019s reliance on <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Services of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) is misplaced because <em>Monell </em>concerned a suit against a municipality, and in no way suggests that state agencies are subject to suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Finally, Mayes has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for the production of documents and for interrogatories. <em>See Moore v. Willis Indep. School Dist., </em>233 F.3d 871, 876 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Heitschmidt v. City of Houston, </em>161 F.3d 834, 840 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-21\">. We also note that there is no evidence that any of the individual defendants acted (or failed to act) with malice for the purpose, or with the intent, of causing Mayes pain or injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
