Patterson maintains the evidence was insufficient to prove his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">Patterson properly preserved his contention at trial by moving for judgment of acquittal in two instances: at the close of the Government\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence. <em>See United States v. Izydore, </em>167 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cIn determining whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions, [this court] must decide, viewing the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, whether a rational juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mann, </em>493 F.3d 484, 492 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">\u201cWire fraud is (1) the formation of a scheme or artifice to defraud, and (2) use of the wires in furtherance of the scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cViolation of the wire-fraud statute requires the specific intent to defraud, i.e., a conscious knowing intent to defraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>doubt that Patterson engaged in a scheme to defraud the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by providing false answers on his assistance application and his subsequent declaration of continuing need, that he used the wires to further this scheme, and that he acted with the specific intent to defraud. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">To convict Patterson of theft of public property, proof was required that (1) \u201cthe property belonged to the government and had a value in excess of $1000\u201d, (2) Patterson \u201cstole or converted the property for his own use or for the use of another\u201d, and (3) \u201che did so knowing the property was not his and with the intent to deprive the owner of the use or benefit of the property\u201d. <em>United States v. Dien Duc Huynh, </em>246 F.3d 734, 745 (5th Cir.2001). Based on Patterson\u2019s conversion of FEMA funds, a rational juror could have found these elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Furthermore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Patterson knowingly made a false statement with respect to the information required to be kept in the records of a federally-licensed firearms dealer. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
