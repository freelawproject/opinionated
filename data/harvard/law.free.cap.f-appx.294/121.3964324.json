He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 841 based on his prior state conviction for distribution of marijuana because the conviction resulted from a plea of nolo contendere. Walker contends that an admission of guilt is necessary to constitute a conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">This court need not address Walker\u2019s contention, which seeks a construction of the \u00a7 841 enhancement provision. The district court rendered an alternative sentence after it properly calculated Walker\u2019s guidelines range and imposed a sentence within the guidelines range. Thus, Walker\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment founded on the guidelines is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Nothing in the record indicates that the court committed procedural error in calculating the Guidelines, and the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-9\">.
