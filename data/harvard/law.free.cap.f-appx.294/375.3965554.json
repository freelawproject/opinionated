Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">The BIA properly determined that Alvarez-Campos is removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) because within five years of his admission Alvarez-Campos was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. Convictions under CahPenal Code \u00a7 487 are categorically for crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>334 F.3d 840, 844 (9th Cir.2003). Moreover, Alvarez-Campos\u2019 grand theft conviction was for a felony. The state court merely suspended his felony sentence and has not declared his conviction to be a misdemeanor. <em>See id. </em>at 844-45 (construing Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b)). A sentence of one year or longer could have been imposed for the felony conviction. <em>See </em>CahPenal Code \u00a7 18 (a felony is punishable by imprisonment in state prison for 16 months, two years, or three years).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review Alvarez-Campos\u2019 contention regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b401-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
