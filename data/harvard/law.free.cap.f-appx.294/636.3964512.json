Oct. 10, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Pan\u2019s brief to this Court does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that, in light of the prior adverse credibility determination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Changle City police department certificate and the supporting affidavits that he offered were insufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. In <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>we found that, in the context of a motion to reopen, the BIA \u201creasonably rejected the authenticity\u201d of an allegedly official government notice because the petitioner had been found not credible in the context of his original asylum hearing. 500 F.3d 143, 146-47 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007)). The BIA explicitly relied on <em>Qin Wen Zheng </em>in its decision, but that case is not cited, much less discussed, in Pan\u2019s brief. Given that the BIA\u2019s rejection of Pan\u2019s evidence in light of the prior adverse credibility determination was a dispositive finding, his failure to challenge it is fatal to his petition for review. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007)(per cu-riam)(denying the petition for review where petitioner failed to raise \u201cany of the issues relevant\u201d to BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. We note that we previously upheld the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination in Pan\u2019s case. <em>See Qi Long Pan v. Gonzales, </em>No. 03-40299-ag (2d Cir. July 19, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
