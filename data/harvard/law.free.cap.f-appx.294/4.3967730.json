Johnson was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of seventy-two months and one day. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Johnson\u2019s sentence is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing expressed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008). Although Johnson was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so, and the Government elected not to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 591. Sentences within the applicable Guidelines range may be presumed by the appellate court to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">The district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Johnson, appropriately treating the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, properly calculating and considering the applicable Guidelines range, and weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, Johnson\u2019s sentence, which is well below the applicable Guidelines range for Count One and no greater than the statutory minimum for Count Three, may be presumed reasonable. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the chosen sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform their client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsels\u2019 motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
