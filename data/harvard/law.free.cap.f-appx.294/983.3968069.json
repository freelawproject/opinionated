In 1988, Goodrich was convicted of aggravated rape, a violation of former Tex Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.03 (Vernon 1987), and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Although \u00a7 21.03 is not listed under Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.046, Goodrich asserts that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (Parole Board) has adopted a rule making \u00a7 508.046 applicable to inmates convicted under \u00a7 21.03 as though they were convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021. He argues that by applying \u00a7 508.046 to his 2005 parole hearing, the Parole Board altered the definition of the crime of which he was convicted in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion and its dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). At the time of Goodrich\u2019s conviction, a prisoner needed the vote of only a majority of a randomly-selected three-member Parole Board panel to be granted parole. <em>See </em>TexCode. Crim. P. 42.12 \u00a7 14A(i) (Vernon 1979). However, under \u00a7 508.046, effective September 1, 1997, a favorable vote of two-thirds of the entire Parole Board was required to grant parole to certain offenders, including those convicted of aggravated sexual assault. <em>See </em>\u00a7 508.046 (Vernon 2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">As the district court noted, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that the Penal Code section for aggravated sexual assault, \u00a7 22.021, encompasses the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>duct previously included in the aggravated rape statutes and that aggravated rape, \u00a7 21.03, was the statutory precursor to aggravated sexual assault. <em>See Griffith v. State, </em>116 S.W.3d 782, 787-88 (Tex.Crim. App.2003). Accordingly, the Parole Board did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause by applying \u00a7 508.046 to Goodrich because it did not alter the definition of the crime for which he was convicted nor increase his punishment. <em>See Collins v. Young-blood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 44, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). Furthermore, this court has determined that the Parole Board\u2019s retroactive application of \u00a7 508.046 does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it is a discretionary rule addressing a prisoner\u2019s \u201csuitability, not eligibility, for parole.\u201d <em>See Wallace v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 351, 355-56 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">MOTIONS TO SUPPLEMENT &amp; CORRECT BRIEF GRANTED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">. Please note, the Parole Board's size was reduced from eighteen to seven members effective January 11, 2004, prior to November 2005 when Goodrich\u2019s parole was denied. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 508.031 (Vernon 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
