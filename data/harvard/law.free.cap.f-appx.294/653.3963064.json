Nelson, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Dang Jiang, </em>No. A98 715 171 (B.IA. Dec. 28, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 715 171 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 1, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">When the BIA does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. See <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA </em>482 F.3d 122,126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Regarding Jiang\u2019s fear of sterilization pursuant to China\u2019s coercive population control program, we find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that this fear was speculative (and therefore not well-founded) as he was unmarried, had no children, and alleged no previous contact with family-planning officials. We have previously found that \u201c[i]n the absence of solid support in the record for [an asylum applicant\u2019s] assertion that he will be subjected to forced sterilization [or some other form of persecution], his fear is speculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125,129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Jiang relies on our decision in <em>Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2006), where we vacated the agency\u2019s finding that the petitioner\u2019s claim of forced sterilization was speculative. <em>See id. </em>at 135-36. Unlike Jiang, however, the petitioner in <em>Lin </em>had two children, planned to have more, had an intrauterine device inserted without her consent, hid from Chinese family-planning officials, and used a false certificate that her husband had been sterilized to avoid her own sterilization. <em>See id. </em>at 130-31, 136. In light of these considerable differences, <em>Lin </em>is of no aid to Jiang.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">We also reject Jiang\u2019s argument that he is eligible for asylum based on the forced sterilization of his mother and aunts. Jiang \u201cdoes not automatically qualify for \u2018refugee\u2019 status on account of a coercive procedure performed on someone else.\u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). And he has presented no evidence that the Chinese authorities are likely to single him out for persecution based on his relatives\u2019 violations of family-planning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The agency also did not err in concluding that Jiang failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on his alleged illegal departure from China. First, the IJ reasonably found that Jiang had failed to prove he left China illegally, based on Jiang\u2019s testimony that he was permitted to leave the country using a passport with his name and picture. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 169 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cSo long as an inferential leap is tethered to the evidentiary record, we will accord deference to the finding.\u201d). Second, the IJ reasonably discredited Jiang\u2019s claim that he previously had been detained in China for illegal departure because: (1) he stated on his asylum application that he had never been detained in any country other than the United States, and (2) his asylum application and his mother\u2019s letter did not mention any prior departure or detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">As Jiang was unable to establish eligibility for asylum, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal or CAT relief arising out of the same factual assertions. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
