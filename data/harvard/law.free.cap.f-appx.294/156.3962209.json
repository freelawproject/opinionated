JONES, Chief Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Diane Hobbs (\u201cMs. Hobbs\u201d) appeals the entry of summary judgment against her on her claim arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cERISA\u201d). She also appeals the district court\u2019s award of costs to defendant Baker Hughes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">Diane Hobbs\u2019s husband, David J. Hobbs (\u201cMr. Hobbs\u201d), was employed by Baker Hughes from 1979 to 2003. As part of its employee benefits plan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Baker Hughes provided Mr. Hobbs with two life insurance policies totaling $195,000 in coverage. Ms. Hobbs was listed as a 50% beneficiary under these policies. In June 2003 Baker Hughes provided Mr. Hobbs a copy of its Summary Plan Description (\u201cSPD\u201d), explaining that if his employment were ever terminated, his life insurance coverage would end unless he converted it to an individual policy. Two months later, in August 2003, Baker Hughes terminated Mr. Hobbs\u2019s employment for cause. On the day of his termination, Baker Hughes hand-delivered a letter (\u201cTermination Letter\u201d) to Mr. Hobbs, which reiterated the conversion policy found in the SPD: \u2018Tour company provided Life ... coverage[ ] will end on the date of your termination. You may apply to convert your coverage to an individual policy. You must apply for the policy within 31 days after your coverage ends. You will receive a conversion application with your COBRA enrollment materials.\u201d Mr. Hobbs went home that day and advised his wife Diane that all his Baker Hughes benefits had ended. Mr. Hobbs never discussed the benefits situation with his wife again, and he made no attempt or inquiry with Baker Hughes to convert his life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">Several months later, in May 2004, Mr. Hobbs suffered a fatal brain aneurism. Ms. Hobbs asked Baker Hughes about Mr. Hobbs\u2019s life insurance benefits and was advised that his coverage had ended the day his employment was terminated. Around this time, Ms. Hobbs learned that the life insurance conversion application referenced in the Termination Letter had been mailed to Mr. Hobbs at his office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>address, rather than his home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Hobbs filed this lawsuit in May 2006, seeking \u201creinstatement\u201d and payment of Mr. Hobbs\u2019s life insurance benefits. The district court granted summary judgment to Baker Hughes, and Ms. Hobbs appeals. Her primary argument on appeal is that Baker Hughes\u2019s failure to send Mr. Hobbs\u2019s conversion application to his home address was a breach of fiduciary duty actionable under \u00a7 502(a)(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). Ms. Hobbs also challenges the district court\u2019s award of $1,351.30 in costs to Baker Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Baker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>364 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir.2004). The decision to award costs in an ERISA case is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Wade v. Hewlett-Packard. Dev. Co. LP Short Term Disab. Plan, </em>493 F.3d 533, 541 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA provides, in part, that a civil action may be brought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). The district court granted Baker Hughes summary judgment on this claim for two reasons. First, the court concluded that Baker Hughes\u2019s actions in this case \u2014 an unexplained failure to deliver a third notice of Mr. Hobbs\u2019s conversion rights \u2014 did not rise to the level of a breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court found no evidence that Baker Hughes was responsible for more than a clerical oversight in this matter. <em>See Bo-dine v. Employers Casualty Co., </em>352 F.3d 245, 251 (5th Cir.2003) (noting that plaintiffs had made no allegations of \u201cdeceptive practices, misrepresentations, or other behavior typically associated with fiduciary breaches by employers under ERISA\u201d); <em>see also Vallone v. CNA Fin. Corp., </em>375 F.3d 623, 642 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Wjhile there is a duty to provide accurate information under ERISA, negligence in fulfilling that duty is not actionable.\u201d) The district court also held that Ms. Hobbs had failed to demonstrate a fact issue on the question of causation; i.e., the court found no evidence indicating that Mr. Hobbs would have acted differently had he been advised yet again of his conversion rights. <em>See Ferrer v. Chevron Corporation, </em>484 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir.2007) (affirming Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of an ERISA claim for lack of a causal relationship between the alleged breach of fiduciary duty and damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The district court further noted that there was some dispute whether the reinstatement Ms. Hobbs seeks is \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 available under \u00a7 502(a)(3). The district court found it unnecessary to reach this question, but for our purposes the issue is sufficient to resolve the case at hand. <em>See FDIC v. Laguarta, </em>939 F.2d 1231, 1240 (5th Cir.1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(noting that summary judgment may be affirmed on any grounds adequately developed below). Our easelaw makes it clear that the \u201creinstatement\u201d of benefits Ms. Hobbs seeks does not qualify as equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>Amschwand v. Spherion Corp., </em>505 F.3d 342, 348 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2995, 171 L.Ed.2d 911 (2008). Though Ms. Hobbs has attempted to cast her prayer for relief as equitable,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in substance she is seeking damages in the form of life insurance proceeds. \u201cObtaining the lost policy proceeds ... is simply a form of make-whole damages. This demand is not equitable in derivation, but is akin to the legal remedies of extracontractual or compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). These legal remedies are not available under \u00a7 502(a)(3). Thus, even assuming Baker Hughes did breach its fiduciary duty in failing to update its records and mail Mr. Hobbs a third notice of his conversion rights, and assuming Ms. Hobbs could show a causal link between this breach and Mr. Hobbs\u2019s decision not to convert his benefits, the relief she seeks is not available under \u00a7 502(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Ms. Hobbs also challenges the district court\u2019s order affirming the award of costs to Baker Hughes. She complains that Baker Hughes should have filed a motion for costs, rather than submitting a bill of costs to the court clerk. ERISA authorizes a court to award costs \u201cin its discretion.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). Costs in an ERISA suit may be awarded on a simple \u201cprevailing party\u201d basis. <em>Wade, </em>493 F.3d at 542-43. Here, Baker Hughes was the prevailing party, and it submitted its bill of costs to the court clerk in accordance with Local Rule 54.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ms. Hobbs filed an objection, which the district court examined and overruled. Ms. Hobbs has not shown this process to be inadequate or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Ms. Hobbs\u2019s request for permission to submit supplemental briefing on <em>Amschwand v. Spherion Corp. </em>is denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-21\">. All parties agree this plan is governed by ERISA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. At one time, Mr. Hobbs had asked Baker Hughes to mail his personal correspondence to his office address. At some point prior to his termination, he requested that Baker Hughes change his mailing address to his residence. Baker Hughes, for unknown reasons, never updated its records accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\">. The district court assumed for the sake of argument, as do we, that Baker Hughes was acting as a fiduciary at all relevant times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. Ms. Hobbs explained in her response to Baker Hughes's Motion for Summary Judgment that the \"proper equitable relief\u201d would allow her to convert Mr. Hobbs's benefits retroactively, pay any necessary premiums, and collect the balance due on the policies. This is, in substance, a request for damages. <em>See Amschwand, </em>505 F.3d at 348 n. 7 (\u201cSuch attempts to recharacterize a desired \u00a7 502(a)(3) remedy as a purely equitable form of relief, like an injunction, have been consistently rejected.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-23\">. Southern District of Texas Local Rule 54.2, \"Bill of Costs,\u201d provides in relevant part, \"An application for costs shall be made by filing a bill of costs within 14 days of the entry of a final judgment....
