We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels the result, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum because Jin failed to establish that her mistreatment by Chinese authorities was motivated, even in part, by her political beliefs. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1116-17 (9th Cir.2000). We reject Jin\u2019s contention that she was entitled to a presumption of political persecution because she did not demonstrate that the police\u2019s criminal investigation had no bona fide objective, and her contention that her treatment was disproportionately severe. <em>See Dinu, </em>372 F.3d at 1044-45 (\u201cheavy-handed\u201d police tactics did not give rise to inference of political persecution). Because Jin\u2019s fear of future persecution is based on these past encounters with the Chinese police, she has failed to show a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 961-62 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Because Jin did not establish asylum eligibility, it necessarily follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b390-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
