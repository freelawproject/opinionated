In August 2007, the district court sentenced Wilson principally to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals his sentence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-26\">Wilson contends that the district court erred in finding that his 1983 conviction in Bronx County Criminal Court for attempted criminal sale of marijuana, a misdemeanor under New York state law, qualified as a aggravated felony for the purpose of enhancing his sentence. We review legal challenges to a sentence <em>de novo, United States v. Matthews, </em>205 F.3d 544, 545 (2d Cir.2000), and find that Wilson\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>We have previously held that a drug trafficking offense, regardless of its classification under state law, is an aggravated felony for sentencing enhancement purposes when it is (1) an offense punishable under the federal Controlled Substance Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d), and (2) can be classified as a felony under federal law. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>319 F.3d 81, 85-86 (2d Cir.2002). Wilson\u2019s 1983 conviction was punishable under the CSA, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), and qualifies as a felony under federal law, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). Thus, the offense is an aggravated felony under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Simpson, </em>319 F.3d at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Wilson invites us to reconsider our holding in <em>Simpson </em>in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). We decline to do so, as nothing in <em>Lopez </em>suggests that a crime punishable as a felony under federal law, but punishable only as a misdemeanor under state law, does not qualify as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
