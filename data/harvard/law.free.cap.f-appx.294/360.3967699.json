We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-484, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The record does not compel the conclusion that changed circumstances excused the untimely filing of Aytayan\u2019s asylum application, where the application was filed nearly two years after the purported change. <em>See Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172,1180 (9th Cir.2008) (concluding that a 364-day delay in filing an asylum application after expiration of visa was not a reasonable period); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Aytayan has failed to demonstrate past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003). Furthermore, because she has not submitted specific evidence to demonstrate that she would be persecuted on the basis of her religion, <em>see id. </em>at 1018, and the Country Report supports the agency\u2019s finding that Armenia\u2019s ban on proselytizing is not enforced against Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, she has failed to establish that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted. <em>See id.; see also Gomes v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1264,1267 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">In her opening brief, Aytayan fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the IJ\u2019s determination that she is not eligible for CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
