After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">A. Criminal Trial and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">In 1993, Scott was convicted of one count of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) showed that Scott had 10 criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category V. Three of those points in the PSI were due to Scott\u2019s 1977 federal convictions for bank robbery, conspiracy and possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No objections were filed as to those convictions or the criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">As a result, in April 1994, the district court sentenced Scott to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment on the bank robbery count and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm count, with terms to run consecutively. The district court imposed the 240-month sentence on the firearm count because Scott had the prior 1977 federal conviction for carrying a firearm in violation of \u00a7 924(c). In 1994, \u00a7 924(c) provided a mandatory minimum 20-year term of imprisonment, rather than a minimum 5-year term of imprisonment, if the defendant had a prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">The district court did not know when it sentenced Scott in 1994 that, in 1978, Scott\u2019s 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction had been reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate his sentence. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>579 F.2d 356, 358 (5th Cir. 1978). This fact was not brought to the district court\u2019s attention or raised on direct appeal of the 1993 convictions and sentences. Instead, Scott\u2019s direct appeal raised two issues unrelated to the vacation of his 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction. This Court affirmed his 1993 convictions and sentences on December 8, 1994. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>No. 94-6374, 42 F.3d 645 (11th Cir. Dec. 8,1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">B. Three Prior Post-judgment Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">Almost four years later, Scott filed a letter in the district court asking to have his 1994 sentence on his \u00a7 924(c) conviction amended pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In this letter, Scott argued for the first time that he should not have received the enhanced 20-year mandatory minimum because his prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction had been reversed in 1978. A magistrate judge construed Scott\u2019s letter as a motion to vacate or set aside his 1994 sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and recommended that Scott\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion be dismissed as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">Scott filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, ai\u2019guing that his motion should be considered timely because he had ineffective counsel on direct appeal, he had been unable to communicate with his attorney during the appeal process and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>only later learned his attorney died during the appeal. Scott also stated that he sent a letter to his attorney asking him to raise on direct appeal the issue of the vacated prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Over Scott\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) and denied Scott\u2019s construed \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Scott appealed the denial of his motion. In April 1999, this Court denied Scott\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), concluding that he had failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In March 2002, Scott filed an application with this Court for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, again raising the issue of his vacated prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction. In April 2002, this Court denied Scott\u2019s application, concluding that Scott\u2019s claims were not based on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In January 2003, Scott filed a motion for relief from the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) in which he raised the issue of his vacated prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction. He also argued that his attorney\u2019s death during the direct criminal appeal tolled the one-year statute of limitations for filing \u00a7 2255 motions and constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying the reopening of his \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">In January 2006, a magistrate judge recommended denying the Rule 60(b) motion because it was untimely and did not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances. The R&amp;R also noted that Scott previously had raised the issue of his counsel\u2019s death in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion and concluded that this argument was insufficient then and now to overcome the time bar. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R&amp;R and denied Scott\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. Scott appealed, and this Court construed his notice of appeal as a COA and denied it on June 12, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">C. Motion on Appeal Now</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">On April 6, 2007, Scott filed the motion at issue in this appeal, titled \u201cMotion for Resentencing Under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(7).\u201d Scott argued that he should be resentenced because the district court relied on his vacated prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction to impose the 240-month sentence. As with prior motions, Scott contended he was unaware that his 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction had been vacated at the time of his 1994 sentencing. He also maintained that he sent a letter to his attorney in October 1994 asking that the \u00a7 924(c) issue be raised, but received no response. He did not learn until 1998 that his attorney died after filing a direct appeal brief and that this Court had affirmed his firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The district court denied Scott\u2019s motion, concluding that it raised the same issues Scott previously raised in his Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the judgment and that the court and this Court already had disposed of those issues. Scott filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"APgO\">A. Section 3559(c)(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">At the outset, we note that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(7) does not afford a basis for resentencing Scott. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315-18 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that district courts do not have authority to modify a piisoner\u2019s sentence, except to the extent provided by federal statutory provisions controlling sentencing and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Known as the federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, \u00a7 3559 became effective on September 13, 1994. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 70001, 108 Stat. 1796, 1982-84 (1994). Under \u00a7 3559, a defendant is subject to a mandatory life term of imprisonment if he has certain prior convictions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c). Pursuant to subsection (c)(7), a defendant may be resentenced if a prior conviction that \u201cwas a basis for sentencing\u201d under \u00a7 3559 is overturned as unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Scott\u2019s prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction was the basis for a penalty enhancement under \u00a7 924(c), not for a life sentence under \u00a7 3559(c). Indeed, Scott was sentenced in April 1994, before the three-strikes law became effective, and could not have been sentenced under that law. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Scott\u2019s \u00a7 3559(c)(7) motion. <em>See United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">B. Other Post-Conviction Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Federal courts have \u201can obligation to look behind the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). In Scott\u2019s case, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 does not provide authority for modifying Scott\u2019s sentence because (1) Scott\u2019s motion was not filed within seven days after sentencing and (2) the government has not filed a motion to reduce Scott\u2019s sentence based on substantial assistance. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(a), (b). Additionally, none of the conditions for reducing an inmate\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 are met. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A), (c)(2) (permitting a district court to modify a prison term if the Director of the Bureau of Prisons moves for a sentence reduction or if the defendant\u2019s guidelines range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Even construing Scott\u2019s motion as one filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255, Scott would not be entitled to relief because his motion is time-barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court already rejected Scott\u2019s argument that his attorney\u2019s death and his failure to receive notice of the disposition of his direct appeal prevented his 1998 letter motion from being time-barred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, that re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>suit is correct and would apply with equal force to Scott\u2019s 2007 motion at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is subject to a one-year statute of limitations that begins to run from the latest of four events, the relevant trigger in this case being the date on which Scott\u2019s judgment of conviction became final. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). Scott\u2019s conviction became final 90 days after this Court affirmed his conviction on December 8, 1994. <em>See Clay v. United States, </em>587 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1076, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Because Scott\u2019s conviction became final before the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), he had until April 23, 1997, to file his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Goodman v. United States, </em>151 F.3d 1335, 1337 (11th Cir.1998). Scott filed the motion now on appeal almost 10 years after the limitations period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The one-year statute of limitations in the AEDPA \u201ccan be equitably tolled where a petitioner untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1443, 170 L.Ed.2d 277 (2008). \u201cThe burden of establishing entitlement to this extraordinary remedy plainly rests with the petitioner[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Even assuming Scott\u2019s allegations are true, he has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances that were \u201cunavoidable even with diligence.\u201d According to Scott, at the time of his April 1994 sentencing, he was unaware that his 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction had been vacated. On August 1, 1994, Scott wrote to his attorney asking for a copy of the appeal brief filed on his behalf and other materials relating to his case. On August 23, 1994, Scott\u2019s attorney responded, advising Scott that he had just filed the appeal brief and that he would send copies of all briefs filed once the briefing schedule had been completed. The attorney also stated that he would be in touch as soon as he heard anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">By October 25, 1994, Scott apparently had learned that his 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction was vacated because on that date he wrote to his attorney asking that the issue be raise in his direct appeal. The attorney did not respond to Scott\u2019s letter or Scott\u2019s other attempts to contact him. Scott did not receive a copy of the appeal brief filed on his behalf and did not know whether his attorney had raised the 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction issue in his appeal. Scott heard nothing further from his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">After waiting almost four years, in July 1998, Scott asked his daughter to try to locate his attorney. After making a series of phone calls, Scott\u2019s daughter reported that Scott\u2019s attorney died on October 13, 1994, and that this Court affirmed his convictions and sentences on December 8, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">The extraordinary circumstances Scott points to are his attorney\u2019s death, which resulted in Scott failing to learn that the \u00a7 924(c) conviction issue had not been raised on direct appeal and that his conviction had been affirmed. Even assuming these circumstances could be considered \u201cextraordinary,\u201d Scott has not alleged facts showing that he acted with the requisite diligence. <em>See Downs v. McNeil, </em>520 F.3d 1311, 1323 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that in addition to extraordinary circumstances, the petitioner also must show that he exercised due diligence to ensure his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>petition was timely filed); <em>Johnson v. Florida Dep\u2019t of Com., </em>518 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201cattorney negligence is not a basis for equitable tolling, especially when the petitioner cannot establish his own diligence in ascertaining the federal habeas filing deadline\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Although the diligence requirement \u201cdoes not require a prisoner to undertake repeated exercises in futility or to exhaust every imaginable option,\u201d it does require him to \u201cmake reasonable efforts.\u201d <em>Downs, </em>520 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">If the facts Scott has alleged are true, Scott knew by October 25, 1994, that the 1977 \u00a7 924(c) conviction supporting his sentencing enhancement had been vacated. He also knew that his attorney already had filed his appeal brief in August 1994 and had promised to send him copies of the briefs once briefing concluded. Yet, when he did not hear from his attorney or receive copies of the briefs, Scott did nothing for over three-and-a-half years. During that period, the AEDPA took effect, and the one-year limitations period expired on April 23, 1997. Only a year-and-a-half after the limitations period expired did Scott ask his daughter to locate his attorney and determine the status of his direct criminal appeal. Thus, Scott did not make reasonable efforts to ascertain in a timely manner the status of his direct criminal appeal or his federal habeas filing deadline and is not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. Accordingly, Scott\u2019s 2007 motion, filed almost ten years after the one-year limitations period expired, is time-barred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\">. In 1977, Scott was found guilty in federal court of bank robbery, conspiracy to commit bank robbery and possession of a sawed off shotgun and sentenced to a term of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-17\">. In 1998, \u00a7 924(c) was amended to provide for a 25-year statutory minimum for a defendant with a prior \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Pub.L. No. 105-386, \u00a7 1(a)(1), 112 Stat. 3469, 3469 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. Section 3559 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">If the conviction for a serious violent felony or serious drug offense that <em>was a basis for sentencing </em>under this subsection is found, pursuant to any appropriate State or Federal procedure, to be unconstitutional or is vitiated on the explicit basis of innocence, or if the convicted person is pardoned on the explicit basis of innocence, the person serving a sentence imposed under this subsection shall be resentenced to any sentence that was available at the time of the original sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">. Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court warned Scott of the potential consequences of construing his 1998 letter as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Shortly after the district court denied Scott\u2019s construed \u00a7 2255 motion, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Castro v. United States </em>that a court cannot recharacterize a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first \u00a7 2255 motion unless the court first informs the litigant of its intent to do so and warns the litigant of the restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. 540 U.S. 375, 377, 124 S.Ct. 786, 789, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). This raises the issue of whether <em>Castro </em>applies retroactively to preclude triggering the restriction on successive motions. However, we need not answer this question because, even if Scott\u2019s 2007 motion is construed as a first \u00a7 2255 motion, it is time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\">. In his objections to the August 1998 R&amp;R concluding that Scott\u2019s letter motion was time-barred, Scott argued what he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>now \u2014 that his attorney's death prevented him from learning that his conviction had been affirmed on appeal without the \u00a7 924(c) conviction issue being raised. The district court overruled Scott's objections and adopted the R&amp;R, thus rejecting Scott\u2019s tolling argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">. Scott\u2019s motion cannot be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 motion filed under the \u201csavings clause\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because his claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir.1999). Nor would Scott be entitled to relief pursuant to a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>or a writ of <em>audita querela.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
