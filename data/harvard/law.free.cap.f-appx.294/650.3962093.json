Following a hearing and review of the record, Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) David Z. Nisnewitz concluded that Apple-whaite had not demonstrated that she was entitled to greater benefits or that the amount previously paid to her was incorrect. The district court determined that the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Although we appreciate Applewhaite\u2019s frustrations in dealing over the years with the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d), we ultimately conclude that the final agency ruling is not infected by legal error and is supported by substantial evidence. On appeal, Applewhaite contends that SSA improperly (1) deprived her of a lump-sum payment of $6,460 due to her upon retirement in July 1996; (2) reduced her monthly benefit payment by $50 starting in August 1996; (3) \u201cunjustly appropriated at least $2,184.00\u201d of her benefits in 1997; (4) failed to give her credit for her 1995 earnings, except for a one-time payment of $400; (5) failed to give her credit for the eight months she worked beyond retirement age; and (6) failed to give her \u201can extra $16.00 (the primary insurance amount).... \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. In sum, Applewhaite alleges that the SSA owes her a total of approximately $23,000 for under-payments dating back to July 1996 and that her current benefit payment, now $1,113 per month, is $119 too low. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\u201cOur review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination is narrow. We may set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision only if it is based on legal error, or if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Bubnis v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 177, 181 (2d Cir.1998) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g)). Both the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and the Commissioner\u2019s brief on appeal explain how the SSA initially miscalculated and eventually corrected Applewhaite\u2019s benefit payments, resulting in an appropriate aggregate disbursement to Applewhaite under the Social Security Act. Applewhaite identifies no error in these explanations <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; instead, she repeats her allegations that the SSA falsified the record documents, <em>see e.g., </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2 (\u201cSocial Security ... proceeded to cover up its unlawful actions by falsifying the computer record ----\u201d), and that individual SSA disbursements were incorrect, <em>see id. passim. </em>The ALJ\u2019s finding that \u201cany allegation of record falsification is unsubstantiated\u201d is supported by substantial evidence \u2014 indeed, there is no evidence to the contrary \u2014 and Applewhaite\u2019s allegations relating to erroneous individual benefit payments are somewhat beside the point. The Commissioner concedes that the SSA issued erroneous benefit payments to Applewhaite in certain months. <em>See e.g., </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8-9. The determinative point is that these errors were corrected so that, in the end, Applewhaite received the aggregate amount to which she is statutorily entitled. We do not repeat the district court\u2019s calculations supporting this determination, which we have reviewed carefully and adopt as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-25\">. Applewhaite was represented by counsel before the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. Although Applewhaite faults certain aspects of the district court's opinion, <em>see </em>Appellant's Br. at 6, 21-22; Reply Br. at 14, she does not indicate how its aggregate calculations are incorrect. <em>See </em>Mem. &amp; Order, No. 05-CV-1470 (CBA) at 5-6 (Nov. 21, 2006) (concluding, e.g., that \"although Applewhaite's 1996 and 1997 benefits payments were individually incorrect, in the aggregate she was paid all of the benefits owed to her\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
