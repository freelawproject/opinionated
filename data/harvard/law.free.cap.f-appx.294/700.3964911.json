For the reasons below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">In February 1992, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Stocker to forty years in prison and eight years special parole for his conviction on drug charges. On August 29, 2006, the District Court granted Stocker\u2019s motion for correction of an illegal sentence in part and dismissed one count of the indictment without prejudice. On December 18, 2006, Stocker filed a counseled motion for a reduction in sentence under former Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction, and Stocker filed a timely notice of appeal. Now proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he has also filed motions for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Idone, </em>38 F.3d 693, 695 (3d Cir. 1994). The District Court was correct that it lacked jurisdiction to reduce Stocker\u2019s sentence under former Rule 35(b). Former Rule 35(b) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a] motion to reduce a sentence may be made ... within 120 days after the sentence is imposed.\u201d The dismissal of one count in August 2006 was not an imposition of sentence which triggered the 120-day period to file a motion under former Rule 35(b). <em>See United States v. Ferri, </em>686 F.2d 147 (3d Cir.l982)(Order reducing sentence was not an imposition of sentence triggering the time to file a Rule 35(b) motion). The District Court was correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>that it lacked jurisdiction to modify the sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6. Stocker\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-18\">. Because Stocker\u2019s crimes were committed before November 1, 1987, the former version of Rule 35 is still applicable to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
