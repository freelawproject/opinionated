He argues that the Government waived jurisdiction of its right to execute his sentence due to its excessive delay in taking him into federal custody. He argues that after sentencing, he was taken to Calcasieu Correctional Center on April 15, 2003; he remained there until May 14, 2007, when he was transferred to a federal prison; he was not in federal custody during this time; and he did not receive credit toward his federal sentence for the time he served in Calcasieu Correctional Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Because Fuselier is challenging the execution of his sentence, a \u00a7 2241 petition is proper. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cIn the context of a \u00a7 2241 petition, this court reviews the district court\u2019s determinations of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Fuselier\u2019s claim is not supported by the record. Fuselier was sentenced to a total of 13 years and one month. In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Fuselier argued that he was not in federal custody while he was at Calcasieu Correctional Center and attached as exhibit A a document containing a handwritten notation that Fuselier \u201carrived in BOP custody at USP Pollock on 05/14/2007.\u201d Exhibit A apparently indicates the date on which Fuselier was physically transferred to the federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana. Fuselier\u2019s exhibit B, which was also attached to his objections, shows that he was held in continuous custody at Calcasieu Correctional Center from April 15, 2003, to January 8, 2007, as the state charges were dismissed in lieu of federal prosecution on April 15, 2003. It also shows that Fuselier\u2019s projected release date is March 5, 2014. This release date indicates that Fuselier was given credit toward his federal sentence for the time he served in Cal-casieu Correctional Center. Therefore, the record shows that the Government did not delay the execution of Fuselier\u2019s federal sentence and, therefore, the Government did not waive jurisdiction of its right to execute his sentence. The district court did not err in determining that Fuselier was not entitled to federal habeas relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Fuselier has also filed a letter and attached a document from the United States Marshals Service Prisoner Tracking System, which he argues supports his claim. Because Fuselier presented this evidence for the first time on appeal, we may not consider it. <em>See Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir. 1999). To the extent that Fuselier\u2019s letter concerning the new evidence may be construed as a motion to supplement the record on appeal, it is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
