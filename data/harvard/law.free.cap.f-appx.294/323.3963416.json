R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b350-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Todor Nedyalkov Dimitrov, a native and citizen of Bulgaria, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his motion to continue. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance, <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), and de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings, <em>id. </em>We dismiss the petition for review in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">To the extent Dimitrov challenges United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denial of the visa petition filed on Dimitrov\u2019s behalf, we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Elbez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1313, 1314 (9th Cir.1985) (visa petition decisions are collateral matters \u201cnot within the scope of a deportation proceeding, and therefore not reviewable by the Court of Appeals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">Contrary to Dimitrov\u2019s contentions challenging the nature and sufficiency of the evidence of the visa petition denial, the IJ acted within his discretion in denying Dimitrov\u2019s motion to continue because Dimitrov\u2019s counsel advised the IJ that US-CIS intended to deny the visa petition. <em>See Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1247 (IJ\u2019s denial of an additional continuance was within discretion where relief was not immediately available to petitioner); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (an IJ may grant a continuance for good cause shown); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1240.8(d) (alien bears burden of proving eligibility for relief from removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Therefore, Dimitrov has not established that the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to continue violated his due process rights. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">The IJ granted Dimitrov voluntary departure and ordered him removed to Bulgaria if he did not post a voluntary departure bond. Dimitrov does not dispute that he failed to post the bond and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>does not explain why. Therefore, the BIA did not violate due process in enforcing the alternate removal order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(8) (\u201cIf the bond is not posted within 5 business days, the voluntary departure order shall vacate automatically and the alternate order of removal will take effect on the following day.\u201d); <em>see also Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1246 (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We grant the government\u2019s motion to withdraw its argument that we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b350-13\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
