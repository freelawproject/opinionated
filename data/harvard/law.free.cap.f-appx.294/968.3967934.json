For the \u00a7 1324 offense, the district court departed upward to 46 months from the guidelines range of 24 to 30 months and then imposed a consecutive nine-month term of imprisonment as the revocation sentence. Soberanis-Gomez challenges the sentence as unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), employing an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 808 (5th Cir.2008). Our review is bifurcated; we look first to whether the court committed procedural error and, if not, to whether the sentence was reasonable. <em>Williams, </em>517 F.3d at 808. A sentencing court does not abuse its discretion in deciding to depart upwardly when its reasons for doing so (1) advance the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2); and (2) are justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 249-50 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-17\">The district court\u2019s departure was based on uncharged conduct, specifically unlawful reentry, which the Government agreed not to pursue as part of Soberanis-Gomez\u2019s plea agreement. The sentence of 46 months was at the low end of the range that would have applied if Soberanis-Go-mez had been convicted of unlawful reentry. Soberanis-Gomez argues that the district court\u2019s sentence undermined his plea agreement and ignored the benefits that his early, pre-indictment plea conferred. He also argues that the court failed to consider his argument that his criminal history was not substantially under-represented, given that he received six points for the prior conviction; that there was nothing extraordinary about his case; and that the sentence imposed was substantially greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-18\">The district court did not err in departing upward based on uncharged conduct dismissed as part of a plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Newsom, </em>508 F.3d 731, 734 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 807-08 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc). Further, the district court noted that it had considered Soberanis-Gomez\u2019s prior drug conviction, the circumstances of the instant offense, his personal circumstances, and the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). The court concluded that the case warranted a departure. We find no procedural error in the decision to depart upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">With respect to the degree of departure and the sentence as a whole, the sentence of 46 months did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Newsom, </em>508 F.3d at 735. We also reject the argument that the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>secutive nine-month revocation sentence rendered the entire sentence unreasonable. That sentence was within the guidelines range, and the advisory Guidelines provide for consecutive sentencing in the revocation context. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b995-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
