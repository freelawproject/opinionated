He has been detained by the Department of Homeland Security for more than three years during the pendency of proceedings to remove him from the United States. Makaj argues this prolonged detention is unconstitutional. His appeal of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal is currently pending before this court. The district court denied Makaj\u2019s petition for habeas relief. We vacate the judgment and remand to the district court, in accordance with the joint motion now filed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The relief available to Makaj depends in part upon which statute governs his detention. <em>See Prieto-Romero v. Clark, </em>534 F.3d 1053, 1057-62 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Casas-Castrillon v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, </em>535 F.3d 942, 944-45 (9th Cir.2008). The government argues that Makaj is detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, but that argument fails because it defies the plain language of the statute. <em>See PrietoRomero, </em>534 F.3d at 1058-61. Makaj was initially detained pursuant 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c), which requires mandatory detention of criminal aliens. However, \u00a7 1226(c) only applies to the \u201cexpedited removal of criminal aliens.\u201d <em>Casas-Castrillon, </em>535 F.3d at 951 (quoting <em>Tijani v. Willis, </em>430 F.3d 1241, 1242 (9th Cir.2005)). After the completion of Makaj\u2019s proceedings before the BIA, the Attorney General\u2019s authority to detain him shifted to \u00a7 1226(a), which \u201cgives the Attorney General general discretionary authority to detain an alien \u2018pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">Makaj argues that his detention is not statutorily authorized because it is prolonged and indefinite. While Makaj\u2019s detention of more than three years is certainly prolonged, it is not indefinite. <em>Prieto-Romero, </em>534 F.3d at 1062-63. Makaj <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>faces a significant likelihood of removal upon completion of the judicial and administrative review process in his case. If withholding of removal is ultimately denied, there is nothing to prevent Makaj\u2019s removal to Albania. <em>See Casas-Castrillon, </em>535 F.3d at 949 (\u201c[Tjhere is nothing, such as a lack of a repatriation agreement with his home country or a finding that he merits mandatory relief from removal, that prevents Casas\u2019 removal to Columbia, if he ultimately fails in fighting the government\u2019s charge of removability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Finally, although Makaj\u2019s detention is statutorily authorized, due process requires the government to provide him with an individualized hearing to determine whether his continued detention is <em>necessary. See id. </em>at 949-51. Makaj\u2019s previous reviews fall \u201cfar shoi\u2019t of the procedural protections afforded in ordinary bond hearings, where aliens may contest the necessity of their detention before an immigration judge and have an opportunity to appeal that determination to the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951-52. The pending joint motion to vacate and remand is granted. Therefore, we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to grant the writ unless Makaj is provided \u201ca hearing ... before an Immigration Judge with the power to grant him bail unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tijani, </em>430 F.3d at 1242).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b355-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
