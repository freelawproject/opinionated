(Kira), appeals the district court\u2019s judgment awarding costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants-appellees, All Star Maintenance, Inc., All Star Management, LLC, and Sundt&gt;-Actus-Bland Company (collectively, defendants). In its appeal, Kira argues only that the district court did not have jurisdiction to rule on defendants\u2019 post-trial fee motion because the court had denied defendants\u2019 initial fee motion in its November 1, 2006 Final Judgment, which was already on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Kira filed suit against defendants in late 2003, and a jury found unanimously for defendants in September of 2006. On October 6, 2006, defendants filed two separate motions: (1) a Motion for Entry of Judgment and for Final Order of Judgement and (2) a Motion for Costs and Attorneys\u2019 Fees. On November 1, 2006, the district court granted defendants\u2019 Motion for Entry of Judgment and for Final Order of Judgment. The order, entitled \u201cMemorandum Opinion and Order on Motions for Judgment\u201d explicitly stated that plaintiffs Motion for Judgment and defendants\u2019 Motion For Entry Of Judgment And For A Final Order Of Judgment were before the court; it did not, however, mention defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. The court also issued a Final Judgment ordering that Kira take nothing and closed with the customary conclusion: \u201call relief not expressly granted is hereby DENIED ... [and] the case is hereby CLOSED.\u201d Like the Memorandum Opinion, the Final Judgment did not address or mention the fee motion or the matter of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Kira filed a Notice of Appeal on November 13, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 15th, defendants submitted an amended motion for costs and attorneys fees. In its response, Kira argued that the Final Judgment denied defendants\u2019 fee motion, and, consequently, the filing of Kira\u2019s appeal divested the district court of jurisdiction to rule on the amended fee motion. In a December 1, 2006 order, the district court considered Kira\u2019s responsive pleadings along with defendants\u2019 fee motion. In reciting the case\u2019s history, the December 1st order stated, \u201c[t]he Final Judgment denied Defendants\u2019 motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d However, the order goes on to say: \u201cDefendants\u2019 amended motion reurging their prejudgment request for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees is properly before the Court and the Court will address the merits of the motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">On June 27, 2007, the district court entered an order granting defendants\u2019 fee motion, and on August 22, 2007, it entered an order denying Kira\u2019s motion to vacate the fee award, explaining that the November 1 Memorandum Opinion and Final Judgment did not act on or discuss defendants\u2019 fee motion. While the court did not refer back to its December 1st statement that the fees had been denied, the district court stated that \u201cnothing impeded or deprived [its] authority to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and decide Defendants\u2019 fee motions.\u201d Based on all the above, this court is convinced that the statement in the December 1st order concerning the November 1 judgment having denied the fee request was an inadvertent mistake and an unintentional characterization of the November 1 Final Judgment. This is the only reasonable interpretation possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Proceeding on the determination that the district court had not yet ruled on the fee motion, the district court retained jurisdiction over defendants\u2019 motion. Kira\u2019s Notice of Appeal did not divest the district court of jurisdiction because defendants\u2019 fee motion constituted a collateral matter that was unrelated to the appeal\u2019s underlying claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Creations Unlimited, Inc. v. McCain, </em>112 F.3d 814, 816-17 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cA district court has jurisdiction to rule on a motion for ancillary attorneys\u2019 fees even after the filing of a notice of appeal with respect to the underlying claims\u201d); <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>280 F.3d 519, 524-25 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe district court, however, retains jurisdiction to resolve motions for sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees while a judgement on the merits is pending on appeal. Such motions are collateral to the merits, so the appeal does not divest the district court of jurisdiction.\u201d). A district court has plenary authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to a motion filed within fourteen days of entry of judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(B). It is undisputed that defendants\u2019 fee motion was timely; thus, the district court retained jurisdiction over defendants\u2019 fee motion as a collateral matter, regardless of Kira\u2019s pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Additionally, defendants\u2019 <em>conditional </em>Notice of Cross-Appeal did not divest the district court of jurisdiction. After Kira filed in the district court a response to defendants\u2019 November 15 amended motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, contending that the November 1 judgment had denied defendants\u2019 earlier motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, defendants on November 27 filed a cross-appeal from the November 1 judgment if and only to the extent that that judgment was construed to deny defendants\u2019 costs and fees. Defendants\u2019 said cross-appeal was expressly conditioned on the November 1 Final Judgment being interpreted (contrary to defendants\u2019 contentions) to deny defendants\u2019 fee motion. After that notice of appeal was filed, the district court held that the fee issue remained before it and granted the November 15 fee motion on June 27, 2007. In reliance on the court\u2019s June 27th Order, defendants filed in this court a Motion for Voluntary Dismissal of Cross-Appeal, which this court granted on July 11, 2007. This voluntary dismissal placed defendants in the exact position as if a notice of appeal had never been filed. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 420, 422 (5th Cir. 1977) (\u201cThe appellants here did timely file a notice of appeal, but then had it dismissed before it had been docketed. In our view, this placed them in the same position as if they had never filed a notice of appeal in the first place.\u201d). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the voluntary dismissal of the November 27 conditional appeal did not divest the district court of jurisdiction over the November 15 fee motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that the district court had jurisdiction to rule on defendants\u2019 fee motion, and the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">. Kira\u2019s said appeal was related to the merits of the Final Judgment. The appeal was addressed by this Court in an opinion issued February 26, 2008, and the district court\u2019s judgment was affirmed (our cause No. 06-51650). The mandate therein has issued:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. This rule does not conflict with Rule 58(e), which allows a district court, in its discretion, to delay an entry of judgment if both (1) a notice of appeal has not been filed and (2) a timely motion for attorneys\u2019 fees has been made. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(e); <em>Burnley v. City of San Antonio, </em>470 F.3d 189, 198 (5th Cir. 2006). The Rule's purpose is to increase judicial efficiency by enabling an appellate court to consider an appeal related to a fee award and an appeal related to the merits at the same time. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(e) advisory committee's notes (1993 Amendments). The Rule does not, however, <em>deprive a district court </em>of jurisdiction over a fee motion upon the filing of a merits-based appeal merely because the district court did <em>not </em>enter a Rule 58(e) order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
