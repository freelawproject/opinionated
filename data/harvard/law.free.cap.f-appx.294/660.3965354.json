Straus denying his application for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Wayne Johnson, </em>No. A23 456 801 (B.I.A. Jan. 10, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>A23 456 801 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Sept. 26, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">As an initial matter, because Johnson was found deportable on criminal grounds, our review is limited to constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); <em>Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir.2007). While Johnson\u2019s brief to this Court does not assert that his challenges to the agency\u2019s decisions present \u201cquestions of law\u201d over which we may exercise jurisdiction, his argument that the agency misapplied the standard for CAT eligibility is reviewable, even though it is ultimately without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>31, 35 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Johnson argues that the IJ erred in his analysis of whether Jamaican officials would \u201cacquiesce\u201d to his torture by ignoring the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard articulated by this Court in <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004). Johnson fails to acknowledge that the IJ discussed the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard with his attorney at his merits hearing, and that the IJ properly took note of that standard in his decision. He similarly fails to acknowledge that the BIA explicitly discussed <em>Khouzam </em>and \u201cwillful blindness\u201d before concluding, like the IJ, that even if credible, Johnson had not established eligibility for relief. Considering this record, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the agency failed to apply the proper standard when evaluating Johnson\u2019s CAT eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In light of the foregoing, we deny Johnson\u2019s petition for review to the extent it raises a question of law over which we have jurisdiction, and dismiss the remaining portions of the petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Khan, </em>495 F.3d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-15\">. We decline to consider whether Johnson\u2019s challenges to the agency's adverse credibility determination present \"questions of law\u201d because the agency explicitly found that, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>he were credible, he had not established eligibility for deferral of deportation under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
