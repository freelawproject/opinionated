She argues that her guidelines sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that her guidelines sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Cervantes-Quintero argues that her guidelines sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not \u201cempirically supported.\u201d As she did not raise this argument in the district court, it is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir. 2005). Cervantes-Quintero has failed to show plain error. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Accordingly, Cervantes-Quintero\u2019s within guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable, and she has failed to overcome that presumption. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. To the extent Cervantes-Quintero argues that her sentence is unreasonable based upon the factors she presented to the district court, we discern no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Cervantes-Quintero challenges the sentence imposed for her conviction by questioning the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. As Cervantes-Quintero concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
