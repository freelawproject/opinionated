Myers appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion for relief from judgment. The district court denied Myers\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion, which raised several claims, but awarded a certificate of appealability on one issue: whether the public safety exception to the warrant requirement authorized the <em>pre-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>questioning of Myers about the location of a firearm used in a murder. We deny relief and affirm as to this issue, and dismiss Myers\u2019 appeal as to all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-24\">In an appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 267 (4th Cir. 2007). In order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To satisfy the second prong, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>must show there is a reasonable probability that his attorney\u2019s errors altered the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Having reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s decision, we conclude that Myers cannot establish that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek suppression of the seized evidence on the basis of the alleged Fifth Amendment violation. Thus, we affirm the portion of the district court\u2019s order rejecting this claim for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Myers, </em>Nos. 3:00-cr-00062; 3:03-cv-02220-3, 2005 WL 1924395 (S.D.W.Va. Aug. 11, 2005). We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal as to all other issues raised in Myers\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b95-17\"><em> Miranda v.
