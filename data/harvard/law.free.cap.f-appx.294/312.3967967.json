Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The immigration judge pretermitted Atrixco\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT on the basis that she \u201crepeatedly stated she\u2019s not scared of going back to her country based on one of the five grounds and she did not feel she would be persecuted if she goes back to her country.\u201d The IJ granted Atrixco\u2019s application for voluntary departure. The Board summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on November 5, 2004. Atrixco filed her motion to reopen on February 10, 2006, outside the 90-day limit set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). <em>See He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128,1131 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Atrixco contends that the Board erred in denying her motion as untimely because she gave a reasonable explanation for failing to file it earlier in that she only recently became aware of \u201cwidespread torture\u201d that had been covered up by the government of Mexico. As stated by the Board, Atrixco did not present material evidence of changed country conditions that was not available and could not have been presented on a timely basis. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>He, </em>501 F.3d at 1131-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
