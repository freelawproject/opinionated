A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Kel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ley has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of ap-pealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b28-15\"> Although Kelley also filed a notice of appeal challenging the district court\u2019s separate order dismissing his post-judgment motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Kelley does not address the district court\u2019s dismissal of that motion in his informal brief and has therefore waived appellate review of that order. <em>See </em>Local Rule 34(b) (\"The Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
