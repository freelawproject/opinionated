Thomas claims that the statutory mandatory minimum penalties prescribed in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) create an unconstitutional disparity between crimes involving powder cocaine and crimes involving crack cocaine, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See </em>21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii); (B)(ii), (ni) (five-year mandatory minimum sentence for five grams of crack cocaine or 500 grams of powder cocaine; ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for fifty grams of crack cocaine or 5000 grams of powder cocaine). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">This court has repeatedly rejected claims that the sentencing disparity between cocaine powder and cocaine base violates either the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause. <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 876-77 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>58 F.3d 96, 99-100 (4th Cir.1995). To the extent Thomas seeks to have this court reconsider these decisions, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can do that.\u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Furthermore, the recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines have no effect on the constitutionality or applicability of the statutory mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a75G1.1(b) (2007); <em>Neal v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 284, 294, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Thomas\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is also misplaced. <em>Kimbrough\u2019s </em>holding that district courts are permitted to disagree with the policies underlying the Sentencing Guidelines is unrelated to the constitutionality of the statutory sentencing disparity. The Court in <em>Kimbrough </em>neither found \u00a7 841\u2019s penalty provisions unconstitutional nor overruled this court\u2019s previous holdings rejecting constitutional challenges to the 100:1 ratio. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 572 (sentencing courts need not \u201cadhere to the 100-to-l ratio for crack cocaine quantities <em>other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences </em>\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\"> On November 1, 2007, the United States Sentencing Commission lowered the base offense level for drug offenses involving crack cocaine. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D 1.1 (2007); USSG Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706. Amendment 706 was made retroactive, effective March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (Mar. 3, 2008); <em>see also United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
