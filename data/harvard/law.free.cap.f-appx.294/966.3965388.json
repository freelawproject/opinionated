Gonzalez\u2019s application was rejected on the basis that Gonzalez had not been continuously physically present in the United States for ten years prior to the filing of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-19\">This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). In the instant case, the BIA relied in part on the IJ\u2019s analysis in determining whether Gonzalez was entitled to relief. Thus, consideration of the IJ\u2019s decision is appropriate. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">The Attorney General has the authority to cancel removal of an inadmissible or removable alien who, inter alia, \u201chas been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years\u201d immediately preceding the date upon which the alien applied for cancellation of removal. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). An alien fails to maintain the necessary continuous physical presence if he has \u201cdeparted from the United States for any period in excess of 90 days.\u201d \u00a7 1229b(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">Whether Gonzalez had been continually present for a period of not less than ten years prior to his application is a factual determination that is subject to this court\u2019s review. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). This court reviews the IJ\u2019s factual conclusions regarding whether Gonzalez established ten years of continuous presence for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis Court must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports his factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to succeed on appeal, Gonza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>lez must provide \u201cevidence so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Questions of law are reviewed by this court de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The IJ based the denial upon Gonzalez\u2019s testimony that he had left the United States and stayed in Mexico for a period of three-and-a-half or four months in 1998, such that Gonzalez had failed to maintain continuous physical presence pursuant to \u00a7 1229(b)(d)(2). Gonzalez denies neither that he so testified nor that the 1998 trip fell within the ten year period relevant to determining whether he qualifies for cancellation of removal. Rather, Gonzalez argues that the IJ erred in basing the denial of relief solely upon Gonzalez\u2019s testimony because Gonzalez\u2019s memory of events occurring in 1998 was not clear at the time he testified. The record does not support Gonzalez\u2019s argument. Although over the course of his testimony Gonzalez slightly revised the length of his 1998 stay in Mexico, he never testified that he could not accurately remember the details of the trip in question. He has thus failed to show that the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Gonzalez also argues that his 1998 trip did not interrupt his continuous physical presence in the United States because his departure to Mexico was not precipitated by a formal removal or voluntary departure order, citing for support <em>In re Avilez-Nava, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 799, 800-01 (BIA 2005). As the BIA noted in its rejection of Gonzalez\u2019s appeal, the holding of <em>Avilez-Nava </em>was specifically limited to an applicant whose departure from the United States was not of sufficient length to interrupt his continuous physical presence in the United States pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(d)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 800 (referring to \u00a7 1229b(d)(2) as Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 240A(d)(2)). Because Gonzalez was absent from the United States for a period of over ninety days, and thereby interrupted his continuous physical presence pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(d)(2), his case is distinguishable from <em>Avilez-Nava.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Finally, Gonzalez contends that the IJ was required to consider factors beyond Gonzalez\u2019s lack of continuous presence in the United States before denying his application. This court has indicated that, when an alien has failed to show continuous physical presence as required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A), further analysis is unnecessary before relief may be properly denied. <em>See Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b993-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
