We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-22\">Arora began working for Starwood Hotels in 1990 as a banquet manager. He was promoted to the position of Director of Banquets and Outlets in 2004. In 2005, Starwood discharged Arora, along with three other assistant banquet managers, following an investigation into alleged misconduct that occurred in the administration of the company\u2019s 2005 annual employment satisfaction survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-23\">Arora sued Starwood alleging his discharge was in violation of Title VII and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Title VII and the TCHRA make it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>hire or to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arora is originally from India, is a naturalized United States citizen, and, at the time of his discharge, was 47 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Summary judgment is proper when the \u201cpleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When making its determination, the court must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Under the <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> framework, Arora is required to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing: (1) he is within a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position, (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision, and (4) he was replaced by someone outside the protected class or treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside the protected class.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">The district court ruled that Arora failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case because he did not raise a material fact issue as to the fourth element; whether he was replaced by someone outside the protected class or treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Starwood replaced Arora with Ian McKee. The only evidence raised to show McKee was outside the protected class was unsupported statements in Arora\u2019s briefs, and Arora\u2019s own declaration and deposition testimony. The summary judgment record did not include any other basis for determining McKee\u2019s race or age. Arora admits his allegations are not based on first-hand knowledge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-19\">Unsubstantiated hearsay evidence that would not be admissible at trial does not suffice to raise a genuine issue of material fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Arora\u2019s failure to produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>competent summary judgment evidence regarding the race or age of his replacement, when evidence of this nature was readily ascertainable through discovery, precludes him from establishing an issue of fact as to whether he was replaced by someone outside the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We also agree with the district court that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Arora was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside the protected class. Arora was discharged along with two other banquet department employees implicated in the survey incident. One was 26 years old and Caucasian, the other 34 years old and Indian. Additionally, two other banquet department employees were investigated but not terminated, one of whom was Indian and one of whom was the same age as Arora. This evidence indicates Arora was treated on par with similarly situated employees that were younger and Caucasian.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Arora failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the fourth element of a <em>prima facie </em>discrimination claim. Accordingly, the district court did not err by granting Starwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment on those claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The district court also did not err in granting Starwood\u2019s summary judgment motion regarding Arora\u2019s retaliation claim. Both Title VII and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act prohibit discrimination against employees who have opposed an unlawful employment practice, or made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the employment practices statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Arora failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. He raised no genuine issue of material fact as to whether he engaged in an activity protected by Title VII.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Arora alleges he told supervisors that an employee was drinking at the bar without paying and that two managers were engaging in sexually provocative behavior. While ungainly, the complained about behavior does not involve an employee being treated unfairly due to race or sex, thus the complaints are not protected activity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
