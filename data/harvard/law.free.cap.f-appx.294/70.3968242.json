Bond appeals the district court\u2019s rulings dismissing his dual actions filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). In Case No. 07-1720, Bond appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration of the judgment in his underlying copyright action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court reviews the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See MLC Automotive, LLC v. Town of Southern Pines, </em>532 F.3d 269, 277 (4th Cir.2008). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Bond v. Blum, </em>No. l:01-cv-02600-MJG (D.Md. July 12, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In Case No. 08-1171, Bond appeals from the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his \u201cindependent action\u201d under Rule 60(b), in which Bond sought monetary damages for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), and other federal statutes. We have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not err in dismissing Bond\u2019s action. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Bond v. Blum, </em>No. l:07-cv-01385-JFM (D. Md. June 26, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">While we grant Bond\u2019s motion to supplement his informal brief in Case No. 07-1720, we deny all other pending motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-11\">. <em>See Bond v. Blum, </em>317 F.3d 385 (4th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\">. Bond also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a number of other post-judgment motions that were filed in this case, including a motion to recuse the presiding judge. Upon review of the record, we find there were no valid grounds for recusal and that the district court did not err in denying Bond\u2019s post-judgment motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
