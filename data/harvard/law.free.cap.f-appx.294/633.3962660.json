Jan-kun denying Danfakha\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Sambaly Danfakha, </em>No. A70 889 762 (B.I.A. Sep. 26, 2002), <em>affg </em>No. A70 889 762 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 5, 1999). Danfakha also seeks review of the November 8, 2007 order of the BIA denying his motion to reopen. <em>In re Sambaly Danfak-ha, </em>No. A70 889 762 (B.I.A. Nov. 8, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">I. Docket No. 07-4752-ag (L): Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Youg Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand, in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination, because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ reasonably found that Danfakha failed to credibly establish that he is from the Casamance region of Senegal. Indeed, Danfakha\u2019s original asylum application and the identity documents he submitted all stated that he is from the village of Tessan, in the region of Tambacounda. While Danfakha testified that his town is located on the border of the Casamance region, the IJ did not err in finding this explanation insufficient to overcome the discrepancy. <em>See, e.g., Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Indeed, Danfakha\u2019s claim was based on his assertion that he and his family were persecuted by Casa-mance rebels because of his Casamance origins. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). Thus, even if Danfakha is from a region that borders Casamance, the discrepancy is substantial when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The IJ also found that Danfakha t\u00e9sti-fied inconsistently with his amended application regarding: (1) whether his brother was kidnapped before or after their father\u2019s alleged death; (2) whether his mother disappeared during a 1985 rebel attack before he left Senegal; (3) whether his fiance\u00e9 was with him during the attack; and (4) whether it took him seven or fifteen days to reach Gambia after escaping from the rebels. In his brief to this Court, Danfakha concedes that these discrepancies \u201cclearly exist in the record.\u201d Thus, the IJ reasonably relied on them in sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>port of his adverse credibility finding, particularly as these findings are material to Danfakha\u2019s claim. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">While we agree with Danfakha as to one of the IJ\u2019s findings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> remand would be futile in this case, as we can confidently predict that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339. When considered as a whole, the agency\u2019s error-free findings provided substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Because the only evidence of a threat to Danfakha\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Finally, because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is dispos-itive of Danfakha\u2019s petition for review in Docket No. 07-4572-ag (L), we need not reach the IJ\u2019s alternate findings regarding relocation and resettlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">II. Docket No. 07-5338-ag (Con): Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">It is beyond dispute that Danfakha\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Furthermore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding he failed to show changed circumstances in Senegal that would excuse the untimely filing of his motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Indeed, Danfakha produced no evidence as to how country conditions in Senegal have changed since the BIA\u2019s September 2002 decision with respect to how those who oppose FGM are treated in Senegal. To the extent Danfak-ha claimed that threats from his family in Senegal constituted changed circumstances, the BIA did not err in finding that his assertions were too vague to support reopening. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94,110,108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (finding that a party seeking reopening bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Because the BIA\u2019s finding that Danfak-ha failed to show changed country conditions was alone sufficient to support the denial of his motion to reopen, we need not reach the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. <em>See Abudu, </em>485 U.S. at 105-06, 108 S.Ct. 904. Nonetheless, we note that we find record support for the BIA\u2019s observation that \u201cFGM has been illegal in Senegal since 1999, that the government has prosecuted those practicing FGM and has fought to end the practice with some success, and that FGM is less common in certain geographic areas in Senegal, including urban centers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the consolidated petitions for review are DENIED. The pending request for oral argument in these petitions is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. As Danfakha argues, there is no support in the record for the IJ\u2019s finding that he testified inconsistently regarding the details of his father\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
