Story\u2019s application for Disability Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d). Story challenged this determination in district court, and the district court affirmed. Story now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-24\">Story filed his application for DIB in 2005, alleging that blindness in his right eye had left him disabled since 2001. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) conducted a hearing and determined that Story did not suffer from a \u201csevere impairment,\u201d defeating Story\u2019s claim for DIB. The Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, rendering it the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Higginbotham v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 332, 336-37 (5th Cir.2005). Story sought review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court, adopting the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Story now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Onr review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) is limited to two areas of inquiry: (1) whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and (2) whether the Commissioner adhered to the proper legal standards when evaluating the evidence. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). A finding of substantial evidence will be reached if the evidence examined by the Commissioner \u201cis \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Story first contends that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Story\u2019s blindness was not a \u201csevere impairment.\u201d A severe impairment is one that \u201csignificantly limits [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1520(c). \u201cAn impairment can be considered not severe only if it is a slight abnormality [having] such minimal effects on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or work experience.\u201d <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099, 1101 (5th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">It is clear that Story is blind in his right eye and suffers some level of resulting pain and discomfort. However, the record also reveals that Story missed multiple medical appointments because he was <em>working </em>on construction jobs; admitted that his symptoms improved when he complied with treatment; and performed daily activities such as gardening, mowing the lawn, and walking to visit his relatives. Taken as a whole, this constitutes substantial evidence to support a finding that Story\u2019s impairment did not \u201csubstantially limit\u201d his ability to do \u201cbasic work activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Story also argues that the ALJ erred by failing to make explicit credibility findings as to Story\u2019s testimony on the effects of his eye impairment. While an ALJ must consider the credibility of a claimant\u2019s testimony, we do not require the ALJ to explicitly state his opinion on the veracity of each allegation. <em>See Haywood v. Sullivan, </em>888 F.2d 1463, 1469-70 (5th Cir.1989) (holding that the ALJ\u2019s consideration of a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony was sufficient). In this case, the ALJ clearly considered Story\u2019s claims and found them inconsistent with the medical evidence. Thus, the ALJ satisfied his obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Story\u2019s numerous remaining arguments lack merit or lie beyond our scope of review. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
