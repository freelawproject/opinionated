On appeal, Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence which was above the recommended guidelines range of 24 to 30 months. Rodriguez argues that the district court failed to state adequate reasons to support the increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The sentence imposed by the district court is typically reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court rejected the notion that the district court needs extraordinary circumstances to justify a deviation from the guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595. A district court, in sentencing, should use the guidelines sentence range as \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d but should then consider all of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. If the court concludes that a sentence outside the Guidelines is warranted, it \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cAfter settling on the appropriate sentence, [the sentencing court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">Rodriguez does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the appropriate advisory guideline range or in the factual recitation of his criminal history. Rodriguez also does not assert that the district court did not specifically consider \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the departure. The district court\u2019s decision to vary from the recommended guidelines was based on the finding that Rodriguez\u2019s history of violent crime and drug trafficking showed that he \u201chas no respect for the law.\u201d Specifically, the district court noted the history of two drive-by shootings and found that \u201cthe guidelines do not capture the cowardly, deadly behavior of this defendant that indicates he is perfectly capable of taking human life if somebody gets in the way of one of his bullets that he shoots at a place of habitation ...\u201d Given the facts of this case and the district court\u2019s reasons for departing, Rodriguez has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence that was 18 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>greater than 30 months, which was the top of the recommended guidelines range. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
