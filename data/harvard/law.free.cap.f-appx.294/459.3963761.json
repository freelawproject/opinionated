We have carefully reviewed the relevant Florida case law, and have compared the instant facts against the facts in those cases. We conclude that a reasonable jury would have to conclude under the facts of this case, and in light of the Florida case law, that Anderson, Jr. had moved out of his parents\u2019 home and was living apart in the duplex. The fact that he was receiving some financial support from his parents is not alone sufficient to make him a member of the family under the policy and the case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
