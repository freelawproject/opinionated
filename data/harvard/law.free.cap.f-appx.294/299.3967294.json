Ortiz-Preciado contends that IJ erred as a matter of law in considering certain evidence in the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. Respondent has filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction. We deny both the motion to dismiss and the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">We reject respondent\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction because OrtizPreciado challenges only the discretionary denial of relief. Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) deprives us of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion to review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s discretionary decision, we retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to review questions of law and constitutional claims. <em>Castro de Mercado v. Mukasey, </em>539 F.3d 1102, 1105-06 (9th Cir.2008). Ortiz-Preciado\u2019s argument that consideration of certain evidence is not permitted in a discretionary determination under \u00a7 1252b(a) presents a reviewable question of law. <em>See Sillah v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 1042, 1043 (9th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (stating that \u201c[a] \u2018question of law\u2019 includes an issue of statutory construction as well as the application of law to undisputed facts\u201d); <em>cfi Castro de Mercado, </em>539 F.3d at 1105-06 (holding that court lacks jurisdiction to consider evidentiary issue that simply is argument that IJ erred in discretionary determination). We therefore deny respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Ortiz-Preciado contends that the IJ erred in considering his criminal and immigration record prior to the INS\u2019s decision in 1995 to adjust his status to lawful permanent resident because consideration of this evidence was contrary to Board precedent. <em>See Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 520, 532 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that BIA ruling that directly contradicted BIA precedent was legal error). We do not agree that <em>Matter of Sotelo-Sotelo, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 201 (BIA 2001), and <em>In re C-V-T-, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 7 (BIA 1998), hold that only recent criminal and immigration violations may be considered. <em>Choe v. INS, </em>11 F.3d 925 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that adjustment of status bars later deportation for initial entry with preconceived intent to remain), also is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Ortiz-Preciado contends that the IJ erred in considering his sharing a residence with and financially supporting undocumented aliens. He disagrees with the Board\u2019s conclusion that any error in the IJ\u2019s characterization of him as a harborer of illegal aliens was harmless. We conclude that the IJ\u2019s consideration of these matters was not contrary to Board precedent and was not legal error. <em>See Matter of Sotelo-Sotelo, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 203-04 (recognizing that Board must balance positive and adverse factors to determine whether discretion should be favorably exercised).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED; PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b326-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
