He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress drugs and money seized from his residence because the initial search of his residence, based upon consent given to federal agents by a third party, was not valid, and because the subsequent search of his residence, based upon a warrant and information obtained from the initial search, was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">We \u201cemploy a two-tier standard of review in evaluating a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress based on an evi-dentiary hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Or-ozco, </em>191 F.3d 578, 581 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cAlthough the district court\u2019s findings of fact are accepted unless clearly erroneous, its ultimate conclusion as to the constitutionality of the law enforcement action is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the district court, considering the evidence offered at the suppression hearing as well as the evidence admitted at trial. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 938 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that there was no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s finding that Jair Ibarra had apparent authority to grant consent to search Torres\u2019s residence and that the police authorities had a good faith reasonable belief that Ibarra had the authority to consent to the search. <em>See Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d at 939. As there was no error in connection with the agents\u2019 initial search of Torres\u2019s residence, Torres\u2019s challenge to the subsequent search of his residence is without merit. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b966-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
