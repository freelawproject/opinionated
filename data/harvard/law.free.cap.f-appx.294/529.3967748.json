For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">Weaver was arrested and convicted of drug possession in 2004. Three years later, he filed suit under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 seeking compensatory and punitive damages from various state and local officials in connection with the arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court determined that all of his claims were frivolous and thus dismissed them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. Weaver moved to appeal this ruling and sought leave to proceed <em>in forma pauper-is, </em>which the district court denied. We determined that the appeal was not frivolous and thus granted Weaver leave to proceed with his appeal <em>in forma pauper-is.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">Weaver made a number of allegations regarding Detective W.J. O\u2019Leary, a narcotics officer in the Nassau County sheriffs department. According to Weaver, O\u2019Leary obtained a search warrant based on an affidavit that contained incorrect and falsified information about the location to be searched as well as the probable cause for such a search. <em>See </em>Rl-1 at 9. Weaver also alleged that O\u2019Leary forged the signature of the county judge, Robert Williams, on the warrant and, in conjunction with other police officers, used this falsified warrant to search Weaver\u2019s trailer and illegally confiscate his property without due process. <em>See id. </em>at 9-10. Additionally, Weaver asserted that he was subjected to malicious prosecution by O\u2019Leary. <em>See id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Weaver also made additional claims against four other officials \u2014 Ray Geiger, the Nassau County Sheriff; Robert Williams and Robert Foster, both Circuit Judges in Nassau County; and Granville Burgess, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Nassau County \u2014 as well as against Nassau County itself. He alleged that Sheriff Geiger had established a pattern or practice of false arrests, illegal searches and other forms of corrupt behavior within the police department and that Nassau County tolerated this behavior by failing to discipline him. <em>See id. </em>at 13-16, 21-23. Additionally, he asserted that Williams, Foster, and Burgess conspired to violate his rights by tacitly accepting this pattern of corruption and approving the falsified search warrant and affidavit. <em>See id. </em>at 17-21. Weaver also sought supplemental jurisdiction for a state law negligence claim against Geiger and other sheriffs department officers regarding the false arrest and prosecution as well as the deprivation of property without due process. <em>See id. </em>at 23-25. Weaver\u2019s complaint could be read as claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, though he never identified that as a separate or distinct issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We review a \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) dismissal based on frivolity for abuse of discretion. <em>See Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor purposes of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), an action is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The factual allegations set forth must be sufficient to \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twom-bly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Since Weaver is filing <em>pro se, </em>we analyze his pleadings under a liberal standard. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157,1160 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Based on Weaver\u2019s brief on appeal, a number of the claims in the complaint have been waived. His brief includes no discussion of the state law negligence claim, Nassau County\u2019s approval of the corrupt police practices, or of any conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1985. We deem any \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant [to be] abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Additionally, Weaver only mentions Sheriff Geiger\u2019s approval of police malfeasance in the context of describing the alleged conspiracy by Burgess and the two judges. Such a brief mention, absent any substantive argument on the merits, amounts to a waiver of that claim. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 n. 10 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">A. <em>Claims Against Detective O\u2019Leary and Other Police Officers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Section 1983 permits a plaintiff to obtain civil damages from any person who deprives him of constitutional rights, so long as that person is acting under color of state law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. However, this relief is unavailable for deprivations of property without due process \u201cif a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3204, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). In addition, \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs may only \u201crecover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d if they can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has somehow been invalidated. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372-73, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The district court rejected all of Weaver\u2019s claims with respect to the alleged illegal search and seizure by O\u2019Leary and the other police officers. Based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>liberal reading of the complaint, Weaver\u2019s claim appears to involve three different potential violations \u2014 O\u2019Leary\u2019s alleged forging of Judge Williams\u2019s signature, the search warrant\u2019s reliance on false statements by confidential informants, and the deprivation of property without due process as a result of the use of this allegedly invalid warrant. The court determined that the last of these claims was foreclosed since Florida state law provided an adequate alternate remedy. <em>See </em>R1-6 at 8-9. Florida has expressly waived state sovereign immunity for tort suits involving, <em>inter alia, </em>loss of property caused by state employees or agents acting within the scope of their employment. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. 768.28(1) (2008). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in determining that this relief qualifies as the type of \u201cmeaningful remedy\u201d required under <em>Hudson. See Hudson, </em>468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. at 3204.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The rationale for the district court\u2019s rejection of the other two allegations is less clearly articulated, but the decision did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The court discussed \u201cnegligent processing of the search warrant,\u201d which it deemed not to involve the infringement of any particular federal constitutional or statutory right, thus making \u00a7 1983 relief unavailable. Rl-6 at 9. Additionally, the court noted that some of Weaver\u2019s claims amounted to challenges to the legality of his conviction, which had to be pursued through habeas review. <em>See id. </em>at 5. The \u201cnegligent processing\u201d rationale would seem to encompass the forgery allegation, which Weaver describes as a violation of state, not federal, law. Since Weaver fails to assert a federal right, the district court was justified in rejecting the forgery-based claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Additionally, the district court\u2019s discussion of impermissible challenges to the legality of Weaver\u2019s conviction sufficiently addresses the claim that the search warrant had an invalid basis. We have previously held that such claims can be brought even without proof that the underlying conviction has been called into question. <em>See Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160 (\u201cBecause an illegal search or arrest may be followed by a valid conviction, ... a successful \u00a7 1983 action for Fourth Amendment search and seizure violations does not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction. As a result, <em>Heck </em>does not generally bar such claims.\u201d). However, we have also determined that <em>Heck </em>would still preclude those claims that \u201cif successful, would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction because they would negate an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1160 n. 2. In order to determine whether such a negation would occur, we must look at both \u201cthe claims raised under \u00a7 1983\u201d and \u201cthe specific offenses for which the \u00a7 1983 claimant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Weaver\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute was premised on the methadone uncovered during the search permitted by the allegedly improper warrant. Accordingly, if Weaver was successful in his claim, it would cast doubt on the validity of an essential element of the offense for which he was found guilty. His allegation of an invalid basis for the search warrant thus amounts to the kind of attack on the factual basis for a conviction that we have deemed impermissible under <em>Heck. See Baxter v. Crawford, </em>233 Fed. Appx. 912, 916 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (barring a <em>Bivens </em>claim alleging illegal search and seizure for an individual convicted of cocaine distribution and possession, since such an action would attack the factual basis for his conviction). Given this potential outcome, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the illegal search claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Weaver also seems to be appealing the district court\u2019s denial of his malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>prosecution claim against O\u2019Leary and other officers. The court rejected such a claim based on <em>Heck, </em>noting that Weaver presented no evidence showing that his conviction had been called into question, thus making such a motion premature. <em>See </em>Rl-6 at 7-8. Since this determination accords with the facts discussed in Weaver\u2019s complaint, the court was within its discretion in dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">B. <em>Claims Against ASA Burgess, Judge Williams, and Judge Foster</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The district court rejected the conspiracy claims against Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Burgess and Judges Williams and Foster, finding them to be both \u201cfantastic and delusional\u201d and otherwise precluded by absolute prosecutorial and judicial immunity. <em>See </em>R1-6 at 5, 6-7. As an initial matter, Weaver\u2019s conspiracy allegations appear to be completely baseless, since he presents no evidence to justify his claims. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (declaring that district courts can dismiss <em>in forma pauperis </em>claims \u201cwhose factual contentions are clearly baseless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Furthermore, the district court was justified in finding that both judges and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney were immune from suit. \u201cJudges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in them judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cThis immunity applies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u201c[a] prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from suit for all actions he takes while performing his function as an advocate for the government.\u201d <em>Rivera v. Leal, </em>359 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir. 2004). In this case, the judges\u2019 actions constituted normal judicial functions, and Burgess\u2019s actions were all performed in the initiation and pursuit of criminal prosecution against Weaver. Since Weaver offered no facts or law to support his allegations that they were all acting outside the scope of their office in their dealings with him, they are all entitled to absolute immunity. The district court was thus justified in dismissing those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Weaver appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), of his \u00a7 1983 suit alleging constitutional violations in connection with his arrest and subsequent conviction on drug possession charges. Based on the facts and law discussed in Weaver\u2019s complain and brief on appeal, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the suit as frivolous. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Weaver\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-16\">. Weaver\u2019s son, Chester Weaver, Jr., was also listed as a plaintiff in the complaint, but the district court dismissed his claim for failure to pay the filing fee or seek <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. He did not appeal that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
