Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In 1988, Sutherland and Gordon were the sole and equal shareholders and directors of C.C. Pace Corporation, an entity that engaged in energy and management systems consulting. In 1989, Sutherland and Gordon entered into a \u201cReorganization Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) to divide the C.C. Pace Corporation. Sutherland received the energy consulting business, later named \u201cPace Resources,\u201d while Gordon received the management systems consulting business, later named \u201cPace Systems.\u201d Among the assets transferred to Pace Systems was \u201c[t]he right to use a derivative of the name \u2018C.C. Pace\u2019 as a corporate or trade name, subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7 below.\u201d Section 7 of the Agreement, entitled \u201cC.C. Pace Name\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">Pace [Resources] and [Sutherland] do not object to and will not oppose the use by [Pace Systems] or [Gordon] of the name \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in a corporate or trade name, provided that [Pace Systems] and [Gordon] may not use the name \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in combination with the word \u201cCorporation,\u201d or the phrase \u201cResources,\u201d or any derivative thereof.... Pace [Resources] and [Sutherland] may continue to use the name \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d as a corporate or trade name, provided that Pace [Resources] and [Sutherland] may not use the name \u201cC.C. Pace,\u201d in combination with the word \u201cCorporation\u201d or the word \u201cSystems\u201d or any derivative thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">After the division of C.C. Pace Corporation, Pace Resources has used as trade names: \u201cPace Resources,\u201d \u201cC.C. Pace Resources,\u201d and \u201cC.C. Pace;\u201d Pace Systems has used as trade names: \u201cPace Systems,\u201d \u201cC.C. Pace Systems,\u201d \u201cCC Pace Systems,\u201d \u201cC.C. Pace,\u201d and \u201cCC Pace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The Appellants claim the Agreement does not give the Appellees the right to use \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in isolation as a trade name because the Agreement states the Appellees may use it \u201cin\u201d a trade name. Appellants further claim they may use \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in isolation because the Agreement allows them to use it \u201cas\u201d a trade name. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Doe v. Kidd, </em>501 F.3d 348, 353 (4th Cir.2007) <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1483, 170 L.Ed.2d 297 (2008). Virginia law applies to the Agreement and follows the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule, which dictates that \u201c[t]he contract is construed as written, without adding terms that were not included by the parties.\u201d <em>City of Chesapeake v. States Self-Insurers Risk Retention Group, Inc., </em>271 Va. 574, 628 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The plain meaning of Section 7 of the Agreement is to allow Appellees to use the trade name \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d as long as they do not use it in conjunction with \u201cCorporation\u201d or \u201cResources.\u201d Similarly, the Agreement allows Appellants to use the trade name \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d as long as they do not use it in conjunction with \u201cCorporation\u201d or \u201cSystems.\u201d The Agreement is silent about either party\u2019s use of \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in isolation. The Appellants\u2019 \u201cin\u201d versus \u201cas\u201d argument strains the plain meaning of the Agreement and reads into it a nonexistent prohibition of use in isolation. As the Agreement does not prohibit isolated usage of the name \u201cC.C. Pace,\u201d the district court did not err when it found the Appellees may use \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d in isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">The Appellants also claim the Agreement prohibits the Appellees from using the Internet domain name \u201cccpace.com.\u201d The Agreement gives the Appellees the right to use \u201cC.C. Pace\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>trade name. The Appellants concede \u201cCC Pace\u201d without punctuation is a derivative use because \u201c[t]here is no material distinction between using the name with or without periods.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. at 7). The Appellees\u2019 use of \u201ccepace\u201d as its domain name is the same as any other use of the trade name and is not a non-derivative use prohibited by the Agreement. The district court did not err when it found the Appellees\u2019 use of the domain name \u201ccc pace\u201d did not violate the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
