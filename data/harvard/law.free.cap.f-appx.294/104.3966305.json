This court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue of whether Nunez\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the State\u2019s introduction of collateral matters during cross examination at the penalty phase of his trial. Also pending before this court is Nunez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">With respect to Nunez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which was adjudicated on the merits in his state court proceedings, habeas relief will not be granted unless Nunez shows that the state court\u2019s adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or that the state court\u2019s adjudication of a claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Nunez must show that his counsel\u2019s assistance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To demonstrate deficient performance, Nunez must establish that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88,104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate prejudice, a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A failure to establish either deficient performance or resulting prejudice defeats the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Nunez pled guilty to the first degree murder of Manuel Martinez, who Nunez believed was having an affair with Nunez\u2019s common law wife, Floridama Berrios. On the night of the murder, Nunez stopped by Berrios\u2019s apartment. When Nunez saw Martinez appear from inside the apartment, Nunez fatally shot Martinez in the head at point blank range.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">During sentencing, which was tried before a jury, Nunez testified, raising the defense of sudden passion. Nunez testified that he and Berrios were separated because of Martinez. The State cross examined Nunez on this issue, asking if his wife had really left him because he had assaulted her two months prior to the murder. Nunez denied assaulting his wife. The next day, the State recalled Nunez for rebuttal, again questioning him about the assault. Nunez\u2019s attorney did not object to the State\u2019s questions regarding the assault, the collateral matter which forms the crux of this appeal. At the close of the evidence, the jury rejected Nunez\u2019s sudden passion defense and sentenced him to 99 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In order to demonstrate that counsel was deficient for failing to object under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>Nunez must show that an objection would have had merit \u2014 an attorney\u2019s conduct can hardly be found objectively unreasonable for failing to make a meritless objection. Whether an objection would have had merit depends on whether the alleged assault by Nunez is a collateral matter under Texas state law. The resolution of this question resulted in opposing decisions by two Texas courts. On Nunez\u2019s direct appeal, the state appellate court agreed that the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross examination were improper because any facts pertaining to Nunez\u2019s possible assault of his wife several weeks earlier involved a collateral matter. However, the court affirmed Nunez\u2019s conviction because his counsel failed to object to the introduction of collateral matters on cross examination and thus procedurally defaulted the claim. The appellate court\u2019s rationale lends support to Nunez\u2019s argument that his counsel was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">However, on state habeas review, the trial court found that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning Nunez regarding a prior assault during the punishment hearing did not involve a collateral matter for two reasons. First, the court held that Nunez\u2019s prior offenses, even unadjudicated ones such as the alleged assault of his wife, were proper matters of proof at a punishment hearing. Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(3)(a) (Vernon 2007). Second, Nunez testified during direct examination that Martinez\u2019s interference in his relationship with Berrios led to their separation some weeks earlier. Thus, the prosecutor was permitted to question Nunez regarding another possible reason for Nunez\u2019s separation from Berrios, a reason that would have undermined his direct testimony. For these reasons, the state habeas court held that it was not ineffective for trial counsel to fail to object to the prosecutor\u2019s proper question. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Nunez\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>written order; it relied on the findings of the trial court that were reached without a hearing. Although the two lower courts disagreed regarding the collateral matter, the state\u2019s highest criminal court denied Nunez\u2019s habeas application. This is a strong statement by the highest criminal court in Texas that Nunez\u2019s proposed objection would have been meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The federal district court held that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 decision was neither contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>Because Nunez failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415,1428 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On appeal, Nunez has not shown that the Court of Criminal Appeals was unreasonable when it decided that the cross examination did not involve collateral matters. Nunez\u2019s counsel cannot have rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make a meritless objection. <em>See Green v. Johnson, </em>160 F.3d 1029, 1037 (5th Cir. 1998), <em>cert, denied, </em>525 U.S. 1174,119 S.Ct. 1107, 143 L.Ed.2d 106 (1999). Accordingly, Nunez has not established deficient performance by his counsel, and we need not address whether there was any prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Nunez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
