On appeal, De-Laughter argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence which was above the recommended Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The sentence imposed by the district court is typically reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court rejected the notion that the district court needs extraordinary circumstances to justify a deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 595. A district court, in sentencing, should use the Guidelines range as \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d but should then consider all of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 596. If the court concludes that a sentence outside the Guidelines is warranted, it \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. \u201cAfter settling on the appropriate sentence, [the sentencing court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">DeLaughter does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the appropriate advisory Guidelines range or the factual recitation of his criminal history. Although he challenges the district court\u2019s conclusions, DeLaughter does not assert that the district court did not specifically consider \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the departure. The record shows the district court considered these factors, including DeLaughter\u2019s history and characteristics, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by DeLaughter. The district court relied on more than the mere number of offenses that DeLaughter had committed and the other times he had been arrested. The district court\u2019s decision was based on the finding that DeLaughter\u2019s history contained repeated instances of threats against others and two additional threats against federal district court judges, one of which pertained to the current criminal conviction. Given the facts of this case and the district court\u2019s reasons for departing from the Guidelines range, DeLaughter has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in imposing consecutive 120-month sentences. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">DeLaughter argues that the district court was not required to provide him notice before imposing an above-guidelines sentence, but should have done so anyway. This court has held that the district court may sua sponte impose a non-guideline sentence without advance notice to the defendant. <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 722-23 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2954, 171 L.Ed.2d 884 (2008). The Supreme Court recently held the same in <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-04,171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">DeLaughter\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b177-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
