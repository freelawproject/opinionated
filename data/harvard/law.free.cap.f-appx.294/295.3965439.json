The Minors al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>leged the \u201cunlawful takings of private property through the unlawful application\u201d of the tax law by the Internal Revenue Board and the Franchise Tax Board. The Minors argue, among other things, that they have not engaged in any revenue taxable activity, that they cannot be classified as \u201ctaxpayers,\u201d that Internal Revenue Code is not positive law, and that defendants unconstitutionally imposed a tax on their right to live and own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The district court properly dismissed the Minors\u2019 action seeking damages for lack of jurisdiction because sovereign immunity bars all suits against the federal government unless it expressly consents to be sued. The IRS and its agents in their official capacities have not waived sovereign immunity, and thus, the Minors\u2019 action is barred. <em>See Gilbert v. DaGrossa, </em>756 F.2d 1455,1458 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Minors asked the district court to provide them with the protection of the law from crimes being committed against them by the Internal Revenue Service and the Franchise Tax Board and to remove all liens and levies. The Minors\u2019 request to enjoin the government\u2019s collection of taxes is barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. <em>Elias v. Connett, </em>908 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir. 1990). To the extent the Minors contend that federal income tax statutes and procedures violate the Constitution, we summarily reject such arguments. <em>See United States v. Nelson (In re Becraft), </em>885 F.2d 547, 548 (9th Cir.1989) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">To the extent that the Minors seek a tax refund, the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity. Internal Revenue Code section 7422 grants a waiver of sovereign immunity to permit jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 for tax refund actions. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a); <em>Thomas v. United States, </em>755 F.2d 728, 729 (9th Cir.1985). A taxpayer, however, must first pay the assessments in full and file a claim for a refund with the IRS. Because the Minors failed to allege that they exhausted their administrative remedies under section 7422, their refund claim is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Finally, because California offers a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient remedy\u201d in its courts for state tax appeals, <em>see Jerron West, Inc. v. State of Cal. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>129 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (9th Cir.1997), the district court properly dismissed the Minors\u2019 claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the State. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The district court also properly dismissed Minors\u2019 remaining claims because the defendant state agency is not a \u201cperson\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985, <em>see Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), and it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>see Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Board (In re Mitchell), </em>209 F.3d 1111, 1115-16 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Because the arguments raised by the Minors on appeal are wholly without merit, we grant the government\u2019s motion to impose sanctions against the Minors for bringing a frivolous appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912; Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Wilcox v. Commissioner, </em>848 F.2d 1007, 1008 (9th Cir.1988) (imposing sanctions against pro se litigant for arguing that wages are not income and payment of taxes is voluntary). We impose sanctions in the amount of $1,000. All other pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b321-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
