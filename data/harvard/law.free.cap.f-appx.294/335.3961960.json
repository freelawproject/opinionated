Barongan, native and citizen of the Philippines, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order affirming an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his motion to continue and denying his motion to remand, No. 05-71257, and the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen and reconsider, No. 05-72632. We have jurisdiction under by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">In his reply brief, Barongan changes his request for relief because his is not eligible to adjust under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 because of the impending dissolution of his marriage. We decline to reach the merits of his newly raised estoppel argument. <em>See Bazuaye v.
