He pleaded guilty to the charge. The district court entered a judgment, which lists the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d as \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien,\u201d and imposed an above-Guidelines sentence of 40 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">Perez-Rodriguez avers that the sentence imposed by the district court was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain why a sentence of 40 months, which was 19 months above the maximum of the Guideline imprisonment range, was not greater than necessary to meet the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). He avers further that before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>imposing the 40-month sentence, the district court should have, but did not, consider the guideline departure provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, which addresses under-representation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The sentence imposed by the district court is typically reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court rejected the notion that the district court needs extraordinary circumstances to justify a deviation from the guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 595. A district court, in sentencing, should use the guidelines sentence range as \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d but should then consider all of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 596. \u201cAfter settling on the appropriate sentence, [the sentencing court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Because Perez-Rodriguez did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to give adequate reasons, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272-73 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">The record shows that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, including Perez-Rodriguez\u2019s history and characteristics, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by Perez-Rodriguez. Accordingly, the district court adequately stated the reasons for the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Perez-Rodriguez\u2019s contention that, in order to comply with the requirement to calculate the applicable advisory guidelines range, the district court had to calculate a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 is without merit. This court specifically rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2954, 171 L.Ed.2d 884 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Lastly, Perez-Rodriguez has not shown that the 40-month sentence was greater than necessary to meet the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). The district court\u2019s determination that Perez-Rodriguez\u2019s extensive criminal history, the likelihood of recidivism, and the need to protect the public warranted an upward departure does not constitute error and the extent of the departure was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004) <em>see also United States v. Zunigar-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir. 2006). Perez-Rodriguez has not demonstrated that the district court procedurally erred or that his sentence was otherwise unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Perez-Rodriguez avers that, even if this court grants no other relief, the court should exercise its power pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 36 to correct an alleged clerical error in the judgment. He argues that the judgment misidentifies the \u201cnature of offense\u201d of conviction as reentry of a deported alien, when, he contends, it should state that he was convicted of the separate offense of being unlawfully \u201cfound in\u201d the United States following removal or deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Rule 36 authorizes us to correct only clerical errors, which exist when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>See United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022,1025-26 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d description, \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[r]eentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cnature of the offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326. Such a method of reference to \u00a7 1326 is not uncommon; in fact, this court has often used the similar term \u201cillegal reentry\u201d in reference to violations of \u00a7 1326 generally. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gunera, </em>479 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A]n alien who has previously been denied entry or been deported or removed commits the offense of illegal reentry when the alien thereafter \u201centers, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States ____\u201d \u201d (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Vargas-Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe illegal reentry statute defines Vargas-Garcia\u2019s offense thusly: a removed alien commits illegal reentry when he \u2018enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States (emphasis added)). Thus, it appears that the district court\u2019s judgment uses the term \u201cre-entry of a deported alien\u201d intentionally in reference to \u00a7 1326 generally, and such is not a clerical error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-8\">. As Defendant observes, we have noted that attempted reentry under \u00a7 1326 constitutes an offense distinct from either reentry or being found in the United States under \u00a7 1326, <em>see United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529, 531 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Martinez-Espinoza, </em>299 F.3d 414, 417 (5th Cir. 2002); but such cases, which focus on the distinction between actual entry and attempted entry, are inapposite here. In this case, the differences between actual and attempted entry are not at issue. Rather, Defendant pled to being found unlawfully in the United States, and we are called to determine whether the judgment contained a clerical error in referring to that offense by its general statutory title.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
