Abrams denying Kastriot Lulaj\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), which included his wife, Kristina, as a derivative applicant. <em>In re Lulaj, </em>No. A 96 421 863/866 (B.IA. Dec. 14, 2007), <em>affg </em>Nos. A 96 421 863/866 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. United States Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Petitioners argue only that the agency failed adequately to support its conclusion that \u201c[tjhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). We disagree. Both the IJ and BIA provided a reasoned basis for their findings where they noted that (1) petitioners\u2019 asylum claim was based on Kastriot\u2019s membership in the Democratic Party, (2) that party had returned to power, and (3) Kastriot did not experience persecution when the party was previously in control. Moreover, the record evidence indicated that neither the government nor the major political parties currently engage in policies of abuse, coercion, or persecution on the basis of an individual\u2019s political party. To the extent petitioners ask this court to take judicial notice of further changes in Albania\u2019s politics \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>occurred between the time of the BIA\u2019s determination and our review,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 186 n. 5, we note that the State Department\u2019s 2007 Country Report on Albania<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> tends to corroborate the IJ\u2019s decision, not refute it. In sum, petitioners point to no evidence compelling a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Because petitioners are unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, they are necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal where both claims were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>Cf. Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006). Because petitioners failed sufficiently to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief before this court, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-19\">.
