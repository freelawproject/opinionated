Thereafter, in 2004, the district court sentenced Ruhbayan to life in prison on one offense and to three concurrent sixty-month sentences on the other three offenses. We affirmed his convictions but vacated his sentence, remanding for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Ruhbayan, </em>406 F.3d 292 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On remand, in 2005, the district court reimposed the initial sentence. Ruhbayan appealed, challenging, inter alia, the district court\u2019s failure to \u201ctake into account factors [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] which should have mitigated against the harsh sentence imposed,\u201d Br. of Appellant 43, including \u201cthe need to avoid inappropriate sentencing disparities\u201d resulting from \u201cthe 100-to-l ratio between powder and crack cocaine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 47.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ruhbayan nevertheless acknowledged our then-controlling decision in <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio cannot be the basis of a variance), <em>vacated </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, - L.Ed.2d - (2008). We rejected Ruhbayan\u2019s appellate contentions and affirmed his sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruhbayan, </em>527 F.3d 107 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Ruhbayan filed a petition for writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding that a sentencing judge is free to consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses in determining whether, \u201cin the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u2018greater than necessary to serve the objectives of sentencing\u201d (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a))). Upon review of the record, we conclude that resentencing is warranted. Accordingly, we vacate Ruhbayan\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> The district court found that Ruhbayan committed and suborned perjury in connection with his 2000 trial on a prior federal charge of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Ruhbayan's base offense level for perjury and suborning perjury was six levels below the offense level for the underlying drug conspiracy offense (up to a maximum level of 30), with the offense level for the underlying drug conspiracy offense being premised on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him.
