Louisiana did not oppose class counsel\u2019s motion for fees. After the district court ordered Louisiana to pay the requested fees, Louisiana requested that the district court reconsider the award of fees, arguing that the Attorney General\u2019s office was the proper entity to litigate the matter and was never served the motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-21\">The district court denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that class counsel had served notice on Louisiana\u2019s attorney of record and, two days after filing the motion for fees, also inquired whether the Attorney General\u2019s office needed to be served. There is evidence that Louisiana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>counsel of record informed class counsel that an attorney for the Attorney General had already been assigned to respond to the motion and that the Attorney General\u2019s office was already in possession of the relevant documentation. The district court found that the initial motion for fees was unopposed and also had merit. Other than being unintentional, the district court concluded that Louisiana failed to provide any reason for its failure to respond to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The attorneys\u2019 fees awarded here were requested pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(b) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205; both sections provide the district court with discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and denial of Louisiana\u2019s motion for reconsideration are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>DP Solutions, Inc. v. Rollins, Inc., </em>358 F.3d 421, 433 (5th Cir.2003) (attorneys\u2019 fees); <em>Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. De La Luz Garcia, </em>501 F.3d 436, 442 (5th Cir.2007) (reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Class counsel\u2019s motion for fees included documentation such as detailed time and expense sheets, a survey of fee rates for Louisiana, a memorandum of law, and declarations of counsel in support of the requested fees. The district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the requested fees nor in denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
