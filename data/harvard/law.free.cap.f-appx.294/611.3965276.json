Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination regarding the timeliness of Odmar\u2019s asylum application and substantial evidence supports the denial of withholding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>we dismiss Odmar\u2019s petition for review in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Odmar entered the United States on April 4, 1999, as a crew member authorized to remain for no more than twenty-nine days. On April 14, 2008, Odmar was served with a Notice to Appear charging him as removable pursuant to Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Odmar filed a defensive asylum application on July 28, 2005, based on his Christianity.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In his testimony before the IJ and in his asylum application, Odmar described various incidents of harm in support of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found Od-mar credible. Odmar described being fearful after witnessing the 1984 clash between Muslims and Christians in the Tan-jung Priok area of Jakarta. In June 1996, a Muslim group leader interrupted a home prayer service in which Odmar participated and demanded that the attendees stop their prayers. In December 1998, Odmar witnessed a Muslim group attack a man on a bus identified as Christian on his national identification card, which indicates religion. Odmar described that members of Muslim organizations solicited him, but not his Muslim neighbors, for donations, and that he felt pressured to contribute. Od-mar also testified that his mother and sister continue to reside in Indonesia and practice Christianity without problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">At the conclusion of the March 2, 2006, hearing, the IJ denied all relief except voluntary departure. The IJ determined that Odmar did not file an asylum application within one year of arriving in the United States, and that he did not qualify for an exception based on materially changed circumstances in Indonesia. The IJ denied withholding of removal finding that Odmar did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of his Christianity if he returned to Indonesia. The IJ found that Odmar\u2019s experiences did not rise to the requisite level of past persecution. The IJ also noted that Odmar testified that his mother, sister, and brother-in-law, who were also Christian, worshiped without any interference from Muslims or the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Odmar timely appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. The BIA issued a decision on August 3, 2007, affirming the denial of all relief and the grant of voluntary departure. The BIA found that Odmar was ineligible for asylum based on his failure to file within the statutory one-year deadline, and his inability to establish \u201cany changed circumstances in Indonesia affecting his eligibility or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d The BIA observed that although Odmar claimed that conditions in Indonesia had been deteriorating since his 1999 departure, he did not apply for asylum until six years later in 2005, and he did not identify \u201cany new \u2018changes\u2019 that occurred in his native country within a reasonable time of his filing that related to his claim for relief, and excused his delay in filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The BIA found that Odmar\u2019s experiences were not sufficiently severe to establish past persecution. The BIA denied withholding, determining that there was no objective basis in the record to conclude that it was more likely than not that Od-mar would be persecuted if he returned to Indonesia. The BIA also agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination that Odmar was not entitled to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Odmar filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">A. Timeliness of Odmar\u2019s Asylum Application</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Odmar\u2019s asylum application based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>on the BIA\u2019s determinations that Odmar did not file his application within the one year deadline and failed to demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his late filing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8); <em>Hayek v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 501, 506-507 (1st Cir.2006). Under the REAL ID Act, this court does retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The BIA\u2019s findings regarding timeliness and changed or extraordinary circumstances, however, are usually factual determinations outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Hayek, </em>445 F.3d at 506-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Odmar contends that we retain jurisdiction because he raises a question of law. He argues that the IJ used the incorrect legal standard by concluding that \u201can increase in the intensity in the circumstances in a particular country does not constitute a material change as contemplated by the regulations,\u201d and that the BIA \u201caffirmed and simply cited the statute and regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">This argument is unavailing. Though the BIA affirmed the IJ, the BIA supplied its own reasoning and did not simply adopt the reasoning of the IJ. Based on the record evidence, the BIA concluded that Odmar had not identified \u201cany new \u2018changes\u2019 that occurred in his native country within a reasonable time of his filing that related to his claim for relief, and excused his delay in filing.\u201d Contrary to Odmar\u2019s argument, this determination did not involve the application of an erroneous legal standard; rather, it is a factual determination that Odmar did not demonstrate that circumstances in Indonesia had changed such that his untimely application should be excused. Determinations of changed circumstances are generally factual determinations, <em>Hayek, </em>445 F.3d at 506-507, and Odmar has not presented a convincing argument that the agency\u2019s determination here was not of a factual nature. This court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review Odmar\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in finding that his untimely application was not excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">B. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>See Romilus v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s findings are upheld if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d and are reversed only if \u201cthe record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">To qualify for withholding of removal, Odmar must either (1) show that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, creating a rebuttable presumption of future persecution; or (2) demonstrate a clear probability of persecution, which requires a showing that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31,107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Da Silva v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">\n<em>1. Past Persecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Sufficient evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Odmar\u2019s experiences do not rise to the level of past persecution. His home prayer service was disrupted, he was solicited for money, and he witnessed physical confrontations. Odmar never suffered any physical harm, was never confined, and was never directly threatened. Occasional mistreatment or a generalized fear of mistreatment do not, on their own, constitute persecution. <em>See Sombah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 49, 50-52 (1st Cir.2008) (Christian Indonesian did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>not establish past persecution where applicant hosted monthly prayer meetings and the attendees\u2019 cars were vandalized, her church was burned down, her husband was threatened on a bus, and Muslim neighbors killed her dog); <em>Susanto v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir.2006) (Chinese Christian Indonesian did not establish past persecution where she was mugged, her home was vandalized during the 1998 riots, her church was bombed, and a Muslim crowd threatened and threw stones at her).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Odmar\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to take into account the totality of the circumstances and violated due process by ignoring evidence of country conditions between 2002 and 2005 is meritless. In his decision, the IJ specifically refers to evidence of country conditions from this time period, including news articles, State Department reports, and other reports submitted in Exhibit 6, and materials postdating September 2005. <em>See Sombah, </em>529 F.3d at 51-52. The parties also addressed the 2005 International Religious Freedom Report during the hearing before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>2. Future Persecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Odmar did not establish that it was more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his Christianity based on country conditions and Odmar\u2019s testimony that his family remains unharmed in Indonesia. <em>See Sipayung v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2007) (no objectively reasonable fear of future persecution where family remained in Indonesia unharmed and able to safely practice their religion, and country reports indicated improved conditions for Christians); <em>Ferdinandus v. Gonzales, </em>504 F.3d 61, 63 (1st Cir.2007) (safety of petitioner\u2019s children, who still live and attend church in Indonesia, undercuts her argument that she will suffer future persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Odmar also argues that direct government involvement triggers \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d of his claims. We need not consider this argument because Odmar failed to present it to the BIA. <em>See Sombah, </em>529 F.3d at 52 (rejecting same argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">We <em>dismiss </em>the petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction and <em>deny </em>it in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-21\">. Odmar has waived any challenge to the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\u201d) by not raising it in his opening brief. <em>See Levin v. Doha Bros., Inc., </em>459 F.3d 68, 76 n. 4 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
