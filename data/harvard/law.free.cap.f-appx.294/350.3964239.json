Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Gerung has shown extraordinary or changed circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of her asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, because Gerung failed to demonstrate past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko, </em>333 F.3d at 1016-17. Furthermore, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004) applies in the context of withholding of removal, Gerung has not established that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted if she returned to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review Gerung\u2019s contention regarding the hearing transcript because she failed to raise that issue before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
