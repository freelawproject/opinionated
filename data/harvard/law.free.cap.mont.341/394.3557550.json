The Department\u2019s final decision granted a judgment and damages to appellee Lisa Williams (Williams) based on a complaint for sexual discrimination which she filed against the appellant Joe Lowther Insurance Agency, Inc. (Corporation). The Corporation now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">\u00b62 Joe Lowther (Lowther) became the sole shareholder and owner of the Corporation in late 1995, after the death of his father, Joe Lowther, Sr. Joe Lowther, Sr. had formed the Corporation in Billings, Montana in 1969, and served as the district manager for Farmers Insurance Group (Farmers). Lowther assumed his father\u2019s position when he took over the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">\u00b63 Lowther met Williams in 1997 or 1998 while he was a patient of Heights Eye Care Center in Billings. Williams worked there as a receptionist. Lowther was a divorced father of three children. Williams was married with two children. Lowther and Williams began a relationship, and sometime in 2001 Lowther approached Williams about coming to work for the Corporation. Initially she refused, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>then accepted his offer in May of 2001. At the time, two other women worked in the office for Lowther. In August of 2001, Lowther and Williams entered into a consensual, sexual relationship. They concealed this affair from Williams\u2019 spouse. By January of2002, while Williams and Lowther were still in the relationship, Lowther\u2019s other employees had left, and Williams was Lowther\u2019s sole employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b64 In June 2002, Williams and her husband initiated proceedings to adopt a third child. In summer of 2002 Lowther began pressing Williams to divorce her husband. Through the end of 2002 and into early 2003, Williams resisted this pressuring, citing to the pending adoption of the child and the untimeliness of initiating a divorce during the holiday season. In May 2003 William s\u2019 husband lost his job, and he decided to stay home with their children. For some reason, this infuriated Lowther and he felt betrayed. Lowther then increased his efforts to persuade Williams to leave her husband. However, these efforts were not successful, and in late May of 2003 Williams ceased having sexual relations with Lowther.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b65 From this point, things went steadily downhill between Lowther and Williams. The two quarreled in public, and the work environment was tense and unbearable to Lowther because he and Williams were the only persons working at the Corporation. On June 20, 2003, Lowther met with Williams, telling her he could not \u201ctake\u201d the situation between them anymore. Lowther told Williams that he needed her more personally than professionally. He offered her a severance package consisting of wages and a lump sum payment and gave her a choice: either resume an intimate relationship with him, or leave her job. At the time, Williams was making approximately $36,000 per year and needed the money to support her family. She was shocked and angry, and refused Lowther\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b66 The next day, Williams telephoned Lowther and told him she had gone to an attorney, and that if he attempted to end her employment or reduce her wages he would be in \u201cbig trouble.\u201d Lowther reiterated his previous offer, increasing the amount of the lump sum payment. Williams refused this offer as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b67 On August 4, 2003, Lowther terminated Williams\u2019 employment with the Corporation. After a lengthy discussion concerning the status of pending business matters for the Corporation, Lowther again told Williams that he needed her more personally than professionally, and again offered her a choice between resuming an intimate relationship with him and losing her job. Williams refused to leave her husband and resume her relationship with Lowther.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00b68 After she was fired, Williams went to executives for Farmers and complained that she had been wrongfully discharged. Williams told the executives that she had an \u201cemotional\u201d relationship with Lowther, but falsely denied that she had a \u201cphysical\u201d relationship with him. Williams\u2019 statements to the Farmers\u2019 executives led them to believe that Lowther had pursued a sexual relationship with Williams and that she found his attentions unwelcome during the entire relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b69 The Farmers\u2019 executives arranged a meeting with Lowther to discuss this matter. He lied about firing Williams, and falsely denied he had had a physical relationship with her. He did, however, admit to much of the rest of the relationship, including the exchange of notes and gifts, and his repeated statements that he needed her personally, but not professionally. Soon after this meeting on August 15, 2003, Farmers\u2019 executives gave Lowther the option of resigning from his position as district manager for Farmers, or being fired. He chose the former course.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b610 On November 21, 2003, Williams filed a complaint with the Department, alleging that the Corporation \u201cdiscriminated against her on the basis of sex (female) when it subjected her to unwelcome <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment culminating when [the Corporation] terminated her employment on or about August 4, 2003.\u201d A contested case hearing on the matter was held in Billings on October 18 and 19, 2004, before a hearing examiner for the Department. On March 7, 2005, the hearing examiner issued a Final Agency Decision. On the basis of extensive findings of facts and conclusions of law, the examiner ruled in favor of Williams, concluding that the Corporation \u201cdiscriminated against her because of sex.\u201d The examiner ordered the Corporation to pay Williams $30,155.13 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b611 Lowther appealed this ruling to the HRC. On May 26, 2005, the HRC affirmed the Department\u2019s Final Agency Decision. In its order, the HRC held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">In discussion, the Commission noted that, in the end, this is still an employment relationship. Joe Lowther was Lisa Williams supervisor and, as the employer, Lowther\u2019s actions should not be excused simply because the office is smaller than others are. The employer failed to consider other options besides termination. Therefore, after careful and due consideration, the Commission concludes that the Final Agency Decision in this matter is supported by substantial evidence and complies with the essential requirements of the law. <em>Admin R. Mont. 24.9.1717(2).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u00b612 Lowther appealed the HRC\u2019s ruling to the District Court, challenging the Department\u2019s Final Agency Decision on several grounds. First, he argued that procedural irregularities in the proceedings prejudiced his substantial rights. Second, he maintained that although the hearing examiner had noted valid, nondiscriminatory reasons for Williams\u2019 firing, he failed to make findings essential to a \u201cmixed motive\u201d analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lowther argued that at best Williams proved a \u201cmixed motive\u201d case, and that the Department improperly awarded damages in violation of Admin. R. M. 24.9.611. Third, Lowther contended that Williams had failed to prove she was a member of a protected class, and further failed to prove that her termination was due to illegal discrimination, instead of simply the natural fallout from the end of her personal relationship with Lowther.</p>\n<p id=\"ASs\">\u00b613 The District Court rejected Lowther\u2019s challenges, and affirmed the rulings of the HRC and hearing examiner. The District Court concluded that Williams had made a prima facie showing of a case of quid pro quo sexual discrimination, and that a presumption that the termination was not based on sexual discrimination, because of the previous consensual relationship, did not apply. As stated by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">The timing of the termination is all-important to this case-a point Petitioner is intent on overlooking. As noted above and explained more fully in the Agency\u2019s Findings of Fact, in late May 2003, the parties stopped having sex. Petitioner pressured Respondent to leave her husband. On June 20, 2003, after months of discussion and consternation regarding their future relationship, Petitioner offered Respondent a severance package and a choice. She could either resume an intimate relationship with Petitioner and leave her husband, or she could leave her job. Respondent did not want to resume her relationship with Petitioner or leave her job. On August 4, 2003, Petitioner fired Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">The Agency concluded and this Court agrees that Petitioner\u2019s actions constituted <em>quid quo pro </em>sexual harassment. His pressuring Respondent to resume their relationship amounted to unwelcomed sexual advances, requests, and conduct. He then made Respondent\u2019s submission to the choice he offered explicitly a term of her employment. Her rejection of Petitioner\u2019s choice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the reason for her dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b614 The District Court, citing <em>Lincoln Co. v. Sanders Co., </em>261 Mont. 344, 862 P.2d 1133 (1993) and \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, also rejected Lowther\u2019s \u201cmixed motive\u201d argument, holding that because Lowther failed to raise this argument before the hearing examiner he could not raise it for judicial review before the District Court. Moreover, the District Court noted that while Lowther offered a variety of nondiscriminatory reasons for his decision to terminate Williams, this was done after Williams had made a prima facie case for sexual discrimination. Thus, the burden had already shifted to Lowther to prove non-discriminatory reasons for the termination. The hearing examiner found Lowther\u2019s proffered reasons for the termination, including poor work performance and a job offer Williams allegedly had received with another company, to be pre-textual. In particular, the District Court pointed to the hearing examiner\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 42, where the examiner found that even after Lowther had terminated Williams he offered her the choice of returning to her job if she resumed her intimate relationship with him, as undercutting any argument that Lowther fired Williams for non-discriminatory reasons. The District Court also rejected Lowther\u2019s argument that the hearing examiner failed to make \u201cspecific and substantial findings of pretext before it rejected his legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Respondent\u2019s termination.\u201d The District Court pointed specifically to roughly fifteen Findings of Fact that provided substantial support for the hearing examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b615 Additionally, the District Court rejected Lowther\u2019s claim that the hearing examiner prejudiced his rights by virtue of irregularities in the proceedings. At the hearing, Lowther attempted to offer expert testimony which would have explained why his decision to terminate Williams was commercially reasonable in light of a \u201clove contract\u201d which the parties had allegedly entered into. This \u201clove contract\u201d was supposedly an agreement between the parties that if the relationship ended, Williams would leave the Corporation. The hearing officer rejected this expert testimony as irrelevant, and noted that whether or not the parties entered into a \u201clove contract\u201d was a question of fact that did not require expert testimony to resolve. Lastly, the District Court rejected Lowther\u2019s argument that the hearing examiner prejudiced his substantial rights by changing the legal basis for his decision. Lowther maintained the hearing examiner first announced that he would apply the standard found in <em>Keppler v. Hinsdale Tp. High Sch. Dist. 86, </em>715 F. Supp. 862 (N.D. Ill. 1989), which Lowther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>claims mandates a presumption of non-discriminatory reasons for a termination when the parties had initially entered into a consensual sexual relationship, but then changed course and rejected the adoption of this presumption in his final decision. The District Court discounted this argument, finding that the hearing examiner never adopted the <em>Keppler </em>presumption, nor was he required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b616 Lowther appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to this Court and raises four issues. However, we decline to address three of these issues because he failed to either raise them below, or properly preserve them for appeal. <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (\u201cThe general rule in Montana is that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory.\u201d). For instance, Lowther argues that the HRC erred in affirming the hearing examiner\u2019s decision on the basis that the Corporation failed to pursue other options prior to terminating Williams. See \u00b6 11. However, Lowther did not raise this issue before the District Court. Similarly, Lowther argues that Williams should be denied relief due to her failure to mitigate damages stemming from her termination. Again, Lowther failed to raise this issue before the District Court. Finally, Lowther argues that he has proved a \u201cmixed motive\u201d case, and that damages were improper under Admin. R. M. 24.9.611. Although he did raise this issue before the District Court, the District Court rejected it because he had not raised it before the hearing examiner. See \u00b6 14. Lowther could have challenged this conclusion under \u00a7 2-4-702(l)(b), MCA, provided he could demonstrate that his failure to raise the argument before the agency was for \u201cgood cause.\u201d However, Lowther has not presented this argument, or even alluded to this statute in his briefs. Thus, we decline to address the foregoing issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b617 We state the remaining issue on appeal as follows: <em>Did the District Court err in affirming the decisions of the HRC and the Department that the Corporation terminated Williams\u2019employment based on illegal sexual discrimination?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b618 \u201cA district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law. We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court order affirming or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>reversing an administrative decision.\u201d <em>Ostergren v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2004 MT 30, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 405, \u00b6 11, 85 P.3d 738, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[pjarties must raise issues and present and develop evidence at the agency level. A district court has no authority to address new evidence on judicial review of agency determinations. As such, this Court is bound by the same limited scope of review.\u201d <em>Ostergren, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b6 19 Lowther argues that Williams failed to prove her termination was due to discrimination based on her sex, and that the Department, HRC, and the District Court, erred in concluding otherwise. In particular, Lowther argues that under <em>Bryson v. Chi. St. U., </em>96 F.3d 912 (7th Cir. 1996), Williams was required to prove she is a member of a protected class, that she was subject to unwanted sexual advances, and that Lowther\u2019s conduct was sexually motivated, but she has failed to do so. Lowther also claims that under <em>Keppler, </em>a presumption arises in this case that his reasons for terminating Williams were due to fallout from their relationship, and not based on sex discrimination, and that Williams has failed to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b620 Williams argues that the District Court, HRC, and the Department correctly determined that she was terminated based on sexual discrimination. Williams argues that even under <em>Keppler, </em>which is arguably supportive of Lowther\u2019s position, she has proven sex discrimination, because <em>Keppler </em>recognizes that \u201cif an employer threatens retaliation to the employee if the employee fails to continue the relationship, there can be an action based on gender or sex.\u201d Williams cites Finding of Fact No. 42 (See \u00b6 14) as support for this conclusion, and points out that Lowther has not alleged this finding, or indeed any of the other findings, are clearly erroneous. Additionally, Williams refutes Lowther\u2019s arguments that she was not subject to unwanted sexual advances. Williams maintains that Lowther\u2019s repeated requests for her to return to the relationship were requests for sexual favors, thus constituting unwanted sexual advances. Finally, Williams argues the hearing examiner correctly concluded that the issue of Lowther\u2019s motivation in resuming their intimate relationship was a question of fact, and that Lowther failed to prove before the examiner that he \u201cwas motivated to return to the former relationship for reasons other than sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b621 The Montana Human Rights Act (MHRA) bans employment discrimination because of sex. Section 49-2-303(l)(a), MCA. Quid pro</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>quo sexual discrimination claims are cognizable under the MHRA. <em>Campbell v. Garden City Plumbing and Heating, </em>2004 MT 231, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 434, \u00b6 15, 97 P.2d 546, \u00b6 15. Because the MHRA is closely-modeled after Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we frequently refer to federal case law in construing the MHRA. <em>Stringer-Altmaier v. Haffner, </em>2006 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 332 Mont. 293, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 138 P.3d 419, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b622 To date, we have not explicitly defined the elements required to make a prima facie case for quid pro quo sex discrimination. The hearing examiner, recognizing this, cited to the definition for actionable sexual harassment as set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11, which was adopted pursuant to Admin. R. M. 24.9.1407. <em>Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 220-221, 797 P.2d 200, 203-204 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual\u2019s employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b623 The hearing examiner further found that under federal law a quid pro quo sexual discrimination claim is properly considered as a \u201cjob detriment claim.\u201d The hearing examiner cited to <em>Priest v. Rotary, </em>634 F. Supp. 571 (N.D. Cal. 1986), where the court equated job detriment claims to situations where \u201ctangible job benefits [are conditioned] on acquiescence to requests for sexual favors or other conduct of a sexual nature ....\u201d <em>Priest, </em>634 F. Supp. at 581. The hearing officer also rejected, as inconsistent with the MHRA, Lowther\u2019s argument that in cases where the alleged sex discrimination follows the ending of a consensual sexual relationship, <em>Keppler </em>requires courts to adopt a presumption that the alleged harassment is fallout from the relationship, and shift the burden to the claimant to show that the conduct was due to sex discrimination. <em>Keppler, </em>715 F. Supp. at 868-69.</p>\n<p id=\"APD\">\u00b624 Before the District Court, and on appeal, Lowther urges us to adopt the <em>Keppler </em>presumption as well as a five-factor test from <em>Bryson </em>which requires claimants to make the following prima facie showing in quid pro quo sex discrimination cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">In order to prove such a claim, many courts of appeal use a five-part test, asking whether the plaintiff has shown (1) that she or he is a member of a protected group, (2) the sexual advances were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>unwelcome, (3) the harassment was sexually motivated, (4) the employee\u2019s reaction to the supervisor\u2019s advances affected a tangible aspect of her employment, and (5) respondeat superior has been established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><em>Bryson, </em>96 F.3d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b625 The District Court declined to adopt this five-factor test, concluding that \u201cthe elements found in the federal Guidelines are the proper method to determine whether an employer has committed <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment. If a party can satisfy the terms found therein, that is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of <em>quid pro quo </em>sexual harassment. There is no need to employ an unnecessarily complicated and overly formalistic test.\u201d Similarly, the District Court rejected the adoption of the <em>Keppler </em>presumption in Montana, noting that its holding has been criticized by other courts. <em>E.g., Babcock v. Frank, </em>729 F. Supp. 279 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). While the District Court acknowledged that a previous consensual relationship may play a role in determining whether sex discrimination has occurred in some cases, the District Court found such a factor inapplicable to the present controversy. As stated by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">[WJhen, as in the instant case, the affair is over and the employer threatens a penalty if the employee will not continue the physical relationship, the employer \u201ccommits illegal sex-based discrimination cognizable\u201d under a <em>quid pro quo </em>claim. <em>Babcock, </em>729 F. Supp. at 288.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b626 Accordingly, the District Court focused its analysis on whether the hearing examiner\u2019s findings supported Williams\u2019 claims of sex discrimination. The District Court concluded that they did, see \u00b6 13, and rejected Lowther\u2019s attempts to rebut this showing \u201cby characterizing his efforts to win Respondent back as motivated by his desire to continue their romantic relationship and not by a desire for sexual intercourse with an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b627 We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion. Lowther has provided no persuasive reason to adopt the multi-factor <em>Bryson </em>test, or the <em>Keppler </em>presumption. Instead, we will continue looking to both our body of case law and the federal guidelines in resolving sex discrimination claims. <em>Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 220-221, 797 P.2d at 203-04. As noted by the district court in <em>Savino v. C.P. Hall Co., </em>988 F. Supp. 1171 (N.D. Ill. 1997), \u201c[on] the quid pro quo question ... the [Supreme] Court [has] noted that the E.E.O.C.\u2019s Guidelines on Sexual Harassment \u2018constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>Savino, </em>988 F. Supp. at 1181 (quoting <em>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB, v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b628  As Williams notes, Lowther does not challenge as clearly erroneous the hearing examiner\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 42 that even after he terminated her employment he offered Williams the choice of having her job back if she resumed the intimate relationship. The assertion by Lowther that this overture was not sexually motivated strains the bounds of credulity. This finding, in light of Lowther\u2019s repeated efforts to condition Williams\u2019 employment on continuation of the intimate relationship, demonstrates that \u201csubmission to or rejection of such conduct by [Williams was] used as the basis for employment decisions affecting [her] <em>....\u2019\u2019Harrison, </em>244 Mont. at 220-221, 797 P.2d at 203-04 (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(a)). Thus, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b629  We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision upholding the award of damages by the Department and HRC to Williams due to illegal sex discrimination by Lowther and the Corporation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> \u201cMixed motive\u201d cases are situations where there may be other, nondiscriminatory reasons for a decision to terminate. <em>E.g., Laudert v.

Bosley, </em>165 F.3d 635, 641 (8th Cir. 1999) (J. Loken, concurring) (writing separately to distinguish between personal animus from discrimination because of gender). <em>See also Succar v. Dade County School Bd., </em>229 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding the \u201charassment... was motivated not by his male gender, but rather by [the former lover\u2019s] contempt for [plaintiff] following their failed relationship; [plaintiffs] gender was merely coincidental.\u201d); <em>accord Pipkins v. City of Temple Terrace, Fla., </em>267 F.3d 1197, 1200 (11th Cir. 2001); <em>but see Lipphardt v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1183 (11th Cir. 2001). However, that distinction hinges upon a fact-intensive inquiry. Here, Lowther does not challenge the agency\u2019s finding that he gave Williams an ultimatum which was \u201csexual\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>nature; that is, resume the sexual relationship or be fired. Since Lowther has not challenged that finding, he is unable to effectively contest the conclusion that his offer was a quid pro quo sexual harassment. Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
