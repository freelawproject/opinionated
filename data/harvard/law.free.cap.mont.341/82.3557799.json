We affirm in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b62 Smith raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges based on a violation of his right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">\u00b65 On March 11,2002, probation and parole officer Kathleen Beccari (Beccari) met with probationer Mark Doman (Doman). At the time, Doman was living in Missoula, Montana, with his girlfriend Delores Shepherd (Shepherd). Shepherd\u2019s sister, Darlene Garcia (Garcia), who also was on probation, was supposed to be living at the same residence with Doman and Shepherd. Doman informed Beccari that Garcia had not lived with them for several months and, instead, had been living with her boyfriend Smith in a trailer on the Pruyn Ranch. Beccari reported this information to Garcia\u2019s probation officer, Tom Forsyth (Forsyth). Forsyth contacted Shepherd, who confirmed that Garcia had not lived with Doman and Shepherd for several months and was living with Smith. Forsyth met with Garcia the following day and Garcia admitted that, although she previously reported she lived with Doman and Shepherd, she actually was living with Smith on the Pruyn Ranch. Garcia then submitted to a drug test, which tested positive for methamphetamine, and she was arrested for violating the conditions of her probation. Based on the unreported change in residence and the positive drug test, Forsyth also determined a probation search of Garcia\u2019s residence at the Pruyn Ranch was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u00b66 Later that day, Forsyth, Beccari, a third probation officer, and officers from the Missoula County Sheriffs Office accompanied Garcia to the Pruyn Ranch. Garcia indicated she was fearful of Smith\u2019s reaction to a search of the trailer and stated she did not have a key to the trailer. The officers gained entry by prying open the trailer\u2019s back door. Upon searching, the officers found weapons, drug paraphernalia, and items used to manufacture and distribute drugs. They also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Garcia\u2019s purse and located some of her clothing in a closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b67 After searching the trailer, the officers decided to apply for a search warrant to search a bus parked near the trailer. While they waited for the search warrant to arrive, Smith drove up to the trailer in a pickup truck. Based on the drug-related items found in the trailer, as well as one officer\u2019s knowledge that Smith\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended, Smith was arrested. In a search of his person incident to the arrest, officers discovered a large amount of cash, a marijuana pipe and a vial which Smith admitted contained methamphetamine. The officers later obtained a search warrant for Smith\u2019s truck and discovered a leather pouch containing nine bindles of methamphetamine. The search of the bus revealed chemical precursors to methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b68 On April 16,2002, the State of Montana (State) charged Smith by information with felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs and misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. The State amended the information on June 10, 2002, to add a third charge of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute. Smith moved to suppress all evidence obtained in the searches. The District Court denied Smith\u2019s motion to suppress on February 3,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">\u00b69 The District Court eventually scheduled a jury trial for August 11, 2004. In late June of2004, Smith moved to dismiss the charges against him on the basis that his constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated. The District Court denied this motion. The court then vacated the trial setting without rescheduling the trial, and nothing further happened in this matter until the District Court ordered the parties to appear for a status conference on April 5, 2005. After several continuances of the status conference, the court scheduled the trial for November 9, 2005. On June 28, 2005, Smith again moved to dismiss the charges against him based on lack of a speedy trial. The District Court held a hearing and denied Smith\u2019s motion. Subsequently, in February of2006, Smith appeared in the District Court and pled guilty to the offenses of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia pursuant to a plea agreement with the State, reserving his right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motions. The District Court accepted Smith\u2019s guilty pleas, sentenced him, and entered judgment on the convictions and sentences. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b610 <em>1. Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>suppress evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b611 Smith\u2019s motion to suppress all the evidence seized during the searches in this case asserted that the initial warrantless search of his trailer was unlawful because it was not justified as a probation search or by any other exception to the search warrant requirement. As a result, according to Smith, the subsequent searches of his person, bus and pickup truck also were unlawful as emanating from the initial unlawful search of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b612 The District Court determined that Garcia\u2019s unreported change in residence and positive drug test gave her probation officer, Forsyth, reasonable cause to conduct a probationary search of Garcia\u2019s new residence, which was Smith\u2019s trailer. The court further determined that Smith\u2019s subsequent arrest, the search of his person pursuant to that arrest, and the searches of his vehicles pursuant to warrants all were lawful. Consequently, the District Court denied Smith\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Smith asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its interpretation and application of the law correct. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>2006 MT 202, \u00b6 8, 333 Mont. 215, \u00b6 8, 142 P.3d 806, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b614 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution guarantee an individual\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. It is well-established that a search conducted in the absence of a properly issued warrant based on probable cause is <em>per se </em>unreasonable absent a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See e.g. State v. Copelton, </em>2006 MT 182, \u00b6 10, 333 Mont. 91, \u00b6 10, 140 P.3d 1074, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b615 A search of a probationer\u2019s residence or effects, however, may be conducted without a search warrant and pursuant to the lesser standard of \u201creasonable cause,\u201d rather than probable cause. <em>Fritz, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>State v. Kriesel, </em>2000 MT 144, \u00b6 12, 300 Mont. 44, \u00b6 12, 2 P.3d 831, \u00b6 12. The rationale for applying the lesser standard is that a probationer has a diminished expectation of privacy and a supervising probation officer is in a better position to determine the level of supervision necessary to provide rehabilitation to the probationer and safety to the community. <em>Fritz, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Kriesel, </em>\u00b6 13. Determining the existence of reasonable cause to conduct a probationary search involves a factual inquiry based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Fritz, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Kriesel, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b616 Smith argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that Forsyth had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sufficient information on which to determine Garcia was living at Smith\u2019s trailer on the Pruyn Ranch is clearly erroneous and cannot support the court\u2019s further finding that Forsyth had reasonable cause to conduct a probationary search of the trailer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b617 Garcia had been reporting to Forsyth that she resided with Shepherd and Dornan. On March 11, 2002, however, Dornan\u2019s probation officer informed Forsyth that Dornan had stated Garcia was currently living with Smith at the trailer on the Pruyn Ranch. Forsyth then spoke directly with Shepherd, who confirmed that Garcia was no longer living with her and Dornan, but was living with Smith. Furthermore, Garcia met with Forsyth on March 12, 2002, and admitted she was living with Smith and had failed to inform Forsyth of her change in residence. Thus, Forsyth had first-hand information-including Garcia\u2019s own admission-that Garcia was living with Smith and had changed her residence in violation of the conditions of her probation. We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding of fact in this regard is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b618 In addition, Garcia provided a urine sample for drug testing at Forsyth\u2019s request during their March 12 meeting. The drug test showed a positive result for methamphetamine use. Thus, Forsyth had the additional information that Garcia was using drugs in violation of her probation conditions, and reason to believe evidence of drugs and drug use might be found at her residence. We agree with the District Court that, under the totality of the circumstances-including Garcia\u2019s unreported change of residence and positive drug test-Forsyth had reasonable cause to search Smith\u2019s trailer on the Pruyn Ranch where Garcia currently was living. Thus, we further conclude that the search of Smith\u2019s trailer was justified as a probationary search.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b619 Smith also argues, however, that Forsyth\u2019s probationary search of his trailer was unlawful because Forsyth failed to follow policies and procedures set by the Montana Department of Corrections Probation and Parole Bureau, in that Forsyth \u201cfailed to verify [Garcia] lived at the trailer, that she had Smith\u2019s permission to live at the trailer and that Smith understood the implications of allowing [Garcia] to live in the trailer.\u201d However, Smith fails to cite the specific policies and procedures he asserts were violated and fails to provide legal authority in support of his contention that a violation of such policies or procedures would render a probationary search unlawful. We do not address arguments which are not supported by citation to legal authority. <em>See e.g. State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 22, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 22; M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u00b620  Having determined that the search of Smith\u2019s trailer was legally justified as a probationary search of Garcia\u2019s residence, and absent any other challenge by Smith to the legality of the searches of his person and vehicles, we conclude the District Court did not err in determining these searches were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b621  We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court err in denying Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges based on a violation of his right to a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b623 Smith moved the District Court to dismiss the charges against him on two occasions, asserting the State had violated his right to a speedy trial. The District Court denied both motions. In its second order denying Smith\u2019s motion, the court observed that, although it found the length of delay in bringing the case to trial troubling, the State had met its burden of establishing the delay had not prejudiced Smith. Thus, the court determined Smith\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated. Smith contends the District Court\u2019s conclusion in this regard is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b624 On appeal, both Smith and the State analyze this speedy trial issue pursuant to the standards we originally set forth in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866. However, after the parties briefed this appeal, we rendered our decision in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, in which we established a new framework for analyzing speedy trial claims. Thus, neither the District Court nor the parties had the opportunity to analyze the speedy trial issue under this new framework. We deem it appropriate that the District Court apply the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis in the first instance. For that reason, we decline to resolve this issue and, instead, remand it to the District Court without prejudice to a timely appeal thereafter by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b625 Affirmed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b107-10\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AuI\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b626 I concur in our Opinion as to Issue 1.1 dissent from our Opinion as to Issue 2 for the same reasons that I dissented from our remand order in <em>State v.
