We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to consider and grant the State\u2019s petition to revoke Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence prior to Morrison beginning to serve the five-year suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b64 On January 10,2005, Morrison entered a plea agreement whereby he pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, his fourth or subsequent offense, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. The District Court sentenced Morrison to the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) for thirteen months followed by a consecutive, suspended sentence to the Montana State Prison (MSP) for five years with conditions. As a part of Morrison\u2019s thirteen-month sentence he was to be \u201cscreened for placement at the Warm Springs Addictions Treatment &amp; Change Program WATCh\u2019 by the Department of Corrections\u201d and upon successful completion of WATCh, or a chemical dependency treatment program determined by the DOC, the remainder of his thirteen-month sentence was to be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b65 On August 19, 2005, Morrison filed a pro se motion for an order suspending the balance of his thirteen-month sentence because he had completed an Intensive Treatment Program Unit (ITU). The State initially opposed the motion because the ITU program is not as intensive as the WATCh program. However, the parties eventually stipulated that Morrison had successfully completed a qualifying chemical dependency treatment program. As a result, the remaining seven months of Morrison\u2019s thirteen-month incarceration were suspended, and he was released from MSP. As a condition of his release, Morrison was instructed to \u201c[rjeport in person to John Uden, Miles City Probation and Parole, on November 14,2005.\u201d Morrison did not contact Officer Uden. On December 5, 2005, the County Attorney filed a petition to revoke Morrison\u2019s suspended sentence on the basis of his failure to satisfy the \u201creporting\u201d condition of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b66 At the revocation hearing, Morrison moved to dismiss the petition, contending that, pursuant to \u00a7 67-8-731, MCA, the remainder of the thirteen-month sentence was not a \u201csuspended sentence\u201d but rather a probationary period that could not be revoked by filing a petition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>revoke a suspended sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Morrison also argued that the petition to revoke was untimely filed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, because in order to revoke the five-year suspended sentence the petition must be \u201cfiled during the period of suspension.\u201d In sum, Morrison contended that the court should dismiss the State\u2019s petition as erroneously filed.</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">\u00b67 In defense of its petition, the State clarified that it sought to revoke only the five-year suspended sentence and not the remainder of the thirteen-month sentence. The State also argued that the thirteen-month sentence and the five-year suspended sentence \u201cstacked\u201d together, allowing for revocation of the five-year suspended sentence based on a violation occurring while Morrison served the remainder of his thirteen-month sentence on probation. The District Court agreed with the State. First, the court concluded that there was no difference between a probationary period and a suspended sentence and, consequently, the remainder of the thirteen-month sentence was a \u201csuspended sentence\u201d that could be revoked. Morrison has not challenged this conclusion on appeal. Second, the court concluded that the thirteen-month and five-year suspended sentences \u201cstacked,\u201d such that the court could properly hear the petition to revoke the five-year suspended sentence based on a violation occurring during the thirteen-month sentence. Accordingly, the court denied Morrison\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b68 At the conclusion of the hearing, the court determined that Morrison had \u201cviolated the condition of probation and suspended sentences\u201d for \u201cboth the 13-month and the five-year\u201d sentences. Subsequently, the court revoked both the remainder of Morrison\u2019s thirteen-month sentence and his five-year sentence, committing him to the DOC for \u201cfive years and one month[.]\u201d Morrison appeals the revocation of his five-year suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s suspended sentence to determine if there was an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>2007 MT 217, \u00b6 8, 339 Mont. 45, \u00b6 8, 167 P.3d 405, \u00b6 8. Where the issue is whether the court had authority to take a specific action, the question is one of law, and our review is plenary. <em>State v. Richardson, </em>2000 MT 72, \u00b6 8, 299 Mont. 102, \u00b6 8, 997 P.2d 786, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b610 As a preliminary matter, we address Morrison\u2019s argument that the State has raised a new theory on appeal and that \u201c[flor this reason alone, the Court should reject the [State\u2019s] argument.\u201d We deem issues which are presented for the first time on appeal to be untimely and will not consider them. <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12. \u201cA party may not raise new arguments or change its legal theory on appeal because it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>Adgerson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"AhJ0\">\u00b611 The State argues on appeal that \u201cMorrison was serving a single sentence for a single offense, which became an entirely suspended sentence when Morrison was placed on probation.\u201d The State contends that the \u201csuspended terms have to merge\u201d in order to encourage rehabilitation and avoid the absurd result of permitting a \u201cprobationer to violate at the end of the 13-month DOC commitment without risking possible revocation of the remaining five-year (or less) suspended sentence.\u201d Morrison replies that the State\u2019s argument that the suspended sentences \u201cmerge\u201d into a \u201csingle sentence\u201d is a new theory on appeal because at the revocation hearing the State argued that Morrison had two separate sentences, albeit \u201cstacking\u201d together. Essentially, Morrison\u2019s change in theory complaint stems from the State\u2019s assertion of \u201cstacking\u201d two sentences in the District Court versus the State\u2019s assertion of one \u201cmerged\u201d sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b612 However, whether using the \u201cstacked\u201d or \u201cmerged\u201d theory, the underlying premise of the State\u2019s argument is the same: that a violation occurring during the thirteen-month sentence provides a basis for revoking the five-year suspended sentence even though the violation occurred prior to commencement of that part of the sentence. Accordingly, the difference between the \u201cmerge\u201d and \u201cstack\u201d theories is de minimus and does not merit complete rejection of the State\u2019s argument on appeal. Moreover, whether we consider the thirteen-month sentence and five-year sentence as separate and consecutive or as a combined sentence, they arise out of the same sentencing order for the same underlying offense, and therefore, the jurisdictional issue Morrison raises on appeal remains and must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b613 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to consider and grant the State\u2019s petition to revoke Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence prior to Morrison beginning to serve the five-year suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b614 Morrison argues that the District Court did not have jurisdiction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to revoke his five-year suspended sentence prior to commencement of that portion of his sentence. Although acknowledging our holdings to the contrary in <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. 395, 642 P.2d 1008 (1982), and <em>Matter of Ratzlaff, </em>172 Mont. 439, 564 P.2d 1312 (1977), Morrison notes the language of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA, referencing the filing of a revocation petition \u201cduring the period of suspension or deferral,\u201d and asserts that the 1983 amendment to this statute now prohibits a district court from revoking a suspended sentence unless the petition is filed after the period of suspension has begun. Morrison asserts that, as a result of the 1983 amendment, our prior decisions are no longer valid authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Sullivan, </em>the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence was revoked while he was on parole from his prison sentence and before he had begun serving the suspended portion of his sentence. <em>Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. at 399, 642 P.2d at 1010. In approving of the prior revocation of Sullivan\u2019s suspended sentence, we relied on our previous decision in <em>Ratzlaff, </em>which we determined answered Sullivan\u2019s contention \u201cin spirit if not factually[.]\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. at 400, 642 P.2d at 1010. In <em>Ratzlaff, </em>the defendant was sentenced to twenty-five years in MSP with ten years suspended. Ratzlaff was released on parole after serving approximately three years in prison and subsequently violated the conditions of his release. As a result, the district court revoked his ten-year suspended sentence for violations of both probationary and parole conditions, <em>Ratzlaff, </em>172 Mont. at 441, 564 P.2d at 1313, and he petitioned this Court for post-conviction relief. We denied the petition, and as we later explained in <em>Sullivan, </em>our decision in <em>Ratzlaff </em>was based on the \u201cnecessary implication that a suspended sentence may be revoked before the defendant actually begins serving probation.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. at 400, 642 P.2d at 1010. We further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">What comes out of these cases is the strong public policy that if a person convicted of a crime, and granted a period of probation as part of the sentence, should commit offenses of such nature as to demonstrate to the court that he is unworthy of probation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>court has the power to revoke or change the order of probation both during the period of probation, and before the period of probation commences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><em>Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. at 401, 642 P.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b616 We reaffirmed <em>Sullivan </em>in <em>Christofferson v. State, </em>272 Mont. 518, 901 P.2d 588 (1995). There, the district court revoked the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence while he was still on parole and prior to the beginning of his suspended sentence. We stated that \u201ca suspension of sentence may be revoked for acts of a probationer after sentence is imposed but before the probationer actually begins serving the suspended sentence.\u201d <em>Christofferson, </em>272 Mont. at 521, 901 P.2d at 589. Then, in <em>State v. Vallier, </em>2000 MT 225, 301 Mont. 228, 8 P.3d 112, we extended the <em>Sullivan </em>holding to incarcerated persons, concluding that where an individual has not met the terms and conditions of his suspended sentence, such as completion of a sexual offender treatment program while incarcerated, the suspended sentence may be revoked, even before the individual actually begins serving the suspended sentence. <em>Vallier, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b617 Section 46-18-203, MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">(1) Upon the filling of a petition for revocation showing probable cause that the offender has violated any condition of a sentence or any condition of a deferred imposition of sentence the judge may issue an order for a hearing on revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">(2) The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court during the period of suspension or deferral. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Prior to 1983, the language in subsection (2) of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, did not exist as a separate subsection. Rather, \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1981), read in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">A judge, magistrate, or justice of the peace who has suspended the execution of a sentence or deferred the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment under 46-18-201 or his successor is authorized, <em>during the period of the suspended sentence or deferred imposition of sentence, </em>in his discretion, to revoke the suspension or impose sentence and order the person committed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYs\">The 1983 amendment deleted the above-emphasized language from this paragraph and placed similar language under the new subsection (2). Introduced as Senate Bill 409, the amendment was passed by the 1983 Session without contention. The bill was filed at the request of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Department of Justice and testimony from an Assistant Attorney General indicated that the amendment was a reaction to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Felix v. Mohler, </em>195 Mont. 391, 636 P.2d 830 (1981). In <em>Felix, </em>this Court, applying \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA (1981), held that a district court\u2019s jurisdiction to revoke a suspended sentence or a deferred sentence only extended \u201cthrough the running of the suspended or deferred sentence, regardless of whether a petition for revocation [had] been filed prior to the termination of the suspended or deferred sentence.\u201d <em>Felix, </em>195 Mont. at 394, 636 P.2d at 832. According to the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, <em>Felix </em>effectively gave probationers serving a suspended or deferred sentence \u201ca <em>carte blanche </em>to violate the conditions of their probation at any time during the final days of their probation because the court [would] be unable to hold a hearing on the petition\u201d prior to expiration of the probation, \u201ceven if a petition to revoke [was] filed during the period of suspension or deferral.\u201d The addition of language within new subsection (2) of the statute addressed this problem by clarifying that the court could act upon a petition to revoke \u201ceven after the period of suspension or deferral [had] run ....\u201d Thus, the 1983 amendment had no impact upon the prior decisions addressing a court\u2019s authority to revoke a suspended or deferred sentence upon a petition filed prior to the commencement of a suspended or deferred sentence, and decisions thereafter have continued to apply this rule. Contrary to Morrison\u2019s contention, <em>Sullivan </em>and these other cases remain good law and support this interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b618  Here, Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence was revoked pursuant to a petition filed prior to commencement of that sentence and while he was still serving the remainder of his thirteen-month DUI sentence. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, and as explained in <em>Sullivan, Christofferson, </em>and <em>Vallier, </em>the District Court had authority to revoke Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence prior to the start of that sentence when a petition for revocation asserting a violation of condition was filed. The State filed such a petition to revoke Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence based on his failure to report to his supervising officer while completing his thirteen-month sentence on probation. The District Court held a revocation hearing, heard testimony from Officer Uden, as well as Morrison, and determined that Morrison understood the condition to report to Officer Uden but failed to do so. Morrison does not allege that this finding was an abuse of discretion or is unsupported by the evidence, only that the District Court lacked authority to revoke his suspended sentence. As explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>herein, the District Court had such authority pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> Morrison has not renewed this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> While Morrison argues that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition to revoke his sentence, we note that the court had personal jurisdiction over Morrison and had general subject matter jurisdiction over revocation petitions. Although \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, uses the term \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d Morrison\u2019s argument is more properly framed as a challenge to the court\u2019s statutory authority to revoke Morrison\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b174-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AG5n\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b620 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision. Morrison was originally sentenced on March 7, 2005, for felony DUI committed on or about February 19, 2004. That being the case, the 2003 version of the code applies. <em>State v. Oie, </em>2007 MT 328, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 205, \u00b6 10, 174 P.3d 937, \u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 24, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 24 (\u201cthe law in effect at the time of the crime controls as to the possible sentence.\u201d)). As the Court points out at \u00b6 4, as to Count I, the DUI count, the trial court imposed the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Defendant is committed to the Montana Department of Corrections for a term of thirteen (13) months, in addition to a consecutive, suspended commitment to Montana State Prison for a term of five (5) years. The Defendant shall be screened for placement at the Warm Springs Addictions Treatment &amp; Change Program \u2018WATCh\u201d by the Department of Corrections. Upon successful completion of the WATCh\u201d program, or chemical dependancy [sic] treatment program placement determined by the Department of Corrections, the balance of the sentence is suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b621 Morrison was released from prison on November 10, 2005, to begin serving the probationary period <em>of his 13-month commitment to DOC. </em>The State filed its petition to revoke on December 5, 2005. Morrison\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the petition on the basis that tinder \u00a746-18-203, MCA-quoted by the Court at \u00b6 17-the petition must be filed during the suspended portion of the sentence. Morrison argued that he had not yet served his full 13-month sentence, and that sentence was not suspended. Rather, he was still serving his probationary sentence. In response, the prosecutor made clear that the State sought revocation of the five-year DOC sentence, not what was left of the 13-month sentence. Specifically, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax_a\">[W]e\u2019re not asking for revocation of the 13 months. We're actually asking for revocation of the five-year DOC sentence. And as I recall the sentences, they stack. And when there is a violation during the first one, there is case law where you can revoke both the first and the second. We're really-we're not messing around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>with the 13-month sentence. We're really just looking at the five years here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b622 The trial court denied Morrison\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating that it considered Morrison to be serving a suspended sentence, that the 13-month and five-year sentences \u201cstack,\u201d \u201cand that the State is not asking that the balance of the 13-month be suspended, but only the succeeding five-year sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b623 With that background, I first address the Court\u2019 determination at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12 that the State did not change its theory on appeal. I conclude that it did so. It was clear that at the District Court both the prosecutor and the trial judge considered the 13-month probationary sentence and the five-year DOC sentence to be separate-the second \u201cstacked\u201d upon the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b624 On appeal, however, the State totally abandons the prosecutor\u2019s theory of separate sentences and, instead, advances the theory that Morrison was serving a single sentence, the suspended portion of which commenced when Morrison was placed on probation. According to the State-and without citation to any authority whatsoever-\u201cMorrison was serving a single sentence for a single offense, which became an entirely suspended sentence when Morrison was placed on probation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b625 The Court glosses over this change in theory concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s theory in the trial court and the State\u2019s theory on appeal amount to the same argument. Opinion, \u00b6 12. While that may be a convenient way to save the State\u2019s case, there is a very important difference in the two theories. Under the prosecutor\u2019s theory-that there are separate \u201cstacked\u201d sentences-the trial court would not have had authority to revoke Morrison\u2019s sentence because under \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA, the petition to revoke had to be filed \u201cduring the period of suspension.\u201d It is undisputed from the record before us that Morrison\u2019s five-year suspended sentence had not yet begun to run. He was still serving the probationary portion of his 13-month commitment. However, under the State\u2019s newly devised appeal theory, the 13-month probationary period and the five-year suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>sentence were not \u201cstacked\u201d but were simply one long sentence. With the result, of course, that the petition was filed \u201cduring\u201d the suspended portion of the sentence in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b626 I would not address the State\u2019s appeal argument for two reasons. First, as noted, the State changed its theory on appeal in violation of the very rule cited by the Court at \u00b6 10, from <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12, and the legion of cases that follow this rule. <em>See State v.

Ely, </em>2003 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 316 Mont. 169, \u00b6 9, 69 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 9; <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Shook, </em>2002 MT 347, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 347, \u00b6 19, 67 P.3d 863, \u00b6 19, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 815, 124 S. Ct. 67 (2003); <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 5, 313 Mont. 218, \u00b6 5, 61 P.3d 749, \u00b6 5. Second, the State cites no authority whatsoever for its newly created \u201cone-sentence\u201d theory. The State bears the burden of supporting with authority its arguments on appeal just as a defendant does. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25, 293 Mont. 490, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25, 977 P.2d 983, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25 (this Court declined to address the State\u2019s argument regarding a warrantless search because the State failed to cite to any legal authority in support of its argument). Our decision here effectively establishes a double standard for parties who change theories on appeal and who fail to cite authority for an appellate argument. A defendant gets hammered if he or she does it, but the State gets away with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b627 Finally, I disagree with the Court\u2019s re-affirmance of <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. 395, 642 P.2d 1008 <em>(1982); Matter of Ratzlaff, </em>172 Mont. 439, 564 P.2d 1312 (1977); <em>Christofferson v. State, </em>272 Mont. 518, 901 P.2d 588 (1995); and <em>State v. Vallier, </em>2000 MT 225, 301 Mont. 228, 8 P.3d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b628 Morrison correctly points out <em>that Ratzlaff and Sullivan </em>involved a different version of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, which stated, in relevant part, that the sentencing judge who had imposed the suspended sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>had the authority to revoke that suspension \u201cduring the period of the suspended sentence.\u201d In deciding <em>Sullivan, </em>this Court wrongly relied on <em>Ratzlaff </em>to hold that by necessary implication a suspended sentence may be revoked before the defendant actually begins serving probation. <em>Sullivan, </em>197 Mont. at 400-01, 642 P.2d at 1010-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b629 The same statutory language was at issue in <em>Felix v. Mohler, </em>195 Mont. 391, 636 P.2d 830 (1981), which, however, presented a slightly different situation. In <em>Felix, </em>the petition was filed before the suspension ran out, but the hearing was not held during the period of suspension. <em>Felix, </em>195 Mont. at 392, 636 P.2d at 831. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State argues that it was this case that prompted the Legislature to amend \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b630 For whatever reason, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, in 1983, and deleted the statutory requirement that the <em>hearing </em>be held during the period of the suspended sentence and, instead, inserted a new provision which required that the <em>petition to revoke be filed </em>during the period of suspended sentence. Morrison argues that a plain reading of this current statute requires that the petition be filed during the period of suspension. That is, of course, precisely what the statutory language mandates. Accordingly, Morrison contends that the former trilogy of <em>cases-Ratzlaff, Sullivan </em>and Mohler-is no longer valid interpretational authority for the current version of the statute. He is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b631 Furthermore, <em>Christofferson, </em>a <em>pro se </em>case decided in 1995 long after \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, had been amended, uncritically relied on <em>Sullivan. Christofferson, </em>272 Mont. at 521, 901 P.2d at 589. And, in <em>Vallier, </em>the defendant, relying on <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Christofferson, </em>conceded that the district court could revoke his suspended sentence before it actually began. <em>Vallier, </em>\u00b6 9. The interpretational issue here was neither raised nor addressed in either case. Morrison does not make such a concession. I conclude that we decided <em>Christofferson </em>and <em>Vallier </em>wrongly, and I would overrule both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b632 For the foregoing reasons I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> The State then goes on to solicitously argue that this sort of sentence was \u201cordained\u201d by \u00a7 61-8-731(l)(a) and (b) \u201cthe purpose of which is to encourage treatment.\u201d The State plays fast and loose with this Court. The State argued quite the opposite in <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194, when this argument was made by the defendant. See Appellant\u2019s opening brief, pp. 19-21, and the State\u2019s reply brief pp. 24-27, in Cause No. 04-294. More to the point, this Court rejected the now proffered \u201ctreatment\u201d theory. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-41; <em>Damon, </em>\u00a7\u00b6\u00b6 65-88 (Nelson, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
