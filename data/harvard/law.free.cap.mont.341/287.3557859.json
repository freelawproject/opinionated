The Decree incorporated a Marital and Property Settlement Agreement. The Agreement included separate sections providing for maintenance and distribution of the marital estate. The maintenance provisions required that Florian make monthly payments to Charlene through 2009, pay Charlene\u2019s health insurance for eighteen months, and pay the remaining debt on one of Charlene\u2019s credit cards. The Agreement includes a paragraph stating: \u201cThe parties specifically agree that provisions for maintenance herein are non-modifiable.\u201d There is no provision in the agreement that Florian\u2019s maintenance obligation would continue in the event Charlene remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">\u00b64 On December 29, 2005, Charlene remarried. In February 2006, Florian filed a motion to terminate his maintenance obligation, arguing that it ended by operation of law when Charlene remarried. On July 3,2006, the District Court, treating Florian\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment, entered an Order and Judgment terminating his obligation to continue making maintenance payments. Charlene now appeals from this Order and Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">\u00b65 We review a summary judgment ruling de novo. <em>Fulton v. Fulton, </em>2004 MT 240, \u00b6 6, 322 Mont. 516, \u00b6 6, 97 P.3d 573, \u00b6 6. Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b66 Section 40-4-208(4), MCA, provides: \u201cUnless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, the obligation to pay future maintenance is terminated upon ... the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b67  If a separation agreement contains no express provision which addresses the termination of a maintenance obligation provided for therein, remarriage of the party receiving maintenance terminates the maintenance obligation, unless maintenance payments are intended as part of the property division. <em>Bertagnolli v. Bertagnolli, </em>185 Mont. 1, 4, 604 P.2d 299, 301 (1979). We conclude that pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(4), Florian\u2019s maintenance obligation to Charlene ended when she remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b68 Charlene is correct that when a separation agreement provides that maintenance payments are \u201cin the nature of a property settlement,\u201d remarriage will not terminate a maintenance obligation. <em>In re Marriage of Hahn, </em>263 Mont. 315, 322, 868 P.2d 599, 603 (1994). Such language in the separation agreement at issue in <em>Hahn </em>was sufficient to defeat the operation of \u00a7 40-4-208(4). However, there is no provision in the separation agreement at issue here which could be construed to make the monthly payments from Florian to Charlene a part of the property distribution. To the contrary, the property distribution and maintenance provisions are in separate sections of the agreement. Likewise, the separation agreement\u2019s provisions concerning its tax consequences reiterate that only the provisions in the maintenance section-monthly payments, health insurance, and payments on one particular credit card-constitute maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b69 Montana law also provides that a decree of dissolution may \u201cexpressly preclude or limit modification of terms set forth in the decree.\u201d Section 40-4-201(6), MCA. If an agreement between parties limits modification, a District Court must adhere to the non-modification clause and cannot later modify the agreement. <em>In re Marriage of Bolstad, </em>203 Mont. 131, 135, 660 P.2d 95, 97 (1983). Similar to the agreement in this case, <em>Bolstad </em>involved a separation agreement that expressly precluded modification. However, the petition to reduce maintenance in <em>Bolstad </em>was based on an alleged inability to pay. <em>Bolstad, </em>203 Mont. at 134, 660 P.2d at 96. It did not involve a situation where the party receiving maintenance remarried. <em>Bolstad </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u00b610 The dissent, while acknowledging that the separation agreement does not mention remarriage, would add to it a provision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Charlene\u2019s remarriage does not terminate maintenance. Such an addition would be contrary to the Comb\u2019s role in interpreting contracts: \u201cIn the construction of an instrument, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-4-101, MCA. <em>See also Anderson v. Stokes, </em>2007 MT 166, \u00b6 46, 338 Mont. 118, \u00b6 46, 163 P.3d 1273, \u00b6 46 (relying on the plain language in an easement grant and declining to insert additional words into the grant); <em>Wurl v. Polson School Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 20, 330 Mont. 282, \u00b6 20, 127 P.3d 436, \u00b6 20 (declining to interpret an employment contract to insert additional language not in the contract itself); <em>Creveling v. Ingold, </em>2006 MT 57, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 322, \u00b6 12, 132 P.3d 531, \u00b6 12 (concluding that \u201cit is not the proper role of the judiciary to insert modifying language into clearly written and unambiguous instruments where the parties to the instrument declined to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AZD\">\u00b611 Both \u00a7 40-4-208(4), MCA, and \u00a7 40-4-201(6), MCA, concern the subject of dissolution of marriage. Section 40-4-208(4), MCA, is a separate, specific statute providing that maintenance will terminate if the party receiving it remarries, unless it is expressly agreed otherwise or specifically provided in the decree. Section 40-4-201(6), MCA, is a statute which applies generally to provisions in separation agreements, which provides that the parties may, if they so desire, limit the court\u2019s ability to later modify their agreement. These two statutory provisions are not necessarily inconsistent because both can potentially be applied to the same agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where statutes relate to the same general subject they should be construed together, where there is no inconsistency between them, so as to give effect to both where possible. <em>City of Billings v. Smith, </em>158 Mont. 197, 212, 490 P.2d 221, 230 (1971); <em>State ex rel. Ronish v. School District No. 1 of Fergus County, </em>136 Mont. 453, 462, 348 P.2d 797, 802 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b612  Taking \u00a7 40-4-208(4) and \u00a7 40-4-201(6) together, we discern the legislative intent to be that upon the remarriage of a party receiving maintenance, maintenance will terminate by operation of law, even if the separation agreement provides that the agreement cannot be modified. For maintenance to continue after the receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>party remarries, a written separation agreement or a court decree must include an express provision that maintenance will not terminate on remarriage of the party receiving maintenance. Thus, despite the non-modification provision in the Agreement, Florian\u2019s maintenance obligation to Charlene ended by operation of law when she remarried. \u00b613 There are no material facts in issue, and the District Court applied the law correctly. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\"> For example, in the present ease, if Florian had petitioned to modify his maintenance obligation as it somehow became unconscionable, a possibility provided for by \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, the Court would not have the authority to grant the petition as the agreement invokes \u00a7 40-4-201(6), MCA, to prevent a modification. Nevertheless, \u00a7 40-4-208(4), MCA, applies to terminate maintenance upon Charlene\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b311-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ApK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b614 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion in \u00b6 7 that, pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(4), MCA, Florian\u2019s maintenance obligation to Charlene ended when she remarried. I would reverse the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b615 The maintenance provisions in the Marital and Property Settlement Agreement incorporated into the decree of dissolution required Florian to pay Charlene a certain sum each month, beginning April 1, 2005, as maintenance. The final payment was to be made on December 1, 2009. In my view, the date certain for the final payment of maintenance-while not referencing remarriage-is an agreement in writing regarding the obligation to pay future maintenance pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(4), MCA. I would enforce the Agreement incorporated into the decree by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b616 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
