We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b62 On July 16, 2005, Missoula County Sheriffs Reserve Deputies Jarret Hoke and Audrey Kramer were on a special patrol of the Johnsrud Recreational Area of the Blackfoot River in Missoula County. As Hoke was completing a routine traffic stop on Highway 200, Ashmore drove by at a high rate of speed honking her horn continually. Hoke subsequently stopped her for Unnecessary Use of a Horn or Other Warning Device, a misdemeanor under \u00a7 61-9-401(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u00b63 During the traffic stop Ashmore was angry and belligerent towards Hoke. Initially, she threw her driver\u2019s license and registration towards Hoke, but then handed it to him when he requested she do so. After Hoke had completed the standard driver\u2019s license and warrant checks, he returned her identification information to her. As Hoke was explaining to Ashmore why she should not honk her horn excessively while passing an emergency vehicle, Ashmore put her vehicle in drive, acted as though she was about to drive off, and then told Hoke that she \u201cdid not want to hear it.\u201d Hoke instructed her to take the vehicle out of gear, and informed her that if she did not listen to him, he would give Ashmore a ticket. Ashmore did so, and then proceeded to shower Hoke with obscene expletives, throwing her driver\u2019s license, proof of insurance, and registration at Hoke again.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">\u00b64 As Hoke was writing Ashmore a citation, she exited her vehicle and started taking pictures of him. Reserve Deputy Scott King, who pulled up and was assisting Hoke, told her to get back in her vehicle. She resisted at first and tried to take more pictures, but soon complied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Hoke then issued her a citation for Unnecessary Use of a Horn or Other Warning Device, and also for Disorderly Conduct, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA. Ashmore threw the citation on the passenger seat of the vehicle, directed another obscene expletive towards Hoke, and then, according to the police report, \u201csquealed her tires and held her horn down as she accelerated away from the traffic stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b65 Following a bench trial in Justice Court, Ashmore was convicted of one count of Disorderly Conduct and one count of Unnecessary Use of a Horn or Other Warning Device. She appealed her conviction to the District Court. On appeal she filed a motion to dismiss the Disorderly Conduct charge. Ashmore maintained that her conduct did not violate the statute as a matter of law because only a few people, the police officers, were disturbed by it. The District Court denied her motion to dismiss. After this denial, Ashmore pled guilty and was sentenced pursuant to a plea agreement which preserved her right to appeal. She now timely appeals the denial of her motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b66 We state the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in denying Ashmore\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u00b67 \u201cThe grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. Our standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Pyette, </em>2007 MT 119, \u00b6 11, 337 Mont. 265, \u00b6 11, 159 P.3d 232, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in denying Ashmore\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">\u00b69 Ashmore maintains the District Court erred in denying her motion to dismiss. She asserts that the Disorderly Conduct statute \u201crequires at a minimum that a defendant engage in behavior that disturbs a number of people.\u201d Ashmore asserts there were no witnesses who observed her behavior, and that of the three reserve deputies who were involved in the traffic stop-Hoke, Kramer, and King-only Hoke and Kramer actually witnessed the conduct allegedly giving rise to the Disorderly Conduct violation. Accordingly, Ashmore maintains the State failed to \u201cpresent any evidence establishing probable cause that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Ms. Ashmore disturbed the peace by disturbing more than a few people with her conduct.\u201d Ashmore claims that her interpretation of \u00a7 45-8-101(1), MCA, is supported by the Criminal Law Commission Comments to the Disorderly Conduct statute and our decision in <em>Kleinsasser v. State, </em>2002 MT 36, 308 Mont. 325, 42 P.3d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b610 The State urges us to affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. The State asserts that \u201c[n]o Montana decision has held specifically that a certain minimum number of people must be affected in order for behavior to \u2018disturb the peace\u2019 within the meaning of the disorderly conduct statute.\u201d The State argues that the plain language of the statute makes disturbance of the peace an element of the disorderly conduct, but does not otherwise contain any numerical requirement of how many \u201cothers\u201d must be affected by the defendant\u2019s conduct in order to give rise to a violation of the statute. The State maintains that \u201cthe number of people affected is not, on its own, determinative of whether \u2018the peace\u2019 is disturbed. Rather, it is only one factor among several that should be considered.\u201d The State asserts that this position is supported by our prior decisions, including <em>City of Billings v. Batten, </em>218 Mont. 64, 705 P.2d 1120 (1985), <em>State v. Turley, </em>164 Mont. 231, 521 P.2d 690 (1974), and <em>State v. Lowery, </em>233 Mont. 96, 759 P.2d 158 (1988). Additionally, the State asserts that <em>Kleinsasser </em>is distinguishable. Accordingly, the State maintains that the allegations in the affidavit demonstrated probable cause sufficient to support a finding that Ashmore violated the Disorderly Conduct statute, and that the District Court\u2019s denial of her motion to dismiss should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b611 In analyzing these arguments, we first turn to the relevant portions of the Disorderly Conduct statute under which Ashmore was charged. They read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">(1) A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if he knowingly disturbs the peace by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">(a) quarreling, challenging to fight, or fighting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">(b) making loud or unusual noises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">(c) using threatening, profane, or abusive language ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Sections 45-8-10 l(l)(a) through (c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">\u00b612 As the State correctly notes, our task in interpreting statutes is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained [in the statute], not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Here, however, there is a disparity between the plain language of the statute and the Criminal Law Commission Comments which provide guidance on how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>this statute is to be applied. The relevant portions of the Comments read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">The intent of the provision is to use somewhat broad, general terms to establish a foundation for the offense and leave the application to the facts of a particular case. Two important qualifications are specified in making the application, however. First, the offender must knowingly make a disturbance of the enumerated kind, and second, the behavior must disturb \u201cothers.\u201d It is not sufficient that a single person or a very few persons have grounds for complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b613 The statute, on the other hand, does not specify that conduct must disturb \u201cothers,\u201d or otherwise indicate that conduct affecting \u201ca single person or a very few persons\u201d is insufficient to give rise to a violation of the statute. In fact, the statute only requires that a defendant \u201cknowingly disturb the peace\u201d by committing one of the acts enumerated in subsections (a) through (j) of the statute, none of which contains a numerical requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b614 The disparity between the Comments and the plain language of the statute itself raises the question of whether it is possible to \u201cdisturb the peace\u201d by specific acts that affect only one, or a few persons, or whether greater numbers of persons must be affected by the enumerated acts before a violation of the statute can take place. The State urges us to ameliorate this disparity by giving little if any weight to the Commission Comments, given that this phraseology, i.e., a reference to \u201cothers,\u201d does not appear anywhere in the statute itself. Ashmore, however, asserts that this course is foreclosed to us, given our holding in <em>Kleinsasser </em>where we cited approvingly to these portions of the Commission Comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u00b615 A review of our prior decisions under this statute shows that, in spite of the language in the Comments, we have never adopted a strict numerical requirement respecting how many people need be affected by conduct before it \u201cdisturbs the peace.\u201d As we noted in <em>Lowery,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">The criminal law commission comments to \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, state that, for a charge of breach of the peace, \u201c[i]t is not sufficient that a single person or a very few persons have grounds for complaint.\u201d However, in <em>City of Billings v. Batten, </em>705 P.2d 1120, 42 St.Rep. 1398, defendant was convicted of using \u201cfighting words\u201d toward his neighbor in the presence of the neighbor\u2019s family and several passers-by and within the hearing of other neighbors. The total number of persons present was about ten. In <em>City of Whitefish v. O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>(Mont. 1985), 704 P.2d 1021, 42 St.Rep. 928, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>defendant was convicted of using \u201cfighting words\u201d in the presence of two friends and a police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><em>Lowery, </em>223 Mont. at 100, 759 P.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b616 Similarly, in <em>Batten, </em>we noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">Although we have never decided how many people must be disturbed before the peace is disturbed, one Montana case involving the crime of breach of the peace, former \u00a7 94-3560, R.C.M. 1947, provides guidance. In <em>State v. Turley </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 231, 521 P.2d 690, Turley\u2019s conviction for disturbing the peace was upheld. Section 94-3560, R.C.M. 1947, prohibited disturbances of the peace by \u201cloud or unusual noise or tumultuous or offensive conduct or threatening, quarrelling, challenging to fight or fighting.\u201d Turley was convicted under this statute when only he, his wife, and a third party were present to witness his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\"><em>Batten, </em>218 Mont. at 71, 705 P.2d at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b617  As these cases demonstrate, we have focused our analysis not upon numbers of persons affected, but rather upon whether the defendant knowingly disturbed the peace by committing one of the acts enumerated in the statute. While the number of individuals affected by the conduct may play a role in whether the peace has been disturbed, it is not necessarily a dispositive factor. Instead, determination of whether the peace has been disturbed should turn on \u201cthe application [of the statute] to the facts of a particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b618 This is, in fact, the approach we applied in <em>Kleinsasser, </em>where we considered whether officers had particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop due to an alleged violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA. In that case, an officer observed Kleinsasser\u2019s car parked off the side of the road around 10 p.m. at night, and saw an individual near the passenger door of the car urinating off the side of the road. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 3. The officer pulled over and conducted an investigative stop of Kleinsasser, suspected he was under the influence of alcohol, and when Kleinsasser refused a preliminary breath test, arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 6. The officer seized Kleinsasser\u2019s license and it was later suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">\u00b619 Kleinsasser challenged the suspension of his license, but the district court denied his petition to have his license reinstated. Kleinsasser appealed the district court\u2019s decision, and argued that his license had been illegally seized because the officer lacked particularized suspicion to justify the stop, and that the observed behavior did not violate the laws of Montana. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The State argued that the observed behavior of Kleinsasser constituted a violation of the Disorderly Conduct statute, in particular \u00a7 45-8-101(i), MCA, and that the officer did have particularized suspicion justifying the stop. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b620 We disagreed with the State, and reversed the District Court, finding that the observed conduct of Kleinsasser did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 45-8-101(i), MCA. Thus, there was no particularized suspicion justifying the investigative stop. The proscribed act described in subsection (i) of the Disorderly Conduct statute reads as follows: \u201ccreating a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act that serves no legitimate purpose ....\u201d Section 45-8-101(i), MCA. We found that Kleinsasser\u2019s conduct did not violate this statute for several reasons. On the one hand, we concluded that Kleinsasser\u2019s conduct did not create a hazardous condition, and further that it served a legitimate purpose. Moreover, we determined that Kleinsasser\u2019s act of urinating, given the time, manner, and conditions under which it occurred, was not \u201coffensive.\u201d After quoting the Commission Comments cited above at \u00b6 12, we concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">In the present case, the incident occurred in the dark of the night, in a rural location where, as Officer Palmer testified, there were no overhead lights of any kind and there was no other traffic around at the time. Moreover, there was no evidence that the behavior disturbed anyone other than Officers Leasure and Palmer, and neither officer was so disturbed by the behavior that they considered giving the individual a citation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b621 Contrary to Ashmore\u2019s assertion, <em>Kleinsasser </em>does not stand for the proposition \u201cthat more than a few people must be disturbed by the alleged conduct\u201d to constitute a disturbance of the peace in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA. Rather, the Court in <em>Kleinsasser </em>continued our prior practice of evaluating whether the commission of one of the enumerated acts in the statute led to a disturbance of the peace by the defendant, based upon \u201cthe facts of a particular case.\u201d Aside from our quotation of the Commission Comments, nowhere in <em>Kleinsasser </em>did we imply or intimate that Kleinsasser\u2019s conduct was not a violation of the statute solely because only two police officers witnessed it. Instead, we found the conduct was not \u201coffensive\u201d based on the fact that only two police officers witnessed it, <em>and </em>the fact that there \u201cwas no evidence that the behavior disturbed anyone other than Officers Leasure and Palmer, <em>and neither officer was so disturbed by the behavior that they considered giving the individual a citation.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 21. (Emphasis added). Thus, our holding in that case was based on the fact that neither the officers, nor anyone else, was offended by the conduct, given the time, place, and manner of its occurrence. Thus, the conduct failed to satisfy any of the enumerated acts in the statute, particularly those in subsection (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b622 This case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Kleinsasser. </em>The complaint filed against Ashmore alleges that Ashmore violated the Disorderly Conduct statute when she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">(1) Quarreled, challenged to fight or fought, by calling the police officer a \u201ccocksucker\u201d and/or other profanities, by resisting instructions of police officers to remain in or return to a vehicle, and by throwing items at officers of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">(2) Made loud or unusual noises by honking her horn excessively when unnecessary and yelling at officers of the peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(3) Used threatening, profane or abusive language, including but not limited to \u201cfucking,\u201d and \u201ccocksucker\u201d on one or more occasions, directed at officers of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b623  We conclude that Ashmore\u2019s conduct falls under the proscriptions set forth in the acts enumerated in subsections (a) through (c) of the Disorderly Conduct statute. Consequently, Ashmore\u2019s conduct does not need to be deemed \u201coffensive,\u201d as was required under subsection (i) <em>in Kleinsasser, </em>but only needs to meet the requirements listed in subsections (a) through (c) of the statute-namely that Ashmore \u201cquarrel[l], challeng[e] to fight, or fight[] ... mak[e] loud or unusual noises ... [or] us[e] threatening, profane, or abusive language ....\u201d Sections 45-8-101(l)(a) through (c), MCA. Ashmore\u2019s conduct more than satisfies these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\u00b624  Accordingly, the only question is whether these proscribed actions, when directed solely at police officers, could be found by a trier of fact to \u201cdisturb the peace,\u201d and thus give rise to a violation of \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA. We hold that they can, and that nothing in our prior precedent under the Disorderly Conduct statute, including <em>Kleinsasser, </em>is inconsistent with this conclusion. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Ashmore\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">\u00b625 For these reasons, the District Court\u2019s Order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
