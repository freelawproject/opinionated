We will repeat here only those facts pertinent to our decision to impose on Engel a sixty-day suspension. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed a complaint against Joseph Engel, III, (Engel), an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Montana. We determined that Engel had violated Rules 1.5,1.15, and 1.18, of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">\u00b62 The Commission on Practice of the Supreme Court of the State of Montana (the Commission) held a hearing regarding the appropriate sanction for Engel. The Commission recommends that we impose on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Engel a public censure and the costs of the disciplinary proceedings based on the Commission\u2019s finding that several mitigating factors weigh against any harsher sanction. We decline to follow the Commission\u2019s recommendation. We conclude that in addition to a public censure and the obligation of the costs of the disciplinary proceedings, Engel\u2019s conduct warrants a sixty-day suspension from practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b63 This Court \u201cpossesses original and exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility\u201d in all matters involving the disciplining of lawyers in the state of Montana. <em>See </em>Introduction, Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (MRLDE). We review de novo the Commission\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations. <em>In re Potts, </em>2007 MT 81, \u00b6 32, 336 Mont. 517, \u00b6 32, 158 P.3d 418, \u00b6 32. We weigh the evidence upon which the Commission\u2019s findings rest. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b64 The Commission cites the presence of several mitigating factors to support its recommendation. The Commission first asserts that the Court did not disavow expressly the Commission\u2019s finding that Engel \u201chad received $295,000 in fees from Kloss during the period 1998-2005, whereas [Engel] recorded over $330,000 in time and expenses representing Kloss.\u201d The Commission cites the fact that Robert James (James), Engel\u2019s opposing counsel in the Edward D. Jones litigation, initiated the complaint against Engel and suggests that James\u2019s litigation tactics played a large part in driving up the litigation costs. The fact that Kloss never complained about Engel\u2019s work or his fee represents a further mitigating factor in the Commission\u2019s view. The Commission asserts that Engel worked \u201cover an extended period of time and achieved positive and beneficial results for [Kloss].\u201d Finally, the Commission cites the negative publicity surrounding Engel\u2019s role in this matter as a mitigating factor. We disagree with the Commission with respect to each alleged mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b65 Engel\u2019s Billable Hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u00b66 Engel argues that the Commission understood his fee arrangement with respect to the \u201coverall picture\u201d of his representation of Kloss, which includes: (1) the termination of a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT); (2) a tort claim against Edward D. Jones, a brokerage firm; and (3) opposition to a petition for the appointment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a conservator for Kloss filed by James, the opposing counsel in the Edward D. Jones litigation. The record fails to support Engel\u2019s claim, however, that the \u201coverall picture\u201d of his representation of Kloss justifies his fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b67 Kenneth Parrent (Parrent), Kloss\u2019s 71-year-old nephew, executed a fee agreement on Kloss\u2019s behalf on July 1, 1998, to have Engel terminate the CRT for an hourly rate of $125. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 9. Engel\u2019s billing records indicate that he performed 65.9 hours of work in terminating the CRT. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 9. Kloss paid Engel $8,362.50 for this work in 1998 according to the terms of the hourly fee agreement. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b68 Engel signed a second fee agreement with Kloss on October 27, 1998, relating to the tort action against Edward D. Jones. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 10. The second fee agreement provided that Engel would bill Kloss at an hourly rate of $125 from an original $20,000 retainer provided by Kloss. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 11. This second agreement further provided that Engel would receive thirty-five percent of any recovery in the action against Edward D. Jones. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 11. The agreement makes no mention of any arrangement, however, whereby Kloss would fund the Edward D. Jones litigation from the proceeds of the CRT.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b69 The parties presumably intended the original $20,000 retainer to fund the Edward D. Jones litigation. Kloss provided an additional $50,000 retainer in 2002. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 11. Engel\u2019s accounting practices make it impossible to determine to which litigation this $50,000 retainer applied. Engel did not place either the $20,000 retainer or the $50,000 retainer in his trust account. Engel instead placed both retainers directly into his operating account. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 11. We determined that these actions, standing alone, violated Rules 1.15 and 1.18, MRPC. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b610 Engel justified the size of the fee for his work in pursuing the uncontested dissolution of the CRT, in part, on the separate action in which James petitioned for a conservator for Kloss. Engel also asserted that he used the $50,000 retainer to cover the cost of his work in contesting James\u2019s petition for a conservator. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 11. Engel changed the fee agreement for terminating the CRT on February 1, 2000. James did not petition for the appointment of a conservator for Kloss until June 2003-about 18 months after Engel received the $50,000 retainer and several years after Engel modified the fee agreement for terminating the CRT. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b611 The Commission gives Engel the benefit of the doubt in suggesting that he properly earned these retainers and the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>fee of nearly $130,000 that he received for the Edward D. Jones litigation. We decline to provide Engel with this benefit in light of the numerous inconsistencies in the record. Engel\u2019s billing records, the various fee agreements, and Engel\u2019s shifting explanations for his accounting practices raise more questions than provide answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b612 We concluded that Engel\u2019s fee in collecting $121,545 for his work in an uncontested proceeding to terminate the CRT \u201ccannot be deemed reasonable under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 33. This conclusion invalidates more than one-third of the total amount that Engel received and, at the very least, raises questions regarding the validity of Engel\u2019s remaining fee. The record does nothing to resolve those questions. The Commission\u2019s recommendation, on the other hand, validates the remaining two-thirds of Engel\u2019s fee and implicitly challenges our conclusion that Engel\u2019s after-the-work-was-performed modification of the fee agreement from an hourly fee to a contingency fee could not be justified \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b613 The ODC\u2019s amended complaint against Engel did not address specifically the entire scope of Engel\u2019s representation of Kloss. As a result, we did not resolve the legitimacy of the remaining two-thirds of Engel\u2019s fee. We see no mitigation in the fact that we did not repudiate explicitly the Commission\u2019s finding relating to an issue not germane to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b614 James\u2019s Filing of Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b615 The Commission continues to advance as a mitigating factor the fact that James, Engel\u2019s opposing counsel, initiated this complaint and employed \u201ctactics\u201d that allegedly drove up Kloss\u2019s expenses, including James\u2019s filing of a petition for a conservator for Kloss. A disinterested District Court held a hearing on James\u2019s petition. We commend to the Commission the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, Ex. 76, and the transcript of the hearing on James\u2019s petition, Ex. 75, before they imply that James filed the petition to gain a tactical advantage in the litigation with Edward D. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b616 The District Court addressed the issue of whether to appoint a conservator for Kloss when faced with the fact that Kloss\u2019s former nearly $1,000,000 estate had a value of less than $5,000 at the time of the hearing. Kloss generally could provide no explanation for the precipitous drop.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b617 The District Court found that Kloss remained oblivious to her financial state and that her nephew, Parrent, had squandered a large part of her estate. Specifically, Kloss did not know that she had deeded to a Colorado corporation a 4,000 square foot house located in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Fairfield, Montana, that she recently had purchased. The Colorado corporation, established by Parrent, had no employees, income, or expenses. The District Court stated that the corporation \u201cappears to be a shell....\u201d Kloss was unaware that Parrent had been using her money to pursue legal and private investigative services in Colorado for his personal matters. Kloss did not know that she had suffered a $167,000 loss in one year in her brokerage account. Kloss did not know that she had borrowed funds by way of a margin account and that she had paid nearly $75,000 in interest on these funds. Kloss testified that she had never used the margin account.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b618 The District Court further found that Parrent had led Kloss to believe that the CRT eventually would divest Kloss of her entire estate. The District Court determined that Parrent had failed to explain to Kloss that, rather than losing her entire estate, she would have retained $650,000 outside the CRT and earned seven percent annual interest on the $350,000 principal of the CRT until her death.</p>\n<p id=\"APj\">\u00b619 The District Court found that Parrent had no means of support outside of Kloss. He lived in the house that Kloss had deeded to his shell corporation. He drove a car that Kloss had bought for his shell corporation. Parrent also served as the sole support for his live-in fianc\u00e9. Despite having no other means of support, Parrent somehow satisfied $200,449 worth of his federal income tax liens in September of2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b620 The District Court also found that Parrent had taken over Kloss\u2019s investment decisions. According to the stock broker, Parrent \u201cwas trying to make money by buying and selling stocks.\u201d The District Court found that Parrent had begun investing in \u201caggressive, volatile, and risky securities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b621 Finally, the District Court found that shortly before it had entered its order freezing Kloss\u2019s assets and ordering Parrent not to exercise his power-of-attorney, Parrent emptied more than $156,000 from Kloss\u2019s brokerage account. Parrent could give no accounting as to what had happened to Kloss\u2019s money. Parrent did not take all of his aunt\u2019s money. He left Kloss about $950.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b622 James learned all of this information during the discovery phase of the Edward D. Jones litigation. James, an attorney bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct, had little choice in the face of this avalanche of avarice. Engel nevertheless seeks to disparage James and his motives for petitioning for a conservator for Kloss. The Commission characterizes James\u2019s petition as a \u201ctactic\u201d that \u201c[drove] up the litigation costs\u201d and implies that James inappropriately initiated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>complaint against Engel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b623 The District Court specifically found that James received no compensation for seeking the appointment of a conservatorship. The District Court further determined that James \u201cundertook this matter to protect Mrs. Kloss, and not for any other or improper purpose.\u201d Indeed, the fact that Engel filed a petition to appoint Parrent as a conservator for Kloss in 1998 supports the notion that Kloss needed protection. Engel represented to the court in that petition that Kloss needed a conservator due to her \u201cage and failed health\u201d and her \u201cinability to function independently.\u201d Engel withdrew the petition based solely upon opposition from relatives to the appointment of Parrent as the conservator, and not based upon a changed perception regarding Kloss\u2019s ability to manage her affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b624 More importantly, Rule 8.3(a), M.R.P.C., specifically requires a lawyer to inform the ODC of another lawyer\u2019s \u201cviolation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d We determined that Engel had violated three separate rules. <em>Engel I, </em>\u00b6 48. Designating James\u2019s reporting of these violations as a mitigating factor undermines a lawyer\u2019s duties pursuant to Rule 8.3(a), M.R.P.C. We refuse to encourage members of the bar to sit on their hands in the face of potential misconduct by opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b625 No Complaint By Kloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b626 The Commission cites Kloss\u2019s failure to complain about Engel\u2019s legal services or the fees that he charged for those services as mitigating the effects of Engel\u2019s ethical violations. Kloss\u2019s testimony at the hearing for the appointment of a conservator belies any apparent satisfaction with Engel\u2019s legal services and the fees that he charged.</p>\n<p id=\"AsH\">\u00b627 Kloss testified that she had paid Engel several thousand dollars to terminate the CRT. We now know that Kloss paid Engel more than $121,000 to terminate the CRT pursuant to Engel\u2019s after-the-work-was-performed modification of the fee agreement. The District Court found that Parrent had written all the checks for legal fees to Engel and that Kloss did not \u201cunderstand or appreciate how much was spent in attorney\u2019s fees, or whether that is a proper amount to spend in attorney\u2019s fees for the work that was performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b628 Kloss testified in that same proceeding that she had paid Engel $2,500 in legal fees in the Edward D. Jones litigation. We now know that Engel accrued fees in that litigation in the neighborhood of $200,000. Kloss testified at the hearing in 2003 that she had paid Engel about $7,500 in total legal fees when in fact she had paid Engel more than $300,000. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Kloss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>would have \u201cno complaint\u201d regarding Engel\u2019s fee. We disagree with the Commission\u2019s view that Kloss\u2019s apparent satisfaction with Engel\u2019s legal services and his fees constitutes a mitigating factor in light of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b629 Positive and Beneficial Results for Kloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b630 The Commission determined that Engel\u2019s work produced \u201cpositive and beneficial results\u201d for Kloss. Our decision in <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1, emerged from Kloss's action. The <em>Edward D. Jones </em>litigation established the important principles that the brokerage contract at issue constituted a contract of adhesion and that, as a result, no party could enforce the contract\u2019s arbitration provision. <em>Edward D. Jones, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 32. More importantly, for our purposes, the Court held that the broker owed Kloss a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d that included explaining the consequences of the arbitration provision. <em>Edward D. Jones, </em>\u00b6 38. Engel pursued litigation that established a fiduciary duty for brokers while he committed abuses of the fiduciary duties that he owed to his client in that same litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b631 The parties eventually settled the action with Edward D. Jones agreeing to pay $150,000 to Kloss. Engel \u201cwaived\u201d any further fee in the <em>Edward D. Jones </em>case. We note that Engel \u201cwaived\u201d any further fee only after James had filed a petition for the appointment of a conservator, after the District Court had denied Engel\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition, after Engel allegedly had expended $77,338.22 in resisting the appointment of a conservator for Kloss, and shortly before the District Court held a hearing on James\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b632 Kloss already had paid Engel roughly $200,000 in the case. Though Engel\u2019s accounting practices make precision impossible, Kloss appears to have suffered a net loss of $50,000 by pursuing the claim against Edward D. Jones. We fail to discern on the record before us any \u201cpositive and beneficial results\u201d for Kloss.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u00b633 Negative Publicity for Engel.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u00b634 Finally, the Commission cites as a mitigating factor Engel\u2019s testimony that \u201cpress publicity about the Kloss litigation and his role in it has been ruinous to his reputation and law practice.\u201d Engel elected to assist Parrent in undoing Kloss\u2019s CRT and filing a tort action against Edward D. Jones. Engel drafted all of the fee agreements at issue. He had ready access to the same information presented to the District Court at the hearing on James\u2019s petition to appoint a conservator for Kloss. Engel\u2019s claim brings to mind the saying that \u201ca boy cannot kill his own parents and then plead for mercy upon himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>because he is a poor orphan boy.\u201d <em>Berry v. Jorris, </em>199 S.W.2d 616, 619 (Ky. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b635  We fail to find persuasive any of the alleged mitigating factors cited by the Commission. The circumstances surrounding Engel\u2019s conduct leave us unable to follow the Commission\u2019s recommendation. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b636 1. Joseph Engel, III, appear before the Supreme Court of the State of Montana on March 18, 2008, at 1:15 p.m. for the administration of a public censure;</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b637 2. Joseph Engel, III, pay, or make arrangements to pay, the costs of the proceedings before the Commission. Pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, Disciplinary Counsel is directed to assemble and serve upon Joseph Engel, III, an itemized list of the costs and expenses incurred in this matter. Joseph Engel, III, shall then have ten days thereafter to file written objections and, if he desires, to request a hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel;</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b638 3. Joseph Engel, III, shall be suspended as attorney and counselor for a period of sixty days, commencing as of the date of the public censure, at the expiration of which time, upon payment of all costs incurred in this proceeding, he may resume the practice of law without further order.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b639 4. The Clerk of this Court is directed to mail copies of this Order to Joseph Engel, III, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by ordinary mail to Joseph Engel\u2019s attorney, the Chairman and the Secretary of the Commission on Practice, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and the Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"Azb\">DATED this 6th day of February, 2008.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-10\">/S/ KARLA M.
