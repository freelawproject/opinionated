We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">\u00b62 The Shoemakers present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Shoemakers had waived the affirmative defense of statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court improperly resolved a genuine issue of material fact in granting the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b65 Meadow Lake Estates is a residential development located in Ravalli County. Developers of the subdivision intended to preserve the \u201cnatural beauty, primitive characteristics, and seclusion\u201d of the property by filing a Deed of Restriction with the Ravalli County Clerk and Recorder in August 1979. The Deed of Restriction set forth a variety of land use limitations on property owners within the subdivision, including the prohibition of commercial activities not \u201ccompatible with the residential nature and characteristics of the area.\u201d The Deed of Restriction reserved easements on all existing roads within the subdivision for the \u201cscenic views and enjoyment\u201d of the property and for the \u201creasonable general use\u201d by all subdivision property owners to access public lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b66 The Shoemakers bought three tracts of land in the Meadow Lake Estates subdivision in 1984. The Jack Creek access road encumbered the Shoemakers\u2019 property at the time of their purchase. The Shoemakers promptly erected a gate across the road where it intersected with their property. When locked, the gate blocked vehicular access to public lands on the other side of the Shoemakers\u2019 tract. The Association demanded in 1987 that the Shoemakers unlock or remove the gate because it was interfering with the property owners\u2019 access to public lands. The Shoemakers refused. The Shoemakers warned the Association that it would have to initiate legal action to resolve the issue surrounding the locked gate. The Association took no immediate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b67 The Shoemakers then launched an outfitting business from their property in 1988. The business operated under an outfitter license and provided guided hunting trips in eastern Montana. The business also occasionally guided hunters on the public lands near the Shoemakers\u2019 property. The Shoemakers ceased operations after several years of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b68 The Association filed a complaint against the Shoemakers in November 2000. The Association accused the Shoemakers of violating provisions of the Deed of Restriction by interfering with the easement over the Jack Creek access road and by operating an outfitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>business on their property. The Association sought a permanent injunction ordering the Shoemakers to remove all obstructions from the Jack Creek access road and prohibiting the Shoemakers from operating the outfitting business on their property. At the same time, the Association filed an application for a temporary injunction and a request to set a show cause hearing. The District Court issued an order on November 15, 2000, directing the Shoemakers to appear on December 4,2000, to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b69 The Shoemakers filed their answer to the Association\u2019s complaint on January 31, 2001. The Shoemakers\u2019 answer asserted general denials of the allegations in the Association\u2019s complaint, including a denial that an express easement encumbered their property for the benefit of Association members. They admitted that \u201ca gate exists on their driveway and that the gate is <em>sometimes </em>locked.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Shoemakers alleged as their first affirmative defense that the Association had waived or abandoned any easement due to the fact that the Association had not used the Jack Creek access road for over seventeen years. The second and third affirmative defenses asserted that, in light of other available forest service access roads in the subdivision, the easement encumbering their land was unnecessary and moot. Their final affirmative defense asserted that, if the easement exists, parking vehicles on the section of Jack Creek access road that sits on the Shoemakers\u2019 property is outside the scope of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b610 The court held the show cause hearing on February 5,2001. Larry Wilkins (Wilkins) testified on behalf of the Association. The Shoemakers did not appear, although their counsel cross-examined the Association\u2019s witness and presented arguments. The court granted a preliminary injunction directing the Shoemakers to keep open the gate across the Jack Creek access road and to remove all \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs during the pendency of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b611 The court\u2019s scheduling order of March 9,2001, directed the parties to file all pretrial motions, \u201cincluding motions in limine and motions for summary judgment\u201d on or before July 20, 2001. By stipulation of the parties, the court later extended the deadline for filing motions to October 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b612 The Association filed a motion for summary judgment. The Association sought summary judgment that it held a valid easement across the Jack Creek access road and that the Shoemakers could not sustain their abandonment defense as a matter of law. The Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>attached to its motion the deposition of Daniel Shoemaker, taken August 21,2001, the deposition of Wilkins, also taken August 21,2001, and the Shoemakers\u2019 Response to Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\">\u00b613 Wilkins testified that he continued to use the road after the Shoemakers lived there. Wilkins explained that he would get around the Shoemakers\u2019 locked gate by walking around the section of fence or climbing over the gate. \u201cI used it when they weren\u2019t there and I\u2019ve used it since they lived there, along with other people.\u201d He stated that \u201c[t]here\u2019s been periods of time when the gate has stood wide open for days, weeks at a time, but it\u2019s always locked during hunting season.\u201d He stated that he used to drive up the road when the forest service land was open to vehicles, but that when the forest service became closed to vehicles, he would bike, ski, or ride his horse up to the forest service land, using the Jack Creek access road through the Shoemakers\u2019 property to get there. He stated that, as a member of the Association\u2019s Board, he knows that the money from the Association dues goes to the road grader and that he saw the Jack Creek access road over the Shoemakers\u2019 property graded at least once.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b614 Daniel Shoemaker asserted in his deposition that non-use extinguished the easement. Yet Shoemaker declared that he \u201ccaught [Wilkins] twice in the last couple years,\u201d riding his bike on the Jack Creek access road, that he gave Mr. Trautman, a lot owner, permission to retrieve an elk that he shot on public land, and that he saw and confronted some children of Dwayne Allen, another lot owner, who were using the road, presumably while lost. He also stated that he gave a key to his cousin, Mike Uffelman, a lot owner, to access the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b615 Shoemaker claimed that he had confronted people six or seven times about using the road since owning the property and admitted that he may have been carrying a gun during those confrontations. When asked if the gate was locked 24 hours a day, Daniel Shoemaker replied \u201cyes,\u201d that it was locked 99.9% of the time. He also stated that, since March of 1997, he has worked full time in Arizona and comes back to his Montana property on vacations, maybe four to six weeks out of the year. He admitted to paying Homeowners Association dues that, in part, go to road maintenance and that a road grader had graded the road on his property in the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b616 The Shoemakers filed their own motion for summary judgment on November 6,2001. For the first time, the Shoemakers claimed that the eight-year statute of limitations on contract claims barred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Association\u2019s action with respect to the outfitting business. Also for the first time, the Shoemakers claimed that they had extinguished any easement across the Jack Creek access road by adversely possessing the easement for the five-year statutory period. The Shoemakers claimed that the Association should be barred from asserting its interest in the easement because it had failed to raise an objection to the Shoemakers\u2019 adverse use within five years of discovering the Shoemakers\u2019 locked gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b617 The Shoemakers appended the affidavit of Daniel Shoemaker, subscribed and sworn on November 5,2001-two-and-one-half months after his deposition-to their motion for summary judgment. Shoemaker alleged that the gate had remained locked since the time of installation in 1984 other than for permitting his family to enter and exit the property. Shoemaker further alleged that no one within the subdivision ever had asked him or his wife for permission to use the roadway: \u201cAny use of the roadway claimed by Mr. Wilkins, or others, has been without permission or consent. To the best of our knowledge, no one other than my family and guests has used the roadway through my property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b618 Shoemaker mentioned two exceptions to this exclusion. The first exception involved some deer hunters, non-members of the subdivision, to whom he denied permission to go past his gate. The second exception was a real estate agent to whom he had given permission and a key to unlock the gate to show land beyond Shoemakers\u2019 property to clients. Shoemaker also admitted to leaving for Arizona on extended trips throughout the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b619 The Association objected to the Shoemakers\u2019 statute of limitations claim on the basis that the Shoemakers had waived the claim by failing to raise it as an affirmative defense. The Association likewise objected to the Shoemakers\u2019 adverse possession claim on the grounds that the Shoemakers had never raised the claim in their answer as an affirmative defense, through a counterclaim, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b620 The District Court held a hearing on February 7, 2002. Daniel Shoemaker testified that he had locked the gate since he bought his property in 1984 until the court granted the temporary injunction requiring that he open it. He claimed that the easement providing Association members access to the neighboring Forest Service property had been eliminated before his purchase. Shoemaker stated that he saw Wilkins one or two times, a man during hunting season who had been lost, and Mr. Daniels\u2019s son and companion all using the access road at some point after he purchased the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u00b621 The court determined that no justiciable controversy existed as the Shoemakers had ceased outfitting operations long ago and had no present plans to reopen it and thus declined to rule on this issue. The court determined that the Shoemakers had waived their statute of limitations defense on the outfitting business by failing to raise it as an affirmative defense in their answer. The court granted the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment, however, regarding the easement along the Jack Creek access road. The court determined that the Jack Creek access road constituted a valid easement encumbering the Shoemakers\u2019 property. The court further determined that the Shoemakers had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact to support their claim of having extinguished through adverse possession the Association\u2019s easement over the Jack Creek access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">\u00b622 The court first noted that the Shoemakers had failed to raise the defense of adverse possession in their responsive pleading or in any of their discovery answers. The court then noted that the party seeking to establish an easement by prescription has the burden to <em>prove </em>each element of prescriptive right by clear and convincing evidence, citing <em>Tanner v. Dream Island, Inc., </em>275 Mont. 414, 424, 913 P.2d 641, 648 (1996) (emphasis added). The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">[t]he Shoemakers have failed to <em>plead </em>each of the elements of adverse possession, and their attempt to <em>prove </em>those elements consists solely of this statement in their Motion for Summary Judgment: \u201c[t]he locked gate at the entry way to [the Shoemakers\u2019] property was \u2018open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted\u2019 since its construction and installation in the summer of 1985.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b623 The court focused on the \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cuninterrupted\u201d elements of adverse possession because the evidence presented on summary judgment demonstrated that certain property owners had continued to use the easement across the Shoemakers\u2019 property. The court identified the contested issue between the parties as <em>frequency </em>of use rather than the <em>fact </em>of such use. The court cited the testimony of Wilkins at the preliminary injunction hearing regarding his continued use of the easement. The court also relied upon Wilkins\u2019s uncontroverted testimony that the Association had maintained the development\u2019s roads over the years. Daniel Shoemaker conceded in his deposition that Association members had used the easement, without his permission and that his Association dues had been used on at least one occasion to maintain the Jack Creek access road. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>concluded that no genuine issue of fact existed in support of their extinguishment claim because their adverse use was not exclusive or uninterrupted. The Shoemakers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b624 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment under the standard set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Gliko v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 112, \u00b6 12, 130 P.3d 155, \u00b6 12. In evaluating cross motions for summary judgment, this Court must evaluate each party's motion on its own merits. <em>Hajenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 507, \u00b6 19, 155 P.3d 1241, \u00b6 19. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b625 The party moving for summary judgment must establish the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Gliko, </em>\u00b6 12. Once the moving party has met its burden, the party opposing summary judgment must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of its case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Fielder v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>2007 MT 118, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 256, \u00b6 12, 162 P.3d 67, \u00b6 12. Summary judgment is inappropriate where, based on the record, reasonable jurors could reach different conclusions as to a particular material fact. <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 33, 299 Mont. 449, \u00b6 33, 999 P.2d 1010, \u00b6 33; <em>Scott v. Henrich, </em>1998 MT 118 , \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 489, \u00b6 22, 958 P.2d 709, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\n<em>Whether the District Court properly determined that the Shoemakers waived the affirmative defense of statute of limitations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">\u00b626 The Shoemakers do not dispute the underlying facts concerning the statute of limitations issue. They argue that the District Court incorrectly determined that they had waived the statute of limitations defense under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) by failing to plead it as an affirmative defense in an answer to the Association\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\u00b627 The Shoemakers urge this Court to adopt a more liberal reading of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c), based on the application of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), in <em>Rivera v. Anaya, </em>726 F.2d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 1984) (allowing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>defendant to raise a statute of limitations defense for the first time on motion for summary judgment when the plaintiff failed to demonstrate prejudice). The Shoemakers argue that the Association suffered no prejudice by the untimely assertion of the affirmative defense and, thus, the defense should have been allowed under federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"A2UJ\">\u00b628  The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure govern all civil suits in Montana district courts. We apply the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure as written. M. R. Civ. P. 1; <em>Busch v. Atkinson, </em>278 Mont. 478, 483, 925 P.2d 874, 877 (1996). The plain language of M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) requires a party affirmatively to set forth the statute of limitations defense by answer. M. R. Civ. P. 8(c)\u2019s requirement that an affirmative defense be pled by answer serves the same principles of fairness and notice that require a plaintiff to set forth the basis of a claim in a complaint. <em>Brown v. Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. 140, 146, 841 P.2d 510, 514 (1992). The affirmative pleading avoids surprise and eliminates the sweeping ambiguities of a general denial. <em>Rambur v. Diehl Lumber Company, </em>144 Mont. 84, 89, 394 P.2d 745, 748 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">\u00b629 Nothing in M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) suggests that an affirmative defense may be raised later in the proceedings upon the showing of a lack of prejudice to the opposing party. This Court consistently has ruled against the circumvention of M. R. Civ. P 8(c)\u2019s requirement that an affirmative defense be pled by answer. We long have held that a party waives an affirmative defense if not raised by answer. <em>Brown, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514; <em>Chandler v. Madsen, </em>197 Mont. 234, 241, 642 P.2d 1028, 1032 (1982); <em>Estabrook v. Baden, </em>284 Mont. 419, 422, 943 P.2d 1334, 1336-37 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b630 The Shoemakers failed to plead the statute of limitations as affirmative defenses in their answer. The Shoemakers raised the statute of limitations defenses for the first time in an untimely motion for summary judgment that they filed almost a year after their answer to the Association\u2019s complaint. The Shoemakers first cited the eight-year statute of limitations for contracts, barring a claim for breach of the Deed of Restriction, and they also cited the five-year statute of limitations for quieting title against an adverse possessor, barring a claim for enforcement of the Jack Creek access road easement by reservation. The Shoemakers made no attempt, however, to amend their answer to include these defenses in the months leading up to their motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b631  The District Court\u2019s ruling denying their summary judgment claim prompted the Shoemakers to seek leave of court to amend their answer. The amendment came too late as more than three years had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>passed between the start of the litigation and the Shoemakers\u2019 motion for an amended answer. The Shoemakers\u2019 untimely presentation of the statute of limitations defense cuts against M. R. Civ. P. 8(c)\u2019s plain language and its purpose to provide notice of the specific defenses not raised by general denials. <em>Brown, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514. We agree with the District Court that the Shoemakers waived the statute of limitations defenses by failing to assert the defenses by answer. <em>Brown, </em>255 Mont. at 146, 841 P.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\n<em>Whether the District Court improperly resolved a genuine issue of material fact in granting the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b632 Our analysis begins with the fact that the Association possesses a valid recorded easement along the Jack Creek access road. The Deed of Restriction filed by the Association reserved easements on all existing roads within the subdivision, including the Jack Creek access road, for all property owners to access public lands. Furthermore, the Shoemakers do not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that a valid Deed of Restriction created an easement by reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b633  The Association provided Wilkins\u2019s and Daniel Shoemaker\u2019s deposition testimony to establish that the Shoemakers\u2019 gate interfered with the Association members\u2019 enjoyment of the easement. The Shoemakers\u2019 attempts to eliminate use of roadway by locking the gate and intimidating Jack Creek access road users directly violated the Deed of Restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b634 All subdivision lot owners in <em>Mason v. Garrison </em>similarly enjoyed the use of a communal dock through an easement until the servient tenement lot owner began to impede the path to the dock by putting up fencing, building gardens, and letting his dogs scare away other dock users. <em>Mason, </em>2000 MT 78, 299 Mont. 142, 998 P.2d 531. Although we stated that the servient lot owner may not be excluded from reasonable use of his property by the other lot owners, we concluded that the servient lot owner may not put his property to a use' that materially interferes with the rights of the dominant estates. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b635 Similarly, the Shoemakers\u2019 placement of a gate over the roadway may have been reasonable for purposes of excluding neighboring horses and livestock from their property. Their decision to lock the gate, to approach Association members while wearing a sidearm, and to call the Sheriff when Association members used the easement, however, materially interfered with the Association members\u2019 enjoyment of their easement. This material interference violated the Deed of Restriction. Therefore, the Association met its burden on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>summary judgment by demonstrating no genuine issue of material fact as to (1) creation of the easement, and (2) the Shoemakers\u2019 interference with the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">\u00b636 The Shoemakers\u2019 defense presents a twist on the usual easement analysis as they seek to <em>extinguish </em>through adverse possession a recorded easement- the Jack Creek access road-rather than <em>establish </em>an easement through adverse possession. The owner of the servient tenement extinguishes an easement through adverse use in the same manner as acquisition of title by adverse possession and acquisition of an easement by prescription: open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted use for the five-year statutory period. <em>Pearson v. Virginia City Ranches </em>Ass\u2019n, 2000 MT 12, \u00b6 46, 298 Mont. 52, \u00b6 46, 993 P.2d 688, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b637 The District Court applied the incorrect standard of proof. At trial, the party asserting a claim for adverse possession must prove each element by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Wareing v. Schreckendgust, </em>280 Mont. 196, 206, 930 P.2d 37, 43 (1996). Upon a motion for summary judgment, the moving party, if asserting easement by prescription or adverse possession, must establish by clear and convincing evidence the elements of prescription in order to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Hitshew v. Butte </em>/ <em>Silver Bow County, </em>1999 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20, 293 Mont. 212, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20, 974 P.2d 650, \u00b6\u00b6 16-20; <em>Unruh v. Tash, </em>271 Mont. 246, 254, 896 P.2d 433, 438 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"AfH\">\u00b638 The non-moving party, however, need only submit evidence of sufficient facts to support a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in favor of the movant. M. R. Civ. P. 56. The nonmovant must present evidence of some probative force, rather than merely rely on the defense pled. <em>Conboy v. State, </em>214 Mont. 492, 500, 693 P.2d 547, 551 (1985). The Shoemakers defended by alleging that they had extinguished the Association\u2019s easement through adverse possession. As the non-movant, the Shoemakers must present facts supporting, rather than negating, the elements of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"AoG\">\u00b639 The Shoemakers do not contest the District Court\u2019s determination on summary judgment that the Association had established the existence of a valid recorded easement and that the easement encumbered their land. They assert that the District Court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the Association because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to their adverse possession defense. This assertion falls short because the Shoemakers failed to present sufficient evidence to support each element of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>extinguishment by adverse possession claim. In fact, they presented evidence that negated their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b640 Like the District Court, we focus our analysis here on the \u201ccontinuous\u201d and \u201cuninterrupted\u201d elements. Continuous and uninterrupted denotes use that has not been interrupted by an act of the owner of the land or by the voluntary abandonment by the party claiming the right. <em>Brimstone Min., Inc. v Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 23, 317 Mont. 236, \u00b6 23, 77 P.3d 175, \u00b6 23. In <em>Brimstone, </em>we held that acts of adverse possession had not extinguished an already existing easement when the servient estate owner put up a locked gate and granted permission to a few users because \u201cpermissive use after a hostile act is sufficiently inconsistent to extinguish an easement.\u201d <em>Brimstone, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36, 41. \u201cContinuous use\u201d does not mean constant use; rather, if the claimant used the property in dispute whenever he desired, without interference by the owner of the servient estate, the use was continuous and uninterrupted. <em>Cook v. Hartman, </em>2003 MT 251, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 343, \u00b6 29, 77 P.3d 231, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes v. Vulles, </em>437 F.2d 177, 180 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">\u00b641 The record is replete with admissions from Daniel Shoemaker that Association members used the easement and with testimony from Wilkins that he and others continued to use the Jack Creek access road during the years that the Shoemakers claimed to have blocked access. This use by Association members interrupts the Shoemakers\u2019 attempted adverse possession of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b642 The Shoemakers admitted in their answer that their gate was only \u201csometimes\u201d locked. Wilkins testified in a deposition that the Shoemakers\u2019 gate had been \u201cleft wide open for days, weeks at a time\u201d and that he and at least ten other Association members continued to use the Jack Creek access road. The Shoemakers conceded that they left Montana for a good part of the year and, therefore, would not have known if the easement was used while they were out of state. Wilkins further testified that the Association regularly maintained and graded the road using money collected from Association dues. The Shoemakers even conceded that the Association had graded the road. The Shoemakers\u2019 inconsistently locked gate, the uncertainty in their ability to enforce their claim of right while out of state, and the Association\u2019s payment for road grading constitute sufficient inconsistency by the Shoemakers, the party asserting the adverse possession right, similar to that present in <em>Brimstone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b643  Like <em>Brimstone, </em>the Shoemakers put up a gate, sometimes locked it, and granted permission to a few users: a real estate agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>an elk hunter, and their cousin. We similarly conclude here that the Shoemakers\u2019 inconsistent actions failed to extinguish an easement. Our review of the record reveals, however, sufficient evidence to determine that the District Court reached the right result that the Shoemakers failed to establish a prima facie case for uninterrupted possession in granting summary judgment to the Association even if it employed the wrong standard. <em>State v. Rensvold, </em>2006 MT 146, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 392, \u00b6 34, 139 P.3d 154, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">\u00b644 The Shoemakers contend that they adequately challenged Wilkins\u2019s testimony through Daniel Shoemaker\u2019s deposition and other affidavits to the point of raising a genuine issue of material fact. The record highlights, however, the Shoemakers\u2019 ever-evolving defense. The Shoemakers claimed in their answer to have locked the gate \u201csometimes.\u201d The Shoemakers\u2019 answer asserted abandonment and waiver as their affirmative defense. These claims contradict Daniel Shoemaker\u2019s deposition testimony, affidavit declarations, and hearing testimony. In his deposition, Shoemaker asserted non-use as his affirmative defense. In his affidavit, he asserted adverse possession as his affirmative defense and, in his hearing testimony, he continued to assert adverse possession through his locking of the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b645 A party may not avoid summary judgment by creating factual inconsistencies in the record. \u201cIt is the general rule that allegations, statements, or admissions contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the pleader, and are admissible as against the party making them in the litigation as proof of the facts which they admit.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Mace, </em>99 Mont. 421, 427-28, 45 P.2d 771, 73-74 (1935). We take the admissions made in the Shoemakers\u2019 answer as proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b646 Similarly, \u201c[w]hen statements in an affidavit submitted pursuant to Rule 56(e), M.R.Civ.P., are repudiated in a later deposition, the affidavit statements do not raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Herron v. Columbus Hosp., </em>284 Mont. 190, 195, 943 P.2d 1272, 1275 (1997). District courts may grant summary judgment where a party\u2019s sudden and unexplained revision of testimony creates an issue of fact where none existed before. <em>Stott v. Fox, </em>246 Mont. 301, 309, 805 P.2d 1305, 1310 (1990); <em>Kaseta v. N. Western Agency of Gr. Falls, </em>252 Mont. 135, 140, 827 P.2d 804, 807 (1992). Therefore, we must consider the unexplained inconsistencies between the answer, deposition testimony, affidavit and hearing testimony of Daniel Shoemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b647 The Shoemakers contradicted themselves throughout the litigation when asked how many Association members they had seen using the easement across their property. The Shoemakers\u2019 answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>declared that <em>no one </em>had used the easement in the 17 years they had owned the property. Daniel Shoemaker admitted in his deposition that he saw Wilkins using it two times and that he could not say whether Wilkins otherwise had used the easement. Shoemaker estimated a <em>total of seven </em>users in 17 years. His affidavit named <em>only two </em>exceptions to the assertion that no one used the easement in 17 years: a deer hunter who was denied permission and the real estate agent who was granted permission. Finally, in his testimony at the summary judgment hearing, he claimed that he saw Wilkins use the easement <em>twice, </em>that he caught a lost hunter on the easement once, and that he had seen Dwayne Allen\u2019s son using it once. We consider these contradictions in light of Wilkins\u2019s consistent statements at the show cause hearing and during his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b648 Daniel Shoemaker\u2019s statements regarding how often the gate was locked further evidence the Shoemakers\u2019 evolving defense. For example, the Shoemakers\u2019 answer included the admission that the gate was \u201csometimes\u201d locked-a position consistent with Wilkins\u2019s testimony. Daniel Shoemaker\u2019s deposition, affidavit and hearing testimony declared, however, that the gate had been locked always, except for his family entering and leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b649  The parties do not provide conflicting accounts. We instead have one party making admissions in its answer that conflict with statements provided in a deposition that, in turn, conflict with statements in an affidavit and testimony during a hearing. This scenario does not create a genuine issue of material fact between the parties; it highlights the evolving nature of the Shoemakers\u2019 defense. The Shoemakers\u2019 shifting accounts fail to refute the Association\u2019s evidence to the point of creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding their adverse possession claim that could be resolved only at trial. These contradictory declarations would leave a jury no reasonable basis on which to find adverse possession. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Scott, </em>\u00b6 22. The Shoemakers presented no credible evidence with respect to the continuous and uninterrupted elements of adverse possession that could allow a jury to determine that the Shoemakers had extinguished the Jack Creek access road easement by adverse possession. <em>LaTray, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Scott, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b650  Once the prima facie case of adverse possession has been made, the presumption shifts in favor of the adverse user\u2019s title and the burden shifts to the other party to show that such use was permissive rather than adverse. <em>Warnack v. Coneen Family Trust, </em>266 Mont. 203, 216, 879 P.2d 715, 723 (1994). The presumption of adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>use never sprang into existence here, however, because the Shoemakers failed to establish a prima facie case in support of all of the elements. <em>Warnack, </em>266 Mont. at 216-17, 879 P.2d at 724. We agree with the District Court that the fact of some use, regardless of frequency, defeats the continuous and uninterrupted elements of the Shoemakers\u2019 defense of extinguishment by adverse possession. This deficiency entitles the Association to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Osterman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>2003 MT 327, \u00b6 34, 318 Mont. 342, \u00b6 34, 80 P.3d 435, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">\u00b651 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
