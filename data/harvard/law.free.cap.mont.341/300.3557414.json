Issue 2: Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence on Robinson when it imposed sentences both for his offenses and because he is a persistent felony offender?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-19\">\u00b63 The State charged Robinson with three felony counts of assault on a peace officer, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210, MCA, one felony count of failure to register as a sexual offender, in violation of \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA, and one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-301, MCA. The charges arose from an altercation that occurred when Ravalli County Sheriffs Deputies served Robinson with a California arrest warrant. The State timely filed notice of its intent to seek to have Robinson sentenced as a persistent felony offender</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u00b64 Trial commenced on July 18, 2005. After the prosecutor had completed his voir dire, during which he explained to the venire panel that Robinson was presumed innocent until proven guilty, defense counsel asked the entire panel whether \u201cthey kind of think he\u2019s probably guilty since he\u2019s sitting here?\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Does anyone differ from that attitude; that they kind of think he\u2019s probably guilty since he\u2019s sitting here? Anybody? Anybody want to be brave enough to weigh in on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">PROSEPECTIVE JUROR: I would assume.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, it would look that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: It appears to you he\u2019s probably guilty because he\u2019s sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Are you in agreement with the concept of innocent until proven guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Are you assuming he\u2019s innocent now or are you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-13\">PROSEPCTIVE JUROR: Well, it would seem rather strange to assemble all these people if there was not some reason for him to be sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: So in that sense, are you sort of assuming he\u2019s guilty before you hear the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. Do you think it\u2019s going to be real hard for you to be impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, no, not when I hear both sides of the story, but you know, that\u2019s what trials are about is bringing in someone that they pretty well know is guilty of something, and then having a couple lawyers battle back and forth with words for a couple, two or three days, trying to decide-or trying to convince the jury of their point of view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-18\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Fair enough, and I-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-19\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: You know, you\u2019ve got two sides here, he can say his side and the law enforcement can say their side and we can decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-20\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Fair enough. And I don\u2019t want to pick on you, because I respect your opinion, but do you think maybe you\u2019re not fully incorporating the idea of innocent until proven guilty in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, that could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Do you feel maybe in some respect you are presuming he\u2019s guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Do you think this maybe isn\u2019t the best trial for you then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, no, because I sat through another one with the same attitude, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Let\u2019s put that one aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Since you\u2019ve already-and I do appreciate your candor. You\u2019ve already told the Court that you\u2019re really not going into this case with an attitude of impartiality and you\u2019re not really going in with the idea of innocent until proven guilty, that maybe-maybe it\u2019s not entirely fair for Mr. Robinson to have you on the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Well, that could be, but I kind of wonder how many other people just figure he\u2019s guilty because he\u2019s here, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, that may be, but you are the one who has been candid enough to say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: On those grounds, I\u2019d ask for [Ms. P] to be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-15\">THE COURT: Cross?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-16\">PROSECUTOR: I\u2019ve been through this now with several individuals, and I know that part of the difficulty, I think. You\u2019ve got some suspicions because of what you heard so far. There\u2019s no getting around the charges here, failure to register as a sexual offender and that sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s-well, the assault thing, I mean, obviously, if somebody was beat up on, they\u2019re going to be upset about it and they\u2019re going to bring suit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">PROSECUTOR: I can fairly tell you that there\u2019s no other suits that are-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-19\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Involved. Yeah, I realize that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">PROSECUTOR: The [sic] there\u2019s nothing hidden here. The only trial right now or lawsuit is the one that you\u2019re presently involved in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-21\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-22\">PROSECUTOR: The reason I\u2019m concerned, [Ms. P], because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the difficulty of the charges, as I mentioned to [Ms. J] before she was excused\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, that\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s just the fact that the assault charges, okay, somebody was hurt and upset about it so they got him here on trial, because they were hit or slugged or threatened or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">PROSECUTOR: The real questions that I think that you\u2019re going to have to decide in this trial if you\u2019re on the jury, [Ms. P], is whether or not police officers were assaulted by Mr. Robinson. He\u2019s going to defend that, Mr. Stevenson is going to defend that vigorously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Right, I realize that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">PROSECUTOR: All we\u2019re asking is, despite your suspicions, if you please, do you think that you are willing to listen to all of the evidence, both sides-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes, I can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">PROSECUTOR:-before you confirm your suspicion that Mr. Robinson may be guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: I can do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">PROSECUTOR: You understand that he\u2019s not guilty just because he\u2019s sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, but I\u2019m not sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">THE COURT: Now, [Ms. P], in your mind, do you understand the difference between probable cause and beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-16\">THE COURT: And so you understand that a person could be put on trial merely on a finding that there\u2019s probable cause that they may have committed an offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-17\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-18\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s basically a reasonable suspicion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-19\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: (Witness nods head.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-20\">THE COURT: And then it\u2019s up to the jury to decide if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that they actually did commit the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-21\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-22\">THE COURT: And you acknowledge that there are people put on trial who are found not guilty by juries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-23\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-24\">THE COURT: And there are people that are either accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>falsely or accused of something in excess of what they actually did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes, unfortunately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re not presuming that he is guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, but there\u2019s reasonable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">THE COURT: Well, probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Probable cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">THE COURT: But you\u2019re prepared to hold [the prosecutor] to his burden of proof to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed what he\u2019s charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">THE COURT: And if [the prosecutor] fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed one or more of these offenses, then you would be willing to return a not guilty verdict on those charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">THE COURT: And you don\u2019t hold any personal bias against Mr. Robinson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: No, I don\u2019t know the man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">THE COURT: And you will follow the jury instructions as best you can?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-16\">PROSPECTIVE JUROR: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">\u00b65 Robinson subsequently used a peremptory challenge to remove the juror and also exercised all of his peremptory challenges. The District Court dismissed one count of assault on a peace officer at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case. The jury found Robinson guilty of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">\u00b66 The District Court held a sentencing hearing on September 21, 2005. The District Court concluded that Robinson was a persistent felony offender. Robinson has not challenged that designation. The District Court sentenced Robinson to ten years in prison on Count One, assault on a peace officer, with an additional, consecutive, ten year prison term as a persistent felony offender; ten years in prison on Count Two, assault on a peace officer, with an additional, consecutive ten year prison term as a persistent felony offender. The sentences on Counts One and Two were ordered to run concurrently with each other, resulting in a total sentence of twenty years for assault on a peace officer. Robinson was sentenced to five years in prison for failure to register as a sexual offender, with an additional five year sentence as a persistent felony offender. These latter two sentences were ordered to run consecutive to each other and consecutive to the twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>years in prison imposed for assault on a peace officer. The District Court also sentenced Robinson to six months in jail for resisting arrest, to run concurrently with the other sentences. These sentences resulted in a judgment requiring Robinson to serve a total of thirty years in prison. Robinson now appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to a prospective juror for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 6, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 6, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 6. If a district court abuses its discretion in denying a challenge for cause, the defendant uses a peremptory challenge to remove the juror, and also uses all of his peremptory challenges, we will reverse the judgment and order a new trial. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 7, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b68  A defendant may challenge a prospective juror for cause if the juror \u201cha[s] a state of mind in reference to the case ... that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. To determine whether a juror must be excused for cause, courts must examine both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances in a given situation. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 16. If voir dire examination of a prospective juror raises serious doubts about the juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, the juror should be removed. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 8</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b69  A district court should excuse a prospective juror for cause if he or she has a fixed opinion of a defendant\u2019s guilt before trial begins. <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 21, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 21, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 21, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 63, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 63, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 63. In <em>DeVore, </em>we concluded that two jurors should have been excused for cause because they repeatedly stated they assumed the defendant was \u201cguilty of something\u201d and they could not suspend that belief. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Similarly, where a juror agreed with defense counsel that she would have a hard time with the presumption of innocence and gave weight to the simple fact that defendant was charged with a crime, the district court erred when it did not excuse the juror for cause. <em>State v. Hausauer, </em>2006 MT 336, \u00b6 28, 335 Mont. 137, \u00b6 28, 149 P.3d 895, \u00b6 28</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b610  In contrast, if a prospective juror merely expresses some concern about remaining impartial, but believes he can lay aside any concerns and fairly weigh the evidence, the district court is not required to remove the juror for cause. <em>State v. Falls Down, </em>2003 MT 300, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 318 Mont. 219, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, 32, 79 P.3d 797, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>32. <em>See also State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 328 Mont. 223, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 119 P.3d 88, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (concluding that a juror did not need removed for cause, even though he had strong religious beliefs about the charges at issue, because he consistently stated that he would follow the law and fairly weigh the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b611 This Court typically gives weight to a prospective juror\u2019s spontaneous statements because they are most likely to be reliable and honest. <em>DeVore, </em>\u00b6 28. A district court should not attempt to rehabilitate jurors whose spontaneous statements demonstrate bias by putting jurors in a position where they will not disagree with the court. <em>Good, </em>\u00b6 54. Coaxed recantations in which jurors state they will merely follow the law, whether prompted by the trial court, the prosecution, or the defense, do not cure or erase a clearly stated bias which demonstrates actual prejudice against the substantial rights of a party. <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 18, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 18, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 18. Still, a district court may ask questions to clarify a juror\u2019s statements and better understand whether the juror is biased or not. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b612  Based on the totality of the circumstances shown by the questions and answers of the prospective juror in this case, as noted above, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the District Court abused its discretion when it denied the challenge for cause. She repeatedly stated that she understood that Robinson was presumed innocent and said she could, and would, be impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b613 As in <em>DeVore </em>and <em>Hausauer, </em>the prospective juror made some comments that suggested she was struggling with the presumption of innocence. She presumed there was some reason to suspect him and put him on trial, or a jury would not have been called. This is a reasonable and logical reaction to being called for jury duty and subjected to voir dire. However, unlike the prospective jurors in <em>DeVore </em>and <em>Hausauer, </em>who stated they could not suspend their presumption the defendant was guilty of something, the prospective juror in this case repeatedly told counsel and the judge that she understood Robinson might be innocent. She did not express a fixed opinion about Robinson\u2019s guilt, but merely stated that the fact he was on trial gave her some doubts about his innocence. As we concluded in <em>Falls Down, </em>a juror need not be excused for cause simply for raising some concerns about a defendant\u2019s innocence, as long as the District Court reasonably concludes the juror is able to lay aside such concerns. When a juror makes conflicting statements, as in this case, the decision whether to grant a challenge for cause is within the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of the trial judge, who has the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question, and to consider her responses in the context of the courtroom, and then determine whether serious doubts exist about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial. <em>See State v. Wright, </em>2002 MT 275, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 352, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 432, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b614  The trial judge\u2019s questions in this case did not lead to a coaxed recantation of a bias as in <em>Freshment. See Freshment, </em>\u00b6 18. In contrast to both <em>Freshment </em>and <em>Good, </em>the District Court here did not place the juror in a position where she simply agreed to follow the law despite a bias. Instead, the District Court judge, as in <em>Heath, </em>clarified her answers and explained the concept of probable cause as a basis for charging someone with a crime. In this instance, the judge appropriately questioned the prospective juror and discussed her answers with her. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Robinson\u2019s challenge for cause to the prospective juror</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b615  This Court reviews a criminal sentence for its legality. If a sentence falls within the statutory parameters, it is legal. <em>State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 55, 333 Mont. 23, \u00b6 55, 140 P.3d 454, \u00b6 55. We grant trial judges \u201cbroad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment.\u201d <em>State v. Ford, </em>278 Mont. 353, 364, 926 P.2d 245, 251 (1996) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b616 When the District Court designated Robinson a persistent felony offender, he became subject to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA, which provides that an offender \u201cshall be imprisoned in a state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years.\u201d Section 46-18-502(2), MCA. The sentencing statute for persistent felony offenders replaces the maximum sentence for an offense, rather than creating a sentence that is imposed in addition to the offense. <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>247 Mont. 206, 208, 805 P.2d 584, 586 (1991). Thus, a district court exceeded the maximum legal sentence when it imposed not only a sentence of ten years, but also imposed an additional 100 year sentence because the defendant was designated a persistent felony offender. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>247 Mont. at 207, 805 P.2d at 585</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b617 In contrast, a district court does not impose an illegal sentence if a persistent felony offender\u2019s sentence falls below the maximum sentence provided. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>282 Mont. 183, 188, 936 P.2d 804, 806-07 (1997), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. In <em>Gunderson, </em>the court imposed a twenty year term for the offense as well as ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>years for the defendant\u2019s persistent felony offender status. Gunderson argued this violated the rule announced in <em>Fitzpatrick </em>because the court imposed a separate sentence upon him as a persistent felony offender. However, we concluded that his sentence was legal because it fell within the statutory limits. <em>Gunderson, </em>282 Mont. at 188, 936 P.2d at 806-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b618  Robinson, relying on <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>argues that his sentence is illegal because sentences as a persistent felony offender are imposed in addition to the sentences for the offenses themselves. Robinson is correct that the District Court did impose sentences for being a persistent felony offender on top of those for assault on a peace officer and failure to register as a sex offender. However, the sentences imposed, in total, are well below the maximum provided for by \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA. We conclude Robinson\u2019s sentences are not illegal because, in total, they are within statutory parameters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b619  The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Robinson\u2019s challenge for cause to a prospective juror, and it did not impose an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> It is not an issue in this case, and we express no opinion, whether the maximum persistent felony offender sentence could have been imposed for each felony Robinson was found to have committed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
