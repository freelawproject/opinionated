We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">\u00b62 BEA presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly determined that teacher transfers and assignments are not mandatory subjects of bargaining under Montana\u2019s Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-17\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly determined that the management rights clause of the collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>protected the District from an unfair labor practice claim when it transferred teachers without bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court properly remanded to the Hearings Officer the question of whether a long-standing practice should be treated as an express provision of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b66 The District hired a new superintendent, Doug Ardiana (Ardiana), between the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years. Ardiana and BEA president Julie Foley (Foley) met to discuss Ardiana\u2019s administrative plans before the start of the 2003-2004 school year. Ardiana informed Foley that he had reassigned teachers in other school districts in which he had worked, and that he would consider doing so in Bonner as he thought necessary to meet the needs of the District. The District involuntarily transferred and reassigned several teachers at Ardiana\u2019s direction during the 2003-2004 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b67 The transfers and reassignments affected the subjects taught and the teachers\u2019 areas of expertise. The District had not involuntarily transferred or reassigned teachers within the previous ten years. BEA responded on April 14, 2004, by filing an unfair labor practice claim with the Board of Personnel Appeals (Board). BEA alleged that the District improperly had refused to bargain for the transfers and reassignments. BEA alleged that the District violated \u00a7\u00a7 39-31-401 and 39-31-305(2) MCA, by refusing to bargain in good faith with respect to a condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u00b68 BEA and the District were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) at the time. The term of the CBA ran from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2004. The CBA did not specifically provide procedures for teacher transfers and reassignments. The CBA did include a management rights clause that recognized the School Board\u2019s prerogative to manage the school district, \u201cexcept as limited by explicit terms of [the CBA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b69 The Board conducted a hearing to determine whether Montana law or the terms of the CBA required the District to bargain in good faith for the transfers. The Board considered both the explicit statutory management right to \u201chire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees...,\u201d provided in \u00a7 39-31-303(2), MCA, and the statutory duty to bargain in good faith for conditions of employment, provided in \u00a7 39-31-305(2), MCA. The Board determined that involuntary teacher transfers constituted mandatory subjects of bargaining as conditions of employment and as conditions that \u201ccan have a great impact on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>well-being of an individual teacher,\u201d citing its own decision in <em>Florence-Carlton Unit v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 15-6 </em>(1979), ULP 5-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b610 The Board also considered whether the CBA allowed the District to make involuntary teacher transfers and reassignments. The District asserted that the CBA\u2019s management rights clause provided express authorization. The clause recognized the School Board\u2019s \u201cprerogativeG ... to operate and manage the school district and retain, without limitation, all powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities conferred upon and vested in it by law. . ..\u201d The District claimed that this portion of the CBA expressly incorporated the statutory management rights set forth in \u00a7 39-31-303(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b611 The Board rejected this interpretation of the CBA. The Board concluded that such a broad interpretation of management rights necessarily would defeat other express provisions of the CBA regarding teacher choice in staffing and hiring decisions. Moreover, the Board found the CBA to be ambiguous as to the parties\u2019 intent to incorporate the statutory management right. The Board also concluded that a teacher\u2019s right to continue teaching a subject or a grade represented a \u201cprofessional advantage\u201d explicitly preserved and protected under the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b612 The Board finally determined that the CBA\u2019s integration clause and the management rights clause did not constitute a waiver of BEA\u2019s right to bargain for transfers and reassignments. The Board applied a federal interpretative scheme that considered the parties\u2019 past bargaining history and the absence of an express waiver of BEA\u2019s right in the CBA. The Board determined that the parties past bargaining practice of not addressing transfers and reassignments and the absence of an express waiver preserved BEA\u2019s right to bargain for transfers and reassignments in the CBA. The Board therefore concluded that the District committed an unfair labor practice when it transferred or reassigned teachers without bargaining with BEA.</p>\n<p id=\"ABU\">\u00b613 The District petitioned the District Court for judicial review. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court determined that the statutory management right contained in \u00a7 39-31-303, MCA, expressly reserved to the District the right to transfer or assign involuntarily as evidenced by management\u2019s \u201cprerogativeG ... [to] hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees ....\u201d The District Court concluded that only \u201cother working\u201d conditions not expressly listed under \u00a7 39-31-303, MCA, represented mandatory subjects of collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court also determined that the CBA\u2019s management rights clause and the statutory management right authorized the District to transfer and assign unilaterally absent an express provision requiring bargaining for teacher transfers. The District Court declined to consider whether BEA had waived its right to bargain for transfers and assignments in light of its decision that the transfers and assignments fell within the District\u2019s management rights. Finally, the District Court remanded to the hearing examiner the question of whether the District\u2019s long-standing practice of not making unilateral transfers without bargaining should be treated as though it constituted an express term of the CBA. BEA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b615  A district court reviews an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the whole record. A district court will uphold an agency\u2019s conclusion of law if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. We in turn employ the same standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s decision. <em>Roos v. Kircher Public School Bd., </em>2004 MT 48, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 128, \u00b6 7, 86 P.3d 39, \u00b6 7. The interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement provision presents a question of law that this Court reviews to determine if it is correct. <em>Hughes v. Blankenship, </em>266 Mont. 150, 154, 879 P.2d 685, 687 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that teacher transfers and assignments are not mandatory subjects of bargaining under Montana\u2019s Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b617 Section 39-31-305(2), MCA, obligates a public employer to bargain \u201cin good faith with respect to wages, hours, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment....\u201d This mandate is virtually identical to the collective bargaining mandate in title 29, section 158(d) of the United States Code, a section of the federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Section 158(d) provides that the parties must negotiate \u201cin good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment ....\u2019\u201929U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). An employer commits an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 39-31-401(5), MCA, if it refuses to negotiate in good faith on any of these subjects. Neither the Montana Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act, nor the NLRA defines \u201cother conditions of employment.\u201d We have not had the opportunity yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>to examine the scope of \u201cother conditions of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b618 This Court has looked previously to federal courts\u2019 construction of the NLRA as an aid to interpretation of the Montana Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act. <em>Small v. McRae, </em>200 Mont 497, 502, 651 P.2d 982, 985 (1982) (citing <em>State, Dept of Hwys. v. Public Employees Craft Court., </em>165 Mont. 349, 529 P.2d 785 (1974). The similarity between \u00a7 39-31-305(2), MCA, and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and the fact that we have not yet explored the scope of \u201cother conditions of employment,\u201d leads us to look to these federal decisions for instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\">\u00b619 The U.S. Supreme Court and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) have construed conditions of employment broadly for purposes of the collective bargaining mandate. For example, the Court in <em>Fibreboard Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 209-16, 85 S. Ct. 398, 402-05 (1964), stated that the policy of fostering \u201cindustrial peace\u201d represents a primary consideration when classifying a bargaining subject as a condition of employment under the NLRA. Similarly, the Court in <em>Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, </em>441 U.S. 488, 495, 99 S. Ct. 1842, 1848 (1979), pronounced that the courts must show deference to the NLRB\u2019s classifications of bargaining subjects as conditions of employment. In <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>where the U.S. Supreme Court held that the setting of food prices for in-plant meals for employees constituted a condition of employment, it described conditions of employment as matters \u201cplainly germane to the working environment,\u201d and \u201cnot among those managerial decisions which lie at the core of entrepreneurial control.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>441 U.S. at 498, 99 S. ct. at 1850 (citing <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>379 U.S. at 222-23, 85 S. Ct. at 409) (internal quotation marks omitted). Managerial decisions that \u201clie at the core of entrepreneurial control,\u201d as distinguished from conditions of employment, include those things related to the \u201cbasic scope of the enterprise....\u201d <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>379 U.S. at 223, 85 S. Ct. at 409 (Stewart, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b620 The federal courts and the NLRB have determined that a diverse range of issues qualify as conditions of employment, and thus constitute mandatory bargaining subjects. The NLRB in <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Fayetteville, </em>330 NLRB 900, 902-03 (2000), held that telephone access, break policies, and accounting for product shortfalls qualify as conditions of employment under the NLRA. Free agency and reserve issues in professional baseball constitute conditions of employment under the NLRA. <em>Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Comm., </em>67 F.3d 1054, 1060-62 (2d Cir. 1995). Rental rates for company houses also represent conditions of employment under the NLRA. <em>American Smelting and Refining Co. v. NLRB, </em>406 F.2d 552, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>553-55 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b621 The federal courts and the NLRB, in early cases interpreting the scope of the NLRA, specifically have held that employee transfers constitute conditions of employment that must he bargained under the NLRA. In <em>Rapid Roller Co. v. NLRB, </em>126 F.2d 452, 457-60 (7th Cir. 1942), the court determined that transferring employees from department to department constituted a condition of employment that required collective bargaining. The NLRB held in <em>In re U.S. Automatic Corp., </em>57 NLRB 124, 133-35 (1944), that even transfers of non-union employees presented proper subjects of mandatory collective bargaining. And in <em>Inland Steel Co. v. NLRB, </em>170 F.2d 247, 252-53 (7th Cir. 1948), the court determined that a related bargaining subject, seniority, posed a mandatory bargaining subject because requiring negotiation provides \u201cprotection of employees against arbitrary management conduct in connection with hire, promotion, demotion, <em>transfer </em>and discharge ....\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b622 We agree with those early federal NLRA decisions that employee transfers and reassignments, like those at issue in this case, constitute conditions of employment. The teacher transfers in Bonner were \u201cplainly germane to the working environment,\u201d perhaps more plainly so than the in-plant meal prices for employees in <em>Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Co., </em>441 U.S. at 498, 99 S. Ct. at 1850. The involuntarily transferred Bonner teachers experienced changes in the subjects they were expected to teach, the number of subjects they were expected to teach, and the abilities and special needs of the students they were expected to teach. The Board recognized the importance of a teacher\u2019s particular assignment. The Board noted the expertise that teachers acquire over years of teaching the same subject, the supplies and materials pertinent to each subject (sometimes purchased with their own funds), and the value of the continuing education unique to their particular subject or grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b623 The teacher transfers did not concern the \u201cbasic scope of the enterprise,\u201d and thus did not lie \u201cat the core of entrepreneurial control.\u201d <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>379 U.S. at 223, 85 S. Ct. at 409. The transfers did not concern the subjects being taught at the school. The transfers concerned who would teach those subjects. The transfers did not concern which grades were taught at the school. The transfers concerned who would teach those grades. The scope of the school\u2019s enterprise remained the same-educating students in grades kindergarten through eight. The conditions changed under which its employees were expected to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b624  We hold that teacher transfers and reassignments constitute \u201cother conditions of employment\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 39-31-305(2), MCA. This interpretation comports with the policy goals pronounced by the legislature in enacting the collective bargaining statutes. Section 39-31-101, MCA, articulates that the overarching policy behind the Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act encourages \u201cthe practice and procedure of collective bargaining to arrive at friendly adjustment of all disputes between public employers and the employees.\u201d This policy mirrors the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fibreboard, </em>in which it held that fostering \u201cindustrial peace\u201d must be a primary consideration in determining whether an issue constitutes a condition of employment under the NLRA. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>379 U.S. at 209-15, 85 S. Ct. at 402-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b625 The District points out that the NLRA lacks a management rights provision that corresponds to \u00a7 39-31-303, MCA. The District argues that this omission precludes us from analogizing to federal law concerning topics deemed to be conditions of employment and therefore subject to mandatory collective bargaining. The Montana management rights provision recognizes, in pertinent part, the \u201cprerogatives of public employers to operate and manage their affairs in such areas as, but not limited to ... hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees.\u201d Section 39-31-303(2), MCA. BEA acknowledges this distinction between Montana and federal law, but asserts nevertheless that federal court and NLRB decisions should guide our decision in light of the fact the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized an implicit and inherent right to manage existing in the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b626 BEA cites <em>First National Maintenance Corp. v. NLRB, </em>452 U.S. 666, 101 S. Ct. 2573 (1981), as an example of the broad management rights recognized by federal courts. The Court held that management retains the right under the NLRA to manage \u201cfree from the constraints of the bargaining process to the extent essential for the running of a profitable business.\u201d <em>First National Maintenance, </em>452 U.S. at 678-79, 101 S. Ct. at 2580-81. The Court concluded that the \u201cemployer\u2019s need for unencumbered decisionmaking\u201d empowered the employer to discharge a number of its employees without bargaining, notwithstanding the statutory duty. <em>First National Maintenance, </em>452 U.S. at 679, 101 S. Ct. 2581.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b627 A comparison of the implicit federal management right recognized by the federal courts with the explicit management right provided in \u00a7 39-31-303(2), MCA, reveals the undefined federal right to be more expansive. The federal management right contains no defined scope or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>outer limit. The federal courts nevertheless have determined that employers have a duty to bargain for employee transfers under the NLRA. <em>Rapid Roller Co., </em>126 F.2d at 457-60; <em>In re U.S. Automatic Corp., </em>57 NLRB at 133-35; <em>Inland Steel Co., </em>170 F.2d 252-53. The Montana management rights provision, on the other hand, discusses a \u201cprerogative\u201d rather than a \u201cright,\u201d and defines the particular subjects to which it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b628 The District urges us to rely on federal authority interpreting management rights clauses in collective bargaining agreements that employ language similar to the language in \u00a7 39-31-303, MCA. The District contends that those cases consistently have determined that management rights clauses permit employers to exercise expressly reserved rights without first bargaining. The District argues that <em>Uforma/Shelby Business Forms, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>111 F.3d 1284, 1290 (6th Cir. 1997), and <em>NLRB v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>8 F.3d 832, 838 (D.C. Cir. 1993), should guide our decision. The District\u2019s reliance on <em>Uforma </em>and <em>U.S. Postal Service </em>falls short.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b629 <em>Uforma </em>involved a waiver by the union. The union\u2019s express waiver of its right to bargain collectively by agreeing to \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d language in the collective bargaining agreement sustained the <em>Uforma </em>corut\u2019s conclusion. <em>Uforma, </em>111 F.3d at 1290. The Corut in <em>U.S. Postal Service </em>decided the case primarily on the basis of whether the union had lost its right to bargain for a subject by previously agreeing to its inclusion in the management rights clause of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>U.S. Postal Service, </em>8 F.3d at 836-38. The current controversy involves no similar bargaining or express waiver of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b630 Moreover, as a matter of statutory construction, the statutory management rights provision does not absolve public employers from their duty to bargain for employee transfers. The management rights provision refers to management\u2019s \u201cprerogative[]\u201d to \u201chire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees.\u201d Section 39-31-303(2), MCA. Both BEA and the District urge that we interpret \u201cprerogative\u201d according to the plain dictionary meaning of the term. Both rely on substantially similar definitions of prerogative as \u201can exclusive or special right, power or privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b631 The District contends that an exclusive right, power, or privilege means an unlimited right with regard to the subjects listed in the management rights provision regardless of the duty to bargain under \u00a7 39-31-305, MCA. The District argues that the provision absolves it of a duty to bargain for all subjects listed. BEA counters that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>prerogative means the exclusive right to make a final decision in the matter. BEA points out that this right to decide remains intact whether the statute requires the employer to bargain. BEA asserts that a bargaining mandate only obligates the employer to meet with the employees\u2019 representative and negotiate in good faith. The statute mandates the process. It requires management to concede nothing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b632  Such an interpretation avoids unnecessary conflict between the two statutes. It also serves both the practical necessity for management rights and the stated purpose of the Montana Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act \u201cto encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining to arrive at friendly adjustment of all disputes between public employers and their employees.\u201d Section 39-31-101, MCA. In light of our determination that \u00a7 39-31-305(2), MCA, requires the District to bargain regarding teacher transfers, we hold that the District Court improperly determined that the District was not required to bargain for teacher transfers and reassignments under the Montana Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AsG\">\u00b633 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that the management-rights clause of the collective bargaining agreement between the District and BEA protected the District from an unfair labor practice claim when it transferred teachers without bargaining.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">\u00b634 The rules of contract construction guide us in determining whether the CBA permitted the District to transfer teachers without bargaining. <em>See e.g. Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 18, 338 Mont. 402, \u00b6 18, 168 P.3d 615, \u00b6 18. We long have recognized, however, the importance of promoting \u201cthe practice and procedure of collective bargaining to arrive at friendly adjustment of all disputes between public employers and their employees.\u201d <em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 502, 651 P.2d at 987 (citing \u00a7 39-31-101, MCA). This same policy animates federal labor law. This Court previously has looked to federal courts for guidance in interpreting collective bargaining agreements. <em>Small, </em>200 Mont. at 502, 651 P.2d at 985. \u201c[R]efusals to confer and negotiate had been one of the most prolific causes of industrial strife\u201d before the advent of modern labor principles. <em>Fibreboard Corp., </em>379 U.S. at 211, 85 S. Ct. at 403. This overarching policy goal also guides our consideration of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b635 The District argues that the CBA\u2019s management rights provision explicitly provides the District with authority to make unilateral teacher transfers without bargaining. This provision, Article IV, \u00a7 4.1 of the CBA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>[BEA] recognizes the prerogatives of the [District] to operate and manage the school district and retain, without limitation all powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities conferred upon and vested in it by law, except as limited by explicit terms of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The District contends that the prerogatives recognized in this provision necessarily must include the right to transfer because it is not \u201climited by explicit terms\u201d elsewhere in the CBA. The District further argues that the provision will be rendered meaningless unless we interpret the provision in this way. The District contends that our failure to apply this interpretation would violate the rule of contract construction that provides that \u201c[t]he whole of a contract is to be taken together so as to give effect to every part if reasonably practicable ....\u201d Section 28-3-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b636 Reading the CBA as a whole, however, reveals that two other clauses figure prominently. The CBA contains an integration clause, commonly known as a \u201czipper clause,\u201d that provides that the parties have subsumed all agreements into the CBA. <em>International Union v. Murata Erie North </em>America, 980 F.2d 889, 903 (3rd Cir. 1992). A union that agrees to a zipper clause generally waives its right to bargain for otherwise mandatory subj ects of bargaining that might not be included in the agreement. <em>International Union, </em>980 F.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b637 The zipper clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">[The CBA constitutes] the full and complete [a]greement between the [District] and the BEA. The provisions herein relating to salary, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment supersede any and all prior agreements, resolutions, practices, rules or regulations concerning salary, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment inconsistent with these provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av0\">The clause, read in isolation, could be interpreted to waive BEA\u2019s statutory right to bargain for teacher transfers and assignments as terms and conditions of employment. <em>International Union, </em>980 F.2d at 903. We do not read a particular clause in isolation, however, as we must interpret the CBA as a whole. Section 28-3-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b638 The CBA also contains a professional advantages clause. The clause provides that the CBA \u201cshall not be interpreted to deprive teachers of professional advantages heretofore enjoyed, however, this does not incorporate these advantages into this contract.\u201d The Board determined that \u201cthe ability to continue to teach in a subject or grade of a member\u2019s choice\u201d constitutes a professional advantage protected under that clause. We have not yet had an opportunity to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>scope of a professional advantages clause. Other jurisdictions have interpreted a professional advantages clause as a condition that would \u201cincrease [a teacher\u2019s] employability\u2019 in his field, and a condition that would \u201caid [a teacher] in getting and retaining subsequent employment in [the] teaching profession.\u201d <em>E.g. Westbrook Sch. v. Westbrook Tchrs. Ass\u2019n, </em>404 A.2d 204, 212 (Me. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b639 We must interpret the CBA in a manner that \u201cgive[s] effect to every part if reasonably practicable ....\u201d Section 28-3-202, MCA. We noted above that transfers and reassignments constitute conditions of employment, in part, because of the expertise teachers acquire over years of teaching the same subject, and the value of the continuing education unique to their particular subject or grade level. \u00b6 22. Expertise and education represent conditions that could increase employability or aid \u201cin getting and retaining subsequent employment in the teaching profession.\u201d <em>Westbrook Sch., </em>404 A.2d at 212. The CBA\u2019s professional advantages clause could be interpreted to protect teachers from involuntary teacher transfers and reassignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b640 The zipper clause and the professional advantages clause in the CBA present us with conflicting provisions. The zipper clause has the general effect of waiving mandatory bargaining subjects not specifically contained in the CBA. In particular, it supersedes past practices concerning conditions of employment. The District had not transferred or reassigned teachers for the past ten years. \u00b6 7. The zipper clause could be interpreted to waive BEA\u2019s right to bargain for teacher transfers or reassignments. The CBA simultaneously protected teachers from unilateral changes to conditions that concerned professional advantages. The expertise and education acquired over years of teaching the same subject could be interpreted to constitute a protected professional advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b641  The CBA, read as a whole, does not reveal conclusively whether the zipper clause waived BEA\u2019s right to bargain for teacher transfers. Likewise, the CBA does not reveal whether the professional advantages clause specifically protected teachers from unilateral transfers or reassignments. The CBA\u2019s conflicting provisions lend themselves to more than one meaning. The CBA is ambiguous as a matter of law. <em>See Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 338 Mont. 41, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 164 P.3d 851, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"Avi\">\u00b642 Section 39-31-305(1), MCA, provides that it is the duty of a public employer to bargain in good faith. The statutory duty to bargain includes a duty to bargain as to \u201cany question arising\u201d under the CBA. Section 39-31-305(1), MCA. Ambiguity in the zipper clause and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>professional advantages clause constitutes a \u201cquestion arising\u201d under the CBA. The CBA provides no clear mechanism to resolve the correct interpretation of those competing provisions. Section 39-31-401(5), MCA, provides that it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain collectively in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b643  The District overstates the concern that to require collective bargaining for teacher transfers would defeat its expressly reserved management right under the CBA. To require collective bargaining on a subject, in fact, has no effect on the employer\u2019s fundamental right to manage and operate. Collective bargaining does not impose on management the duty to concede to union demands. Collective bargaining merely means, under Montana law, \u201cto meet at reasonable times and negotiate in good faith ....\u201d Section 39-31-305(2), MCA. It obligates the employer to no particular outcome. It merely obligates the employer to participate in good faith in the actual collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b644  We note that bargaining also promotes the purpose of the Montana Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act to \u201cremove[] certain recognized sources of strife and unrest\u201d and \u201carrive at friendly adjustment of all disputes between public employers and their employees.\u201d Section 39-31-101, MCA. Similarly, Congress, in its statement of policy goals for the NLRA, emphasized that \u201c[t]he denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest ....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. Collective bargaining provides a process that places little actual burden on the employer, but can do so much to \u201cdefuse[] and channel[] conflict between labor and management.\u201d <em>First National Maintenance, </em>452 U.S. at 674, 101 S. Ct. at 2578. We determine that the District committed an unfair labor practice when it refused to bargain in good faith for teacher transfers and assignments, in light of the ambiguity in the CBA created by the competing provisions of the zipper clause and the professional advantages clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b645 <em>Whether the District Court properly remanded to the Hearings Officer the question of whether a long-standing practice should be treated as an express provision of a collective bargaining agreement. </em>\u00b646 BEA argues on appeal that the District Court improperly remanded to the Hearings Officer the issue of whether the District\u2019s long-standing practice of not unilaterally transferring teachers required it to bargain for teacher transfers. We need not address this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>issue because we have held that both the Montana Collective Bargaining for Public Employees Act and the CBA require the District to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b647 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
