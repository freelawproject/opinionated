We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating A.M.D.\u2019s and A.A.D.\u2019s parental rights to A.H.D?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9T\">\u00b63 A.M.D. (hereinafter \u201cFather\u201d) and A.A.D. (hereinafter \u201cMother\u201d) are the parents of three children: S.D., T.D., and A.H.D. A.H.D. was born on April 8, 2006, in Whitefish, Montana. Prior to A.H.D.\u2019s birth, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) removed S.D. (born November 20, 2002) and T.D. (born <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>December 19, 2003) from their parents\u2019 care and custody and placed the children in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b64 DPHHS removed S.D. and T.D. from their parents\u2019 home in rural Lake County, alleging that the home was unkempt and that there was a potential for neglect and abuse of the children. DPHHS prepared a treatment plan, which the District Court for the Twentieth Judicial District, Lake County, approved on February 15,2005. The treatment plan identified several grounds for S.D.\u2019s and T.D.\u2019s removal from the family home, including: poor hygiene in the children, lack of regular bathing of the children and failure to change diapers regularly; lack of a set bedtime for the children; disarray in the home including overflowing garbage, dirty dishes, and animal waste; broken windows, no smoke alarm, and no working lights in the home; Father\u2019s extremely limited role in caring for the children due to his frequent absence as a long haul truck driver; and allegations that Mother failed to properly administer medications to the children. Shortly after DPHHS removed S.D. and T.D. and placed the children in foster care, the parents moved to Whitefish, Montana, where A.H.D. was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b65 Upon her discharge from the hospital, DPHHS placed A.H.D. in foster care with her siblings in Lake County. On April 11, 2006, the Deputy Flathead County Attorney, on behalf of DPHHS, filed a Petition for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication as Youth in Need of Care and Temporary Legal Custody with the District Court. DPHHS asserted that it had probable cause to believe that A.H.D. was abused or neglected or in danger of being abused or neglected. DPHHS also alleged that there was sufficient evidence that A.H.D. was a youth in need of care based on the parents\u2019 inability to safely and appropriately parent A.H.D. DPHHS attached an affidavit to the petition from social worker Lori Schlenz.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b66 The next day, the District Court entered an Order to Show Cause, Order Granting Emergency Protective Services and Notice of Show Cause Hearing. The District Court found that there was probable cause to believe that A.H.D. was abused or neglected or in danger of being abused or neglected and that immediate protection of the child was required. The District Court appointed a guardian ad litem for A.H.D. and ordered that a show cause hearing be held on April 28, 2006. The court held the hearing and found A.H.D., by a preponderance of the evidence, to be an abused or neglected child, designated her as a youth in need of care, and granted the State\u2019s petition for emergency protective services and temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"A4T\">\u00b67 While A.H.D.\u2019s matter was pending, the Lake County District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Court entered an order terminating Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. on June 26, 2006 (hereinafter \u201cLake County termination order\u201d), after finding that the parents failed to comply with the majority of the treatment plan objectives. The court noted that a licensed clinical psychologist found that Mother had little capacity for true intimacy or true self-reflection and exhibited symptoms of depression, moodiness, and passive-aggressive behavior. The District Court noted that Mother quit therapy after a few sessions and failed to return. The District Court also found that the parents failed to attend parenting classes and cancelled scheduled appointments. In regard to the family\u2019s living environment, the District Court found that DPHHS was unable to inspect the parents\u2019 Whitefish home due to a lack of cooperation from the parents. The District Court found that the parents failed to contact the social worker on a regular basis, and when the parents did call, unless prompted, they failed to inquire as to the welfare of their children. Based on these findings, the court concluded that Father and Mother failed to comply with the treatment plan, and that the conduct or condition rendering them unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b68 Two months after the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D., DPHHS filed a Petition for Determination that Preservation or Reunification Services Need Not be Provided, in regard to A.H.D., pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2), MCA. The parents filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s petition, and the District Court held a two-part hearing on the petition on December 18, 2006, and February 9, 2007. Father, Mother, social worker Schlenz, and visitation specialists Kelli Becker and Syndee Hunter testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b69 On March 12, 2007, the District Court issued an Order Determining that Preservation or Reunification Services Need Not be Provided, and Setting Permanency Plan Hearing (hereinafter \u201cMarch 12 order\u201d). The court made extensive findings of fact regarding Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parenting issues, the previous termination of their parenting rights, their failure to comply with the treatment plan, and their failure to attend visitation sessions with A.H.D. The court specifically found that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D. Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2), MCA, the court ordered that DPHHS need not make efforts to provide preservation or reunification services to Father and Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00b610 The District Court subsequently approved DPHHS\u2019s permanency plan for A.H.D. Shortly thereafter, DPHHS filed a Petition for Termination of Parental Rights with Right to Consent to Adoption and Notice of Hearing. The court held a hearing on June 8, 2007, and granted the State\u2019s petition. In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Terminating Parental Rights with Right to Consent to Adoption and Granting Permanent Legal Custody (hereinafter \u201ctermination order\u201d), the court incorporated the findings and conclusions of the March 12 order and took judicial notice of the prior proceedings, including the testimony at the two hearings. The court found that the parents\u2019 inability to satisfy the elements of the treatment plan for S.D. and T.D., continuing concerns with their parenting deficiencies, their inability to improve their parenting skills, and their failure to visit A.H.D. when given opportunities to do so, indicated their inability to exercise their fundamental parental rights. The court found and concluded that the reasons for the involuntary termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D., and that the best interests of A.H.D. would be served by terminating the parent-child relationship. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights to determine whether the lower court abused its discretion. <em>In re A.S., </em>2006 MT 281, \u00b6 24, 334 Mont. 280, \u00b6 24, 146 P.3d 778, \u00b6 24. Our review for abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b612  However, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, the right must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re </em>D.B., 2007 MT 246, \u00b6 17, 339 Mont. 240, \u00b6 17, 168 P.3d 691, \u00b6 17. Prior to terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, a district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 17. \u201cTo satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings.\u201d <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights </em>of C.J.K., 2005 MT 67, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 289, \u00b6 13, 109 P.3d 232, \u00b6 13. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re L.H., </em>2007 MT 70, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 405, \u00b6 13, 154 P.3d 622, \u00b6 13. \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In re </em>L.H., \u00b6 13. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re L.H., </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b613  \u201cThe district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional conditions and needs of the children. Consequently, the best interests of the children are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights.\u201d <em>In re </em>C.J.K., \u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 41-3-609(3), MCA). \u201cMoreover, the party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met.\u201d <em>In re </em>C.J.K., \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b614 <em>Issue One. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating A.M.D.\u2019s and A.A.D.\u2019sparental rights toA.H.D?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b615 Sections 41-3-601-612, MCA, provide for the termination of the parent-child relationship. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 25, 339 Mont. 28, \u00b6 25, 168 P.3d 629, \u00b6 25. Section 41-3-602, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">This part provides procedures and criteria by which the parent-child legal relationship may be terminated by a court if the relationship is not in the best interest of the child. The termination of the parent-child legal relationship provided for in this part is to be used in those situations when there is a determination that a child is abused or neglected, as defined in 41-3-102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u00b616 Accordingly, to proceed with a termination under \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-601-612, MCA, there must be a determination that the child is \u201cabused or neglected.\u201d Section 41-3-102(3), MCA, defines \u201cabused or neglected\u201d as \u201cthe state or condition of a child who has suffered child abuse or neglect.\u201d Section 41-3-102(7)(a)(i)-(iii), MCA, then defines \u201cchild abuse or neglect\u201d as: \u201c(i) actual physical or psychological harm to a child; (ii) substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child; or (iii) abandonment.\u201d Section 41-3-102(7)(b)(i)(A), MCA, also notes that the term \u201cchild abuse or neglect\u201d includes \u201cactual physical or psychological harm to a child or substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child by the acts or omissions of a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare ....\u201d A \u201cyouth in need of care\u201d is \u201ca youth who has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>adjudicated or determined, after a hearing, to be or to have been abused, neglected, or abandoned.\u201d Section 41-3-102(34), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b617 After the District Court determines that the child is abused or neglected, the court is authorized to terminate the parent-child relationship if it finds that any of the criteria enumerated in \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, exist. <em>In re </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 29. Most relevant to this matter, \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence ... that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">(d) the parent has subjected a child to any of the circumstances listed in 41-3-423(2)(a) through (2)(e) ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b618 Although DPHHS is generally obligated to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of a child from the child\u2019s home and to reunify separated families under \u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA, there are several key exceptions. Section 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">Except in a proceeding subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, the department may, at any time during an abuse and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunificati on services need not be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for the appointment or assignment of counsel to represent the indigent parent in accordance with the provisions of 41-3-425. A court may make a finding that the department need not make reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">(e) had parental rights to the child\u2019s sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent\u2019s ability to adequately care for the child at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Section 41-3-423(2)(a)-(e), MCA, frees DPHHS from making further efforts to reunify the family once the statutory elements are met. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of A.P., </em>2007 MT 297, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 39, \u00b6 17, 172 P.3d 105, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\u00b619 With this statutory scheme in mind, we can now turn to the parents\u2019 specific contention that the District Court erred when it terminated their parental rights to A.H.D. Father and Mother assert that the District Court erred in two ways: (1) the District Court failed to specify which circumstances of their previous involuntary termination were relevant to their ability to adequately care for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>A.H.D., and (2) the District Court did not find by clear and convincing evidence that these circumstances existed. The parents\u2019 arguments can be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">A. Specific Circumstances of Prior Involuntary Termination</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b620 Father and Mother contend that the District Court failed to specify which circumstances of the previous involuntary termination were relevant to their ability to care for A.H.D. The parents claim that the termination order did not reference any specific circumstances of the previous termination. They argue that without the specific circumstances, \u201ca court cannot compare A.H.D.\u2019s situation to the situation of her siblings, let alone determine that clear and convincing evidence establishes that those circumstances are relevant to the current termination proceeding.\u201d Accordingly, the parents assert that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to make such specific findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b621 As outlined above, the court may order the termination of the parent-child relationship, upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(a)-(f), MCA, exist. Section 41-3-609(1), MCA; <em>In re </em>K.J.B., \u00b6 27. One of these circumstances is that the parent has subjected a child to any of the circumstances listed in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a)-(e), MCA. Section 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 27. Most relevant to this appeal, \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, provides that DPHHS need not make reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has \u201chad parental rights to the child\u2019s sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent\u2019s ability to adequately care for the child at issue.\u201d Section 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 28. \u201cWe have determined that the circumstances of a prior termination continue to be relevant in a later termination of a sibling under \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, -unless the circumstances have changed.\u201d <em>In re A.P., </em>\u00b6 30. \u201cTo satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings.\u201d <em>In re </em>K.J.B., \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u00b622 The State asserts that the District Court\u2019s termination order must be read in conjunction with the Lake County termination order and the March 12 order. Stating that the findings and conclusions in the March 12 order were relevant and applicable, the District Court incorporated them into the termination order. In the March 12 order, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Court specifically found that Father and Mother had their parental rights to S.D. and T.D. involuntarily terminated pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, and the circumstances related to the termination of their parental rights were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D. In the termination order, the District Court reiterated that these findings were the ground for the court\u2019s determination that reunification services need not be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b623  We agree with the State that the District Court did not err in determining that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights with respect to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D. The order terminating Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to A.H.D. must be considered in conjunction with the March 12 order, along with the testimony presented at the two hearings. In the termination order, the District Court specifically found that the parents\u2019 \u201cinability to satisfy the elements of their Lake County Treatment Plan and their ultimate termination of parental rights, as well as the continuing concerns with the same parenting deficiencies, their inability to improve their parenting skills, and their failure to visit their child despite being given opportunities to do so, indicate their inability to exercise their fundamental parental rights as the child\u2019s parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b624 The District Court found that it had been determined that Mother had little capacity for true intimacy or true self-reflection and exhibited \u201can essentially unresolved dismissive style of attachment consistent with her lack of attachments during childhood.\u201d Although the treatment plan recommended intensive therapy for Mother, the District Court found that she failed to follow through with counseling and quit attending sessions in the spring of 2005. In addition, Father refused to attend therapy sessions with Mother as recommended and did not follow through with obtaining another psychological evaluation and parenting assessment as recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b625 The District Court also found that the parents failed to follow through with several of the parenting services provided for them in relation to S.D. and T.D. Specifically, the District Court found that they attended only 23.45 hours of an offered 109.5 hours of parenting education. The District Cotut further found that of the 65 arranged visits between the parents and S.D. and T.D., the parents arrived late for most visits, cancelled 26 visits, and failed to appear for three visits, despite DPHHS providing them with transportation. Furthermore, the parents cancelled scheduled appointments with service providers, including AWARE and the Child Development Center, and failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>maintain contact with their social workers. The District Court also found, citing the Lake County termination order, that in the approximately sixteen months that the Lake County DPHHS worked with Father and Mother, they were given every opportunity to comply with their treatment plan, but \u201cthey chose not to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b626 The District Court\u2019s findings of fact pertaining specifically to the parenting of A.H.D. support its conclusion that the above-described circumstances related to the termination of parental rights as to S.D. and T.D. remained relevant to the parents\u2019 ability to adequately care for A.H.D. The District Court first noted that at the time of the hearings, A.H.D. was eight to ten months old, and in the previous termination, T.D. was ten months to two years old. The District Court found that the same risks that were present for T.D., given her infancy and reliance on caregivers for basic needs, applied to A.H.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b627 The District Court addressed the testimony of visitation specialist Kelli Becker, who noted that Mother continued to require prompting as to meeting A.H.D.\u2019s basic needs and that she was unable to consistently replicate or demonstrate these parenting skills during visits with A.H.D. The District Court specifically found that Mother had exhibited these same basic parenting limitations with her older children, thus demonstrating that the circumstances that led to the previous termination remained relevant to Mother\u2019s ability to care for A.H.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b628 Furthermore, the District Court found that in the visits with A.H.D., the parents demonstrated considerable difficulty in accepting redirection or changing behaviors that were detrimental to their children. The District Court found that Mother continued to demonstrate a lack of understanding of basic parenting skills, while Father failed to demonstrate an ability to carry out regular parenting activities and typically directed Mother to complete the parenting tasks while he observed. The District Court found that he was unsupportive of Mother, which contradicted counselor recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b629 The District Court also noted Mother\u2019s failure to follow through with mental health recommendations. The court found that she had \u201csignificant mental health issues\u201d including depression and emotional issues that impacted her ability to parent. Based on the testimony of social workers Schlenz and Becker at the hearing, the court found that despite recommendations for therapy and referrals to parenting classes, Mother failed to engage in those services. Given Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s failure to comply with therapy or parenting class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>recommendations in the previous termination, the District Court\u2019s findings with regard to A.H.D. again demonstrate that the circumstances that led to the previous termination continued to be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b630 On the issue of visitation, the District Court found that although DPHHS provided resources and continued to facilitate visitations, \u201cthe [parents] continued their pattern of failing to participate in offered services.\u201d The District Court specifically noted their failure to maintain contact with social worker Schlenz. When the parents did contact Schlenz, the District Court found that the contacts were often fraught with hostility and resistance from the parents. The District Court specifically noted that the parents chose to \u201ctake a break\u201d from doing visits with A.H.D. following the termination of their parental rights to S.D. and T.D., which the court said demonstrated their lack of dedication to parenting. Father and Mother did not have a single visit with A.H.D. from July 5, 2006 to October 6, 2006, which the court found was predominantly due to the parents\u2019 failure to contact DPHHS. The court found that their pattern of missing visits with A.H.D. continued in 2007 as well. These findings clearly support the District Court\u2019s finding that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. remained relevant to their ability to care for A.H.D., given their documented prior failings in keeping in contact with DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b631 The District Court further found that from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">August of 2004 to May of 2006, the [parents] exhibited patterns of behavior demonstrating an inability to provide basic parenting for their eldest children; these patterns are certainly germane to their ability to care for A.H.D. in light of the pervasiveness of their indifference towards parenting S.D. and T.D. (i.e., not an isolated incidence or issue). These patterns continued from the time of A.H.D.\u2019s birth to the present. The [parents] lack insight into fundamental parenting knowledge and have been oppositional to all services offered to assist them in improving their skills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Later, the court specifically found that the parents \u201chave failed to demonstrate consistency and predictability in meeting the needs of their child(ren) and the same concerns that were present in the Lake County case that lead [sic] to termination of their parental rights remain a concern as to their ability to parent A.H.D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\u00b632 The findings of fact in both the March 12 order and the termination order clearly demonstrate and support the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>finding that the circumstances that led to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were on-going in nature and remained relevant to their ability to care for A.H.D. Father and Mother failed to comply with the Lake County treatment plan. As a result, the Lake County District Court terminated the parent-child relationship between the parents and S.D. and T.D. The same circumstances that illustrated their failure to comply with the treatment plan were clearly present and unchanged in their parenting of A.H.D., as demonstrated by the District Court\u2019s findings. Contrary to the parents\u2019 assertion, the District Court specifically identified the circumstances of the earlier termination that remained relevant to the termination of their rights to A.H.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b633 To the extent that Father and Mother challenge whether any \u201cpeculiar circumstances\u201d existed at all to support the termination of their parental rights, we note that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. In its findings of fact, the District Court even cited to the record and the testimony at the hearings. The parents point out that S.D. and T.D. were removed from the family home due to unsafe living conditions and claim that these circumstances are easily remedied. The parents note that they moved to a new home in a different city prior to A.H.D.\u2019s birth and they testified at trial that the home was safe and clean for a child. The parents claim that no one from the department even inspected the new home and that the District Court failed to mention this change in circumstances in its findings. The parents\u2019 contention is without merit, however, as we note that in the Lake County termination order, the Lake County District Court found that DPHHS was unable to inspect the parents\u2019 Whitefish home because of the parents\u2019 vague schedule and lack of cooperation in arranging visits. The Flathead County District Court also made specific findings illustrating the difficulties DPHHS had in maintaining contact with the parents. Ultimately, the District Court\u2019s findings and a review of the record demonstrate that there were numerous circumstances supporting the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b634  We hold that the District Court did not err in finding that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to care for A.H.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">B. Clear and Convincing Evidence Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b635 Father and Mother next argue that the District Court erred when it failed to find that the circumstances that led to the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>their parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were established by clear and convincing evidence. The parents contend that \u201cthe District Court only found that clear and convincing evidence established that a previous judicial determination was made that reunification services need not be provided:\u201d They assert that the District Court\u2019s failure to enter a new finding in its termination order was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b636 Section 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, states that \u201c[t]he court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence ... that any of the following circumstances exist: (d) the parent has subjected a child to any of the circumstances listed in 41-3-423(2)(a) through (2)(e) ....\u201d Because the termination of parental rights involves a fundamental liberty interest, a district court must adequately address each statutory requirement to determine if it has been established. <em>In re A.P., </em>\u00b6 27. We have held that \u201cthe party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met.\u201d <em>In re </em>C.J.K., \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b637 In the termination order the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Based upon the foregoing, clear and convincing evidence exists that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">1. There has been a judicial determination that Reunification Services Need Not be Provided to birth-mother... and birth-father ... based upon the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">a. The birth-parents\u2019 parental rights to T.D. and S.D., [A.H.D.]\u2019s siblings, were involuntarily terminated in the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">b. The circumstances related to that termination of parental rights are relevant to the parents\u2019 ability to adequately care for [A.H.D.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">In the March 12 order, the District Court prefaced its recitation of the findings of fact by stating \u201cthe Court hereby determines the following [findings of fact], based upon clear and convincing evidence ....\u201d The court then specifically found that \u201c[t]he circumstances related to the termination of parental rights as to S.D. and T.D. are relevant to the birth-parents\u2019 ability to adequately care for the above-named child, A.H.D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">\u00b638  It is clear from a review of the District Court\u2019s two orders that the court addressed the applicable burden of proof and found that the State established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D. As noted above, the termination order must be read in conjunction with the March 12 order, as the earlier findings were expressly incorporated into the termination order. In the March 12 order, the District Court based its findings on clear and convincing evidence. To the extent that the parents contend that the District Court failed to make a new \u201cclear and convincing evidence finding\u201d in the termination order and that \u201cover six months passed between the hearing on the matter of whether reunification services needed to be provided and the district court\u2019s ultimate termination of parental rights\u201d we note that, at the termination hearing, the court took judicial notice of the prior hearing testimony and proceedings, and the parents\u2019 counsel at the termination hearing stated that he and the parents agreed that it would \u201cbe duplicative ... and unnecessary to essentially present the same testimony over again.\u201d The District Court\u2019s finding was not \u201cstale\u201d as it was agreed that the hearing testimony that led to the March 12 findings of fact was still relevant and applicable. Accordingly the District Court did not err in relying on the testimony presented at the earlier hearings and incorporating earlier findings based on evidence presented at those hearings, as the testimony was still relevant to the termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b639  DPHHS presented clear and convincing evidence establishing that the circumstances related to the termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to S.D. and T.D. were relevant to their ability to adequately care for A.H.D. The District Court made specific findings as to the statutory requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, and we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights to A.H.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b527-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
