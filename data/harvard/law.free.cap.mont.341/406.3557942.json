The District Court ruled that Lammers\u2019 loss of personal property, which was destroyed in a fire, was not insured under her landlord\u2019s insurance policy issued by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in ruling that the lessee, Lammers, could not recover from Allstate, which issued an insurance policy to her lessor?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\u00b63 Lammers formerly owned a commercial building in Hardin, Montana, known as the Solazzi Building. In January 2000, Lammers sold the building to Cory Kenney, who leased back a part of the building to Lammers. She used her leased space in the building for a variety of business enterprises, as well as storing personal belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">\u00b64 On July 26, 2001, a fire occurred at the Solazzi Building, which Lammers claims destroyed much of her property. Prior to the fire, the lessor, Kenney, had purchased a \u201cCustomizer Business Insurance Policy Special Form\u201d insurance policy from Allstate which was in effect at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">\u00b65 The policy contains two types of coverage, Coverage A-Business Property and Coverage B-Business Liability. Under the Business Property section of the policy, describing the property it covers, the policy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-12\">Property Covered-Buildings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">This policy covers the replacement cost (or the actual cash value, if such is indicated in the Declarations) of the building(s) for which a description and limit of liability is shown in the Declarations. This coverage includes the following items when on the same premises:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">6. Personal property in apartments or rooms you furnish as landlord.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">\u00b66 Following the fire, Kenney sent a letter to Allstate requesting that it cover Lammers\u2019 losses in the fire. Allstate did not explicitly deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>coverage, nor did it pay any part of Lammers\u2019 loss. Lammers then filed a complaint seeking damages from Allstate, as well as from several other defendants. Lammers subsequently filed a motion for partial summary judgment, claiming coverage under Kenney\u2019s insurance policy with Allstate. Allstate filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting Lammers had no coverage under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b67 At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the District Court issued a ruling from the bench granting Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court noted the lack of clarity in the description of what personal property the insurance policy covered, because the language did not expressly state whether it covered only the insured\u2019s personal property or also provided coverage for a tenant\u2019s personal property. The District Court then denied Lammers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted Allstate\u2019s summary judgment motion, dismissing the claim against Allstate with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b68 Following the resolution of Lammers\u2019 claims against other defendants, the District Court entered a final judgment in favor of Allstate on June 27, 2006. Lammers now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Gliko v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 112, \u00b6 12, 130 P.3d 155, \u00b6 12. The moving party must establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b610 Whether coverage exists under an insurance policy presents a question of law, and we review whether the District Court correctly interpreted the provisions of Allstate\u2019s policy. <em>Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 10, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 10, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b611 We construe an insurance policy \u201caccording to the entirety of its terms and conditions as set forth in the policy.\u201d Section 33-15-316, MCA. This means that we will read the contract as a whole and attempt to reconcile its parts to give each meaning and effect. <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, \u00b6 25, 289 Mont. 312, \u00b6 25, 961 P.2d 114, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b612  It is well-settled Montana law that ambiguities in an insurance policy will be construed against the insurer. <em>Jacobsen v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 72, \u00b6 19, 320 Mont. 375, \u00b6 19, 87 P.3d 995, \u00b6 19; <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 17, 298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 17, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b6 17; <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14. An insurance policy is ambiguous \u201cwhere the contract, when taken as a whole, is reasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 281, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 703, \u00b6 26 (citing <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 25). To determine if an insurance policy is ambiguous, we examine it \u201cfrom the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence but not trained in the law or insurance business.\u201d <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Wendell, </em>\u00b6 14.).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b6 13 Lammers argues the policy is ambiguous because it did not clearly state whose personal property it covered. We agree. The policy states that coverage applies to \u201c[pjersonal property in apartments or rooms you furnish as landlord\u201d in the building covered by the policy, in this case the Solazzi Building. This language of the policy is ambiguous because it is reasonably subject to two different interpretations. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 26. The policy language could, as Allstate contends, mean that only personal property owned by the landlord is covered. However, the language used does not clearly say so. A reasonable interpretation of this language by an insured is that the policy applies to property of others as well as that owned by Kenney when it is located in rooms Kenney provides as a landlord. It would have been simple for Allstate to draft its policy so as to state that coverage is limited to personal property owned by the insured, Kenney. It did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b614  The District Court judge noted that there were two possible interpretations of the applicable policy language by stating that a person reading the policy \u201ccan\u2019t be sure ... whether the personal property is insured\u2019s personal property or tenant\u2019s personal property. It could be either one.\u201d Not only from the viewpoint of an insurance consumer of average intelligence, but also to someone trained in the law, the policy is ambiguous. Because the policy provision establishing coverage for personal property is ambiguous, we must construe it against Allstate and in favor of providing coverage. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"A2hP\">\u00b615 Allstate also presents an argument, in a rather cursory fashion, that Lammers, as the tenant, is not entitled to coverage under her landlord\u2019s policy. Allstate points to a separate provision of the policy, Coverage B, which insures Kenney against liability to others, and argues that because Lammers is not named as an insured, her property is not covered. However, as Lammers notes, the policy provision stating who are the \u201cPersons Insured\u201d specifically applies to a separate portion of the policy, Coverage B, which provides liability insurance. This separate section of the policy does not state that it is also applicable to Coverage A, under which Lammers claims coverage. Allstate points out no particular provision of its policy which clearly precludes insurance coverage for Lammers\u2019 loss. Again, under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>circumstances, we will construe the policy in favor of providing coverage. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b616 Lammers also argues that she is entitled to coverage for the loss of her property under separate provisions of Allstate\u2019s policy providing coverage for business property. However, because we conclude her claimed loss is covered by the policy\u2019s buildings coverage provisions, we need not consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b617  We conclude that the insurance policy is ambiguous and, therefore, it must be construed in favor of providing coverage to Lammers. The order granting Allstate\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed, and this case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
