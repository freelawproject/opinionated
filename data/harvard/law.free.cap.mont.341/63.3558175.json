We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AmD\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b63 Did the WCC err when it concluded that Michalak\u2019s injury-occurred during the course and scope of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b64 Did Michalak abandon his employment by participating in reckless behavior?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b65 On July 23, 2005, Curtis M. Michalak (Michalak) suffered an injury while riding a wave runner at his employer\u2019s annual company picnic at Flathead Lake. At the time of his injury, Michalak worked for Felco Industries, Ltd. (Felco) in Missoula, Montana, and Liberty provided Felco\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b66 Since approximately 1980, John Felton (Felton), Felco\u2019s president and owner, has hosted a company picnic at his lakeside home. Felco generally invites its employees and their families, friends, and vendors to the company picnic. In 2005, Felco rented wave runners for the annual picnic. While riding one of the wave runners, Michalak suffered serious injuries, including several vertebrae fractures, and he was unable to return to his employment with Felco.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b67 Michalak filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for his injury. Liberty denied Michalak\u2019s claim on the basis that the injury did not occur within the course and scope of his employment. Michalak then filed a claim with the WCC seeking compensation for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b68 The WCC issued findings of fact and conclusions of law after considering Michalak\u2019s trial testimony and the deposition testimony of Michalak, his co-workers, and other witnesses. The WCC found that Felco notified its employees of the 2005 picnic by placing a notice within the employees\u2019 pay stubs and by displaying notices within the plant. The WCC found that Felco paid for all the picnic supplies, including the wave runner rentals. The WCC found that Michalak had the duty of overseeing the wave runners during the picnic, and it found credible Michalak\u2019s testimony that he bore responsibility for supervising the wave runners\u2019 operation, including providing riders with safety instructions, monitoring the wave runners\u2019 fuel and oil levels, instructing others on how to ride the wave runners, and enforcing time limits on the wave runners\u2019 use. The WCC further found that, \u201cduring the performance of his duties,\u201d Michalak took a ride on one of the wave runners and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u00b69 The WCC next applied the four \u201ccourse and scope\u201d factors set forth in <em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1 </em>and concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Michalak was within the course and scope of his employment when he suffered his injury. 214 Mont. 13, 16-17, 692 P.2d 417, 419 (1984). Liberty appeals the WCC\u2019s holding and challenges both the WCC\u2019s findings of fact and its conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b610 We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Simms v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2005 MT 175, \u00b6 11, 327 Mont. 511, \u00b6 11, 116 P.3d 773, \u00b6 11. Substantial credible evidence to support a finding of fact may be somewhat less than a preponderance of evidence but must be more than a mere scintilla. <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11. We apply the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) effective at the time an employee suffers an injury. <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins., </em>273 Mont. 313, 316, 903 P.2d 785, 787 (1995). The 2005 version of the Act governed when Michalak was injured on July 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b611 I. Did the WCC err when it concluded that Michalak\u2019s injury occurred during the course and scope of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b612 Employees who receive an injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d are entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Section 39-71-407, MCA (2005). Liberty argues that \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA (2005), removes Michalak from the definition of employee and therefore Michalak\u2019s injury is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b613  Section 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA (2005), defines \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cworker\u201d to exclude a person who is \u201cparticipating in recreational activity and who at the time is relieved of and is not performing prescribed duties ....\u201d Thus, a person injured while participating in recreational activities still qualifies as an \u201cemployee\u201d and retains workers\u2019 compensation coverage if the person is injured while performing \u201cprescribed duties.\u201d Section 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA (2005); <em>Connery v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>280 Mont. 115, 929 P.2d 222 (1996). <em>Courser\u2019s </em>traditional four-factor \u201ccourse and scope\u201d analysis determines whether a person is \u201cperforming prescribed duties.\u201d <em>Connery, </em>280 Mont. at 120, 929 P.2d at 225. The factors are: (1) whether the activity was undertaken at the employer\u2019s request; (2) whether the employer, directly or indirectly, compelled the employee\u2019s attendance at the activity; (3) whether the employer controlled or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>participated in the activity; and (4) whether the employer and the employee mutually benefited from the activity. <em>Connery, </em>280 Mont. at 121, 929 P.2d at 226. Each factor\u2019s presence or absence \u201cmay or may not be determinative,\u201d and each factor\u2019s significance \u201cmust be considered in the totality of all attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Connery, </em>280 Mont. at 121, 929 P.2d at 226 (quoting <em>Courser, </em>214 Mont. at 16-17, 692 P.2d at 419). After evaluating these factors, the WCC concluded that Michalak\u2019s injury was compensable because he had not been relieved of his \u201cprescribed duties\u201d and thus was acting within the course and scope of his employment. We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence, and we review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Simms, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b614 Our review of the record supports the WCC\u2019s finding, under the first <em>Courser </em>factor, that the picnic was undertaken at Felco\u2019s request. Felton testified that the Felco company picnic had been an annual event since 1980. Felton testified that he selects the particular date of the pierde and that he and Felco pay the picnic expenses. Felton further testified that Felco provided paddle boats and wave runners because \u201cit\u2019s common sense that people are going to more likely come if you have something like that ....\u201d Denise Sand, Felco\u2019s secretary, testified that she notifies the employees about the picnic through notices placed aromad the plant and in the employees\u2019 paychecks. The notice that Sand distributed in 2005 requested a head-count and indicated that friends, family, and vendors were welcome at the Felco company picnic. Tim Yoder, a Felco supervisor in charge of Felco\u2019s safety program, testified that he received a picnic invitation in his paycheck. Michalak also testified that he received an invitation in his paycheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b615  Regarding the second <em>Courser </em>factor, the WCC found that \u201cat a minimum, Felco indirectly compelled [Michalak\u2019s] attendance at the picnic.\u201d The WCC stated that Michalak felt compelled to attend the picnic because his supervisor had asked him to oversee the wave runners. Steve Talley, Michalak\u2019s supervisor, testified that he felt responsible for instructing the picnic attendees on safety procedures relating to the wave runners. Talley testified that he asked Michalak to assist with and watch over the wave runners because Talley knew that he would be unable to continuously supervise the wave runners. Talley testified that Michalak agreed to provide assistance. Michalak testified that Talley asked him to oversee the wave runners at the picnic. Michalak indicated that he understood Talley\u2019s request to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>made in his capacity as Felco\u2019s foreman, not as a personal favor to Talley. Michalak testified that he went to the office of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks and at some point obtained and reviewed a copy of the Montana boating regulations. Michalak testified that one of his daughters felt ill on the morning of the picnic, and he thought he would be unable to attend. Her condition soon improved, however, and Michalak testified that he and his family went to the picnic so that he could fulfill his obligation and respect his employer. We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that Felco compelled Michalak\u2019s attendance at the company picnic.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b616  As to the third <em>Courser </em>factor, the WCC found that Felco controlled and participated in the picnic activities. Felton testified that he selects the date of the picnic and that he and Felco pay for the picnic expenses, including food, beverages, paddleboats, and wave runners. He further testified that Felco provides everything and has a policy against employees bringing items to the picnic. Felton testified that he hosts the company picnic at his home on Flathead Lake. Felton further testified that he believed Felco took a tax deduction for the picnic expenses. Shawn Skinner, Felco\u2019s general manager, testified that he had duties and responsibilities related to organizing the picnic, but primarily delegated the tasks associated with organizing the picnic to Ken Lockwood, an independent contractor, and Denise Sand. Sand testified that she used a Felco company credit card to purchase the picnic supplies, including the wave runner rentals. Sand further testified that Felco claimed the picnic expenses as a tax deduction. Several witnesses also testified that the annual company picnic features a horseshoe tournament, with the winner earning a spot on a plaque displayed at Felco. We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding that Felco controlled or participated in the picnic.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b617  Finally, the WCC found that Felco and its employees mutually benefited from the picnic. Felton testified that the company picnics were good for the company and that the picnic promoted good relations. Tim Yoder testified that the picnic was good for the company and good for morale. Skinner testified that the company picnic benefited Felco and Felco\u2019s employees. Sand testified that the picnic was good for the company because the picnic provides an opportunity for the employees to congregate with their spouses and extended family. We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s finding, under the fourth <em>Courser </em>factor, that the Felco company picnic provided mutual benefit to Felco and its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00b618  Liberty\u2019s argument that Michalak failed to satisfy the <em>Courser </em>factors rests on the misconception that the \u201cactivity\u2019 in the <em>Courser </em>analysis should be Michalak\u2019s wave runner ride, rather than the Felco company picnic. However, Liberty\u2019s narrow focus on Michalak\u2019s wave runner ride is inconsistent with <em>Courser </em>itself. In <em>Courser, </em>we determined that Courser was within the course and scope of his employment when he was injured in a motorcycle accident while commuting from graduate school to his home in Dillon, Montana. We applied the four-factor \u201ccourse and scope\u201d analysis and focused on the activity of attending graduate school, not the motorcycle ride. 214 Mont. at 16-17, 692 P.2d at 419. The WCC properly focused its <em>Courser </em>analysis on the Felco company picnic as the \u201cactivity,\u201d rather than Michalak\u2019s ride on the wave runner, to determine whether Michalak\u2019s injury occurred within the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b619  We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings under the <em>Courser </em>factors. Based on its <em>Courser </em>analysis, the WCC determined that, though Michalak was injured while participating in a recreational activity, he nonetheless was within the course and scope of his employment when he was injured and that his injury was compensable. We conclude that the WCC\u2019s findings support its conclusion of law that Michalak was injured within the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b620 Liberty argues that the above four-factor analysis has no place in Montana\u2019s jurisprudence and advocates that we overrule <em>Courser. </em>According to Liberty, the <em>Courser </em>factors trace their ancestry to the \u201cliberal construction\u201d statute, \u00a7 39-71-104, MCA (1985), and, because the Legislature has repealed that statute, the factors should be excised from our jurisprudence. Additionally, Liberty describes this Court\u2019s <em>Connery </em>decision, in which we concluded that the \u201cprescribed duties\u201d of \u00a7 39-71-118(2)(a), MCA, are determined by applying the <em>Courser </em>factors, as \u201csimply a judicial abracadabra.\u201d We disagree with Liberty on both counts. First, the <em>Courser </em>factors set forth <em>what </em>a court should analyze to determine whether a person\u2019s injury falls within the course and scope of employment; the Legislature\u2019s directive that the Act be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party instructs a court <em>how </em>to interpret the Act. Section 39-71-105, MCA (2005). The <em>Courser </em>factors and the Legislature\u2019s directive are not mutually exclusive and we decline Liberty\u2019s plea to overrule <em>Courser </em>and its successive body of case law. Second, as to the \u201cjudicial abracadabra\u201d charge, we explained in <em>Connery </em>that the Legislature left the term \u201cprescribed duties\u201d undefined and we noted that defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>prescribed duties is fact-intensive and varies depending on the particular case. Thus, we concluded that \u201cthe application of a traditional course and scope of employment analysis is, and will be, necessary to determine exactly what an employee\u2019s \u2018prescribed duties\u2019 are in a particular case.\u201d 280 Mont. at 120, 929 P.2d at 225. In the eleven years since <em>Connery, </em>the Legislature has declined to modify or further define the term \u201cprescribed duties.\u201d Absent farther legislative direction, we reject Liberty\u2019s plea to overrule <em>Courser, Connery, </em>and the ensuing cases applying the \u201ccourse and scope\u201d factors. We conclude that the WCC applied the correct analysis to determine whether Michalak\u2019s injuries were compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b621 II. Did Michalak abandon his employment by participating in reckless behavior?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b622 Liberty argues that Michalak abandoned his employment by operating the wave runner in a reckless manner. According to Liberty, the only way Michalak could have sustained his severe injuries is by operating the wave runner at a high rate of speed and in a dangerous manner. In support of its argument, Liberty cites to <em>Hicks v. Glacier Park, Inc., </em>236 Mont. 113, 768 P.2d 346 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Hicks, </em>a Glacier National Park bellhop, who fancied himself an auto-mechanic, attempted to assist a guest with a weak car battery. The bellhop first push-started the car, then accelerated to a high rate of speed, failed to stop at a stop sign, and eluded a pursuing park ranger by putting \u201cthe pedal to the metal.\u201d The bellhop eventually lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a tree approximately two-and-a-half miles from the hotel. 236 Mont. at 114, 768 P.2d at 347. The WCC found that even if the bellhop was initially within the course and scope of his employment, he deviated from the scope of his employment when he evaded the law enforcement officer. We affirmed the WCC\u2019s judgment denying compensation to the bellhop. <em>Hicks, </em>236 Mont. at 117, 768 P.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b624 Liberty argues that, like the bellhop in <em>Hicks, </em>Michalak abandoned the course and scope of his employment when he operated the wave runner recklessly and at high speed and thus \u201cpursue[d] an objective in nowise essential to or incidental to any service he is paid to perform ....\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>236 Mont. at 115, 768 P.2d at 347 (emphasis omitted). <em>Hicks </em>is inapplicable to this case. Unlike <em>Hicks, </em>the WCC in this case made no findings that Michalak acted recklessly or negligently. In fact, the WCC made no findings regarding the manner in which Michalak operated the wave runner other than finding that he was injured during'the performance of his duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>[Michalak] testified that he was instructed to help pick up the wave runners, supervise, give safety instructions, monitor the fuel and oil levels, provide instructions on how to ride them, and enforce time limits on their operation. At one point, during the performance of his duties, [Michalak] elected to take a turn on one of the wave runners himself because one was available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">While riding one of the wave runners, [Michalak] sustained the injuries that are the subject of this action. [Michalak\u2019s] recollection as to the specifics of how he was injured is vague because of his injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b625 Though Liberty acknowledges that Michalak provided some assistance before taking a ride on the wave runner, Liberty claims that testimony from Michalak and Talley supports finding both that Michalak was operating the wave runner in a reckless manner and that he was untrustworthy as a witness. Michalak testified that as he executed a subtle left-hand turn, he saw \u201csomething very weird in the water, and that is the last thing I remember.\u201d Michalak testified that he regained consciousness underwater and that he had to blow bubbles to determine the direction of the surface. He stated that when he gained the surface of the lake, the wave runner was \u201cquite a distance\u201d from him. Talley testified that Michalak told him that \u201che was out there flipping the Wave Runner around\u201d when he was injured. Based on this testimony, Liberty urges that the only possible explanation for Michalak\u2019s injury is that \u201che was traveling at a very high rate of speed when he lost control of the wave runner and was plunged deep into Flathead Lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b626  In essence, Liberty calls on this Court to make additional findings of fact regarding Michalak\u2019s injury. Liberty states that \u201cit is conclusively established by the [un-contradicted] testimony of Talley that [Michalak] injured himself while whipping the wave runner around at a high speed.\u201d However, Talley\u2019s testimony is contradicted: Michalak testified that he was not \u201cwave-jumping\u201d when he was injured, but that he was making a subtle left-hand turn and saw a discoloration in the water. Other witnesses testified that they saw logs floating in the lake in 2005. Further, the WCC determined that Michalak was a credible witness. The WCC also found that Michalak was injured during the performance of his duties; we concluded under Issue I that substantial credible evidence supported the WCC\u2019s <em>Courser </em>analysis and that the WCC correctly concluded that Michalak\u2019s injury occurred diming the course and scope of his employment. Our standard is whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>not whether evidence supports findings different from those made by the WCC. <em>Taylor v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>275 Mont. 432, 440, 913 P.2d 1242, 1246 (1996). In this case, the WCC\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence; moreover, we refuse to substitute our judgment for that of the WCC\u2019s when the issue \u201crelates to the weight given to certain evidence or the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>275 Mont. at 437, 913 P.2d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b627  We conclude that the WCC properly applied the four factors from <em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1, </em>214 Mont. 13, 692 P.2d 417 (1984), to determine whether Michalak\u2019s injury while riding a wave runner at the Felco company picnic occurred during the course and scope of his employment. We conclude that substantial credible evidence exists to support the WCC\u2019s findings under the <em>Courser </em>factors and that the WCC correctly concluded that Michalak was injured during the course and scope of his employment. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
