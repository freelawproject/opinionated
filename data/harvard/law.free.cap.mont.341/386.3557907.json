Joann and Dick denied that David had an ownership interest in either the truck or the tools. The matter proceeded to trial, where a jury found that David was the rightful owner of the truck and any tools contained within. Joann and Dick now appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AaE\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by using a special verdict form that treated the truck and tools as a whole?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u00b64 II. Did the District Court err by denying Joann and Dick\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law concerning Joann Finn?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u00b65 III. Did the District Court err by denying Joann and Dick\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law regarding the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u00b66 The truck and tools in question originally belonged to Augustine Turk (\u201cGus\u201d). In his will, Gus divided his estate equally between his and his late -wife\u2019s surviving siblings. The estate\u2019s assets included a great deal of equipment and tools, including the property at stake in the instant case. The Turk siblings elected to take their share of the estate in this equipment. Dick served as one of the estate\u2019s personal representatives and kept the titles to the estate equipment and vehicles in a filing cabinet in his home. Though the estate has been closed for more than eight years, the heirs gave conflicting testimony as to how the equipment was to be distributed amongst the Turks, and whether each received his or her fair share.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">\u00b67 Most of this equipment was stored on Joann\u2019s property in Townsend. Several years after the final accounting, David removed the truck (in which some of the tools were stored) from Joann\u2019s property without notifying her or Dick. When Joann noticed the truck was missing, she reported it stolen to the police. The police report named David as a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">\u00b68 The sheriff repossessed the truck and returned it to Joann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>David\u2019s attorney sent a demand letter to Joann and Dick requesting return of the truck and the tools. They contested David\u2019s ownership, and this litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b69 At trial, David testified that his brother Bill (now deceased) gave him the U-Haul truck. David introduced the truck\u2019s title into evidence. The title listed Augustine Turk as the vehicle\u2019s owner, and was signed over to David Turk (the purchaser) by both Charles Morris and Richard Turk (the sellers). In response, Dick testified that the title from the truck was an open title. Dick denied that the truck was given as a gift to David and accused David of stealing the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b610 At the close of David\u2019s case, Joann and Dick made two motions for judgment as a matter of law. First, they argued, David had failed to state a prima facie case against Joann, and thus she should be dismissed from the case. Second, they claimed the statute of limitations had run as to any possible estate or contract claims that David might bring against them. The District Court denied both motions and held that no issues of contract law or estate law were at stake. The court instructed counsel not to argue any theories of estate or contract law and to limit their arguments to the issue of whether or not David had received the property as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b611 The court revised the special verdict form it had prepared and withdrew the following jury instruction, which had been delivered at the beginning of the trial: \u201cIf you find that David Turk was given a proposed distribution of the assets of the Estate of Augustine Turk and never objected to that distribution within 30 days of its receipt, he has waived his right to object.\u201d David objected to the court\u2019s decision to strike the estate law issue, but Joann and Dick did not. Appellants also voluntarily withdrew their remaining proposed jury instructions which dealt with estate and contract law issues pertaining to the ownership of the tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b612 The jury found that David was the rightful owner of the truck and the accompanying tools. The court ordered J oann and Dick to trun over the truck to David; however, they did not do so until several months later, after David filed a motion for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u00b613 I. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by using a special verdict form that treated the truck and tools as a whole?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b614 After denying both of Joann and Dick\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law, the court revised the special verdict form and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>withdrew a previously given jury instruction pertaining to an issue of estate law. The court explained that the new verdict form and jury instructions \u201cbasically limit[] the case now to whether or not there was a gift to the plaintiff!.]\u201d The revised verdict form read: \u201cDoes David Turk rightfully own the 1975 Ford U-Haul Truck, Title #429002 with the tools inside of it?\u201d In response to this interrogatory, the jury was instructed to \u201c[w]rite in Tes\u2019 or \u2018No.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b615 Joann and Dick sirgue that the court erred by revising the verdict form and jury instructions, and claim the court improperly denied them the opportunity to argue their theories of ownership based on estate and contract law. They further argue that the revised verdict form improperly combines distinct questions of ownership, treating the tools and the truck as a whole. However, they have waived the right to argue each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b616 The failure to object to a verdict form and/or jury instructions at trial results in a waiver of the right to challenge them on appeal. <em>Greytak v. RegO Co., </em>257 Mont. 147, 152, 848 P.2d 483, 486 (1993). Objections to jury instructions or special verdict forms must be specific, and must state with particularity the grounds upon which they are made. M. R. Civ. P. 51; <em>Greytak, </em>257 Mont. at 152, 848 P.2d at 486. We have cautioned that \u201c[t]he instruction which is given without objection becomes the law of the case.\u201d <em>Kneeland v. Luzenac America, Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 43, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 43, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 43 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b617 The record clearly demonstrates that Joann and Dick have waived their right to challenge both the verdict form and jury instructions on the basis that either omits issues of estate or contract law. When the court explained its decision to revise the verdict form and the jury instructions, Joann and Dick agreed with the court\u2019s decision to restrict the jury from considering any estate law issues. Joann and Dick then withdrew their proposed jury instructions concerning estate and contract law and stated they had no additional objections to the remaining jury instructions, nor any new jury instructions to offer. These actions prevent Joann and Dick from challenging the court\u2019s decision to preclude the jury from considering their contract and estate law theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b618 Joann and Dick did object to the revised verdict form, but only on a very narrow ground: the jury should consider the ownership of the truck and the tools separately, they argued, not as a whole. However, this argument too has been waived, for the same reasons discussed above. The only theory upon which Joann and Dick challenged David\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ownership of the tools was based in estate law: they concede that David, as an heir of Gus\u2019s estate, may have owned 1/6 of the tools, but argue that after distribution of the estate, he did not have a complete ownership interest in the tools. By contrast, David claims a 100 percent ownership interest in the U-Haul truck, stating it was a gift from Bill Turk (now deceased). Thus, Joann and Dick reason, the jury should be asked to make distinct findings as to who owns the tools and who owns the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b619 This theory of the case was embodied in the court\u2019s initial instruction to the jury (reproduced in \u00b6 12 above). However, Joann and Dick failed to object when the court later withdrew that instruction and precluded the jury from further analyzing ownership of the tools under estate law. Thus, Joann and Dick had no farther legal basis for differentiating between the tools and the truck. At that point, the sole issue became whether the truck and tools were stolen or were gifted.</p>\n<p id=\"AXD\">\u00b620  Once Joann and Dick acquiesced in the District Court\u2019s ruling to preclude consideration of estate law issues, and withdrew all proposed jury instructions pertaining to estate law, they were no longer in a position to argue that, under estate law, David did not have a complete ownership interest in the tools. They effectively waived any right to challenge the verdict form for failing to differentiate between ownership of the truck and the tools under estate law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b621 II. Did the District Court err by denying Joann and Dick\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law concerning Joann Finn?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b622 Joann and Dick moved the District Court for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that David failed to state a prima facie case against Joann Finn. On appeal, Joann and Dick argue that the District Court erred by refusing to dismiss Joann from the case, and denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b623 When reviewing an order denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law, we employ the same criteria used by the district court in the first instance. <em>Marie Deonier v. Paul Revere Life Ins. </em>Co., 2004 MT 297, \u00b6 18, 323 Mont. 387, \u00b6 18, 101 P.3d 742, \u00b6 18. We have defined the standard for granting judgment as a matter of law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury and all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from that evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>opposing the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><em>Marie Deonier, </em>\u00b6 18. Joann and Dick claim Joann had no \u201cdominion [or] control\u201d over the property; however, both the evidence in the record and Joann\u2019s own testimony suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b624 The single issue at trial was whether, as a result of a gift from Bill Turk, David owned the U-Haul truck. Joann had possession of the truck and the ignition key both before and during the trial. When David removed the truck from her property, she-not Dick-reported it to the police as stolen and filed trespassing charges against David. In the police report, Joann is listed as the only complainant, and the offense is categorized as \u201cvehicle theft.\u201d The report also contained a voluntary statement made by Joann, describing the truck and its contents. In her statement, Joann said \u201c[t]his truck was removed from our property without pemission [sic] or knowledge.\u201d The police report was entered into evidence during the plaintiffs case-in-chief, though it was a defense exhibit. Thus, the District Court could have properly considered this evidence in ruling on the motion. After the truck was recovered, the sheriff returned it to Joann. Through his attorney, David sent a demand letter (Plaintiffs Exhibit E) addressed to both Dick and Joann, requesting the return of the truck. Joann refused to return the truck to David.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b625  Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only where there is a complete absence of evidence. Here, there is not a complete absence of evidence-both Joann\u2019s possession of the truck, and the police report she filed reporting the truck as stolen justified submitting the issue of ownership to the jury. Joann attempted to exercise ownership over the truck by reporting it stolen, and preventing David from taking control of the truck. Thus, the District Court did not err in refusing to dismiss her from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b626 III. Did the District Court err by denying Joann and Dick\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law concerning the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b627 Joann and Dick argue that the District Court erred by denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law, in which they argued David failed to bring his suit within the statute of limitations set forth under \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-202(2), 27-2-207, 27-2-231, 72-3-802, and 72-3-1011, MCA. Again, we conclude that Joann and Dick have waived this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b628  We have held time and again that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense which must be raised in a party\u2019s pleadings. M. R. Civ. P. 8(c); <em>Estabrook v. Baden, </em>284 Mont. 419, 421, 943 P.2d 1334, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>1335-36 (1997). \u201cThe law is clear that if the defense is not plead affirmatively, it is waived.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Dept. of Fish, Wildlife, &amp; Parks, </em>205 Mont. 85, 96, 666 P.2d 1228, 1233 (1983) (citations omitted). In their answer to David\u2019s complaint, Joann and Dick did not argue that the statute of limitations had expired. Thus, they have waived their right to argue the issue now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b629 In sum, all but one of the issues Joann and Dick raise are not properly before us for consideration. Joann and Dick failed to raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in their answer to David\u2019s complaint, and thus have waived the right to argue it now on appeal. Similarly, Joann and Dick expressed their approval of the court\u2019s decision to preclude the jury from considering any estate law issues, and voluntarily withdrew their proposed jury instructions dealing with the same. Thus, they waived the right to challenge the verdict form on appeal, on the basis of an estate law theory. We conclude that the District Court did not err in refusing to dismiss Joann Finn from the case, because the record reflects ample evidence that she interfered with David Turk\u2019s possession of the truck and tools. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-6\">JUSTICE WARNER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8m\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b630 I dissent to the Court\u2019s holding under Issues I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b631 Under Issue I, the Court holds that Appellants waived their right to challenge the District Court\u2019s special verdict form because they withdrew their objection to the court\u2019s ruling on estate and contract issues and failed to adequately object when the District Court presented its form. However, I believe the Court applies waiver too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">\u00b632 We have held that \u201cwhere no objection is raised to the special verdict form before its submission to the jury, the Court will not review the sufficiency of the form for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Wisher v. Higgs, </em>257 Mont. 132, 143, 849 P.2d 152, 158 (1993), <em>overruled on other grounds, Blackburn v. Blue Mt. Women\u2019s Clinic, </em>286 Mont. 60, 951 P.2d 1 (1997) (citation omitted). In <em>Weinberg v. Farmers State Bank, </em>231 Mont. 10, 19, 752 P.2d 719, 724 (1988), we explained that where \u201cthe issue of propriety of the special verdict [is] not raised by objection at the time of its presentation to counsel,\u201d then the issue is waived. Here, a specific objection to the verdict form was raised. Considering this law and the circumstances here, I believe Appellants\u2019 objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>was adequate to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b633 The District Court prepared the special verdict form after denying Appellants\u2019 motion for directed verdict. Although Appellants withdrew their objection to the court\u2019s dismissal of the estate theory claims, they continued to object to the form of the court\u2019s special verdict for purposes of the gift theory which remained. As Appellants\u2019 counsel stated at that time, \u201cthe tools should be-not be part of the verdict but it should only be the truck that would be an issue as to whether or not it was a gift.\u201d The District Court thereafter noted the objection \u201cto the verdict form and the instruction on gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b634 This was all which was necessary at that point, <em>because David had already admitted that he owned only a proportional amount of the tools housed in the back of the U-Haul, not all of them. </em>Nonetheless, the District Court lumped all of the tools together with the truck under the gift issue. Indeed, <em>both parties </em>objected to this on the ground that it was unfair for the District Court to combine ownership of the truck and tools into one jury question. In acquiescing to the court\u2019s removal of the estate and contract issues generally, Appellants did not waive their specific objection to the District Court\u2019s handling of the gift issue. That objection was preserved for appeal, and I believe the verdict form was clearly flawed in lumping all of the property together into one question. The jury was thus prevented from deciding the case in accordance with the uncontested evidence, admitted by David, that he did not own all of the tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b635 Under Issue II, I believe the District Court erred by not granting the Appellants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law concerning Joann. The Court concludes that there was \u201cmore than enough evidence in the record to justify submitting the issue of the truck\u2019s ownership to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b636 However, the evidence cited by the Court, including the police report and Joann\u2019s statement, offers no assertion by Joann that she owned the property herself; she was merely reporting that it was taken from her property. Without more, this evidence does not support the conclusion that Joann exercised ownership over the U-Haul. Joann\u2019s pressing of trespassing charges against David occurred because David had trespassed on her property-not because David took the truck. Thus, the court should have concluded that any authority Joann exercised over the truck was minimal, was due to the fact that it was housed on her property by Dick, and did not make out a prima facie claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b637 I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
