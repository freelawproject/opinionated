The Estate sought compensation for damages from an August 2002 automobile accident near Bozeman, Montana, in which their parents, Alan and Sharon Wamsley (Wamsleys), were killed. In its suit, the Estate sought to \u201cstack,\u201d or combine the coverage of, three underinsured motorist (UIM) policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>issued to the Wamsleys by Nodak. Nodak disputed its obligation to stack these three policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b62 After lengthy legal proceedings, on November 9,2005, the District Court rendered a stipulated judgment against Nodak pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54. In its order, the District Court held the Estate could stack all three UIM policies, and rendered final judgment against Nodak in the amount of $400,000.00. On appeal, Nodak challenges this order as well as the District Court\u2019s denials of its motion to stay, its motions for summary judgment, its motion to reconsider, and a grant of summary judgment to the Estate on the issue of stacking. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b63 Although complicated, the facts and chronology in this case are not in dispute. On August 8, 2002, the Wamsleys were traveling eastbound in a Chrysler Voyager minivan on Interstate 90 near Bozeman, Montana. Lester Stanton, a Montana resident, was traveling westbound on the opposite side of Interstate 90 at the same time. Stanton was highly intoxicated and passed out while driving. As a result, he crossed the highway meridian and collided with the Wamsleys\u2019 minivan. The impact from the crash spun the Wamsleys\u2019 vehicle into a motor home which was traveling behind it on Interstate 90. The Wamsleys and Stanton were all killed. The Wamsleys had been residents of North Dakota and insured with Nodak, a North Dakota-based insurance carrier. Stanton was insured by an Idaho-based insurance carrier, Progressive Specialty Insurance. After their death, two of the Wamsleys\u2019 six children, Corey and Jeffrey Wamsley, were appointed co-Personal Representatives of the Wamsleys\u2019 Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"Axg\">\u00b64 After the accident, the Estate obtained Montana counsel. The Estate received $50,000.00 from Progressive, representing the coverage limits of Stanton\u2019s policy. Because the damages from the accident exceeded this amount, the Estate sought additional payment from Nodak under three UIM policies held by the Wamsleys prior to their death. The policies provided UIM coverage in the amount of $100,000.00 per insured, for each vehicle covered. The Wamsleys owned a total of three vehicles covered under these terms, one of which was the Chrysler Voyager minivan which the Wamsleys were driving on August 8, 2002. The other two vehicles were garaged in North Dakota at the time of the accident. If allowed, the stacking of these policies would permit the Estate to seek a total of $600,000.00 in UIM claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b65 In December 2002 the Estate\u2019s counsel notified Nodak of its intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>to stack all three UIM policies. At the time of this demand, we were considering, but had not yet decided, <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892. At issue in <em>Hardy </em>was the constitutionality of \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, a statute passed by the Montana Legislature which prohibited the stacking of UIM policies. The Estate\u2019s Montana counsel notified Nodak of this pending litigation and stated her belief that we would likely find the statute unconstitutional and allow the stacking of UIM claims. As a settlement proposal, the Estate offered to accept $400,000.00 from Nodak in exchange for dropping its UIM claims for the full amount of $600,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b66 On April 7, 2003, Nodak paid the Estate $200,000.00 for UIM coverage on the Chrysler minivan involved in the accident. However, Nodak continued to dispute its obligation to stack the two remaining UIM policies. On April 18, 2003, we decided <em>Hardy, </em>overturning \u00a7 33-23-203, MCA, and holding that stacking of UIM policies was allowed in Montana as a matter of public policy. <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38,45. Immediately after <em>Hardy </em>issued, the Estate restated its demand that Nodak provide payment under the remaining two UIM policies, an amount totaling $400,000.00. The Estate set a response deadline of April 28,2004, after which it stated it would file suit against Nodak. Counsel for Nodak requested more time to study the matter, which the Estate graciously granted. On May 20, 2003, Nodak informed the Estate it was still investigating its demand, and requested further time to complete its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b67 In truth, Nodak was preparing to seek a declaratory judgment in North Dakota on the Estate\u2019s UIM claims. On June 4, 2003, Nodak initiated an action in District Court in Kidder County, North Dakota. Nodak sought a declaration that the Wamsleys\u2019 UIM policies could not be stacked under North Dakota law. The Wamsleys\u2019 surviving children were named as defendants. A \u201ccourtesy\u201d notice of this lawsuit was received by the Estate\u2019s counsel on June 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b68 Meanwhile, litigation on this matter was also underway in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court in Gallatin County, Montana. On June 23,2003, the Estate filed suit against Nodak and sought to stack the UIM policies, seeking recovery of $400,000.00 in compensatory damages. The Estate also sought punitive damages for violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-101 through 1006, MCA. On July 23, 2003, Nodak responded in the Montana action by filing a \u201cLimited Appearance to Contest Personal Jurisdiction\u201d pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12. On August 13, 2003, the Estate moved for partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>summary judgment on its stacking claims. On August 14,2003, Nodak filed a motion to stay the Estate\u2019s motion pending the outcome of its declaratory judgment action in North Dakota.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b69 On October 7, 2003, while Nodak\u2019s motion to stay was under consideration, the North Dakota District Court ruled that North Dakota law would be applied in Nodak\u2019s declaratory judgment action. Nodak brought this ruling to the District Court\u2019s attention in the Montana action. On November 5, the District Court in Montana held oral argument on Nodak\u2019s motion to stay and subsequently denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"Alhx\">\u00b610 Notably, on November 11, Nodak moved for partial summary judgment in the Montana District Court, arguing for the first time the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over it and that North Dakota law should apply to the Estate\u2019s claims. Nodak also argued the District Court in Montana was required to grant the North Dakota ruling full faith and credit, and that collateral estoppel barred the Estate from litigating its UIM claims in Montana. On November 14, the District Court held oral argument on the Estate\u2019s previous summary judgment motion on the issue of stacking. That same day the District Court ruled it had <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over Nodak and that the Estate was allowed to stack the UIM policies as a matter of law, in effect refusing to accredit the North Dakota rulings on choice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b611 Five days later, on November 19,2003, after the Montana District Court had already ruled on the Estate\u2019s stacking claims, the North Dakota District Court granted summary judgment to Nodak holding it was not obligated to stack the UIM policies. The next day, the District Court in Montana denied Nodak\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that North Dakota law did not apply to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims in Montana and that the claims were not barred by collateral estoppel. Subsequently, Nodak moved the court to reconsider its denial of Nodak\u2019s motions to stay and partial summary judgment. On January 27, 2004, the District Court denied Nodak\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b612 On September 13, 2004, the North Dakota Supreme Court, over one dissenting Justice, upheld the North Dakota District Court\u2019s declaratory judgment, finding that North Dakota law applied to the UIM claims and did not allow stacking. <em>Nodak Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wamsley, </em>687 N.W.2d 226 (N.D. 2004). On September 30, 2004, the District Court in Montana entered an order rendering judgment against the Estate of Lester Stanton in the amount of $700,000.00. On December 2,2004, after obtaining this judgment and serving notice on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>all parties, the Estate moved for partial summary judgment in the amount of $400,000.00 for its UIM claims and sought an entry of final judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). In response, Nodak opposed the Estate\u2019s motion and filed another cross-motion for summary judgment, again arguing that the North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nodak </em>should be given full faith and credit. Nodak\u2019s motions were again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b613 Other issues not relevant to the current appeal continued to be raised and argued before the District Court. On September 2, 2005, both parties entered into mediation in this matter and subsequently entered into a Stipulation Regarding Final Judgment. Pursuant thereto, on November 9, 2005, the District Court entered final judgment against Nodak in the sum of $400,000.00, and certified the judgment as final pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Nodak timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b614 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b615 Issue One: Did the District Court err by concluding it had personal jurisdiction over Nodak in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b616 Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Nodak\u2019s motion to stay legal proceedings in Montana pending the outcome of Nodak\u2019s declaratory judgment action in North Dakota?</p>\n<p id=\"AG-\">\u00b617 Issue Three: Did the District Court err in holding that Montana law applied to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b618 Issue Four: Did the District Court err in concluding the Estate could stack the UIM policies when the Estate presented no evidence of a reasonable expectation that the policies could be stacked?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b619 Issue Five: Did the District Court err by refusing to accord preclusive effect to the rulings from the North Dakota courts under the Full Faith and Credit clause to the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b620 Issue Six: Does the doctrine of collateral estoppel preclude the Estate from litigating its UIM claims in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">\u00b621 Issue Seven: Do principles of comity require the Montana courts to defer to the rulings from the North Dakota Supreme Court in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">\u00b622 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the standard established by M.R.Civ.P. 56. The moving party must establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Russell v. Masonic Home of Mont. Inc., </em>2006 MT 286, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 351, \u00b6 9, 147 P.3d 216, \u00b6 9. Once this burden has been satisfied, the non-moving party may raise a genuine issue of material fact by presenting substantial evidence essential to one or more elements in the case. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 9. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether or not they are correct. <em>Russell, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b623 We review district court orders related to trial administration matters, such as a motion to stay, under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Eatinger v. Johnson, </em>269 Mont. 99, 105-06, 887 P.2d 231, 235 (1994). \u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 50, 333 Mont. 23, \u00b6 50, 140 P.3d 454, \u00b6 50 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b624 Issue One: Did the District Court err by concluding it had personal jurisdiction over Nodak in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b625 The District Court concluded Nodak waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, and submitted to the jurisdiction of the District Court, by its voluntary appearance at the hearing on November 5, 2003, and by failing to properly argue the merits of this defense as required by M. R. Civ. P. 12 and M. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(a). Nodak maintains this was error. First, Nodak argues it is not \u201cfound\u201d in Montana pursuant to M. R. Civ. P 4B(1), Montana\u2019s \u201clong arm\u201d jurisdiction statute, and that subjecting it to personal jurisdiction in Montana offends due process. Second, Nodak asserts its \u201climited appearance\u201d on July 23,2003, preserved the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, permitting Nodak to argue it at a later unspecified date. Thus, its participation in the November 5 hearing did not waive the defense. The Estate counters that the \u201climited appearance\u201d is no longer available in Montana, and that such an appearance is simply treated as a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12. Accordingly, the District Court was correct to deem the motion to be without merit since Nodak failed to argue or brief it within five days pursuant to M. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b626  We agree with the Estate that Nodak waived its right to argue the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. The District Court correctly noted that M. R. Civ. P. 12 has effectively abolished the distinction between \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d appearances. <em>Semenza v. Kniss, </em>2005 MT 268, \u00b6 17, 329 Mont. 115, \u00b6 17, 122 P.3d 1203, \u00b6 17 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>Knoepke v. S.W. Ry. Co., </em>190 Mont. 238, 243, 620 P.2d 1185, 1187 (1980)). A \u201climited appearance\u201d in Montana is effectively treated as a Rule 12 motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>See Foster Apiaries, Inc. v. Hubbard Apiaries, Inc., </em>193 Mont. 156, 160, 630 P.2d 1213, 1215 (1981). Under M. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(a), a party raising this defense has five days to file a supporting brief or argue its motion. Failure to do so subjects that party to the risk its motion will be deemed without merit. M. Unif. Dist. Ct. R. 2(b). That is precisely what happened here. Nodak\u2019s \u201climited appearance\u201d was in effect a Rule 12 motion. Nodak did not argue the merits of lack of personal jurisdiction, or even raise the specific issue, until roughly three and a half months after it filed its initial appearance, and in the interim presented other arguments to the District Court. Under these circumstances, the District Court did not err in finding the Rule 12 motion without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">\u00b627  The District Court also correctly determined Nodak\u2019s participation in the court proceedings constituted a voluntary appearance under M. R. Civ. P. 4B(2), thus waiving the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction and admitting the jurisdiction of the District Court. M. R. Civ. P. 4B(2) provides that \u201c[\u00a1jurisdiction may be acquired by our courts over any person ... by the voluntary appearance in an action by any person either personally, or through an attorney, or through any other authorized officer, agent or employee.\u201d As we stated in <em>Spencer v. Ukra, </em>246 Mont. 430, 804 P.2d 380 (1991), \u201cany act which recognizes the case as in court constitutes a general appearance, and even in the face of a declared contrary intention, a general appearance may arise by implication from the defendant seeking, taking, or agreeing to some step or proceeding in the cause beneficial to himself and detrimental to the plaintiff, <em>other than one contesting only the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Spencer, </em>246 Mont. at 433, 804 P.2d at 382 (quotation omitted, emphasis added). Nodak could have argued personal jurisdiction without subjecting itself to the power of the District Court, but chose not to. <em>Semenza, </em>\u00b6 17 (quotation omitted) (stating that a party may argue lack of personal jurisdiction without concern that such argument will \u201csubject [it] to the general power of the court solely because of the response.\u201d). Instead Nodak sought affirmative relief from the District Court in its motion to stay on the basis of principles of comity. By filing motions seeking relief from the District Court \u201con other, non-jurisdictional grounds ... [Nodak] admitted the authority and jurisdiction of the court over the company and the case.\u201d <em>Foster Apiaries, </em>630 P.2d at 1215, 193 Mont. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">\u00b628 Because we find the District Court did not err in concluding it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>personal jurisdiction over Nodak under the foregoing rationales, we do not reach the other challenges Nodak raises to the District Court\u2019s rulings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b629 Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Nodak\u2019s motion to stay legal proceedings in Montana pending the outcome of Nodak\u2019s declaratory judgment action in North Dakota?</p>\n<p id=\"AgK\">\u00b630 Nodak argues the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion to stay constituted an abuse of discretion. Nodak asserts the District Court should have stayed the proceedings in Montana until the North Dakota declaratory judgment was decided. Nodak maintains that notions of comity required this result because the litigation was \u201cfirst-filed\u201d in North Dakota. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b631 In <em>Simmons v. State, </em>206 Mont. 264, 670 P.2d 1372 (1983), we defined \u201ccomity\u2019 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">not a rule of law, but one of practice, convenience, and expediency. It does not of its own force compel a particular course of action. Rather, it is an expression of one state\u2019s entirely voluntary decision to defer to the policy of another. Such a decision may be perceived as promoting uniformity of decision, as encouraging harmony among participants in a system of co-operative federalism, or as merely an expression of hope for reciprocal advantages in some future case in which the interests of the forum are more critical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\"><em>Simmons, </em>206 Mont. at 289, 670 P.2d at 1385 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b632 The Ninth Circuit has described the \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule on which Nodak relies as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">a generally recognized doctrine of ... comity which permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an action when a complaint involving the same parties and issues has already been filed in another district.... [T]his \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule is not a rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied, but rather is to be applied with a view to the dictates of sound judicial administration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\"><em>Pacesetter Systems, Inc. v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>678 F.2d 93, 94-95 (9th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">When reviewing a decision involving the \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule on appeal \u201can ample degree of discretion, appropriate for disciplined and experienced judges, must be left to the lower courts.\u201d <em>Pacesetter Systems, Inc., </em>678 F.2d at 95 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">\u00b633 Here, the District Court adhered to the dictates of sound judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>administration and did not abuse its discretion when it denied Nodak\u2019s motion to stay. Clearly, Montana and North Dakota both have interests in resolving the UIM stacking claims at issue. The North Dakota Supreme Court has stated North Dakota\u2019s interest in governing the relationship between a North Dakota insured and North Dakota insurer. <em>Nodak, </em>687 N.W.2d at 234. Montana has a number of important interests as well. First, Montana has a well-established practice of applying Montana law to automobile accidents occurring within its borders. <em>E.g., Kemp v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>183 Mont. 526, 533, 601 P.2d 20, 24 (1979); <em>Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 315 Mont. 281, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 68 P.3d 703, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Also, in Montana an injured party may bring a suit against the tortfeasor and the insurance company in one action when UIM coverages are sought. See <em>e.g., State of Mont. ex. rel. Gadbaw v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 127, \u00b6\u00b619-25, 316 Mont. 25, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25, 75 P.3d 1238, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25. Because the accident occurred in Montana and the tortfeasor was a Montana resident, the claim arose here and Montana is the proper forum within which to \u201csettle the rights, status, and other legal relations in that underlying action.\u201d <em>Nodak, </em>687 N.W.2d at 235 (Maring, J., dissenting). Choice of law and the issue of stacking are critical in making these final determinations and are well within the judicial competency of the District Court in Gallatin County. By denying Nodak\u2019s motion to stay, the District Court was simply trying to prevent needless \u201cpiecemeal litigation\u201d with respect to these claims. <em>Nodak, </em>687 N.W.2d at 235 (Maring, J., dissenting) (stating that \u201cby deciding the declaratory judgment action [in North Dakota], we encourage piecemeal litigation.\u201d). Additionally, Nodak fails to provide any evidence that substantial injustice resulted from the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion. Instead, the District Court\u2019s decisions were an example of sound judicial administration. Its actions were not arbitrary and did not \u201cexceed[] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>English, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b634  Moreover, as the Estate points out, there is an exception to the \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule where a party\u2019s \u201cfirst filing\u201d is simply an act of forum-shopping. <em>Alltrade, Inc. v. Uniweld Prod. Inc., </em>946 F.2d 622, 628 (9th Cir. 1991). Nodak\u2019s rush to the North Dakota courts in this case is a paradigmatic example of such conduct. Nodak apparently believed it would get a more favorable result in the North Dakota courts on the UIM stacking issue, and therefore sought to lull a delay in the commencement of the Montana case in order to secure an advantage there. See \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Under such circumstances, Nodak\u2019s invocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201ccomity\u201d rings hollow. Accordingly, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Nodak\u2019s motion to stay the Montana proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b635 Issue Three: Did the District Court err in holding that Montana law applied to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b636 Nodak maintains the District Court erred when it concluded Montana law applied to the Estate\u2019s UIM stacking claims. Nodak asserts that an application of the choice of law analysis from the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7\u00a7 188, 193 (1971) leads to the conclusion that North Dakota law should apply to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims. In essence, Nodak argues the UIM claims concern a North Dakota insurance transaction to which only North Dakota law should apply and that Montana\u2019s relationship is limited solely to the fact that the accident occurred here. The relevant sections of the Restatement provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u00a7 188. Law Governing in Absence of Effective Choice of Law by the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">(1) The rights and the duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">(2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see \u00a7 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">(a) the place of contracting,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">(c) the place of performance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">\u00a7 193. Contracts of Fire, Surety or Casualty Insurance The validity of a contract of fire, surety or casualty insurance and the rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u00a7 6. Choice-of-Law Principles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">(1) A court, subject to constitutional restrictions, will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">(2) Where there is no such directive, the factors relevant to the choice of law include .... [Not applicable.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b637 The Estate contends the District Court was correct to apply Montana law to the Estate\u2019s claims. Particularly, the Estate points to <em>Youngblood v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>262 Mont. 391, 866 P.2d 203 (1993) and <em>Kemp </em>for the proposition that Montana has long applied Montana law to automobile accidents occurring within its borders. The Estate also claims the conflicts analysis we applied under the Restatement in <em>Mitchell </em>points to the conclusion that Montana law controls. Nodak argues <em>Mitchell </em>is distinguishable on its facts and does not apply to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b638 In <em>Mitchell, </em>we analyzed a claim similar to the one before us now. In that case, Plaintiff Mitchell was injured in an automobile accident in Montana. At the time he was living and working in Montana, but was insured under his parents\u2019 policies issued in California. To cover damages from the accident, Mitchell tried to stack his parents\u2019 UIM policies, although they covered vehicles garaged in California at the time of the accident. Mitchell sought to apply Montana law to his stacking claims. The District Court ruled against him, holding that California law applied. At issue on appeal before this Court was whether California or Montana law would govern the determination of Mitchell\u2019s stacking claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b639 In <em>Mitchell </em>we outlined the analysis to be applied when resolving conflicts of laws questions under the Restatement. We began by noting that under our prior decisions in <em>Phillips v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>2000 MT 55, 298 Mont. 438, 995 P.2d 1002, and <em>Casarotto v. Lombardi, </em>268 Mont. 369, 886 P.2d 931 (1994), we would apply the Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws to Mitchell\u2019s claims. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 16. We stated that we would approach the Restatement \u201ccriteria in a careful, step-by-step fashion, to avoid misapplication of the law.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b640 Accordingly, before conducting an analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 188(2) and 193, our first task was to determine \u201cwhether Montana law addressed the choice of law concerning Mitchell\u2019s ... policy pursuant to \u00a7 6(1).\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 18. We noted that \u00a7 6(1) of the Restatement \u201crequires a court to first look to relevant state law when determining applicable law.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 21. We also noted \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, provides that \u201c \u2018[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>contract is to be interpreted according to the law in [sic]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> usage where it is to be performed or, if it does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA). From this we concluded that \u201cunless the terms of the insurance contract provide otherwise... where an insurance contract designates the place of performance to be any state where a claim arises, performance occurs where the insured obtains judgment.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). Linking these analyses together we held \u201c[i]t logically follows, that the place of performance is also the place where an insured is entitled to receive benefits, has incurred accident related expenses, or is entitled to judgment.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 20. On this premise we concluded Montana was the place of performance of the contract because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">Mitchell was working and living in Montana at the time of the accident; the underinsured tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle was insured in Montana; Mitchell\u2019s medical expenses were incurred in Montana; Mitchell settled with the [tortfeasors\u2019] insurers for the policy limit giving rise to the underinsured motorist claim in Montana; and judgment concerning the accident will be rendered and paid in Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b641 While the facts in this case differ slightly from those in <em>Mitchell, </em>the choice of laws analysis is comparable. As Nodak notes, the Wamsleys were residents of North Dakota and had none of the Montana contacts that the Plaintiff had in <em>Mitchell. </em>Nodak also provides a thorough factor-based analysis under \u00a7 188(2) and \u00a7 193 of the Restatement, and shows why that analysis favors the application of North Dakota law. Yet Nodak fails to apply the careful \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach we applied in <em>Mitchell </em>and skips over the analysis under \u00a7 6(1) of the Restatement which is required <em>before </em>proceeding to the general factor-based analysis in \u00a7 188(2). As a result, Nodak overlooks the operation of \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, and our holding in <em>Mitchell </em>to the effect that one must first determine the place of performance of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b642 Absent language to the contrary, the place of performance of an insurance contract is \u201cwhere an insured is entitled to receive benefits, has incurred accident related expenses, or is entitled to judgment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 20. The factor-based analysis described in the Restatement comes into play only after it has been determined that the contract does not designate a place of performance. If Montana is determined to be the place of performance, then no further analysis under the Restatement factors is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b643 Here, Montana is the place of performance of Nodak\u2019s insurance contracts. The UIM policies in this case contain nearly identical boilerplate language to the policies at issue in <em>Mitchell. </em>Both policies specify the area of coverage to include \u201cthe United States of America, its territories and possessions; Puerto Rico; or Canada.\u201d Nodak\u2019s attempt to distinguish the policies here from those in <em>Mitchell </em>is unavailing. Nodak correctly points out that the endorsement section of the policies entitled \u201cUnderinsured Motorist Coverage-North Dakota\u201d does not specify a territory of coverage for UIM claims. But neither does it state a limitation of such coverage. Further, the provision of the policy itself entitled \u201cPart C-Underinsured Motorist Coverage\u201d clearly adopts as its territory of coverage the area specified in \u201cPart F-General Provisions.\u201d This latter provision specifies a territory of coverage for the entire policy, including the UIM provisions, and does not indicate a more limited territory of coverage for UIM claims. Absent any limitations of coverage in the endorsement to the UIM policy, nothing in the policies indicates the UIM territory of coverage to be other than \u201cthe United States of America, its territories and possessions; Puerto Rico; or Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b644  Montana is where the accident occurred and the damages arose. It is the site of the personal injury action filed by the Estate, and the forum in which an order of judgment against Stanton, the Montana tortfeasor, has been rendered. See \u00b6 12. Moreover, Nodak has already paid the Estate $200,000.00 in UIM claims submitted by the Estate\u2019s counsel in Montana. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not err in holding that Montana law should apply to the stacking and coverage issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b645 Issue Four: Did the District Court err in concluding the Estate could stack the UIM policies when the Estate presented no evidence of a reasonable expectation that the policies could be stacked?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b646 Nodak argues our decision in <em>Hardy </em>does not apply to the UIM claims here because under <em>Hardy </em>the Estate is required, but failed to, prove the Wamsleys had a reasonable expectation they would be able to seek UIM coverage under all three policies although they paid a separate premium for each. Nodak further maintains that for <em>Hardy </em>to apply the Estate must show the Wamsleys were charged premiums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>for stacked UIM coverages, and that they paid a premium for coverage they did not receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b647 The Estate argues that Nodak raises this issue for the first time. We agree. A review of the record shows Nodak had ample opportunity to present this theory to the District Court but failed to do so. Thus, out of fairness to the District Court we will not consider it on appeal for the first time. <em>Timis v. Young, </em>2001 MT 63, \u00b6 8, 305 Mont. 18, \u00b6 8, 22 P.3d 1122, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b648 Issue Five: Did the District Court err by refusing to accord preclusive effect to the rulings from the North Dakota courts under the Full Faith and Credit clause to the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b649 Nodak argues the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 1, required the District Court to grant preclusive effect to the North Dakota rulings on choice of law and stacking. Nodak asserts those rulings were res judicata to issues raised by the Estate in Montana, and that the District Court erred in not granting them full faith and credit. Nodak points out that the North Dakota District Court ruled on choice of law on October 7,2003, several weeks prior to the Montana District Court\u2019s ruling applying Montana law to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims. In response, the Estate maintains the District Court did not err because the required elements of res judicata are not satisfied. In particular, the Estate argues that the Wamsleys\u2019 children, who appeared in the North Dakota action, were not in privity with the Estate. The Estate also argues full faith and credit is not required in this case because recognition of the North Dakota rulings would impermissibly interfere with the litigation in Montana and Montana\u2019s important interests in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b650 The Full Faith and Credit clause, U.S Const, art. IV, \u00a7 1, states that \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.\u201d Pursuant to this clause, the first Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, which specifies that properly authenticated judicial proceedings are to be given national effect. The United States Supreme Court has explained the \u201canimating purpose\u201d of this clause \u201cwas to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation throughout which a remedy upon a just obligation might be demanded as of right, irrespective of the state of its origin.\u201d <em>Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp., </em>522 U.S. 222, 232, 118 S. Ct. 657, 663 (1998) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[a] final judgment in one State, if rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, qualifies for recognition throughout the land.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>522 U.S. at 233, 118 S. Ct. at 663-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b651 We have recognized that \u201cthe full faith and credit obligation owed to final judgments is exacting. A final judgment rendered by a state court is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of its sister states.\u201d <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 39, 970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 39. In practical terms, full faith and credit \u201c \u2018generally requires every State to give to a judgment at least the <em>res judicata </em>effect which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 39 (quoting <em>Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 109, 84 S. Ct. 242, 244 (1963)). Moreover, there is no public policy exception for the full faith and credit due judgments from another jurisdiction. <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 45. Full faith and credit may demand \u201csubmission ... even to hostile policies reflected in the judgment of another State, because [of] the practical operation of the federal system ....\u201d <em>Baker, </em>522 U.S. at 233, 118 S. Ct. at 664 (quotation omitted). Thus in <em>Carr </em>we held that Montana was required to grant full faith and credit to a Wyoming judgment \u201ceven assuming the law underlying the judgment contravenes the public policy of Montana.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 45; See also <em>E.g. Finstuen v. Crutcher, </em>496 F.3d 1139 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that full faith and credit requires Oklahoma to recognize an adoption by a same sex couple already formalized in another state even though Oklahoma statute specifically prohibits such adoptions on public policy grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b652 The first step in this analysis is to determine whether the judgment in the North Dakota District Court is res judicata to the action in the Montana, where full faith and credit is sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To satisfy the res judicata criteria in Montana, the following elements must be satisfied: \u201c(1) the parties or their privies must be the same; (2) the subject matter of the action must be the same; (3) the issues must be the same, and must relate to the same subject-matter; and (4) the capacities of the persons must be the same in reference to the subject-matter and to the issues between them.\u201d <em>Lane v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 130, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 55, \u00b6 23, 68 P.3d 819, \u00b6 23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(quotation omitted). The Estate contends element number one, identity of the parties or their privies, is not satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b653 As we have previously stated \u201cthe concept of a \u2018privy1 in the context of a judgment applies to one whose interest has been legally represented at trial. We have similarly defined privies as those who are so connected in estate or in blood or in law as to be identified with the same interest and, consequently, affected with each other by litigation.\u201d <em>Holtman v. 4-G\u2019s Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>264 Mont. 432, 437, 872 P.2d 318, 321 (1994). Here, the record shows that the Wamsleys\u2019 children and the Estate are in privity because their legal interests in this matter are the same and were represented similarly in both forums. In North Dakota, the Wamlseys\u2019 children argued against applying North Dakota law to their UIM claims, and the same position was taken by the Estate in Montana. The Wamsleys\u2019 children and the Estate had the same interest in advancing those arguments because of the potential benefit to both the Estate and the children if they were allowed to stack UIM claims. The fact that a conflict of interest might develop later between the children and the Estate is not significant here because, in either event, more money would be available to either the Estate or the Wamsleys\u2019 surviving children if the UIM claims could be stacked. Additionally, we note that the same attorney appeared in North Dakota and Montana, arguing the same basic position in both forums. For these reasons, we agree with Nodak that the privity requirement of res judicata is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b654 Accordingly, we agree with Nodak that the basic elements of res judicata seem to be satisfied by the North Dakota rulings. If full faith and credit were to be accorded the North Dakota rulings, then theoretically after October 7, 2003, the District Court in Montana would be compelled to apply North Dakota law to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims. However, the unquestioning application of full faith and credit in this case is problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b655 The Estate advances two other arguments against granting full faith and credit in this case which deserve careful consideration. First, the Estate argues the North Dakota rulings should not be granted full faith and credit because they greatly offend the public policy in Montana in favor of stacking. However, this is not an appropriate basis upon which to refuse full faith and credit because, as a general rule, a judgment must be afforded full faith and credit regardless of how greatly it offends the public policy of Montana. <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 45. However, the Estate advances a second argument against granting full faith and credit which we do find compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u00b656 The Estate argues the North Dakota rulings are not due full faith and credit because they impermissibly interfere with the Montana litigation. In this connection, it bears repeating that these two cases proceeded simultaneously in two state courts, with competing rulings being sought and obtained within weeks, and sometimes days, of each another. Unlike the classic situation involving the entry of judgment by one court prior to the commencement of the ensuing case in another, we are faced here with an anomalous state of affairs; indeed, Nodak has cited no precedent addressing how and even whether full faith and credit is due under such circumstances. It is against this backdrop that we analyze whether the District Court erred in declining to accord the North Dakota rulings full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b657 Full faith and credit due to the judgment from a sister state is not automatic. The Full Faith and Credit clause \u201cis not an inexorable and unqualified command. It leaves some scope for state control within its borders of affairs which are peculiarly its own ... [and] there are limits to the extent to which the laws and policy of one state may be subordinated to those of another.\u201d <em>Pink v. A.A.A. Hwy. Exp., </em>314 U.S. 201, 210, 62 S. Ct. 241, 246 (1941); <em>Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, </em>320 U.S. 430, 438, 64 S. Ct. 208, 213, (1943), <em>overruled on other grounds by Thomas v. Wash. Gas Light Co., </em>448 U.S. 261, 100 S. Ct. 2647 (1980), (\u201cwe assume ... that the command of the Constitution and the statute is not all-embracing, and that there may be exceptional cases in which the judgment of one state may not override the laws and policy of another....\u201d). Thus, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel \u00a3a state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker, 522 </em>U.S. at 232, 118 S. Ct. at 663 (quoting <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Indust. Accident Commn., </em>306 U.S. 493, 501, 59 S. Ct. 629, 632 (1939)). Similarly, the Supreme Court has denied the enforcement of anti-suit injunctions which purport to control a court\u2019s actions in another state. \u201cOrders commanding action or inaction have been denied enforcement in a sister State when they purported to accomplish an official act within the exclusive province of that other State <em>or interfered with litigation over which the ordering State had no authority.\u201dBaker, 522 </em>U.S. at 235, 118 S. Ct. at 665 (emphasis added). This view is echoed in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws </em>\u00a7 103 cited by the Estate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">A judgment rendered in one State of the United States need not be recognized or enforced in a sister State if such recognition or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>enforcement is not required by the national policy of full faith and credit because it would involve an improper interference with important interests of the sister State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b658 As the comment to the Restatement indicates, the exception represented in this rule is \u201crare\u201d and its precise parameters, as defined by the United States Supreme Court, remain \u201cuncertain.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 103 cmt. a. However, there are cases where \u201cthe national policy of full faith and credit giv[es] way to the important interests of the sister state.\u201d <em>Reading &amp; Bates Const. Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Corp., </em>976 S.W.2d 702, 714 (Tex. App. 1998). Thus in <em>Reading </em>the Texas Court of Appeals refused to grant full faith and credit to a Canadian judgment subsequently recognized under Louisiana law, without first deciding for itself if it was compelled to enforce the Canadian judgment under Texas law. <em>Reading, </em>976 S.W.2d at 714-15. The Texas Court of Appeals acknowledged its duty to generally recognize valid Louisiana judgments under full faith and credit, but rejected the notion that it was automatically compelled to give a Canadian judgment full faith and credit in Texas simply because it was first recognized in Louisiana. <em>Reading, </em>976 S.W.2d at 715. The Texas court noted its legitimate interests in evaluating a foreign judgment before enforcement in Texas, and rejected the attempt to enforce the Canadian judgment \u201cthrough the back door\u201d via Louisiana law. <em>Reading, </em>976 S.W.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b659 Here, the North Dakota declaratory judgment action was begun in an attempt to apply North Dakota law \u201cthrough the back door\u201d in Montana, and avoid a potentially adverse result here. As noted above, Nodak took advantage of the Estate\u2019s good graces by obtaining extensions to respond to its demands, all the while buying time to file a pre-emptive action in North Dakota. See \u00b6 6. It is evident that the declaratory judgment in North Dakota was brought for the purpose of preempting the District Court in Montana from exercising control over the judicial processes necessary to resolve this dispute. We agree with Justice Maring that the North Dakota rulings simply constituted an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on choice of law and stacking. <em>Nodak, </em>687 N.W.2d at 236 (Maring, J., dissenting). The District Court in Montana was not bound by those rulings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00b660 We are troubled by Nodak\u2019s invocation of full faith and credit in an attempt to confer upon District Courts in North Dakota interlocutory control over District Courts in Montana. Nodak can point to no cases where full faith and credit has given one state the power to issue declaratory judgments aimed at exerting such control over <em>ongoing </em>litigation in a forum state. Permitting North Dakota\u2019s declaratory judgments to have preclusive effect over Montana courts in this case \u201cwould mean in effect that the courts of [North Dakota] can control what goes on in the courts of [Montana].\u201d <em>Baker, 522 </em>U.S. at 236 n. 9, 118 S. Ct. 665 n. 9 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b661  We emphasize that our decision here is not based upon the fact that anti-stacking statutes are contrary to public policy in Montana. We acknowledge there is no public policy exception to full faith and credit. We also recognize that this case presents a unique set of circumstances for which no clear rule in the full faith and credit jurisprudence has been established. <em>See Baker, 522 </em>U.S. at 245, 118 S. Ct. at 670 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (noting that the United States Supreme Court has never exactly determined at what point \u201can otherwise valid judgment cannot intrude upon essential process of courts outside of the issuing State ....\u201d). Nonetheless, we conclude it would defeat the purpose of forging national unity to use full faith and credit to needlessly expand a single cause of action into multi-state litigation. If anything, such a use of the full faith and credit clause simply balkanizes the legal process, brings state courts into greater conflict, and diminishes respect for the type of state sovereignty the first Congress envisioned. For these reasons, we conclude the District Court did not err in declining to accord full faith and credit to the competing rulings issued by the North Dakota courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b662 Issue Six: Does the doctrine of collateral estoppel preclude the Estate from litigating its UIM claims in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b663 Nodak argues the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the Estate from pursuing its UIM claims in Montana once the District Court in North Dakota had ruled on the choice of law and UIM claims. However, Nodak points to no authority which supports the application of collateral estoppel in situations where contemporaneous suits are unfolding. As we have stated \u201c[c]ollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>bars the reopening of an issue that has been litigated and determined in a <em>prior suit.\u201d Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, \u00b6 15, 130 P.3d 1267, \u00b6 15 (emphasis added). The suits in this matter were contemporaneous, with Montana and North Dakota ruling on various aspects of the cases at parallel times. The doctrine has no applicability in this context and did not operate to bar the Estate\u2019s UIM claims in Montana. Furthermore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>collateral estoppel did apply here, the District Court was not required to grant the North Dakota rulings full faith and credit because they would impermissibly interfere with the Montana litigation as explained above in our discussion of Issue Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b664 Issue Seven: Do principles of comity require the Montana courts to defer to the rulings from the North Dakota Supreme Court in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b665 Lastly, Nodak asserts that general principles of comity require Montana to defer to the sovereignty of North Dakota and give effect to the North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Nodak. </em>We disagree. As we noted above at \u00b6 31, a state\u2019s decision to extend comity to another state is entirely voluntary. <em>Simmons, </em>206 Mont. at 289, 670 P.2d at 1385. Moreover, unlike full faith and credit, comity need not be extended in cases where \u201cit would contravene the public or judicial policy of the forum state.\u201d <em>Kane v. Kane, </em>198 Mont. 335, 338, 646 P.2d 505, 507 (1982) (quotation omitted); <em>Oberson v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 329, \u00b6 10, 330 Mont. 1, \u00b6 10, 126 P.3d 459, \u00b6 10. As our foregoing analysis suggests, Montana is entitled to comity in this matter just as much as North Dakota. While we respect North Dakota\u2019s interests in regulating the relationship between its resident insurers and their insureds, Montana has a number of weighty interests in this matter as we have discussed above. To paraphrase the District Court, comity should extend in all directions: east to west, as well as west to east.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b666 For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-8\">JUSTICES NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> The portion of \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, cited in Mitchell actually reads as follows: \u201cA contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to he performed ....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\"> As a technical matter, we note that full faith and credit requires a sister state to give a judgment the res judicata effect it would have in the State which initially-rendered the judgment. <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 39. Accordingly, it would be more appropriate to conduct the res judicata analysis under North Dakota law because the declaratory judgment was issued there. However, both parties have argued res judicata under Montana law, and neither party has alleged the res judicata criteria differ substantively between Montana and North Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\"> As the Estate notes, Nodak never sought to have the declaratory judgment from North Dakota certified in Montana pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, \u00a7\u00a7 25-9-501 to 508, MCA. As we stated in <em>Carr </em>\u201c[t]he UEFJA provides the procedural framework for enforcing foreign judgment in the states that have enacted it.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 41. This raises the question-for the time being unresolved-as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>whether a Montana court is required to pay any recognition to a declaratory judgment from a sister state which is not certified pursuant to the statutory requirements of the UEPJA, or whether the full faith and credit due the judgments from another state transcends this statutory framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b507-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A_B\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b667 I concur with the Court\u2019s holding herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b668 Nodak has offered substantive arguments which I believe are compelling but which, because of procedural or postural issues in this litigation, I am not able to adopt. I agree that Nodak\u2019s personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>jurisdiction defense was not preserved before the District Court and thus waived. I concur that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Nodak\u2019s comity-based request for a stay under the circumstances here, specifically, the litigation tactics explained by the Court, though I do not necessarily agree, as discussed more fully below, that we have or should have a \u201cpractice of applying Montana law to automobile accidents occurring within [our] borders,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 33, which would render a careful application of the statutes and Restatement factors unnecessary or secondary. Similarly, I believe that the circumstances here, described by the Court as \u201canomalous,\u201d place this case within a very narrow exception to the general rule that we give full faith and credit to the North Dakota judgment. That exception is rightfully a narrow one, as we should have no interest in either casually dishonoring a judgment entered elsewhere or encouraging dueling litigation here. And, though I am sympathetic with some of the thoughts Justice Warner expresses in his opinion regarding <em>Hardy </em>and the stacking issue, I nonetheless must concur with the Court that the merits of this issue cannot be reached because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b669 Finally, I concur with the Court\u2019s holding on the merits of the choice of law issue, Issue Three, though I do not necessarily agree with the entirety of the analysis. Since adopting the Restatement\u2019s formulation for determining choice of law issues in <em>Casarotto, </em>the Court has, in my view, used inconsistent analytical approaches which need to be resolved or clarified. <em>Compare Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 20, 315 Mont. 281, \u00b6 20, 68 P.3d 703, \u00b6 20 (analyzing choice of law for an automobile insurance contract under \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, and despite the absence of place of performance, determining that the place of performance is where the injury occurs, thereby bypassing analysis pursuant to \u00a7 188 of the Restatement) <em>with Burchett v. Mastec N. America, Inc., </em>2004 MT 177, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19, 322 Mont. 93, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19, 93 P.3d 1247, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19 (analyzing choice of law for an employment contract under \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, and determining that where the contract does not indicate a place of performance, \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, may be unworkable and choice of law is determined by applying \u00a7 188 of the Restatement).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b670 Here, the Court\u2019s analysis begins at the right place but quickly turns to the result in <em>Mitchell </em>and implies therefrom that because the case involves an automobile accident occurring in Montana, the \u201cplace of performance\u201d must necessarily be Montana. We should be wary of creating a bright-line rule whereby we always imply that the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>intended the place of injury to also be the place of performance. Such an approach does not give effect to the original intent of the parties, which is the primary concern of the Restatement. Further, such an approach may, in some future case where a Montana resident is involved in an accident outside the state, dictate that we apply the law of the other state, because the place of performance has become synonymous with the place of injury. I believe we should clarify our law in order to provide a clear and consistent analytical approach under the Restatement and our statutes to these contract questions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and DISTRICT JUDGE PHILLIPS join in the concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b509-5\">JUSTICE WARNER,</author>\n<p id=\"AIqs\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b671 I concur with the Court in several respects. I disagree with the Court on the seminal issue of whether the District Court was required by conflict of laws principles previously adopted and by comity to dismiss this action. This action should either be decided under North Dakota law or dismissed in deference to the North Dakota judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AahW\">\u00b672 This case stems from the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hardy, </em>which unduly restricts the right to contract, and denies the legislature its rightful role in making policy decisions. The Court compounded the problems inherent in <em>Hardy </em>when it decided <em>Mitchell </em>by misconstruing \u00a7 28-3-102, MCA, and essentially ignoring the uniform conflict of law principles which were adopted in <em>Casarotto. Casarotto, </em>268 Mont. at 373-74, 886 P.2d at 934. Now, the Court again errs by refusing to let North Dakota courts decide questions arising between North Dakota citizens concerning a North Dakota contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b673 The Court discusses seven issues. \u00b6\u00b6 15-21.1 do not disagree with the entirety of the Court\u2019s analysis. I agree that the District Court did not err in concluding that it had personal jurisdiction over Nodak, \u00b6 25; I agree the District Court did not err in refusing to accord preclusive effect to the North Dakota Judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to the United States Constitution, \u00b6 61; and I agree that collateral estoppel does not preclude the Estate from litigating its claims in Montana, \u00b6 63. While the record is not as clear as the Court implies, \u00b6 34, considering Nodak\u2019s actions in this case, I conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Nodak\u2019s motion to stay Montana proceedings pending the outcome of the North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Dakota action based on the \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Along with Chief Justice Gray and Justice Rice, I disagree with the result of <em>Hardy. Hardy, </em>\u00b6 49 (Rice, J. &amp; Gray, C.J., dissenting). The case is, however, the law in Montana. Unless and until <em>Hardy </em>is overturned there is no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion of law that under Montana law the Estate could stack the UIM policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b674 I disagree with the Court and would hold that the District Court erred in concluding that Montana law applies to the Estate\u2019s stacking claims; alternatively, I would dismiss this action, deferring to the decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b675 Section 28-3-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">A contract is to be interpreted according to the law and usage of the place where it is to be performed or, if it does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and usage of the place where it is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b676 The error the Court makes is in holding that Montana law must apply every time a contract made elsewhere has some effect in Montana. As it erroneously did in <em>Mitchell, </em>the Court again says when an automobile accident happens in Montana, Montana is \u201cthe\u201d place where an applicable insurance contract is performed. Then, because the contract is to be performed here, pursuant to \u00a7 28-3-102 no further analysis -under the Restatement factors is required. \u00b6\u00b6 40,41; <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 20. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 28-3-102, there is no need for conflict of law principles. If the Court\u2019s premise is accepted, when there is sufficient contact with Montana to give its courts jurisdiction, a contract, any contract, is performed in Montana. The Court is incorrect. In truth, \u00a7 28-3-102 is not an absolute directive that when an accident happens in Montana, Montana law must always apply to the interpretation of an applicable insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u00b677 The fact that an automobile insurance policy provides coverage throughout the United States is not alone sufficient to show that it is only performed where an accident happens. It is obviously the intention of the parties to the contract that it will be performed in many places. In a case such as presented here, Montana is simply \u201ca\u201d place the insurance contract may be performed. The contacts with Montana noted by the Court at \u00b6 44 may have relevance in determining which state\u2019s law applies. However, these factors are most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>closely related to the Estate\u2019s tort claims against Stanton, and are only tangentially related to the contract claims the Estate makes against Wamsley\u2019s insurer, Nodak. The fact that the accident happened in Montana is simply one of several factors to be considered in making the decision which law should apply. But, it is not the only factor. It is obvious that North Dakota, where the parties to this action are domiciled and live, where they negotiated for the insurance, where they entered the contract, where the premiums were paid, where the car involved was garaged, and where any payment from Nodak will be made, is also a place where the insurance contract will be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"AR6\">\u00b678 There are many instances, when an accident happens in Montana, that an insurance contract should be interpreted by applying Montana law. Likewise, Montana law may be appropriately applied in interpreting an insurance contract when an accident did not happen in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b679 In my view, the Court errs in holding that Montana courts will not consider multi-state insurance contacts as directed by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 193, which the Court sets out at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"AEc6\">\u00b680 Other courts, interpreting statutes identical to \u00a7 28-3-102, have concluded that the law of the state where an insurance contract was made should generally apply, rather than the law of the state where an accident happened to occur. <em>E.g. Rhody v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>771 F.2d 1416, 1420 (10th Cir. 1985); <em>Great West Cas. Co. v. Hovaldt, </em>603 N.W.2d 198, 201 (S.D. 1999); <em>Rush v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>891 F.2d 267, 270 (10th Cir. 1989) (citing <em>Rhody, </em>771 F.2d at 1420); <em>Bohannan v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>820 P.2d 787, 797 (Okla. 1991). For example, in <em>Rhody, </em>the Tenth Circuit held that an identical Oklahoma statute did not require the application of Oklahoma law when an automobile insurance contract was entered in Texas, but an accident occurred in Oklahoma. The court reasoned that the wording of the statute \u201crestrict[ed] application of the law of the place of performance of a contract to cases in which the place of performance is indicated in the contract.\u201d <em>Rhody, </em>771 F.2d at 1420 (emphasis omitted). Simply establishing the United States as the area of coverage was insufficient, in the Tenth Circuit\u2019s view, to indicate the intent for the place of performance to be wherever an incident occurred and gave rise to a claim. <em>Rhody, </em>771 F.2d at 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b681 These cases and other cases addressing similar facts recognize that the state where the parties entered the contract has a greater interest in having its own law applied than a state that is only connected to the parties by happenstance. In an identical situation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Oregon Supreme Court declined to apply its own law to interpret an insurance contract entered into in Michigan when the plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident in Oregon because the \u201cplace of plaintiffs injury was fortuitous.\u201d <em>Davis v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>507 P.2d 9, 10 (Or. 1973). Instead, the court concluded it was better to apply the law of the state with more connection to the contract between the insurer and insured. <em>Davis, </em>507 P.2d at 10. <em>See also Lee v. Saliga, </em>373 S.E.2d 345, 352 (W. Va. 1988) (concluding that another state\u2019s law should apply to interpret an insurance contract where West Virginia\u2019s \u201conly connection to the dispute is the fortuity that the accident occurred there\u201d); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Roach, </em>945 So. 2d 1160, 1169 (Fla. 2006) (declining to apply Florida law when the insureds were not permanent residents of Florida because \u201c[t]o do so would throw conflicts-of-law jurisprudence into disarray and destroy the stability in contractual arrangements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b682 This Court has recognized in the context of employment law that when a contract does not indicate a particular place of performance, \u00a7 28-3-102 does not require the application of Montana law to the contract. <em>See Burchett v. Mastec N. Am., Inc., </em>2004 MT 177, 322 Mont. 93, 93 P.3d 1247. In <em>Burchett, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 28-3-102 did not apply because \u201c[a]t the time [they] entered into the employment contract, the parties did not know where it was to be performed; the work... was transitory by nature.\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>\u00b6 13. The contract in this case is analogous. As in <em>Burchett, </em>when the Wamsleys and Nodak entered the insurance contract, they did not know that performance would occur in Montana. Section 28-3-102 thus does not mandate the application of Montana law, based on this Court\u2019s own reasoning in <em>Burchett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b683 The insurance contract at issue here was between residents of North Dakota who conduct their business there. It was entered in North Dakota and the vehicles were principally garaged in North Dakota. Nodak set its rates and the insured\u2019s paid their premiums in North Dakota. The parties and the insurance contract have virtually no connection to Montana other than the \u201cfortuity that the accident occurred [h]ere.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>373 S.E.2d at 352. Considering that the tort claims the Estate makes against Stanton only peripherally involve the contract claims against Nodak, the place where the insurance contract was negotiated, the place where it was made, the place of performance, the principal location of the insured autos, and considering the domicile, residence and place of business of the parties, it becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>obvious that North Dakota law should apply to the Estate\u2019s claims against Nodak. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 188(2).</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">\u00b684 Further, in my view, this Court should grant comity to North Dakota in this instance for a reason which the Court does not mention. The Montana Supreme Court has the right and the duty to correctly interpret Montana law for the benefit of Montana citizens. Still, Montana is a part of the United States and the judgments of our sister states are important-especially to the citizens of those other states. The only Montanans affected by the Court\u2019s decision today are the local lawyers. The refusal to grant comity in this case, where only North Dakota policy is directly affected, impinges unnecessarily upon the harmonious interstate relations which are part and parcel of the spirit of co-operative federalism. <em>See </em>Simmons, 206 Mont. at 291, 670 P.2d at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b685 There are now two diametrically opposed judgments, oneinNorth Dakota and the other in Montana. It remains to be seen if Montana\u2019s decision today aids the Estate\u2019s pursuit of an insurance payment the Wamsleys did not bargain for, or only necessitates further litigation between North Dakota citizens. I would defer to the North Dakota judgment and dissent from the Court\u2019s decision not to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> The \u201cfirst to file\u201d rule, noted by the Court at \u00b6\u00b6 32,34, is an important factor in conflict of laws jurisprudence. However, under the facts of this case I agree with the Court that it is not determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
