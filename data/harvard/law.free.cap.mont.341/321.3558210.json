Madplume (Madplume) was charged with the offense of sexual intercourse without consent after DNA evidence revealed the presence of the accuser\u2019s DNA on Madplume\u2019s finger. An omnibus hearing was scheduled but was continued seventeen times at Madplume\u2019s request. During this time Madplume signed a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. In September 2005 Madplume moved to suppress the DNA evidence on the ground that it was obtained without a warrant and therefore resulted from an unlawful search of his person. The District Court granted his motion. The State appealed and in January 2007 we reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Madplume\u2019s omnibus hearing was ultimately held on March 14, 2007. On that date, he filed a motion to dismiss for violation of the right to a speedy trial. The District Court granted the motion without a hearing and the State appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b62 The question presented is whether the District Court properly granted Madplume\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of the right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b63 The factual background of this case was presented in <em>State v. Madplume, </em>2007 MT 11, 335 Mont. 290, 150 P.3d 956, and is not relevant to the issue before us; therefore, it will not be repeated here. This appeal concerns the procedural background of Madplume\u2019s case only.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b64 It is undisputed that 894 days had elapsed from the time Madplume was charged and the date on which he filed his motion to dismiss. Madplume argued to the District Court and to this Court on appeal that this passage of time resulted in a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u00b65 The District Court granted Madplume\u2019s motion to dismiss. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">\u00b66 A criminal defendant\u2019s claimed violation of the right to a speedy trial presents a question of constitutional law. We review a trial court\u2019s resolution of such questions for correctness and will not disturb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>findings underlying a district court\u2019s speedy trial ruling unless the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Spang, </em>2007 MT 54, \u00b6 7, 336 Mont. 184, \u00b6 7, 153 P.3d 646, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b67 <em>Issue: Did the District Court properly grant Madplume\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of the right to a speedy trial ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b68 Madplume moved the District Court to dismiss the charges against him, asserting the State had violated his right to a speedy trial. The District Court granted his motion finding that he had been prejudiced by the lengthy delay and that the State had not met its burden of disproving prejudice. The State contends the District Court\u2019s conclusion is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b69 We note that this case proceeded through the District Court and to this Court on appeal before we issued our decision in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, in which we announced a comprehensively-revised speedy trial test that \u201cmore closely tracks the balancing approach envisioned by the [U.S.] Supreme Court in Barker,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Doggett,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and other post <em>-Barker </em>cases.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 106. As a result, the parties argued to the District Court and that court ruled based on analysis of the standards set forth in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, overruled in part <em>by Ariegwe. </em>Thus, the District Court did not have the opportunity to analyze the speedy trial issue under the new <em>Ariegwe </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b610  On appeal, the State filed its opening brief before <em>Ariegwe </em>was issued; however, <em>Ariegwe\u2019s </em>new test was published before Madplume responded or the State replied. Neither party, however, analyzed the speedy trial issue under the newly-announced test but continued to rely upon a <em>Bruce </em>analysis. Since the timing of <em>Ariegwe\u2019s </em>publication precluded the court and the parties from analyzing the speedy trial issue under this new framework, and as we recently did in <em>State v. Smith, </em>2008 MT 7, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 341 Mont. 82, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 176 P.3d 258, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, we deem it appropriate to remand this matter to the District Court without prejudice to a timely appeal thereafter by either party, with instruction that the District Court apply the <em>Ariegwe </em>analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>resolving the speedy trial issues herein presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b611 We reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Madplume\u2019s case and remand for analysis under <em>Ariegwe.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b344-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> <em>Barker v.
