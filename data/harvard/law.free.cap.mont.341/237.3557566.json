Holland was indigent and the District Court appointed counsel to defend him at the expense of the State of Montana. His appointed counsel moved the District Court for its approval to expend State funds to investigate the case and to retain an expert witness. The District Court granted the motion and approved up to $3,000 in defense expenditures. Defense counsel ultimately spent $2,922 on investigative and related expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b64 Ultimately, Holland pled no contest to the criminal endangerment charges and guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. On April 27, 2006, the District Court sentenced Holland, deferring the imposition of sentence for three years. As a condition of the deferred sentence, the judge required Holland to repay the $2,922 expended by defense counsel, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, and \u00a7 46-8-113, MCA (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Holland does not contest the finding of the District Court that he is able to pay. He appeals the requirement that he repay defense costs, asserting that the statutes do not authorize the District Court to impose such a condition on his deferred sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u00b65 We review a sentence for legality, examining only whether it is within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. </em>Hirt, 2005 MT 285, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 267, \u00b6 11, 124 P.3d 147, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\u00b66 Section 46-18-201(3)(b), MCA, permits a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that includes \u201cpayment of costs as provided in 46-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>18-232 or payment of costs of court-appointed counsel as provided in 46-8-113.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b67 Section 46-18-232, MCA, is not involved in this appeal as it only concerns costs of prosecution that a defendant may be ordered to pay. Section 46-8-113, MCA, provides in pertinent part: \u201c[t]he court may require a convicted defendant to pay the costs of court-appointed counsel as a part of or a condition under the sentence imposed as provided in [this title].\u201d Section 46-8-113(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b68  We have held that \u00a7 46-8-113(1) includes all costs related to a criminal defense. <em>State v. Hubbel, </em>2001 MT 31, \u00b6 33, 304 Mont. 184, \u00b6 33, 20 P.3d 111, \u00b6 33, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 11, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 11, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 11. As we noted in <em>Hubbel, </em>the statute contains no limitation on which defense costs a judge may require a defendant to pay. <em>Hubbel, </em>\u00b6 33. The District Court had the statutory authority to condition Holland\u2019s deferred sentence on his repayment of approved costs the State incurred in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b69  The District Court did not err when it required Holland to repay $2,922 as a condition of his deferred sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b610 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\"> In 2005, the legislature amended \u00a7 46-8-113, MCA, but delayed the effective date until July 1, 2006. Because Holland committed the offense and was sentenced before this date, the amendment does not apply to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
