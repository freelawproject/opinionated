We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in determining credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">\u00b63 The facts in this case are more fully set forth in <em>State v. Erickson, </em>2005 MT 276, 329 Mont. 192, 124 P.3d 119 <em>(Erickson T). </em>Erickson was arrested in Dawson County on November 1, 2001, and placed in jail. On December 4, 2001, the State charged Erickson with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(5), MCA (DC 01-055). Bail was initially set at $50,000.00. Erickson was unable to post bail, thus he remained incarcerated until his bail amount was reduced. He was able to post a commercial surety bond in the amount of $5,000.00 on July 25, 2002, and he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">\u00b64 On September 19, 2002, while out on bond, Erickson and two other individuals were arrested for manufacturing methamphetamine (meth). Erickson was charged with operating an unlawful clandestine lab, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132(l)(a), MCA (DC 02-048). His bail was set at $250,000.00, and he remained incarcerated until sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">\u00b65 On the morning of the scheduled trial in DC 01-055, Erickson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>entered into a plea agreement with the State wherein he agreed to plead guilty to the possession charge in DC 01-055, and to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea on the clandestine lab charge in DC 02-048. In exchange, the State agreed to recommend a five-year suspended sentence in DC 01-055, and to make a binding recommendation for a concurrent ten-year sentence with five years suspended in DC 02-048. The agreement also stated that the sentences would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">rim concurrently and [Erickson] will be given credit for time served awaiting trial in DC 02-048, i.e., credit for time served from the date of his arrest on the unlawful operation of clandestine lab charge to the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">At the change of plea hearing on September 18, 2003, the District Court accepted Erikson\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b66 On December 19, 2003, the District Court held a combined sentencing hearing. At this hearing, the court sentenced Erickson to five years in Montana State Prison (MSP) in DC 01-055 with all time suspended and ten years in MSP in DC 02-048 with five years suspended. The court also ordered that the two sentences were to ran concurrently. In its December 23, 2003 Judgment and Order Suspending Sentence, the District Court ordered that Erickson would be credited with 289 days served in DC 01-055 and 430 days served in DC 02-048. Erickson appealed arguing, among other things, that he must be given credit in DC 01-055 for all of the time he served in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"ALC\">\u00b67 On November 1, 2005, we issued our Opinion in <em>Erickson I </em>wherein we reversed and remanded for a determination of whether Erickson\u2019s bond in DC 01-055 was revoked and for further inquiry into the question of credit for time served. <em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6 39. We stated in <em>Erickson I </em>that if Erickson\u2019s bond in DC 01-055 was revoked on September 19, 2002, and he was surrendered to the Sheriff, he was then incarcerated awaiting trial on the charges in DC 01-055 as well as those in DC 02-048. In such case, his incarceration was directly related to the charges in DC 01-055, hence \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, would require that he receive credit for the time between his arrest and when judgment was entered on that charge. However, if his bond in DC 01-055 was never revoked, then he was not incarcerated on that charge after his release on July 25, 2002, and he need not receive credit against that charge for the time served after his arrest on September 19, 2002. <em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b68 The District Court held a hearing on the matter on January 5, 2006, and on January 26, 2006, the court issued an Order wherein it made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>That on Case No. DC 01-055, that the Defendant\u2019s Bail was not formally revoked on September 19, 2002, and therefore the Defendant shall not be given credit for time served in jail on Case No. DC 01-055 for days served in jail beginning September 19, 2002. The Court FURTHER FINDS that the Defendant was not surrendered by his Bondsman to the Dawson County Sheriffs Department until after the Defendant was arrested on Case No. DC 02-048.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The court issued its Amended Judgment and Order Suspending Sentence the same day. In this amended judgment, the court ordered that Erickson be given credit for time served in custody in DC 01-055, from his arrest on November 1,2001, to his release on bond on July 25, 2002, for a total of 267 days; and in DC 02-048, from his arrest on September 19, 2002, to the sentencing hearing on December 19, 2003, for a total of 457 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b69 Erickson appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment arguing that he should also be given credit in DC 01-055 for the 457 days he served in custody from September 19, 2002, when he contends his bond in that case was revoked, until his combined sentencing hearing on December 19, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b610 Trial judges are granted broad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment for offenses. <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, ? 8, 325 Mont. 317, \u00b6 8, 106 P.3d 521, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Hembd, </em>254 Mont. 407, 411, 838 P.2d 412, 415 (1992)). On appeal we will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8. Instead, we will only review a criminal sentence for its legality; that is, whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 8, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 8). Moreover, a trial court's statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining credit for time served.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u00b612 Erickson argues on appeal that he should be given fall credit for both the 267 days he spent in custody in DC 01-055 prior to being released on bail and the 457 days he spent in custody after he claims his bail in DC 01-055 was revoked. In other words, Erickson maintains that he should receive 724 days credit in DC 01-055 as well as the 457 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>days credit he received in DC 02-048.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b613 Section 46-18-403(1), MCA (2001), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">Credit for incarceration prior to conviction. (1) Any person incarcerated on a bailable offense and against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction, except that the time allowed as a credit may not exceed the term of the prison sentence rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>State v. Kime, </em>2002 MT 38, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 341, \u00b6 15, 43 P.3d 290, \u00b6 15, <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, 323 Mont. 287, 99 P.3d 661, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">the general purpose of \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, is to eliminate the disparity of treatment between indigent and nonindigent defendants. In other words, credit for time served is given so as not to penalize indigent defendants who are unable to post bail and must remain in custody until they are sentenced when nonindigent defendants may secure their release and remain free during that time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">However, we further stated in <em>Kime </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">[t]hat purpose is not served by crediting a defendant\u2019s sentence for time served where the defendant would not have been released from custody had he or she been able to post bail in any event as a result of being held on a sentence related to an earlier offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACd\"><em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\u00b614 In the instant case, the State argues that our ruling in <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, 310 Mont. 320, 50 P.3d 530, should be extended to the facts in the case here to prevent Erickson from receiving \u201cwhat amounts to a double credit.\u201d Price was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), a fourth or subsequent offense, and four misdemeanors. He pled guilty to the misdemeanors prior to trial. He was convicted of the DUI charge following a jury trial and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for that offense with four years probation. The district court sentenced Price to a total of twelve days in jail on the misdemeanor offenses to run consecutively to the DUI sentence. Because Price had served eighteen days in jail awaiting trial, the court deemed the misdemeanor jail sentences served, and credited the remaining six days of time served to Price\u2019s DUI sentence. <em>Price, </em>\u00b61.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">\u00b615 Price contended on appeal that the district court erroneously applied \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA. He argued that the district court was required to grant him full credit for time served on <em>each </em>sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>imposed. In other words, according to Price, for the eighteen days he remained in jail prior to trial, he should have received eighteen days credit against his DUI sentence along with the time credited toward his misdemeanor sentences. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Price, </em>we cited with favor the following statement made by the Hawaii Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cOnce credit has been granted, no additional purpose is served by granting a second or \u2018double credit\u2019 against a later consecutive sentence. Courts in other jurisdictions having similar statutes agree that a defendant who receives consecutive sentences is entitled to presentence credit only once against the aggregate of the consecutive terms, while a defendant sentenced to concurrent terms in effect receives credit against each sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>Price, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting <em>State v. Tauiliili, </em>29 P.3d 914, 918 (Haw. 2001)). And, we held in <em>Price </em>that \u201c\u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, entitles defendants to credit for presentence incarceration only once against the aggregate of all terms imposed when multiple sentences are imposed <em>consecutively.\u201d Price, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b617 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State would like us to analogize this case to <em>Price </em>and hold that concurrent sentences should be treated the same as the consecutive sentences in Price-i.e., that a defendant should be entitled to credit for presentence incarceration only once against the aggregate of all terms imposed. However, in making this argument, the State failed to point out the last portion of the quotation in <em>Price </em>from the Hawaii Supreme Court that \u201ca defendant sentenced to <em>concurrent </em>terms in effect receives credit against <em>each </em>sentence.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 27 (emphasis added); <em>Tauiliili, </em>29 P.3d at 918 (emphasis added). While this statement is not explained further in <em>Price, </em>we are reluctant to extend <em>Price\u2019s </em>holding regarding consecutive sentences to the concurrent sentences in the instant case given this statement. And, indeed, as demonstrated below, it is not necessary that we do so here. In addition, we admonish counsel that when relying on cases to support an argument, they take care not to overlook and omit portions of the case that could prove contrary to their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b618 In <em>Erickson I, </em>we remanded to the District Court \u201cfor a determination of whether Erickson\u2019s bond on DC-01-055 was revoked [and] for calculation of and ordering of credit against his sentences in conformity with\u201d that opinion. <em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6 39. We stated in <em>Erickson I </em>that \u201c[w]hile the record on appeal includes a copy of the bond revocation, it has never been established in the District Court that Erickson\u2019s bond in DC-01-055 was revoked.\u201d <em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6 26. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">[i]t is clear under the circumstances of this case that, if Erickson\u2019s $5,000 bond was revoked by his bondsman pursuant to \u00a7 46-9-401(3), MCA, on September 18, 2002, and he was surrendered to the Sheriff, he was then incarcerated awaiting trial on the charges in DC-01-055 as well as those in DC-02-048. His incarceration was, in such instance, directly related to the charges in DC-01-055, and \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, would require that he receive credit for the time between his arrest and when judgment was entered on that charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">If the truth of the matter is that Erickson\u2019s bond in DC-01-055 was never revoked, the District Court would be correct that he was not incarcerated on that charge after his release on July 25, 2002, and he need not receive credit for such time served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD8l\"><em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b619 We made this determination based on our holding in <em>Kime </em>that \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 46-18-403(1), MCA, a defendant\u2019s sentence may be credited with the time he or she was incarcerated only if that incarceration was <em>directly related </em>to the offense for which the sentence is imposed.\u201d <em>Erickson I, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 16) (emphasis added). Kime was arrested on November 26, 2000, on charges of felony theft, DUI and driving while his license was suspended, and placed in the Gallatin County Detention Center. He did not post bail, hence he remained incarcerated at the detention center. At the time of his arrest, Kime was participating in a supervised release program as part of a prior sentence for a felony assault conviction. The prior sentence committed Kime to the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) for a period of ten years with five years suspended. On December 5, 2000, the DOC removed Kime from the supervised release program and transferred him to MSP to serve the remainder of his sentence on the felony assault conviction. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b620 On December 12, 2000, the State charged Kime by Information with felony theft, second offense DUI and driving while his license was suspended. Kime pled guilty to the charges pursuant to a plea agreement and he was sentenced on April 2,2001. At sentencing, Kime requested that the court credit him with time served from the date of his arrest on November 26, 2000, until the April 2, 2001 sentencing. However, the district court credited Kime with only the 20 days served between his arrest and December 5,2000, when Kime was transported from the detention center to MSP. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b621  On appeal, the State pointed out in <em>Kime </em>that \u00a7 46-18-403(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>MCA, provides for credit only for time a defendant is \u201cincarcerated on a <em>bailable </em>offense\u201d (emphasis added), and that once Kime was transported to MSP, he was incarcerated on, and serving his sentence for, his nonbailable prior felony conviction. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6 13. We agreed with the State\u2019s argument in <em>Kime, </em>that a defendant should only be credited for time served prior to sentencing where the incarceration is <em>directly related to the offense for which the sentence is imposed, </em>and we so held. <em>Kime, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b622 In the instant case, the District Court stated the following at the January 5, 2006 sentencing hearing after remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">I do not believe that the bonding company in this case personally delivered the defendant to the Sheriffs Office and that he was then arrested. The record reflects that there was a stop of a vehicle in which he was a passenger; that there was a search of the vehicle; drugs were found and arrests were made on September 18th [2002]. My belief is that after that arrest, the bonding agents came in and revoked the bail in the 01 charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">As the Supreme Court indicated in paragraph 25 [of <em>Erickson I\\, </em>if the truth of the matter is that Erickson\u2019s bond in DC 01-055 was never revoked, the district the court [sic] would be correct that he was not incarcerated on that charge after his release on July 25,2002, and he need not receive credit for such time served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">It is the opinion of the court that he need not and should not be given credit for time served from September 18th [2002] because he was in custody from that date on the 02 charge of operating a clandestine lab.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">And, in its January 26, 2006 Order, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">That on Case No. DC 01-055, that the Defendant\u2019s Bail <em>was not formally revoked </em>on September 19, 2002, and therefore the Defendant shall not be given credit for time served in jail on Case No. DC 01-055 for days served in jail beginning September 19, 2002. The Court FURTHER FINDS that the Defendant was not surrendered by his Bondsman to the Dawson County Sheriffs Department -until after the Defendant was arrested on Case No. DC 02-048. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u00b623  Consequently, we hold that the 467 days Erickson served following his arrest on September 19, 2002, until his sentencing on December 19, 2003, was directly related to the clandestine lab charge (DC 02-048) and only incidentally related to the possession charge (DC 01-055). Hence, the District Court was correct in crediting Erickson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>with 467 days served in DC 02-048 and refusing to credit him a second time in DC 01-055 for the 467 days he served awaiting trial on the charges in DC 02-048.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b624 As the State points out in its brief on appeal, the District Court\u2019s ruling was consistent with Erickson\u2019s plea agreement, which stated that Erickson \u201cwill be given credit for time served awaiting trial in DC 02-048, i.e., credit for time served from the date of his arrest on the unlawful operation of clandestine lab charge to the time of sentencing.\u201d Furthermore, at the January 5,2006 sentencing hearing after remand, the District Court specifically noted on the record that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">had it not been for the plea bargain agreement Mr. Erickson would have received a substantially harsher sentence than what was actually imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Looking back at this, I guess I wish I had not followed the plea agreement and imposed something considerably more stringent on this defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">To impose a statutory duty on the sentencing court to apply an additional 457 days credit in DC 01-055 in addition to the 457 days credit for time served in DC 02-048 not only undermines the plea agreement, but results in a substantially different sentence than what was contemplated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b625  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining credit for time served in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
