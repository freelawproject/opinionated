We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate the parent-child relationship between R.P. and M.P. constitute an abuse of discretion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">\u00b64 M.P. tested positive for marijuana on June 23, 2006-the day he was born. M.P.\u2019s mother admitted drug use during her pregnancy and an on-going addiction to methamphetamine. The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) removed M.P. and placed him in foster care a few days after his birth. The Department placed M. P. with his maternal grandmother in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">\u00b65 The Department petitioned the District Court for immediate protection and emergency protective services five days after M.P.\u2019s birth. The District Court adjudicated M.P. as a youth in need of care on July 25, 2006. M.P.\u2019s mother relinquished her parental rights two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">\u00b66 M.P.\u2019s father, R.P., was incarcerated at the time of his son\u2019s birth. The Department filed a petition to terminate R.P.\u2019s parental rights in October of 2006. The Department moved for an order dismissing the petition to terminate after learning that R.P. had a parole hearing scheduled for November 30,2006. The Department re-filed the petition after determining that R.P. had failed to obtain parole and would remain ineligible for parole for at least another year.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing regarding the termination of R.P.\u2019s parental rights on April 24,2007. Jacqui Poe (Poe), a community social worker with the Department, testified at the hearing. Poe confirmed that the Department had placed M.P. with his maternal grandmother shortly after his birth. Poe highlighted the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>attachment needs of infants during their formative years. Poe testified that M.P.\u2019s early placement created an important caregiver attachment between M.P. and his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b68 Poe testified that the combination of M.P.\u2019s infancy and R.P.\u2019s incarceration prevented regular contact between the child and his father. Poe addressed R.P.\u2019s efforts concerning his parent-child relationship with M.P. R.P. had provided no child support. R.P.\u2019s incarceration prevented him from visiting his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b69 Poe asserted that parents who are interested in creating a relationship with their child usually make efforts to contact the Department. Poe testified that a request for pictures that came through R.P.\u2019s counsel comprised R.P.\u2019s only effort to contact the Department. Poe informed the court that the Department considered R.P.\u2019s incarcerated state to constitute abandonment under \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b610 R.P. also testified at the termination hearing. R.P. informed the court that he had recently enrolled in an anger management course. He testified that he also had signed up for a parenting class. R.P. asserted that Poe had made no efforts to contact him. R.P. stated that, with regard to contacting the Department concerning M.P., \u201cI assumed everything I had to do would be through [counsel] ....\u201d R.P. concluded by asking the court to give him the opportunity to support and parent M.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b611 The District Court terminated R.P.\u2019s parental rights in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order entered on June 4, 2007. The court found that the child \u201cwill have been in foster placement for more than 15 of the most recent 22 months before the father will be eligible for parole in November 2007 ....\u201d The court determined, therefore, that a presumption existed that the child\u2019s best interests required termination of R.P.\u2019s parental rights. The court found that R.P. \u201cfailed to present any credible evidence at the hearing that controverts this presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b612 The District Court took note of R.P.\u2019s criminal history, citing his seven prior felonies and four prior revocations. The court noted R.P.\u2019s parole denial in November of 2006, and the fact that R.P. would not become eligible for parole again until November of 2007. The court found that R.P. had to serve approximately three more years in prison. The court found that \u201cthe condition rendering the father unfit-his imprisonment-is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b613 The cotut also found that R.P. had a history of voluntary underemployment, \u201cdespite [R.P.\u2019s] assertion that he wishes to support M.P.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The court found that R.P. had failed to establish a substantial relationship with his son by failing to visit or have regular contact with M.P. The court determined that R.P. had failed to manifest an ability to assume legal and physical custody of M.P. due to his incarceration. The court found that R.P. had abandoned M.P. due to R.P.\u2019s incarceration, as well as the testimony of both Poe and R.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b614 The court noted that R.P.\u2019s incarceration would continue for more than one year. The court accepted Poe\u2019s testimony that M.P. required immediate permanent placement to meet his developmental, cognitive, and psychological stability needs. The court found that R.P.\u2019s incarceration prevented him from providing an immediate permanent placement. Accordingly, the court found that \u201creunification with the father is not in M.P.\u2019s best interests because of M.P.\u2019s placement with his maternal grandmother, his age, and his needs.\u201d The court concluded that the Department did not need to provide R.P. with a treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b615 The District Court ultimately concluded that the Department, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, had established the statutory criteria for terminating R.P.\u2019s parental rights by clear and convincing evidence. The court terminated the parent-child relationship of R.P. and M.P. in order to serve \u201cthe best interests of M.P.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re D.B., 2007 </em>MT 246, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 240, \u00b6 16, 168 P.3d 691, \u00b6 16. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to perform a substantial injustice. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 18. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the law. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of A.P., 2007 </em>MT 297, \u00b6 28, 340 Mont. 39, \u00b6 28, 172 P.3d 105, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b618 R.P. argues that the District Court improperly relied on the presumption in favor of termination set forth in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA. The State concedes that the presumption found in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, does not apply, but argues that the District Court properly terminated R.P.\u2019s parental rights on alternative grounds. The State argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the District Court\u2019s reference to the presumption provided in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, constitutes harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b619 Parents have a fundamental liberty interest in their right to the care and custody of their children that requires protection through fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re </em>D.B., \u00b6 17. We have held that the district court must address adequately the applicable statutory requirements before terminating parental rights. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 17. Section 41-3-609, MCA, sets forth the substantive criteria concerning the termination of a parent-child legal relationship. A district court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights if it finds that the State has established any one of the conditions listed in the statute. Section 41-3-609(1), MCA; <em>In the Matter of S.T., </em>2008 MT 19, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19, 341 Mont. 176, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19, 176 P.3d 1054, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19. The court must find that the State has established the condition by clear and convincing evidence. Section 41-3-609(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b620 Section 41-3-604(1), MCA, establishes a presumption that termination of a parent-child relationship is in a child\u2019s best interests if the child \u201chas been in foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months ....\u201d Although \u00a7 41-3-604, MCA, establishes a presumption regarding a child\u2019s best interests, the provision primarily concerns the State\u2019s obligation to file a petition to terminate parental rights. Indeed, we recently have confirmed that the \u201c \u2018presumption in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, neither eliminates the substantive requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, nor diminishes the clear and convincing burden of proof on the party seeking termination of parental rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>In re B.H., </em>2001 MT 288, \u00b6 29, 307 Mont. 412, \u00b6 29, 37 P.3d 736, \u00b6 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b621 The District Court affirmatively found that a presumption existed that terminating R.P.\u2019s parental rights would best serve M.P.\u2019s interests due to the fact that M.P. \u201cwill have been in foster placement for more than 15 of the most recent 22 months before the father will be eligible for parole ....\u201d The court referenced this presumption twice in its findings of fact and found that the father had failed to controvert the presumption. Section 41-3-604(1), MCA, provides that a presumption in favor of termination exists only \u201c[i]f a child has been in foster care ...\u201d for 15 of the most recent 22 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b622 The State concedes that no presumption existed in this case because M.P. had not yet remained in foster care for the requisite length of time. We note that in addition to finding that a presumption in favor of termination exists, the District Court advanced factual findings pertaining to conditions that support termination under \u00a7 41-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>3-609, MCA. We recently have reaffirmed that a district court properly terminates parental rights if it correctly relies upon \u201cany one basis....\u201d <em>In the Matter of S.T., </em>\u00b6 15. Accordingly, we determine only whether any one of the bases asserted by the District Court under \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, supports the termination of R.P.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b623 Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, provides that a court may order termination if a child constitutes a youth in need of care and (1) the parent has not complied with an appropriate treatment plan, and (2) the condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The statute absolves the State from providing a treatment plan if the parent \u201cis or will be incarcerated for more than 1 year and reunification of the child with the parent is not in the best interests of the child because of the child\u2019s circumstances ....\u201d Section 41-3-609(4), MCA. The statute also specifically directs the district court to consider a parent\u2019s history of violent behavior and \u201cpresent judicially ordered long-term confinement ...\u201d when determining whether the condition rendering the parent unfit is likely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b624 The District Court noted that the court previously had adjudicated M.P. as a youth in need of care. The District Court found that R.P. would remain incarcerated for more than one year. The court specifically found that reunification would not serve M.P.\u2019s best interests due to M.P.\u2019s age and his developmental, cognitive, and psychological needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b625 The District Court noted R.P.\u2019s extensive criminal history, his recent parole denial, and his ineligibility for another parole hearing until November of 2007. Accordingly, the court determined that the condition rendering R.P. 'unfit to parent, his incarceration, was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The District Court\u2019s factual findings reveal that the court relied on \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, as one basis under the statute warranting termination of R.P.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b626  A district court also may terminate a putative father\u2019s rights if the father fails to contribute to the support of a child for an aggregate period of one year when able to do so, or if the father fails to establish a substantial relationship with the child. Sections 41-3-609(l)(e) and 41-3-423(3)(a)-(b), MCA. A putative father may demonstrate a substantial relationship with his child by having regular contact with the child or the agency having the care and custody of the child and by \u201cmanifesting an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child ...\u201d if the other parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>does not have physical custody of the child. Section 41-3-423(3)(b)(ii)-(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b627 The District Court found that R.P. failed to \u201cpresent any testimony or evidence indicating that he had actually supported, established a relationship or had any contact with his son, M.P.\u201d The court also found that R.P. had a history of voluntary underemployment despite his assertions that he wished to support M.P. The court noted that neither R.P., nor M.P.\u2019s biological mother, presently maintained physical custody of the child, and found that R.P. had failed to manifest an ability to assume legal and physical custody of M.P. The court concluded that R.P., as a putative father, had failed to support and establish a relationship with M.P. as outlined under \u00a7 41-3-423(3)(a)-(b), MCA. Thus, the court found that R.P. satisfied another condition for termination listed under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b628  The District Court\u2019s factual findings and conclusions of law demonstrate that the court did not rely on the presumption in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, when terminating R.P.\u2019s parental rights. Although the District Court twice mentioned the presumption, the factual findings and conclusions of law entered by the District Court speak directly to the criteria listed in \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, and specifically address the best interests of M.P. The record demonstrates that the District Court conscientiously employed its judgment and did not exceed the bounds of reason when it terminated R.P.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b629 We recognize the significant limitations that an incarcerated father faces when trying to establish a relationship with his infant child. We also note, however, that \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609 and 41-3-423, MCA, generally accommodate incarcerated individuals. Section 41-3-423(3), MCA, for example, employs language that accounts for putative fathers burdened by physical or financial limitations. The statute generally requires only that putative fathers make those efforts available under the circumstances. Section 41-3-423(3), MCA. The District Court\u2019s factual findings demonstrate that R.P. failed to take even those opportunities that remained available to him during his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b630 The District Court\u2019s consideration of R.P.\u2019s incarcerated state does not diminish the State\u2019s burden of affirmatively establishing the criteria found in \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re D.B., </em>\u00b6 18. Likewise, district courts must continue to give primary consideration to the best interests of the child. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 24, 339 Mont. 28, \u00b6 24, 168 P.3d 629, \u00b6 24. We note only that the provisions governing the termination of a parent-child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>relationship necessarily consider a parent\u2019s behavior and his or her efforts of parental support and care. Sections 41-3-609 and 41-3-423, MCA. The statutes specifically direct district courts to consider long-term confinement and incarceration lasting more than one year. Sections 41-3-609(2)(d) and (4)(c), MCA. Furthermore, we have recognized that \u201ca child may need help while a parent is incarcerated and that such help cannot be delayed pending the parent\u2019s release.\u201d <em>Matter of D.G., </em>244 Mont. 17, 21, 795 P.2d 489, 491 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b631  The District Court made specific factual findings concerning M.P.\u2019s best interests and the criteria set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. The District Court concluded that the State had established by clear and convincing evidence that terminating R.P.\u2019s parental rights served M.P.\u2019s best interests. We determine that the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate R.P.\u2019s parental rights did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
