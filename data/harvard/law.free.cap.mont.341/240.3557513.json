Later that evening, Sanchez turned himself in to law enforcement and admitted shooting Aleasha. The State charged Sanchez with deliberate homicide for Aleasha\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b68 Before trial, Sanchez moved to exclude a note the State proposed to offer as a trial exhibit. The note read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">To whom it concerns:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">On July 8, 04 around 10:30 p [sic] Raul Sanchez Cardines told me if I ever was cought [sic] with another man while I was dating him, that he would kill me. Raul told me he had friends in Mexico that had medicine that would kill me and our doctors wouldn\u2019t know what it was till it was to [sic] late and I would be dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">So if I unexspetly [sic] become sick and on the edge of death, and perhaps I die no [sic] you will have some answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">Aleasha Chenowith (written and printed signature)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u00b69 Sanchez argued that the note should be excluded because it contained inadmissible multiple hearsay and would also violate his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The District Court denied Sanchez\u2019s motion and ruled that Aleasha\u2019s note was admissible as a statement under belief of impending death, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(2). The District Court concluded that Sanchez\u2019s statements within the note were admissible as either a statement against interest, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), or as a statement describing Sanchez\u2019s then existing state of mind, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 803(3). The District Court did not address Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim. Sanchez\u2019s jury trial began on June 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">\u00b610 At trial, Sanchez testified that he and Aleasha had been dating for approximately four-and-a-half months and that he had contemplated marrying Aleasha. However, Sanchez became suspicious that Aleasha was cheating on him with Angel, one of Sanchez\u2019s co-workers. On July 19, 2004, Sanchez confronted Angel, who confirmed Sanchez\u2019s suspicions. Sanchez testified that when he later spoke with Aleasha, she threatened to create problems for him with law enforcement so that Sanchez would ultimately have his children taken away from him. According to Sanchez, he felt as though \u201csomething got dark in [his] head[,]\u201d and he shot Aleasha several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">\u00b611 At trial, the State introduced several statements that Aleasha made to others before her death. In addition to the note, the State elicited testimony about other instances in which Sanchez purportedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>threatened Aleasha. Pamela Ehrlich testified that Aleasha told her about an argument she had with Sanchez. According to Ehrlich\u2019s testimony, during the argument Sanchez stated, \u201cMe love you, [Aleasha]. Me not love you that much. You cross me, I kill you.\u201d The District Court overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection. Leann Chenowith, Aleasha\u2019s sister, testified that Aleasha told her that \u201cif [Aleasha] ever made [Sanchez] mad ... he had stuff in Mexico that his friend could give him, and that it would eat her stomach in a matter of days.\u201d This statement was also admitted over Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b612 During closing arguments, the prosecutor argued that the jury could convict Sanchez of mitigated deliberate homicide only if the jury found that Sanchez\u2019s <em>response </em>to extreme emotional distress was reasonable, rather than that his <em>explanation </em>for the extreme emotional distress was reasonable. Defense counsel objected that the prosecutor was misinterpreting the jury instructions, and the District Court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b613 Sanchez objected throughout the proceedings to the mitigated deliberate homicide jury instruction because the instruction stated that mitigated deliberate homicide was a \u201clesser included offense\u201d of deliberate homicide. Sanchez argued that the instruction allowed the jurors to indirectly consider sentencing factors in their deliberations. The District Court overruled Sanchez\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b614 The jury convicted Sanchez of deliberate homicide, and the District Court sentenced Sanchez to life without parole in Montana State Prison. Sanchez appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, \u00b6 8, 127 P.3d 458, \u00b6 8. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employing conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 72, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6 72, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 72. We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 8. In criminal cases, we review jury instructions in their entirety to determine if they fully and fairly presented the applicable law to the jury. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6 57, 306 Mont. 389, \u00b6 57, 34 P.3d 487, \u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b616 I. Did the District Court improperly allow Aleasha\u2019s statements to be introduced over Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objections?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b617 \u201cHearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d within the statement. M. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is inadmissible \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by statute, these rules [of evidence], or other rules applicable in the courts of this state.\u201d M. R. Evid. 802. Sanchez asserts that the District Court erred when it admitted, over hearsay objections, Aleasha\u2019s statements to her sister, Aleasha\u2019s statements to her neighbor, and Aleasha\u2019s note. According to Sanchez, these three statements contain double hearsay and thus, to be admissible, must comply with the multiple-hearsay rule, which requires that all instances of hearsay within a statement conform to a hearsay exception. M. R. Evid. 805. We note at the outset that these three statements contain only one level of hearsay. Montana Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if: ... (2) Admission by party-opponent. The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or a representative capacity ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">(Paragraph breaks omitted.) Thus, the statements attributable to Sanchez are exempt from the hearsay definition; they are not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>A. Aleasha\u2019s statement to her sister</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A93\">\u00b618 Leann Chenowith testified that Aleasha told her that Sanchez had threatened that \u201cif [Aleasha] ever made [Sanchez] mad... he had stuff in Mexico that his friend could give him, and that it would eat her stomach in a matter of days.\u201d The District Court overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection without stating a specific rationale. Sanchez argues that no hearsay exception applies to this statement and that the District Court erred in admitting the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b619  We conclude that the District Court correctly overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection to Leann Chenowith\u2019s testimony because the statement falls outside the hearsay definition. Though Aleasha made the statement outside the courtroom, the record reveals no indication that the State sought to prove that Sanchez actually could obtain poison from acquaintances in Mexico. The State may have offered the statement to show a pattern of threats or that Sanchez contemplated killing Aleasha; however, these rationales are not objectionable on hearsay grounds. The District Court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection because the State did not offer the statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and thus, the statement was not hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\n<em>B. Aleasha\u2019s statement to her neighbor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5u\">\u00b620 Pamela Ehrlich testified that Aleasha told her that, during an argument, Sanchez stated, \u201c[m]e love you, [Aleasha]. Me not love you that much. You cross me, I kill you.\u201d The District Court again overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection without stating a specific rationale. Sanchez argues that no hearsay exception applies to this statement and that the District Court erred in admitting the statement. The State apparently combines its arguments relating to the statements of Aleasha\u2019s neighbor and Aleasha\u2019s sister and responds that Aleasha\u2019s statements could be admissible as excited utterances, present sense impressions, or statements made under a belief of impending death. Alternatively, the State argues that if the District Court erred its error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b621 Our review of the record convinces us that the hearsay exceptions proposed by the State are inapplicable to this statement. The \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d hearsay exception applies to statements made \u201cwhile the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.\u201d M. R. Evid. 803(1). Ehrlich\u2019s testimony reveals that Aleasha\u2019s statement recounted a threat Sanchez made the prior evening. Thus, Aleasha\u2019s statement described an event that she \u201cperceived\u201d the prior evening, rather than a \u201cpresent sense impression.\u201d The \u201cexcited utterance\u201d hearsay exception applies to statements \u201crelating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d M. R. Evid. 803(2). Ehrlich testified that Aleasha seemed unconcerned by Sanchez\u2019s threat and that Aleasha remarked, \u201c[Sanchez] was nothing more than a dumb little Mexican. He ain\u2019t got the balls to do nothing.\u201d Aleasha\u2019s comments indicate that she lacked the \u201cstress of excitement\u201d necessary to implicate the excited utterance exception. Similarly, we conclude that the \u201cstatement under belief of impending death\u201d hearsay exception is inapplicable because Aleasha\u2019s comments indicate that she did not make the statement \u201cwhile believing that [her] death was imminent,\u201d and her statement did not concern \u201cthe cause or circumstance of what [she] believed to be impending death.\u201d M. R. Evid. 804(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b622 Though no exceptions apply to Aleasha\u2019s hearsay statement, we agree with the State that the District Court committed harmless error because the State presented other admissible evidence that proved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>same facts as the hearsay evidence. We apply the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test to determine whether a district court\u2019s trial error is harmless. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 43, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 43, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 43. Under the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test, we consider a trial error harmless if the State demonstrates that the \u201cfact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence and, qualitatively, by comparison, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we abandoned the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test, which emphasized the quantity of admissible evidence proving guilt, in favor of the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test, which focuses on the qualitative impact the inadmissible evidence may have on the fact-finder. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b623 Sanchez testified that his suspicions of Aleasha\u2019s infidelity were confirmed on Monday morning, July 19, 2004, when Angel, a coworker, admitted sleeping with Aleasha. Sanchez testified that he then arranged for his daughters to sleep at a friend\u2019s house so that he and Aleasha could talk without his children present. He testified that he bagged up Aleasha\u2019s clothes and dropped them off at her house. He knocked on the door, but no one answered, and Sanchez returned to work. Sanchez testified that he recognized a vehicle outside Aleasha\u2019s house as he drove home from work and that he knew that Angel was at Aleasha\u2019s house. Sanchez testified that he retrieved his pistol from his home, went to a store and bought ammunition, and then returned to Aleasha\u2019s house. Again, no one answered the door, and Sanchez went home. When Aleasha called him that evening and asked him to come to her house, he returned to Aleasha\u2019s and parked outside her house, with the gun on the seat next to him. He testified that she came outside, they argued, and he grabbed his gun and shot her when she threatened to have his children removed from his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b624 Jason Sheehan, one of Sanchez\u2019s co-workers, testified that Sanchez mentioned during the lunch break that Sanchez was upset because Aleasha had cheated on him. Sheehan testified that Sanchez stated that he was going to go to Aleasha\u2019s house, drop off her clothes, and \u201cmaybe slap her around a little bit.\u201d Sheehan also testified that Sanchez stated that \u201cmaybe he would get out his 9 [millimeter pistol] and go shoot her.\u201d At no point did Sanchez object to Sheehan\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b625 In light of the damaging testimony from Sheehan and Sanchez, we conclude that the District Court committed harmless error in admitting Aleasha\u2019s hearsay statement. The testimony of Sanchez and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Sheehan presented the jury with cumulative evidence that proved the same facts as Aleasha\u2019s statement. Moreover, given the character of Sanchez\u2019s and Sheehan\u2019s in-court testimony, the jury was presented with evidence of deliberate homicide that qualitatively outweighed any impact that Aleasha\u2019s statement may have had on the jury. The jury heard from Aleasha\u2019s killer himself, that, after learning of Aleasha\u2019s infidelity, he made arrangements for the care of his children, he went to the store and purchased ammunition, he took the loaded gun to Aleasha\u2019s house, he waited for her to come outside, and he shot her after a brief argument. We conclude that the qualitative nature of Sanchez\u2019s testimony outweighs any qualitative impact that Aleasha\u2019s hearsay statement may have had on the jury and that no reasonable possibility exists that the hearsay statement contributed to the conviction, and thus, any error is harmless. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\n<em>C. Aleasha\u2019s note</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b626 At trial, the State offered a note written by Aleasha that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">To whom it concerns:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">On July 8, 04 around 10:30 p [sic] Raul Sanchez Cardines told me if I ever was cought [sic] with another man while I was dating him, that he would kill me. Raul told me he had friends in Mexico that had medicine that would kill me and our doctors wouldn\u2019t know what it was till it was to [sic] late and I would be dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">So if I unexspetly [sic] become sick and on the edge of death, and perhaps I die no [sic] you will have some answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">Aleasha Chenowith (written and printed signature)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Sanchez objected to the note\u2019s admission on hearsay grounds throughout the pre-trial proceedings and at trial. The District Court overruled Sanchez\u2019s hearsay objection and concluded that M. R. Evid. 804(b)(2), the hearsay exception for statements made under belief of impending death, removed Aleasha\u2019s written statements from the hearsay rule. Sanchez argues that Aleasha\u2019s note does not indicate that she feared imminent death, and thus, the District Court erred in admitting the note as a dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u00b627 We agree with Sanchez that the District Court incorrectly relied on the \u201cstatement under belief of impending death\u201d hearsay exception to admit Aleasha\u2019s note. This exception applies to statements \u201cmade by a declarant while believing that the declarant\u2019s death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstance of what the declarant believed to be impending death.\u201d M. R. Evid. 804(b)(2). Aleasha\u2019s statements that <em>\u201cif I </em>[unexpectedly] become sick\u201d and <em>\u201cperhaps </em>I die\u201d indicate that she viewed her death as neither certain nor imminent. (Emphases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b628 However, as with Ehrlich\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling constituted harmless error. As discussed in \u00b6 19, the statements relating to Sanchez\u2019s Mexico connections fall outside the hearsay definition because the State did not offer the statements to prove that Sanchez actually could obtain poison from sources in Mexico. Sanchez\u2019s threat that he would kill Aleasha if she committed adultery presents the only questionable portion of Aleasha\u2019s note. The threat\u2019s substance essentially mirrors Sanchez\u2019s \u201c[y]ou cross me, I kill you\u201d statement, and we conclude that this statement\u2019s admission constitutes harmless error for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b629 The testimony of Sheehan and Sanchez presented the jury with cumulative evidence that proved the same facts that Aleasha\u2019s note sought to prove. Further the qualitative nature of their testimony outweighs any qualitative impact that Aleasha\u2019s hearsay statement may have had on the jury; we can conceive of no evidence more qualitatively damning than Sanchez\u2019s narration of the day he killed Aleasha. Further, Sheehan\u2019s account of Sanchez\u2019s lunchtime comment that \u201cmaybe he would get out his 9 and go shoot [Aleasha]\u201d confirmed that Sanchez contemplated killing Aleasha shortly after learning of her transgression. In light of the evidence presented by Sanchez\u2019s and Sheehan\u2019s testimony, we conclude that no reasonable possibility exists that the statement in the note contributed to Sanchez\u2019s conviction, and thus, any error is harmless. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b630 II. Did the introduction of Aleasha\u2019s note violate Sanchez\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b631 Sanchez claims that the District Court violated his constitutional right to confrontation under both the United States and Montana Constitutions when it admitted Aleasha\u2019s note as evidence. Sanchez argues that the note was \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay and thus was inadmissible unless the court found (1) that the declarant was unavailable, and (2) that there was a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Though Sanchez concedes Aleasha\u2019s unavailability, he asserts that he had no opportunity to question her about the note.</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">\u00b632 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees criminal defendants the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them. The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay. <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822-826, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 2274-75 (2006). Testimonial hearsay statements are inadmissible unless the declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1374 (2004). The Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Crawford </em>that the Sixth Amendment mandates that a testimonial statement\u2019s reliability be tested \u201cin the crucible of cross-examination[,]\u201d not left to the \u201cvagaries of the rules of evidence ....\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S. Ct. at 1370. Additionally, Montana\u2019s Constitution grants a defendant the right to \u201cmeet the witnesses against him face to face ....\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. This provision clarifies that full cross-examination is a critical aspect of the confrontation right. <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221 \u00b6 22, 290 Mont. 479, \u00b6 22, 964 P.2d 766, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b633 Sanchez argues that Aleasha\u2019s note, documenting the date and time of Sanchez\u2019s alleged statement and the substance of his threat, is testimonial because it bears similarities to an affidavit. Additionally, Sanchez equates Aleasha\u2019s note with Lord Cobham\u2019s infamous letter, discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford, </em>that implicated Sir Walter Raleigh for treason. 541 U.S. at 44-45, 124 S. Ct. at 1360. The State argues that the note is non-testimonial because it reflects \u201can intent to direct attention (possibly only medical attention) to the reasons for any suspicious illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b634 Though the United States Supreme Court has declined to comprehensively define \u201ctestimonial,\u201d it has supplied a consistent starting point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">[The Confrontation Clause] applies to \u201cwitnesses\u201d against the accused-in other words, those who \u201cbear testimony.\u201d [1] N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828). \u201cTestimony,\u201d in turn, is typically \u201c[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S. Ct. at 1364; <em>see also Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S. Ct. at 2274. Thus, to determine whether a witness bears testimony, the Court finds significant the statement\u2019s purpose, the statement\u2019s context, and the audience the statement is intended to reach. In <em>Davis, </em>the Court seemingly retreated from its earlier pronouncements that \u201cstatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are... testimonial under even a narrow standard\u201d and that \u201c[w]hatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum to... police interrogations.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1364, 1374. The <em>Davis </em>Court concluded that whether or not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>statement made to police officers during an interrogation is testimonial hinges on the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose: if the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose is to \u201cestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution[,]\u201d the statement is testimonial; if the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose is to \u201cenable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergencyt,]\u201d the statement is non-testimonial. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 821-24, 126 S. Ct. at 2273-74. As the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Davis </em>illustrates, the Court finds no particular inquiry dispositive in determining whether a statement is testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">\u00b635 In <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>we discussed what constitutes a testimonial statement. In general, a declarant\u2019s statements are presumed testimonial if they are knowingly made to a police officer or government agent. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. A statement is presumed non-testimonial, however, if the declarant had \u201cobjective reason to believe\u201d that the statement served only \u201cto avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger\u201d and the agent receiving the statement lacked intent to create evidence. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. A statement made to a nongovernmental agent is non-testimonial -unless the declarant had \u201cclear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant....\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. Thus, though we declined to formulate a comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d we recognized that certain presumptions arise depending on the intended audience and the purpose of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">\u00b636 In our <em>Mizenko </em>discussion we also found significant a statement\u2019s context, and we looked to whether a declarant reasonably should expect that the State would use the declarant\u2019s statements at trial. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-21. We noted the Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of \u201ca casual remark to an acquaintance\u201d as non-testimonial, <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S. Ct. at 1364, and we explained that the word \u201c\u2018casual\u2019... modifies the declarant\u2019s assumption as to what use, if any, the listener might make of the statement.\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 17. If an objective declarant reasonably would expect the State to use the declarant\u2019s statements at trial, then, absent an opportunity for confrontation, the Sixth Amendment bars the admissibility of such statements. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 17. Further, we recognized that a statement\u2019s characterization as testimonial did not depend on government involvement in the declarant\u2019s making the statement: \u201c \u2018Thus, if just before trial a person shoved a written statement under the courthouse door, asserting that the accused did in fact commit the crime, that would plainly be testimonial even though no government official played a role in preparing the statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Richard D. Friedman, <em>The Confrontation Clause Re-Rooted and Transformed, </em>2004 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 439, 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b637 Aleasha addressed her note \u201c[t]o whom it concerns[.]\u201d Her stated reason for -writing the note was that \u201cif I unexspetly [sic] become sick and on the edge of death, and perhaps I die no [sic] you will have some answers.\u201d The note\u2019s substance indicates that the note\u2019s purpose was to explain her untimely death or poisoning, not to prevent or mitigate future harm. Aleasha\u2019s short note named the person she suspected would kill her and the method he threatened to use. In essence, Aleasha\u2019s note contained information that could establish or prove facts to answer questions regarding how, why, and by whom she had been harmed or killed. The State\u2019s contention that the purpose of Aleasha\u2019s note may have been to \u201cdirect attention (possibly only medical attention) to the reasons for any suspicious illness[,]\u201d completely ignores the accusatory nature of the note (as does Justice Rice\u2019s concurrence): in a nine-line note, Aleasha documented the date and time that Sanchez threatened her, she named Sanchez as her suspected killer, she described Sanchez\u2019s motive, and she described his threatened method of execution. Though Aleasha did not address her note specifically to police officers, the note\u2019s substance and its comprehensive salutation indicate that it reasonably included law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b638 Moreover, the circumstances surrounding Aleasha\u2019s note indicate that it bears little similarity to a non-testimonial \u201ccasual remark to an acquaintance.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S. Ct. at 1364. Rather, the circumstances indicate that an objective declarant would reasonably expect the State to make use of her statement: Aleasha memorialized Sanchez\u2019s threat by writing it down on a piece of paper from a yellow legal pad; she used a formal salutation on the note: \u201c[t]o whom it concerns:\u201d; the note asserted that Sanchez had already committed a crime-threatening Aleasha; the note asserted that Sanchez contemplated a future crime-killing Aleasha; and she formally ended her note by both printing and signing her name. Additionally, though Aleasha did not \u201cshove a written statement under the courthouse door,\u201d she did leave the note in a location that an officer investigating her death could easily find it; the officer testified that he found the note on Aleasha\u2019s kitchen counter with her bills and correspondence. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 19. We conclude that Aleasha\u2019s note was testimonial because the purpose of the note was to explain Aleasha\u2019s untimely death or poisoning, the intended audience reasonably included law enforcement, and the circumstances surrounding the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>indicate that an objective declarant reasonably should have anticipated that the State would make use of the statements at trial. Our conclusion that Aleasha\u2019s note was testimonial, however, does not end our analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b639 Though the Supreme Court held in <em>Crawford </em>that the Confrontation Clause mandates cross-examination to assess a testimonial statement\u2019s reliability, the Court nonetheless acknowledged that exceptions to the Confrontation Clause exist. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S. Ct. at 1370. The Court cited the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine as one such exception: \u201cthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of determining reliability.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S. Ct. at 1370. In <em>Davis, </em>the Court again referenced the equitable doctrine, stating that \u201cone who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 833, 126 S. Ct. at 2280.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b640 As this case presents our first opportunity to consider the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine since the <em>Crawford </em>decision, other jurisdictions\u2019 <em>post-Crawford </em>decisions aid our analysis. To the extent that it applies to an admitted and intentional killing, we find persuasive the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>U.S. v. Garcia-Meza, </em>403 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>F.3d 364 (6th Cir. 2005). In <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of murdering his wife after hearing testimony from law enforcement officers describing the wife\u2019s hearsay statements concerning a prior assault. At trial, the defendant admitted killing his wife, but argued that her murder was not premeditated. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 367. On appeal, Garcia-Meza claimed that his right to confrontation was violated when his wife\u2019s hearsay statements were admitted into evidence. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 369. The Sixth Circuit disagreed and held that Garcia-Meza had forfeited his right to confrontation because his wrongdoing caused her unavailability. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370 (citing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S. Ct. at 1370; <em>Reynolds v. U.S., </em>98 U.S. 145, 158-59, 25 L. Ed. 244, 248 (1879) (\u201cThe rule has its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d)). The Sixth Circuit noted that no dispute existed as to whether the defendant killed his wife; the dispute centered, rather, on whether the defendant acted with premeditation. Thus, the court reasoned, because the defendant was responsible for the declarant\u2019s unavailability, he forfeited his right to confrontation. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b641 The Sixth Circuit specifically rejected Garcia-Meza\u2019s argument that the forfeiture doctrine applies only when the defendant has committed wrongdoing with the intent to prevent the witness from testifying. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370. The court stated that the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmation of the forfeiture doctrine\u2019s equitable basis \u201cstrongly suggests that the rule\u2019s applicability does not hinge on the wrongdoer\u2019s motive.\u201d <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370. The court further reasoned that a defendant would benefit if his wrongdoing prevented a witness from testifying against him, regardless of whether or not that was his intent. The Sixth Circuit held that the rule of forfeiture, based on equitable principles, permits no such result. <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b642 The Sixth Circuit decided <em>Garcia-Meza </em>in the interim between the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>decisions. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court further clarified the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine. In response to the contention that domestic violence cases require more flexibility regarding testimonial evidence, the Court reiterated that the doctrine operates to extinguish \u201cconfrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 833, 126 S. Ct. at 2280 (citations omitted). The Court noted that domestic violence crimes are particularly prone to victim intimidation and coercion to prevent the victim from testifying, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">[W]hen defendants seek to undermine the judicial process by procuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims, the Sixth Amendment does not require courts to acquiesce. While defendants have no duty to assist the State in proving their guilt, they <em>do </em>have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 831-34, 126 S. Ct. at 2279-80. The Court farther stated that Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6) codifies the forfeiture doctrine. Though primarily dicta, <em>the Davis </em>discussion of the forfeiture doctrine and the Court\u2019s statement that Rule 804(b)(6) \u201ccodifies\u201d the doctrine has generally been interpreted by lower courts to require a defendant\u2019s intent to silence a witness by wrongdoing before applying the doctrine. <em>E.g. Colorado v. Moreno, </em>160 P.3d 242, 245-46 (Colo. 2007) (collecting cases and noting that \u201cthe clear consensus in non-murder cases is that the doctrine requires a showing of an intent on the part of the defendant to prevent the declarant from testifying at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b643 Though the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the forfeiture doctrine in <em>Davis </em>seemingly casts doubt on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>other jurisdictions\u2019 post <em>-Davis </em>decisions concur with the Sixth Circuit that, in homicide cases, the doctrine\u2019s applicability does not depend on whether the defendant intended to silence a witness. For example, in <em>California v. Giles, </em>a murder case, the California Supreme Court held that an \u201cintent-to-silence\u201d element is not a prerequisite to the forfeiture doctrine\u2019s applicability. 152 P.3d 433,443 (Cal. 2007), <em>cert. </em>granted,_U.S._, 128 S.Ct. 976. The defendant in <em>Giles </em>admitted killing his girlfriend, but argued that he acted in self-defense. The California Supreme Court adopted its appellate court\u2019s reasoning that \u201c[fjorfeiture is a logical extension of the equitable principle that no person should benefit from his own wrongful acts.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443. The court further reasoned that, regardless of whether a defendant specifically intended to prevent a witness from testifying, \u201c[a] defendant whose intentional criminal act renders a witness unavailable for trial benefits from his crime if he can use the witness\u2019s unavailability to exclude damaging hearsay statements by the witness that would otherwise be admissible.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\u00b644 The California Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that language from <em>Davis </em>discussing the forfeiture doctrine-\u2018\u201cwhen defendants <em>seek </em>to undermine the judicial process by procuring or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>coercing silence from witnesses and victims\u201d\u2019-supported an intent-to-silence requirement. <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443 n. 5 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 833, 126 S. Ct. at 2280). Rather, the court stated that the Supreme Court simply was describing traditional witness tampering cases in a domestic violence context. <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443 n. 5. The California court considered it more significant that the Supreme Court reaffirmed the forfeiture doctrine\u2019s equitable nature and clarified that <em>Crawford </em>did not destroy a court\u2019s ability to protect the integrity of its proceedings. <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443 n. 5. The <em>Giles </em>court concluded that applying the forfeiture doctrine without an intent-to-silence requirement was proper to protect the integrity of a court\u2019s proceeding: \u201ccourts should be able to further the truth-seeking function of the adversary process when necessary, allowing fact finders access to relevant evidence that the defendant caused not to be available through live testimony.\u201d <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b645 Even jurisdictions that impose an intent-to-silence requirement on the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine recognize that homicide cases may present an exception. For example, in <em>Illinois v. Stechly, </em>the Illinois Supreme Court left open the possibility of a homicide exception though it determined that the above-quoted language from <em>Davis </em>\u201cstrongly connotes a requirement of intent.\u201d 870 N.E.2d 333, 350-53 (Ill. 2007) (plurality). The <em>Stechly </em>court declined to apply the forfeiture doctrine to a sexual abuse case, absent evidence showing that the defendant intended to prevent the witness from testifying, and noted that outside the context of murder cases, the authorities uniformly require proof of intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Stechly, </em>870 N.E.2d at 353 (plurality). The court distinguished the majority of cases, which hold that intent is irrelevant, as either predating <em>Davis </em>or as involving the defendant\u2019s murdering the witness. <em>Stechly, </em>870 N.E.2d at 351-52 (plurality). The Illinois court further noted that jurisdictions that did not impose an intent-to-silence requirement in murder cases feasibly were reconcilable with the general rule requiring intent. Summarizing the reasoning of those cases, the Illinois court stated that those jurisdictions essentially hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">[T]he prosecution need not <em>prove </em>that the defendant committed murder with the intent of procuring the victim\u2019s absence. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>consistent with presuming such intent when the wrongdoing at issue is murder. When a defendant commits murder, notwithstanding any protestation that he did not specifically intend to procure the victim\u2019s inability to testify at a subsequent trial, he will nonetheless be sure that this would be a result of his actions. Murder is, in this sense, different from any other wrongdoing in which a defendant could engage with respect to a witness-more than a possibility, or a substantial likelihood, a defendant knows with absolute certainty that a murder victim will not be available to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><em>Stechly, </em>870 N.E.2d at 352-53 (plurality). Thus, the Illinois court left open the possibility that the intent to prevent a witness\u2019s testimony could be \u201cpresumed\u201d in the murder context, while otherwise requiring proof of intent. <em>Stechly, </em>870 N.E.2d at 352-53 (plurality).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b646  To the extent that a deliberate criminal act results in the victim\u2019s death, we agree that the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine does not hinge on whether the defendant specifically intended to silence a witness. The doctrine derives from the maxim that no person should benefit from the person\u2019s own wrongdoing. <em>Reynolds v. U.S., </em>98 U.S. at 158-59, 25 L. Ed. at 248; <em>Garcia-Meza, </em>403 F.3d at 370. The natural result of a deliberate killing is <em>always </em>that the victim is unavailable to testify; we agree with the <em>Giles </em>court that a defendant whose intentional criminal act results in a victim-declarant\u2019s death benefits from the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing if the defendant can use the death to exclude the victim-declarant\u2019s otherwise admissible testimony, regardless of whether the defendant specifically intended to silence the victim-declarant. <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443. Such a result undermines the judicial process and threatens the integrity of court proceedings, and though courts may not \u201cvitiate constitutional guarantees when they have the effect of allowing the guilty to go free[,]\u201d nor must they acquiesce in the destruction of the criminal-trial system\u2019s integrity. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 833, 126 S. Ct. at 2280.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b647  The facts of this case are substantially similar to those of <em>Garcia-Meza. </em>Sanchez fatally shot Aleasha, thereby rendering her unavailable as a witness. Sanchez was charged with Aleasha\u2019s homicide, and the State introduced her prior statements. No dispute exists as to whether Sanchez killed Aleasha-he admitted it to law enforcement and at trial. We need not determine whether the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing is the same act for which he was tried because the dispute at trial centered on whether mitigating circumstances existed, not on whether Sanchez killed Aleasha. We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Sanchez forfeited his Sixth Amendment right to confront Aleasha when he killed her. Moreover, Sanchez cannot claim that his Montana constitutional right to \u201cmeet the witnesses against him face to face\u201d was violated when his admittedly deliberate wrongdoing prevented such a confrontation. We emphasize the narrow holding on this issue: when a defendant admittedly and deliberately kills another person, thus procuring the person\u2019s unavailability as a witness, the defendant forfeits the constitutional rights to confront the victim at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing applies to situations in which the defendant disputes the underlying act of \u201cwrongdoing\u201d or to situations in which the wrongdoing does not result in death are issues not presented or addressed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b648 Though the District Court failed to address Sanchez\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim and based its ruling on hearsay exceptions, we cannot say the District Court reached an incorrect result. We will uphold a district court\u2019s correct decision, regardless of the stated rationale. <em>State v. Rensvold, </em>2006 MT 146, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 392, \u00b6 34, 139 P.3d 154, \u00b6 34. We conclude the District Court reached the legally correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b649 III. Did the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument deny Sanchez the right to a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b650 Sanchez asserts that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by repeatedly misstating the law regarding the elements of mitigated deliberate homicide during closing arguments and that these misstatements denied Sanchez his right to a fair trial. The State maintains that Sanchez has waived his right to appeal this issue because he failed to move the District Court for curative measures, such as a mistrial or a cautionary instruction. As Sanchez points out, however, his objection was overruled, and he had no reason to anticipate that the District Court would issue curative measures. We conclude that Sanchez\u2019s objection during closing arguments properly preserved this issue for appeal. Section 46-20-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b651 If a prosecutor\u2019s improper comments prejudice a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, then the proper remedy is reversal. <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Mont. 367, 381, 897 P.2d 1063, 1072 (1995). Though Sanchez did not move the District Court for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct, we employ the same two-step analysis we use to review a denial of such a motion: we determine first whether the prosecutor made improper comments, and, if so, whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>A. The prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeV\">\u00b652 Sanchez argues that the prosecutor repeatedly misstated the law regarding mitigated deliberate homicide during the State\u2019s closing argument and rebuttal. Specifically, Sanchez points to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that, to convict for mitigated deliberate homicide, the jury had to find that Sanchez\u2019s <em>response </em>to extreme emotional distress was reasonable, rather than that a reasonable explanation existed for his emotional distress. The prosecutor then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[t]he streets would be littered with corpses if it was reasonable to shoot somebody because they cheated on you and made you angry. Based on your own lifetime experiences you have seen that. You may have been part of it. Did you kill somebody? Did somebody kill you, your friends, other people? No. That answers the question. This is not a <em>reasonable response </em>for a person under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">(Emphasis added.) Sanchez argues that the plain language of the mitigated deliberate homicide statute indicates that \u201creasonable\u201d modifies the defendant\u2019s emotional state, not the defendant\u2019s actions. The statute provides that a person who commits a deliberate homicide, \u201cbut does so under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse\u201d has committed mitigated deliberate homicide. Section 45-5-103(1), MCA. The statute is unambiguous, and we conclude that the prosecutor misstated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b653 On appeal, the State argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks are \u201ctroubling\u201d only because they are not presented in their proper context. The State then attempts to furnish this context by directing us to two instances when the prosecutor made \u201caccurate\u201d statements of the law. The first instance the State identifies is an accurate statement of the law; however, the State has misidentified the speaker: it was Sanchez\u2019s counsel, not the prosecutor who properly stated the law on mitigated deliberate homicide. The second instance, though properly attributed to the prosecutor and an accurate statement of the law, was followed directly by an incorrect explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation. That is, <em>what would a reasonable person do, </em>not what the defendant did. The evidence in this case shows you it was not reasonable. And if it\u2019s not reasonable, there goes mitigated deliberate homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b654 The State maintains that improvising during closing arguments frequently results in imperfect syntax and less than crystal clear meaning. The comments at issue, however, demonstrate a blatant misstatement of the law, not mere inadvertence. The prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument went far beyond appropriate ad-libbing and tested the boundaries of professional ethics. We cannot accept the State\u2019s incongruous arguments in support of the prosecutor\u2019s statements, and we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>B. Prejudicial effect of improper comments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Auc\">\u00b655 Having determined that the prosecutor improperly stated the law, we must next determine whether the comments prejudiced Sanchez\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 12. We do not presume that a prosecutor\u2019s improper comments prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial; rather, Sanchez must demonstrate, from the record, that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements prejudiced him. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27. Additionally, when determining prejudicial effect, we review improper comments in the context of the entire case. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b656 Sanchez offers as evidence of prejudicial effect a note from the jury to the District Court requesting additional instructions. The note reads: \u201cYour Honor, One of our jurors has requested that you define the term \u2018reasonable.\u2019\u201d Sanchez argues that the jury\u2019s note indicates that the jury was confused by the term \u201creasonable,\u201d that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments caused this confusion, and that Sanchez\u2019s right to a fair trial was thus prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b657 The jury\u2019s note requested only that the District Court define \u201creasonable.\u201d The note did not indicate that the jury was confused as to which term \u201creasonable\u201d modified. Moreover, the jury instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide accurately conveyed \u00a7 45-5-103, MCA, which unambiguously states that \u201creasonable\u201d modifies the explanation for the extreme mental or emotional stress, not the defendant\u2019s act of causing the death of another human being. The jury additionally was presented with defense counsel\u2019s correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>interpretation of the law and the District Court\u2019s instructions on mitigated deliberate homicide. The prosecutor also informed the jury that the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments were not evidence. Before closing arguments the District Court read aloud the jury instructions and stated that the instructions \u201cconstituted] the law that [the jury] must follow in this case.\u201d American jurisprudence depends on a jury\u2019s ability to follow instructions and juries are presumed to follow the law that courts provide. <em>State v.

Sanchez asserts that this language <em>\u201cprobably </em>pushed the jurors away from fully considering [his] mitigated deliberate homicide defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sanchez argues that including the word \u201clesser\u201d in the instruction may have permitted the jury to surmise that Sanchez would receive a lesser sentence if the jury convicted him of mitigated deliberate homicide rather than of deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b661 A jury should not consider sentencing in determining a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>State v.

The jury instruction correctly stated the law. Additionally, the jury instructions, taken together, accurately set forth the State\u2019s burden of proof and the elements that the jury must find to convict Sanchez of mitigated deliberate homicide or deliberate homicide. To give a jury instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide that would alleviate Sanchez\u2019s concern would be difficult, if not impossible. If, as Sanchez argues, use of the word \u201clesser\u201d invited the jury to indirectly consider punishment, the same can be said of the word \u201cmitigated\u201d-a term defining the very essence of the described offense. The jury instructions, when viewed in their entirety, fully and fairly presented the applicable law to the jury. Moreover, Sanchez\u2019s speculation that the \u201clesser included\u201d language <em>probably </em>dissuaded the jury from a mitigated deliberate homicide verdict cannot overcome the presumption that the jury actually followed the law that the District Court provided.

Spencer, </em>2007 MT 245, 339 Mont. 227, 169 P.3d 384, for the proposition that we should consider the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of Aleasha\u2019s note itself to determine whether the note constitutes a testimonial statement. The concurrence misreads <em>Spencer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Spencer, </em>we determined that a three-and-a-half-year-old victim\u2019s statements were non-testimonial after determining that the witnesses testifying about the statements had heard the statements in their capacities as a foster parent and a counselor, rather than as state investigators. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 23. Because the statements were made to non-governmental agents, the statements were presumed non-testimonial unless the declarant had \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d that they would be used against the defendant in court. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. We concluded, however, that the \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard was unworkable when applied to a three-and-a-half-year-old victim and, relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Davis </em>decision, we looked to the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the interaction between the declarant and the witnesses because the circumstances surrounding the statements bore similarities to an interrogation. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Here, in contrast to <em>Spencer, </em>the declarant, Aleasha, was a competent adult and the circumstances bear no similarities to an interrogation. Even if the circumstances were akin to an interrogation, the proper focus would be on the primary purpose of the interrogation or interaction, not, as the concurrence suggests, on the primary purpose of the statement itself. Moreover, though we concluded in <em>Spencer </em>that the declarant\u2019s age made the <em>Mizenko </em>presumptions unworkable, those presumptions were nonetheless initially implicated and necessitated the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d analysis; no presumptions are implicated in this case.

Opinion, \u00b6 28. While I agree with the outcome of the Court\u2019s decision, I write separately to urge the adoption of the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u00b666 Forfeiture by wrongdoing, as this Court accepts, is an equitable concept that prevents an individual from benefiting from his own wrongful actions. Opinion, \u00b6 47. In fact, Montana law generally codifies the equitable principle in \u00a7 1-3-208, MCA (2005), which states that \u201c[n]o one can take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d While the Montana Rules of Evidence are silent regarding the forfeiture doctrine\u2019s relation to hearsay, the principle has been codified in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Federal Rules of Evidence as Rule 804(b)(6). This rule provides that: \u201cA statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness\u201d is not considered hearsay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00b667 The United States Supreme Court first applied the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing in <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 158 (1878):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">The Constitution does not guarantee an accused person against the legitimate consequences of his own wrongful acts.... [I]f [a defendant] voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his [Sixth Amendment] privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Supreme Court recently affirmed the doctrine\u2019s validity in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 62, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1370 (2004) (\u201cthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds\u201d). It has been adopted by numerous state courts as well. After recently considering both the evidentiary and constitutional aspects of the issue, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts noted that \u201cwe are aware of no jurisdiction that, after considering the doctrine, has rejected it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>830 N.E.2d 158, 166-67 (Mass. 2005). Even after acknowledging that its state constitution provides broader protections than the federal constitution, the Massachusetts Court interpreted its state constitution \u201ccoextensively\u201d with the federal constitution on this issue and recognized the doctrine, \u201c[g]iven the overwhelming precedential and policy support for its adoption[.]\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>830 N.E.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b668 I would apply this principle to the Rules of Evidence as well. However, despite a previous opportunity to do so, the Court has so far declined. We were presented with proposed M. R. Evid. 804(b)(6), the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to M. R. Evid. 802\u2019s bar against admission of hearsay, following a recent rule review process. Support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>for the adoption was offered by various members of the Commission on Evidence and by district court judges, but the Court rejected the rule. I continue to believe that the rule would serve an appropriate and important purpose in the search for truth which our courts are intended to conduct. The instant case presents a clear example of how a defendant may benefit from his wrongdoing and why the exception should be adopted. Accordingly, the Court\u2019s holding, which applies the forfeiture doctrine as an exception to the Confrontation Clause, should apply with equal force as an exception to the rule against hearsay, which would admit the evidence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Issue II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b669 The Court concludes that Aleasha\u2019s note was testimonial because \u201cthe purpose of the note was to explain Aleasha\u2019s untimely death or poisoning, the intended audience reasonably included law enforcement, and the circumstances surrounding the note indicate that an objective declarant reasonably should have anticipated that the State would make use of the statements at trial.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. I cannot agree with any of these conclusions because the Court has added its own speculation, or has ignored parts of the note, to reach each one.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b670 First, the Court states that the \u201cnote\u2019s substance indicates that the note\u2019s purpose was to explain her untimely death or poisoning ....\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 37. However, the Court does not adequately consider that the note gave instruction in the event Aleasha unexpectedly would \u201cbecome sick and on the edge of death.\u201d In such a sickened state, Aleasha would benefit by giving her medical providers the \u201canswers\u201d she was providing in the note. The Court simply pretends these words do not exist. The State\u2019s argument to this effect is improperly dismissed by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b671 Then, the Court concludes that the note was \u201cintended\u201d for law enforcement because it was left in the <em>kitchen. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 38. This conclusion is based upon the Court\u2019s surmise that law enforcement could more easily find it there. Assigning an intention by Aleasha to involve law enforcement from this most ordinary of actions is mere speculation. I submit that the note would have been found by law enforcement in any room of the house, and its location in the kitchen, without more, added nothing to the note\u2019s testimonial significance. Indeed, when the \u201cmore\u201d is considered, which is virtually ignored by the Court, a contrary conclusion appears. The note was handwritten on a small, single piece of paper and was found in Aleasha\u2019s kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>among her personal correspondence and bills. The location of the note in Aleasha\u2019s <em>personal </em>home, among <em>personal </em>papers, supports the objective conclusion that the note had a <em>personal </em>purpose and was meant for those who would have been typical visitors to her kitchen. Aleasha made no effort whatsoever to put her message into the hands of officials, to otherwise take precautions to protect or preserve the message for legal purposes, or to even label or direct the note to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b672 While the Court states that it \u201cfinds no particular inquiry dispostive in determining whether a statement is testimoniad,]\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34, the Court\u2019s analysis implies the question is susceptible to short, simplistic solutions: first, that because the note was more than a \u201ccasual remark,\u201d it must be testimonial, and because the note was discovered by a police officer, it must have been intended for police to easily find it. Opinion, \u00b6 38. This ignores the further details of the note and the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b673 When determining if a statement made by an unavailable declarant is testimonial, two Montana cases guide us: <em>State v. Mizenko </em>and <em>State v. Spencer. </em>In <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>we offered initial, post-<em>Crawford </em>boundaries of testimonial and non-testimonial statements for purposes of the Confrontation Clause. 2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458. We concluded that statements are testimonial in at least two situations: (1) \u201cwhen a declarant knowingly speaks to a police officer or governmental agent\u201d and (2) when the declarant had a \u201cclear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant. . . .\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. In contrast, we explained that a statement is non-testimonial when the declarant has an \u201cobjective reason to believe\u201d that the statement will serve to \u201cavert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger ....\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. We also stated that the \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard is an \u201cobjective\u201d standard. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b674 In <em>State v. Spencer, </em>we elaborated on <em>Mizenko, </em>concluding that where the \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard is \u201cunworkable,\u201d we must review the statement to determine its \u201cprimary purpose.\u201d 2007 MT 245, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 227, \u00b6 22, 169 P.3d 384, \u00b6 22. There, we relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266 (2006). <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. <em>InDavis, </em>the Supreme Court decided that when circumstances objectively indicate that the primary purpose of an interrogation is to enable police to assist in an ongoing emergency, the statements are non-testimonial. <em>Davis, 5A7 </em>U.S. at 821, 126 S. Ct. at 2273. If however, the circumstances objectively signify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that an ongoing emergency does not exist, but rather the interrogation\u2019s purpose is to prove past events that may be relevant in a future prosecution, the statements are testimonial. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 821-24, 126 S. Ct. at 2273-74. Accordingly, when determining, for Confrontation Clause purposes, whether a statement is testimonial, we first consider whether it is objectively reasonable that the declarant intended the statement to be used as evidence against the accused and, second, where there is no clear reason to believe that the declarant intended the statement to be used as evidence, we consider the primary purpose of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b675 When considering the note in its entirety under these standards, Aleasha may just as well have intended the note to alert medical providers to the cause of a potential illness, a non-testimonial purpose, or, indeed, simply have offered an explanation to others about the reason for her demise. The salutation \u201c[t]o whom it concerns[,]\u201d just as \u201creasonably\u201d includes medical or emergency personnel, relatives, and friends, thereby mitigating the note\u2019s potential testimonial qualities. The Court ascribes a law enforcement purpose from this broad salutation because it necessarily includes law enforcement. Instead, the Court should infer otherwise: because the generic salutation potentially included anyone in the world, it was not primarily a directive to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b676 Even assuming that the Court\u2019s reasoning about Aleasha\u2019s note and the reasoning of this concurrence offer competing, objectively reasonable interpretations regarding Aleasha\u2019s intent, it would then be appropriate to consider, as in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the note to determine whether it constitutes testimonial or non-testimonial evidence. Here the Court limits the application of our holding in <em>Spencer </em>to only interrogations, Opinion, \u00b6 38 n. 1, thereby disregarding the very reason we adopted the primary purpose test in the first place. We adopted the primary purpose analysis because the \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard was unworkable as applied to the statement of a three-and-a-half-year-old child. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22. Accordingly, application of the primary purpose analysis does not turn solely on whether an interrogation is involved, but considers whether the clear reason to believe standard is unworkable under the circumstances. However, in an effort to avoid consideration of the primary purpose of the note, the Court narrowly constricts the kinds of circumstances in which the primary purpose analysis can be applied-only to interrogations-and deflates our holding in <em>Spencer. </em>This is an artificial and shortsighted tact which will not serve us well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>in the future. To the contrary, the primary purpose analysis should be applicable to any statement, including a hand-written note, where it is unclear whether the declarant intended the statement to be used as evidence. Accordingly, where there are competing objectively reasonable interpretations of a statement, as here, we should look to the statement\u2019s primary purpose and \u201cbased on objective circumstances\u201d determine whether the statement is testimonial. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b677 Pursuant to our holding in <em>Spencer, </em>where the primary purpose of the statement is to assist in future litigation, the statement is deemed testimonial. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22. However, where the primary purpose is to mitigate future harm, the statement is non-testimonial. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22. In analyzing the primary purpose we must consider the totality of the \u201cobjective circumstances.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 22. Unfortunately, the Court\u2019s opinion considers only a fraction of the note. Looking at the note as a whole, most of the note discusses the availability of a drug which could possibly cause Aleasha\u2019s sickness or death. The note\u2019s third sentence states: \u201cSo, if I unexspetly [sic] become sick and on the edge of death, and perhaps I die no [sic] you will have some answers.\u201d The conclusory word \u201cso\u201d indicates that the note\u2019s purpose is to provide \u201canswers\u201d if Aleasha contracted a serious illness which could bring about her death. The note indicates the cause of her potential sickness (a drug from Mexico that doctors may not know about), and also suggests investigatory leads (Sanchez or his friends) that may be helpful in ascertaining either the type of drug for medical purposes or assigning criminal responsibility \u2014 an admittedly testimonial aspect of the note. However, looking at the note in its entirety, and the circumstances surrounding Aleasha\u2019s handling of the note, discussed above, it served largely to alert family, friends, or medical personnel to the reasons she came down with a sudden and strange illness. Consequently, the note\u2019s primary purpose was not to serve as evidence in a criminal prosecution, but to mitigate potential harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b678 Thus, I would conclude that there is neither a \u201creasonably objective\u201d reason to believe that the note was intended for criminal prosecution purposes, nor circumstances supporting a conclusion that the note was \u201cprimarily\u201d written to support a prosecution. Accordingly, while I support adoption of the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception for Confrontation Clause purposes, I believe that the note is non-testimonial and would end the Confrontation Clause analysis at that point.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> The dissenting opinion states that the adoption of the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception within the Federal Rules of Evidence is not \u201ca principled ground\u201d for considering adoption of the exception for our state rules. Dissent, \u00b6 123 n. 5.1 confess an inability to understand why consideration of the approach taken by the federal rules-and indeed, the approach of many other states who have likewise adopted the exception-on an evidentiary issue is unprincipled.

State, </em>615 P.2d 594, 601 (Alaska 1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b685 With these well-settled principles in mind, I agree with the Court\u2019s preliminary analysis under Issue III. In particular, I agree with the Court that \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA, is unambiguous. Opinion, \u00b6 52. Section 45-5-103(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">A person commits the offense of mitigated deliberate homicide when the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being but does so under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress <em>for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. </em>The <em>reasonableness of the explanation or excuse </em>must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Under the plain language of this statute, the word \u201creasonable\u201d modifies the defendant\u2019s explanation or excuse for his emotional state, not the defendant\u2019s actions. The statute requires the fact-finder to determine whether the defendant\u2019s explanation or excuse for his extreme mental or emotional stress is reasonable. There is nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the statute that requires (or even permits) the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s <em>response </em>to the extreme mental or emotional stress was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b686 I also agree with the Court that the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing arguments went far beyond appropriate ad-libbing and that his comments demonstrate a blatant misstatement of \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Indeed, the prosecutor told the jurors-not once, but <em>four </em>times, and even after defense counsel had pointed out that the prosecutor was misstating the law-that they had to determine whether Sanchez\u2019s <em>actions </em>were reasonable. First, the prosecutor argued during his initial closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">The defense counsel -will argue that this was a <em>reasonable response </em>to extreme emotional distress. You must ask yourself, is it reasonable? Was there extreme-extreme emotional distress? Not just emotional distress but extreme emotional distress and <em>was his reaction reasonable. </em>You can argue until you\u2019re blue in the face and you cannot make this defendant\u2019s <em>actions reasonable </em>under these circumstances.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Then, during his rebuttal closing, the prosecutor reiterated these misstatements of the law several more times:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">The Court read you the instructions. The reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation. <em>That is, what would a reasonable person do, not what the defendant did. </em>The evidence in this case shows you it was not reasonable. And if it\u2019s not reasonable, there goes mitigated deliberate homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Defense counsel said this is an extremely difficult case. I would make no comment on that but I will suggest to you, based on your lifetime experiences, <em>was the defendant\u2019s actions reasonable </em>under these circumstances? Your lifetime experiences tell you that relationships come and go, that people get cheated on in their mind, that they are hurt, that they are angry. If it is <em>reasonable </em>then under those circumstances <em>to kill somebody, </em>the streets would be littered with corpses. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">At this point, defense counsel objected that the prosecutor \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>misinterpreting these instructions over and over again.\u201d The court responded: \u201cYou may continue with closing. The objection is overruled.\u201d The prosecutor then stated, yet again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">The streets would be littered with corpses if it was <em>reasonable to shoot somebody </em>because they cheated on you and made you angry. Based on your own lifetime experiences you have seen that. You may have been part of it. Did you kill somebody? Did somebody kill you, your friends, other people? No. That answers the question. This is not a <em>reasonable response </em>for a person under these circumstances. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b687 While the Court concludes that these improper statements \u201ctested the boundaries of professional ethics,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 54,1 conclude that the prosecutor crossed those boundaries. Rule 3.1(a)(1) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein . . . without having first determined through diligent investigation that there is a bona fide basis in law and fact for the position to be advocated\u201d (paragraph break omitted). Likewise, Rule 3.3(a)(1) prohibits a lawyer from \u201cknowingly . . . mak[ing] a false statement of ... law to a tribunal or fail[ing] to correct a false statement of... law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer\u201d (paragraph break omitted). And Rule 4.1(a) prohibits a lawyer from \u201cknowingly . . . mak[ing] a false statement of. . . law to a third person\u201d (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b688 Here, there is no legal basis for the version of \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA, argued by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The prosecutor\u2019s statements of the law were patently false.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, as the Court observes, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not mere inadvertence. Opinion, \u00b6 54. As a matter of fact, if we accept that the prosecutor followed his duty under Rule 3.1(a)(1) not to advocate a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u201cwithout having first determined through diligent investigation that there is a bona fide basis in law\u201d for that position, then the inference readily drawn from the record before us is that the prosecutor knowingly made false statements of law in violation of Rules 3.3(a)(1) and 4.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b689 But it is not necessary to draw such an inference. The proposed jury instruction filed by the prosecutor with respect to the issue of mitigated deliberate homicide establishes that he was fully aware of the law under \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA. That proposed instruction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">In order to find the Defendant guilty of the lesser offense of mitigated deliberate homicide, the State must prove the following two propositions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">First, that the Defendant caused the death of Aleasha Chenoweth and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Second, that when the Defendant did so, he acted purposely or knowingly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">Additionally, you must find that at the time the Defendant caused the death of Aleasha Chenoweth, he was acting <em>under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. </em>The reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the Defendant\u2019s situation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The emphasized language is identical to the pertinent language of \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA. In other words, the prosecutor correctly recited the language of the statute in his proposed jury instruction but went to the jury and argued a completely different-and false-version of the statute. Given these circumstances, I conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing arguments did not merely \u201ctest[] the boundaries of professional ethics,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 54, but instead crossed the boundaries of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct and violated the prosecutor\u2019s duties and responsibilities set out in <em>Fletcher.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b690 The Court holds that although the prosecutor improperly stated the law to the jury, Sanchez has not demonstrated that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements prejudiced his right to a fair and impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trial. I disagree. The basic premise underlying the Court\u2019s holding is that the District Court provided an unambiguous instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide and the jury followed that instruction. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 58. In this regard, the Court notes that \u201cjuries are presumed to follow the law that courts provide.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 57. This presumption is well-established in American jurisprudence, and I do not dispute it. However, I do dispute the Court\u2019s assumption that the jury received an unambiguous instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b691 Prior to closing arguments, the District Court read Instructions 8 through 19. The instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide (Instruction 17) accurately conveyed \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arsk\">A person commits the offense of Mitigated Deliberate Homicide when the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being but does so under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">However, during the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the following sequence of events occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR:] Defense counsel said this is an extremely difficult case. I would make no comment on that but I will suggest to you, based on your lifetime experiences, was the defendant\u2019s actions reasonable under these circumstances? Your lifetime experiences tell you that relationships come and go, that people get cheated on in their mind, that they are hurt, that they are angry. If it is reasonable then under those circumstances to kill somebody, the streets would be littered with corpses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to have to object because he is misinterpreting these instructions over and over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">THE COURT: You may continue with closing. The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">By overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection that the prosecutor was misinterpreting the instructions, the District Court effectively endorsed the prosecutor\u2019s statement as to what the jury had to decide-namely, whether Sanchez\u2019s <em>actions </em>were reasonable. Not content to rest on his laurels, however, the prosecutor then proceeded to repeat this misstatement of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: The streets would be littered with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>corpses if it was reasonable to shoot somebody because they cheated on you and made you angry. Based on your own lifetime experiences you have seen that. You may have been part of it. Did you kill somebody? Did somebody kill you, your friends, other people? No. That answers the question. This is not a reasonable response for a person under these circumstances. This is not extreme emotional distress. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Immediately thereafter, the bailiffs were sworn and the jurors began their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b692 It is apparent on this record that the jury received conflicting instructions from the court on mitigated deliberate homicide. Under Instruction 17, which was given before closing arguments, the jury was told to decide whether Sanchez, at the time he caused Aleasha\u2019s death, was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there was reasonable explanation or excuse. But under the version of the law provided by the prosecutor near the end of his rebuttal closing argument, the jury was told to decide whether Sanchez\u2019s \u201cactions\u201d themselves were reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., whether killing Aleasha was \u201ca reasonable response for [Sanchez] under these circumstances.\u201d The District Court explicitly endorsed the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect articulation of the law when it overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection that the prosecutor was misinterpreting the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b693 A virtually identical situation occurred in <em>State v. Jones, </em>615 S.W.2d 416 (Mo. 1981), which the Missouri Supreme Court described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Three things stand out about the argument in this case: First, the prosecutor told the jury [during closing argument] that a \u201creasonable belief\u2019 satisfied the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.... Thus, the prosecutor in this case undertook to define reasonable doubt in wholly erroneous terms. Second: The prosecutor\u2019s statement was promptly objected to and the objections were overruled, giving the argument the imprimatur of the trial court. Third: The prosecutor was not content with a passing reference to the subject, but upon the overruling of defense objection, proceeded to repeat his erroneous definition of reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\"><em>Jones, </em>615 S.W.2d at 420 (citations omitted). The court reversed the convictions, noting that while the evidence of guilt was strong, the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements could not be excused as harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u00b694 In the case at hand, the Court reasons that the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>informed the jury that the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments were not evidence. Opinion, \u00b6 57. But the problem here is not that the prosecutor purported to provide evidence; the problem here is that the prosecutor purported to state the law of mitigated deliberate homicide and the District Court gave the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements the imprimatur of the court. The Court also reasons that the jury was presented with defense counsel\u2019s correct interpretation of the law. Opinion, \u00b6 57. But the District Court never endorsed defense counsel\u2019s interpretation of the law; the court only endorsed the prosecutor\u2019s interpretation of the law, which was patently false.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b695 \u201cAmerican jurisprudence depends on a jury\u2019s ability to follow instructions and juries are presumed to follow the law that courts provide.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 57 (citing <em>State v. Turner, </em>262 Mont. 39, 55, 864 P.2d 235, 245 (1993), and <em>Opper v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 84, 95, 75 S. Ct. 158, 165 (1954)). Accordingly, when the trial court imparts conflicting versions of the law and thereby inhibits the jury from correctly following the law, the resulting verdict cannot stand. Indeed, this Court has long recognized that the giving of conflicting jury instructions on a material issue is reversible error. <em>See e.g. State v. Rolla, </em>21 Mont. 582, 587, 55 P. 523, 525 (1898); <em>Wells v. Waddell, </em>59 Mont. 436, 443-44, 196 P. 1000, 1002 (1921); <em>Skelton v. Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>110 Mont. 257, 261, <em>100 P.2d 929, 931 (1940); Bohrer v. Clark, </em>180 Mont. 233, 246, 590 P.2d 117, 124 (1978); <em>Swenson v. Buffalo Bldg. Co., </em>194 Mont. 141, 151, 635 P.2d 978, 984 (1981). In <em>Rolla, </em>the Court observed that \u201cwhen conflicting propositions of law are given upon a material point, one correct and the other incorrect, the judgment will be reversed. It cannot be assumed in such case that the jury will follow the correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>Rolla, </em>21 Mont. at 587, 55 P. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">\u00b696 In the case at hand, the jury unquestionably received conflicting statements as to the law under \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA: first, the court\u2019s correct instruction that Sanchez\u2019s <em>explanation or excuse for his extreme mental or emotional stress </em>had to be reasonable, and second, the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect statement, which received the imprimatur of the court, that Sanchez\u2019s <em>actions </em>had to be reasonable. Section 45-5-103(1), MCA, carves a fine line-one that is easily capable of being misunderstood by jurors, particularly when they receive conflicting statements as to its meaning. Under these circumstances, the Court\u2019s assumption that the District Court provided an unambiguous instruction on mitigated deliberate homicide is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b697 Before concluding, I note that the Court has imposed on Sanchez a virtually insurmountable burden to demonstrate that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Berger,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that [the obligations to govern impartially and to do justice], which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcQ\"><em>Berger, </em>295 U.S. at 88, 55 S. Ct. at 633. Along these same lines, we observed in <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 897 P.2d 1063 (1995), that improper comment by the prosecutor creates an unacceptable risk that jurors will simply adopt the prosecutor\u2019s views instead of exercising their own independent judgment. <em>See Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 381, 897 P.2d at 1071. Yet, there is no way that Sanchez can get inside the minds of the jurors in his case to determine whether this occurred-i.e., whether they rendered their verdict based on the law as incorrectly stated by the prosecutor and endorsed by the District Court. Moreover, even if a juror offered insight in this regard, Sanchez is prohibited from using juror testimony or affidavits to impeach a verdict based upon misapprehension of the law. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 606(b); <em>State v. Kelman, </em>276 Mont. 253, 262, 915 P.2d 854, 860 (1996). As it turns out, the District Court\u2019s endorsement of the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect statement of the law establishes, in my view, that Sanchez was deprived of a fair trial and due process of law. But one is left to wonder how Sanchez, under the burden imposed by the Court, otherwise could have demonstrated prejudice as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b698 In this regard, I believe that the Court errs in not weighing the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct more heavily in the analysis. By refusing to recognize prejudice to Sanchez, the Court not only affirms the denial of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial but also sends the message that there are no adverse consequences to prosecutorial misconduct of this nature. In my view, if a prosecutor knowingly flaunts the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, repeatedly misrepresents the law to the jury, and blatantly ignores this Court\u2019s admonishment in a prior case not to misstate the law as instructed by the judge <em>(see </em>\u00b6 89 n. 3, <em>supra), </em>these factors should be weighed heavily in determining whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b699 That said, the fact that the District Court imparted conflicting versions of \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA, to the jury is itself reversible error. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>one accepts the premise that a jury which is given conflicting propositions of law cannot correctly follow the law, then the entire foundation of the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue III crumbles, as it should. In light of the prosecutor\u2019s repeated misstatements of the law and the District Court\u2019s endorsement of those misstatements, we simply cannot have confidence that the jury was able to properly consider the lesser included offense of mitigated deliberate homicide. <em>Cf. State v. Rogers, </em>2001 MT 165, \u00b6\u00b6 14-22, 306 Mont. 130, \u00b6\u00b6 14-22, 32 P.3d 724, \u00b6\u00b6 14-22 (holding that the defendant was prejudiced because the jury\u2019s ability to consider the lesser included offense had not been \u201cmaximize[d]\u201d). I conclude that Sanchez\u2019s constitutional rights to a fair trial and to due process of law were clearly violated. I therefore would reverse and remand this case for a new trial. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Issue II</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6100 In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), the Supreme Court announced a categorical bar to the admission of certain hearsay evidence at a criminal trial. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement of a witness who is absent from trial is inadmissible unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1365, 1374. Although the Supreme Court identified three formulations of what constitutes a testimonial statement, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S. Ct. at 1364, the Supreme Court did not adopt a specific definition, opting instead to define the term on a case-by-case basis, <em>see e.g. Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266 (2006). However, as this Court notes in \u00b6\u00b6 34 and 36 of today\u2019s Opinion, the Supreme Court has suggested a number of considerations that are pertinent in determining whether a statement is testimonial-in particular, the statement\u2019s purpose, the statement\u2019s context, and the audience to whom the statement was made. None of these considerations is dispositive; rather, they inform the ultimate question of whether the declarant should have expected, under the circumstances, that the State would use his or her statements at trial. In other words, would a reasonable person in the position of the declarant have objectively foreseen or anticipated that his or statements might be used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime? <em>See United States v. Townley, </em>472 F.3d 1267, 1272 (10th Cir. 2007), <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S._, 127 S. Ct. 3069 (2007); <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>v. Cromer, </em>389 F.3d 662, 675 (6th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b6101 I agree with the Court\u2019s explanation of these principles in \u00b6\u00b6 34 and 36.1 also agree with the Court\u2019s analysis in \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 38 of whether the statements contained in Aleasha\u2019s note were testimonial. As the Court observes, the nature of the note was accusatory. It identified Aleasha\u2019s killer and the threatened means of execution, and it stated the exact time and date of Sanchez\u2019s reported threat. It purported to provide \u201csome answers\u201d regarding a crime that would certainly be prosecuted if sufficient evidence, such as the note, were available; and in this sense, the note\u2019s obvious purpose was to speak for Aleasha regarding her unexpected demise should she not be able to speak for herself, i.e., to provide incriminating testimony that Aleasha could not provide in person. It was addressed to a broad audience of persons who might be concerned about Aleasha\u2019s illness or death, and it was placed in a location where law enforcement was likely to find it. Indeed, the detective who found the note testified that he searched Aleasha\u2019s residence because he \u201cfelt that it was important to go there to look for any notes or written letters, any diaries, e-mails or just anything that might document some kind of a history,\u201d more specifically, \u201c[a]ny kind of history of threats [being made to Aleasha].\u201d Not surprisingly, when he found the note, he immediately recognized its \u201cevidentiary value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b6102 The State contends that Aleasha\u2019s note \u201cdoes not reasonably purport to show an intent it would be used prosecutorially but only an intent to direct attention (possibly only medical attention) to the reasons for any suspicious illness.\u201d As the Court observes, however, this contention completely ignores the accusatory nature of the note. Moreover, I find it highly implausible that a person who intends to alert medical personnel to the reasons for a suspicious illness would place such information in a pile of correspondence and bills where it is not reasonably likely to be discovered by medical personnel in a timely manner, if at all. In any event, the State\u2019s argument also misapprehends the pertinent inquiry here, which is not what Aleasha specifically intended but, rather, what an objective declarant reasonably would have expected under the circumstances, Opinion, \u00b6 36, i.e., whether Aleasha should have understood (whether she actually did or not) at the time she wrote the note that there was a significant probability the statements contained therein would be used prosecutorially. Under the circumstances presented, an objective declarant in Aleasha\u2019s position would have anticipated that the statements contained in the note would be used in the investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and prosecution of Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b6103 Accordingly, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that Aleasha\u2019s note contained testimonial statements. In addition, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing applies in this case. However, I do not agree with the Court\u2019s explication of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b6104 In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing is an exception to the Confrontation Clause\u2019s categorical bar against the admission of testimonial statements. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S. Ct. at 1370. This exception, the Supreme Court noted, extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S. Ct. at 1370; <em>accord Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 2280 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b6105 In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court provided further insight into the scope of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception. Addressing the argument that the nature of the offense charged in that case-domestic violence-required greater flexibility in the use of testimonial evidence against the accused, the Supreme Court noted that this particular type of crime is \u201cnotoriously susceptible to intimidation or coercion of the victim to ensure that she does not testify at trial\u201d and that when this occurs, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause gives the criminal a windfall.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2279-80. Notwithstanding, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]e may not, however, vitiate constitutional guarantees when they have the effect of allowing the guilty to go free.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2280.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b6106 At the same time, however, the Supreme Court noted that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing may extinguish confrontation claims under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">But when defendants seek to undermine the judicial process by procuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims, the Sixth Amendment does not require courts to acquiesce. While defendants have no duty to assist the State in proving their guilt, they do have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system. We reiterate what we said in Crawford: that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing . . . extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds. That is, one who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axs\"><em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2280 (ellipsis in original; emphasis, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u00b6107 This language-in particular, the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the verb \u201cseek\u201d in conjunction with \u201cundermining] the judicial process\u201d and \u201cdestroying] the integrity of the criminal-trial system\u201d-as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to vitiate the right of confrontation because the charged offense is susceptible to intimidation or coercion of the victim-declarant indicate that the focus of the forfeiture doctrine is not solely on whether the defendant may benefit from his own wrongdoing. In other words, not all conduct by the defendant that happens to result in a witness\u2019s unavailability comes within the doctrine. Rather, the doctrine is directed specifically at conduct by which the defendant \u201cseek[s]\u201d or intends \u201cto undermine the judicial process\u201d or \u201cdestroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system\u201d by procuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b6108 This conclusion is substantiated by the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Davis </em>that \u201cFederal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6) . . . codifies the forfeiture doctrine.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2280. Federal Rule 804(b)(6) provides as follows: \u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: ... A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was <em>intended </em>to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness\u201d (emphasis added, paragraph breaks omitted). Again, according to <em>Davis, </em>this is a codification of the forfeiture doctrine, <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2280; and by its own terms, the doctrine requires <em>an intent </em>to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability as a witness. Numerous courts have reached the same conclusion. <em>See State v. Romero, </em>156 P.3d 694, 702 (N.M. 2007) (citing cases, and concluding that the majority rule requires proof of an intent to prevent the declarant from testifying), <em>cert. </em>dismissed,_U.S._, 128 S. Ct. 976 (Jan 11, 2008); <em>see also People v. Stechly, </em>870 N.E.2d 333, 348-53 (Ill. 2007) (analyzing the forfeiture doctrine and Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(6) and concluding that intent is an element of the doctrine), <em>rehearing denied </em>(May <em>29,2007); People v. Moreno, </em>160 P.3d 242, 246 (Colo. 2007) (noting that \u201cthe clear consensus in non-murder cases is that the doctrine requires a showing of an intent on the part of the defendant to prevent the declarant from testifying at trial\u201d), <em>rehearing denied </em>(Jun. 25, 2007); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>405 F.3d 227, 242 n. 9 (4th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]he intent requirement in Rule 804(b)(6) continues to limit application of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to those cases in which the defendant intended, at least in part, to render the declarant unavailable as a witness against him. Absent such intent, Rule 804(b)(6) has no application.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u00b6109 That said, I recognize that a case such as this-where the defendant has admitted to deliberately causing the victim\u2019s death through wrongdoing and, thus, causing the victim\u2019s absence from trial-presents an unusual situation. There is no evidence in the record that Sanchez sought by this action to undermine the judicial process or to destroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system. Indeed, there was no \u201cjudicial process\u201d to undermine at the time Sanchez committed the homicide. It would seem, therefore, that the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing, as articulated in <em>Davis, </em>is inapplicable. On the other hand, had Sanchez merely assaulted Aleasha, and had he then caused her absence from trial by admittedly threatening her, the forfeiture doctrine presumably would have applied. Thus, we would be rewarding defendants who admittedly killed their victims through wrongdoing if we did not apply the same rule to them. To avoid this anomaly, I conclude that where the defendant has admitted to deliberately causing the declarant\u2019s death through wrongdoing, then the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception applies to that specific declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b6110 On this basis, I conclude that the admission of Aleasha\u2019s note did not deprive Sanchez of his right of confrontation. He procured Aleasha\u2019s unavailability by fatally shooting her, thereby rendering her unavailable as a witness, and he admitted to having engaged in this wrongdoing deliberately (albeit, with mitigating circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b6111 The Court reaches the same result; however, in so doing, the Court relies on principles broad enough to suggest that the forfeiture-by-wrongdo ing exception applies irrespective of whether the defendant had an intent to procure the declarant\u2019s -unavailability as a witness. It is on this point that I believe the Court errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b6112 Throughout the Court\u2019s discussion in \u00b6\u00b6 40 through 46, the Court repeatedly refers to the \u201cequitable basis\u201d of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception and the maxim that \u201cno person should benefit from the person\u2019s own wrongdoing.\u201d Indeed, this maxim is the foundation of the Court\u2019s conclusion that Sanchez forfeited his right to confrontation in this case. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. Yet, while <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>refer to the \u201cequitable\u201d basis of the doctrine, neither opinion states that the doctrine applies broadly to prevent a defendant from \u201cbenefiting\u201d from his own wrongdoing. Moreover, if the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception applied whenever a defendant would otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>\u201cbenefit\u201d from his own wrongdoing-whether or not that wrongdoing was intended to procure a declarant\u2019s unavailability as a witness-then the exception most certainly would swallow the rule. What if the victim-declarant is simply too frightened to face the defendant at trial? Has the defendant then \u201cbenefited\u201d from his wrongdoing and thereby forfeited his right to confrontation? It would seem so under the broad language used by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b6113 The Court\u2019s approach of relying on general maxims and principles of equity contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s unambiguous statement that \u201cFederal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6) . . . codifies the forfeiture doctrine,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2280, and the fact that Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(6) requires an intent to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability as a witness. The Court seems to dismiss the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Davis </em>as \u201cprimarily dicta,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42, and to adopt the California Supreme Court\u2019s broad reasoning in <em>People v. Giles, </em>152 P.3d 433 (Cal. 2007), <em>cert. </em>granted,_U.S._, 128 S. Ct. 976 (Jan. 11, 2008), namely, that \u201c \u2018[a] defendant whose intentional criminal act renders a witness unavailable for trial benefits from his crime if he can use the witness\u2019s unavailability to exclude damaging hearsay statements by the witness that would otherwise be admissible,\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 43 (quoting <em>Giles, </em>152 P.3d at 443). It is imprudent, however, to so readily dismiss the narrow version of the rule suggested in <em>Davis </em>in favor of the broad interpretation offered in GiZes-particularly since we are speaking of a constitutional right and since the result of the Court\u2019s broad, sweeping statements in \u00b6\u00b6 40 through 46 to the effect that the doctrine applies to any wrongdoing by a defendant from which he or she happens to \u201cbenefit\u201d will most surely be to render that constitutional right subject to exception more often than not. In my view, the defendant\u2019s intent is an element of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception, and the Court errs to the extent it suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b6114 In sum, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that Aleasha\u2019s note contained testimonial statements. Furthermore, I agree with the Court that the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception applies on the facts of this case. However, I strenuously disagree with the Court\u2019s suggestion in \u00b6\u00b6 40-46 that the exception applies whenever a person would otherwise benefit from his or her own wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Issue I</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u00b6115 As noted at the outset, I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue I. However, because we will, no doubt, confront the matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>adopting the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rules in some other context, I believe that it is appropriate to respond briefly to Justice Rice\u2019s arguments on this point <em>(see </em>Concurrence, \u00b6\u00b6 65-68).</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">\u00b6116 I respectfully disagree that we should adopt this exception to the hearsay rules, either by way of our caselaw or by an amendment to the Rules of Evidence. My rationale is grounded in the nature of hearsay evidence and in the reasons we reject hearsay evidence as a general rule and admit it, as exceptions to the general rule, only under narrowly-defined circumstances. Indeed, if the purpose of our courts is to \u201csearch for truth,\u201d Concurrence, \u00b6 68, then we ought not to disregard the two elemental principles underpinning the law of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b6117 First, as a general rule, \u201c[hjearsay is <em>not admissible </em>except as otherwise provided by statute, these rules, or other rules applicable in the courts of this state.\u201d M. R. Evid. 802 (emphasis added). As noted in the Commission Comments to Rule 802, \u201cthe rule that hearsay is inadmissible has been followed in Montana without question since the early case of <em>Davis v. Blume, </em>1 Mont. 463, 465 (1872).\u201d This broadly-stated prohibition reflects the well-settled view that out-of-court statements are presumptively unreliable, given that the declarant\u2019s perception, memory, and veracity cannot be tested in the presence of the fact-finder while under oath and subject to cross-examination. As explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">The hearsay rule is generally said to exclude out-of-court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted because there are four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (1) insincerity, (2) faulty perception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration, each of which decreases the reliability of the inference from the statement made to the conclusion for which it is offered. The hearsay rule ordinarily prohibits the admission of out-of-court statements by declarants on the theory that cross-examination can help test for these four classes of error, thus allowing the fact-finder to weigh the evidence properly and to discount any that is too unreliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., </em>189 F.3d 218, 232 (2nd Cir. 1999) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Shukri, </em>207 F.3d 412, 417 (7th Cir. 2000) (\u201cHearsay testimony is presumptively unreliable under the common law because the opposing party has no opportunity to cross-examine and test the declarant\u2019s truthfulness under oath before the factfinder.\u201d (citing 5 John H. Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Common Law </em>\u00a7 1368, at 37, \u00a7 1420, at 251 (rev. ed. 1974), and <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 245, at 728 (Edward W. Cleary ed., 3d ed., 1984))). The opportunity for the fact-finder to weigh the declarant\u2019s sincerity, perception, memory, and narration and to discount any testimony that is too unreliable is lost where that evidence is admitted by way of a third party who simply repeats the declarant\u2019s statements in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b6 118 Second-and this principle follows from the first-the exceptions to the general prohibition against hearsay evidence are grounded in \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d M. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), i.e., a consensus that out-of-court statements made under certain circumstances are sufficiently reliable to allow their admission notwithstanding the declarant\u2019s absence. <em>See e.g. </em>Commission Comments to M. R. Evid. 803(4) (\u201cThe guarantee of trustworthiness [underpinning the statements-for-purposes-of-medical-diagnosis-or-treatment exception] is provided by the patient\u2019s motivation for proper diagnosis and treatment.\u201d); Commission Comments to M. R. Evid. 803(6) (\u201cThe guarantee of trustworthiness [underpinning the records-of-regularly-conducted-activity exception] is provided by the nature of the record and the circumstances of preparation, enhanced by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Schering Corp., </em>189 F.3d at 233 (\u201c[T]he trustworthiness of [the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule] is a function of their ability to minimize some of the four classic hearsay dangers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b6119 In sum, as a general rule, the admission of hearsay evidence is <em>not </em>a reliable and trustworthy vehicle for finding \u201ctruth\u201d; rather, this form of evidence frustrates that search, which is why Rule 802 exists in the first place. But we admit certain categories of hearsay testimony where the law has determined, based on historical evidence and practice, that there are circumstantial guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness built into these categories of hearsay testimony and that these types of evidence, therefore, may enhance or further the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b6 120 The forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception, however, is not based on any notion of reliability or trustworthiness. Indeed, the fact that an actor engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness provides no indication whatsoever as to whether that declarant\u2019s out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>statement is reliable or trustworthy. The statement may be true, or it may be a complete fabrication. It may be based on accurate information or on a complete misperception of the events in question. It may be reliable due to one or more of the circumstances that underlie the other exceptions to the hearsay rule, or it may have no independent and inherent indicia of reliability and trustworthiness at all. It might, in the first instance, enhance the search for truth, or it might, in the second, significantly frustrate or obviate that search altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b6121 For these reasons, I disagree that the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception serves a role in the \u201csearch for truth.\u201d Rather, application of the exception results in a conclusive presumption about <em>the truth </em>of a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement based solely on <em>the alleged conduct </em>of the accused. More to the point, in most instances, application of the exception is about punishing the alleged conduct <em>for which the actor is on trial and of which he or she is presumed innocent', </em>it has nothing to do with facilitating the search for truth by admitting presumably reliable out-of-court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b6122 We have always examined evidence objected to on hearsay grounds through the lens of circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, and it seems dangerous to me to eliminate this perspective for an entire category of statements. Once we discard this analysis for one category of evidence, why not do it for others? I cannot agree with so readily tossing out our historical litmus test.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b6123 Thus, irrespective of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> hearsay statements offered in Montana courts against a party who engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness must continue to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis under existing hearsay law. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the statement offered is hearsay, then it should not be admitted absent the statement\u2019s falling under one of those narrow hearsay exceptions that is historically grounded in independent and inherent indicia of reliability and trustworthiness. The rules of evidence must remain a neutral medium which facilitate the search for truth; they must not become instruments of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b6124 Based on my analysis under Issue III, I conclude that this case should be reversed and remanded for a new trial. I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary decision. As to Issue II, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion that Aleasha\u2019s note contained testimonial statements, and I agree with the Court that the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception applies to Sanchez\u2019s confrontation claims; however, I reach the latter conclusion concerning the applicability of the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception on a narrower ground than the rationale underlying the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> Not only did the prosecutor misrepresent the law here, he also misrepresented to the jury what defense counsel would argue. Defense counsel argued the reasonableness of Sanchez\u2019s explanation or excuse for his claimed extreme mental or emotional stress, not the reasonableness of Sanchez\u2019s actions under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> Although the State makes no attempt to show that the prosecutor correctly stated the law, the State does argue that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper. The State suggests that the prosecutor merely improvised, resulting in \u201csyntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear.\u201d However, I agree with the Court that the State\u2019s arguments in this regard are incongruous. Opinion, \u00b6 54. In fact, the State\u2019s candor to tms Court is questionable in light of its attempt to spin the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements as nothing more than \u201cambiguous\u201d remarks, \u201cinartfully spoken\u201d and \u201cnot exemplars of clarity,\u201d but \u201cfair arguments\u201d if not viewed in \u201cdistorted isolation.\u201d These characterizations are disingenuous at best, given that the prosecutor blatantly misrepresented the law, not once, but four times in his two closing arguments. The State legitimately may argue that Sanchez waived his claim of error or was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements; but as to those misstatements, the State has an ethical duty to candidly concede obvious prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\"> In this regard, I note that in <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, 303 Mont. 507, 16 P.3d 391, we chastised this same prosecutor for misrepresenting the State\u2019s burden of proof during voir dire and closing argument. <em>See Stewart, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-45.

Montana also does not march lock-step with federal procedural and evidentiary rules. <em>See e.g. </em>Table C, <em>Montana Rules of Evidence Differing from Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>Title 26, Chapter 10, MCA (Annotations 2006). Likewise, the mere fact that the federal government has adopted the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception in the Federal Rules of Evidence is not itself a principled ground for adopting the exception as part of the Montana Rules of Evidence. Contrary to Justice Rice\u2019s concurrence, this is not to say that \u201cconsideration\u201d of the approaches taken by the federal government and our sister states is unprincipled. Concurrence, \u00b6 66 n. 1. Rather, it is to say that wholesale adoption of the exception merely because others have done so would be unprincipled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b305-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AFP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b6125 I join Justice Nelson\u2019s dissent on Issue III and would reverse and remand for a new trial on that basis. Like Justice Nelson, it is my view that, if the Court reached the correct result on this issue, there would be no need to address the others. Because various views on Issues I and II are offered by others, I will do so as well, but only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b6126 On Issue I, I would not adopt the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rules for the reasons expressed by Justice Nelson. This is a matter best considered on a case-by-case basis, at least until such time as we have sufficient experience with the doctrine here in Montana to consider it more knowledgeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\u00b6127 On Issue II, I join Justice Rice\u2019s analysis of whether Aleasha\u2019s note is testimonial. I would conclude it is not testimonial, for the reasons so cogently stated by Justice Rice. I also believe Aleasha\u2019s lack of fear or concern through the course of events which occurred in this case-that is, the several threats and going out to Sanchez\u2019s vehicle on the very day she was killed-buttresses that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">\u00b6128 Moreover, I have grave concerns about the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine in certain cases. In this regard, I agree with Justice Nelson that forfeiture by wrongdoing should not apply in a deliberate homicide case involving the defense of justifiable use of force (that is, self-defense). It also is my view, however, that the doctrine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>not applicable in this case where the defense of mitigated deliberate homicide is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b6129 I understand full well the notion and maxim that no one should benefit by his or her wrong. Indeed, that maxim underlies many legal subject areas, including fraudulent inducement in entering-and tortious interference with-a contract, and most other situations in which a party comes to a court without clean hands. It may well be that forfeiture by wrongdoing should apply as well in certain criminal cases, but I would not apply it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b6130 A bedrock principle of criminal law in this country is the constitutional right to confront one\u2019s accusers. Another is the requirement that the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Another-perhaps the most-bedrock principle of criminal law is the presumption of innocence. It is difficult for me to embrace the notion that an \u201cequitable\u201d basis such as forfeiture by wrongdoing can sweep away one\u2019s constitutional confrontation rights. Indeed, it strikes me that-in a case such as this where the defense is to admit that the offense was committed but to offer the defense of mitigation-the opportunity to reasonably present the defense is effectively trumped by the admission of evidence that repeatedly highlights the wrongdoing. Thus, while the Court is correct, \u00b6 47, that it is the purposeful causing of the death of another which prevents the ability to exercise the right to confront the deceased, the purposeful death was not committed for the purpose of avoiding the confrontation. Stated differently, had there been a homicide for the purpose of preventing the victim from testifying or assisting in a criminal prosecution, I would agree that forfeiture by wrongdoing properly would apply; other factual situations might also support application of the doctrine. I cannot join the Court in applying it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b6131 I would reverse and remand for a new trial on prosecutorial misconduct in this cause number.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
