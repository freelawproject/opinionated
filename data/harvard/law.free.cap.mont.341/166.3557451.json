We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by denying McFarlane\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">\u00b64 2. Did McFarlane\u2019s counsel for the motion to withdraw plea provide ineffective assistance of counsel by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">a. Citing to the improper legal standard for a plea withdrawal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">b. Failing to challenge the adequacy of the plea colloquy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">\u00b65 On August 4, 2003, the Custer County Attorney filed an information charging McFarlane with burglary, a felony, and theft, a misdemeanor. Both charges arose from McFarlane\u2019s entry into Bill Hopkins\u2019 residence on or about May 27, 2003. McFarlane was arraigned on August 19, 2003, and was represented by Wyatt Glade (Glade). Thereafter, a change of plea hearing was held on January 14, 2004, during which McFarlane pled guilty to both the burglary and the theft, pursuant to a plea agreement. In exchange for McFarlane\u2019s guilty plea, the State agreed to move to dismiss the persistent felony offender status against McFarlane. Following the court\u2019s colloquy with McFarlane, the court accepted McFarlane\u2019s guilty plea. A sentencing hearing was then set for April 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">\u00b66 However, McFarlane failed to appear at the sentencing hearing, instead fleeing the jurisdiction. McFarlane was a fugitive for two years until arrested on warrant issued by the District Court and returned to Montana by authorities. Glade withdrew as McFarlane\u2019s attorney of record on March 30, 2006, and the court appointed John Houtz as McFarlane\u2019s new counsel. Shortly thereafter, McFarlane filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the burglary charge. In support of his motion, Houtz asserted that under the three-factor <em>Huttinger </em>test, the court should grant McFarlane\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The court held a hearing on the motion and McFarlane testified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>McFarlane told the court that Glade had instructed him \u201cto answer [the court\u2019s] questions the way [he] did to get the Judge to accept the plea.\u201d During his testimony, McFarlane also asserted that Glade knew that McFarlane possessed a key to the Hopkins\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b67 The District Court denied the motion to withdraw, determining that McFarlane\u2019s plea \u201cwas an intelligent and voluntary plea. He had an opportunity to review the plea agreement with his attorney. He said that he was satisfied with his attorney .... this is an opportunistic attempt at getting the best parts of [the] bargain ....\u201d McFarlane appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo, <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 17, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b617, as the issue of whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 17. We review the underlying factual findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are unsupported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23. We then review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law, and application of the law to the facts, for correctness. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court err by denying McFarlane\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b610 McFarlane contends that his guilty plea was entered both involuntarily and unintelligently. He advances three arguments in support of his contention. First, McFarlane argues that his plea was involuntary because his attorney, Glade, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by inadequately preparing him for the change of plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">\u00b611 Section 46-16-105(2), MCA, allows a court to withdraw a guilty plea and substitute a not guilty plea where good cause is shown. \u201cGood cause\u201d includes involuntariness of the plea, but may also include other criteria. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 16. In fact, we have recognized that \u201cineffective assistance of counsel constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 for withdrawal of a guilty pleat.]\u201d <em>Hans v. State, </em>283 Mont. 379, 410, 942 P.2d 674, 693 (1997) (internal citations omitted). \u201cWhere a defendant is represented by counsel during the plea process and enters his plea upon the advice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>counsel, the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel\u2019s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 411, 942 P.2d at 693 (internal quotations omitted). Following the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to a guilty plea, the defendant must show (1) that his counsel\u2019s advice fell outside the range of competence demanded of a criminal attorney and (2) but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have entered a guilty plea. <em>Hans, </em>283 Mont. at 410-11, 942 P.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b612 McFarlane asserts that Glade did not adequately prepare him for the change of plea hearing, specifically arguing that Glade told him \u201che had to answer yes to all questions asked by the court in the change of plea hearing.\u201d McFarlane also asserts that Glade failed to inform him of the available defense of \u201cpermission\u201d despite Glade knowing that McFarlane had a key to the Hopkins\u2019 residence. However, McFarlane makes this argument for the first time on appeal. In the District Court, McFarlane did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as a basis for withdrawal of his guilty plea. Neither the briefing in support of his motion to withdraw nor the hearing on the motion directly raises an ineffective assistance argument. While the District Court commented upon McFarlane\u2019s testimony that there \u201cmay be an ineffective assistance of counsel claim or something like that involved,\u201d the District Court was not squarely presented with the issue. We have repeatedly held that this Court considers issues presented for the first time to be untimely and will not consider them. <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12. We refuse to consider new arguments and changes in legal theory on appeal \u201cbecause it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>Adgerson, </em>\u00b6 12. Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of this ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b613 To be clear, we are not presented here with a separate, standalone ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but rather an argument that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness impacted the voluntariness of McFarlane\u2019s plea. As McFarlane\u2019s briefing states, \u201c[a] separate claim of ineffectiveness is not properly addressed in this appeal because ... the record does not fully explain why [Glade] took [the] particular actionf.]\u201d We have explained that \u201c[o]nly when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>340, \u00b6 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b6 14 Second, McFarlane argues that his plea was unintelligent because \u201che was not made aware of a legislatively created defense to the charge of burglary, vis-a-vis, permission.\u201d McFarlane complains that not only did his attorney fail to inform him of the permission defense, but the court\u2019s plea colloquy failed to address the \u201cspecifics\u201d of possible defenses. Therefore, McFarlane asserts that the \u201ccomplete absence of an explanation to the defendant at or before the change of plea hearing of the defense of permission ... requires vacating the guilty plea ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXU\">\u00b615 However, as with his first argument, McFarlane challenges the inadequacy of the plea colloquy for the first time on appeal. We note that, while waiting to review the plea hearing transcript, McFarlane stated in his motion to withdraw that \u201cDefendant anticipates the court\u2019s interrogation will be found to be adequate.\u201d Thereafter, McFarlane\u2019s counsel, then Houtz, did not attack the sufficiency of the plea colloquy at the plea withdrawal hearing. Accordingly, we also decline to review this assertion because it was not presented to the District Court. <em>See Adgerson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b616 Third, McFarlane attacks the voluntariness of his plea on the ground that he did not \u201cunderstand what acts amount to being guilty of [burglary],\u201d and thus contends his guilty plea was not entered intelligently. The State responds that McFarlane\u2019s plea was \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently made\u201d because \u201cMcFarlane knew the direct consequences of his plea\u201d and points to several case specific considerations in support of the District Court\u2019s denial of McFarlane\u2019s motion. We review this claim under the <em>Brady </em>standard to determine if McFarlane entered his guilty plea voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b617 The <em>Brady </em>standard considers a guilty plea to be \u201cvoluntary only when the defendant is \u2018fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel....\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6 21, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1472 (1970)); <em>see also Warclub, </em>\u00b6 18 (reaffirming \u201cour intention to use the <em>Brady </em>standard for the voluntariness of guilty pleas, as articulated in <em>Brady\u201d). </em>\u201c[W]e will not overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea if the defendant was aware of the direct consequences of such a plea, and if his plea was not induced by threats, misrepresentation, or an improper promise such as a bribe.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 32. When determining if a defendant entered a plea voluntarily and whether a district court erred in denying a motion to withdraw a plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>we examine \u201ccase-specific considerations.\u201d These considerations include the adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation, the benefits obtained from a plea bargain, the withdrawal\u2019s timeliness, and other considerations that may affect the credibility of the claims presented. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24, 328 Mont. 397, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24, 121 P.3d 521, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b618 The District Court thoroughly questioned McFarlane before accepting his guilty plea. The record reveals that McFarlane expressed understanding about the charges against him, the maximum penalties for each offense, and his waiver of his right to a trial. McFarlane stated that he was making the plea on his \u201cown free will\u201d and was not threatened prior to making the plea. He testified that he discussed \u201call the consequences\u201d of his plea with counsel and he was \u201csatisfied with the services of [his] attorney, Mr. Glade[.]\u201d The court also asked if McFarlane had discussed possible defenses and the concept of lesser included offenses with his attorney. McFarlane indicated that he had discussed defenses and lesser included offenses with Glade. When asked if he had permission to enter the Hopkins\u2019 residence he responded, \u201cno.\u201d On this basis, the court accepted McFarlane\u2019s plea. Later, at the withdrawal hearing, McFarlane did not challenge his plea on the basis that he was threatened or induced to make the plea. The only argument he squarely presented was that he did not understand the consequences of his guilty plea. However, our review of the record of the change of plea hearing, along with consideration of case specific considerations discussed below, convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b619  First, McFarlane waited approximately two years before seeking withdrawal of his plea. McFarlane fled the jurisdiction after entering his guilty plea and prior to his sentencing, avoiding authorities for two years. His actions indicate an awareness of the consequences of entering a guilty plea and an intention to avoid sentencing penalties by absconding. Moreover, as the State notes, McFarlane\u2019s criminal history includes convictions based on thirteen counts of burglary in six separate criminal proceedings spanning nearly forty years. At the plea withdrawal hearing, McFarlane testified that he had previously pled guilty to approximately seventeen felonies. McF arlane\u2019s experience with the criminal justice system, and burglary charges in particular, cast further doubt on his claims that he was unaware of the permission defense and was confused by the meaning of a guilty plea. Accordingly, McFarlane\u2019s argument that he \u201cmisunderstood\u201d the guilty plea or was \u201cconfused\u201d about its meaning is unpersuasive. We conclude that McFarlane understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>consequences of his plea and failed to establish good cause to support a plea withdrawal. McFarlane\u2019s guilty plea was voluntarily entered and we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of McFarlane\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b620 2. Did McFarlane\u2019s counsel for the motion to withdraw plea provide ineffective assistance of counsel by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">a. Citing to the improper legal standard for a plea withdrawal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b621 McFarlane\u2019s second issue is that counsel on his withdrawal motion, Houtz, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by relying on an improper legal standard for withdrawal of a plea. The State contends that we should refuse to review this claim because the record is \u201csilent\u201d as to why Houtz did not present the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"Abs\">\u00b622 When asserting ineffective assistance of counsel in this context, a defendant must meet the two-pronged <em>Strickland </em>test by showing: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell outside the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his case. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. With respect to the first prong, there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s actions fall within the broad scope of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7. The threshold inquiry to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is whether the allegations of deficient representation can be documented and resolved from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b623 McFarlane\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel stems from Houtz\u2019s use of the <em>Huttinger </em>test when arguing that the court should allow withdrawal of his guilty plea. We relegated formal application of the <em>Huttinger </em>test to history in our decision in <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23, and subsequently adopted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Brady </em>standard in its place. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 18. Accordingly, McFarlane contends that Houtz was ineffective by citing the <em>Huttinger </em>test instead of the <em>Brady </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b624 We have recognized the principle that \u201ccounsel\u2019s erroneous advice on a critical point \u2018cannot be excused as a strategic or tactical judgment, but could have sprung only from a misunderstanding of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Becker, </em>2005 MT 75, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 364, \u00b6 19, 110 P.3d 1, \u00b6 19 (citing <em>United States v. Streater, </em>70 F.3d 1314, 1321 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). As the <em>Brady </em>standard is arguably more lenient to a defendant seeking plea withdrawal than the old <em>Huttinger </em>test, we cannot discern any reason why Houtz would cite the incorrect and potentially less beneficial standard, other than he failed to recognize the change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>law. Therefore, Houtz\u2019s reliance on the antiquated <em>Huttinger </em>test cannot be presumed a tactical judgment call, and we conclude that Houtz\u2019s performance fell outside the range of competence demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"ATF\">\u00b625 McFarlane must also satisfy the burden of showing that Houtz\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his case. McFarlane contends that Houtz\u2019s argument \u201cwithin the confines of the <em>Huttinger </em>test\u201d caused the District Court to consider the promptness of McFarlane\u2019s motion to withdraw, which is \u201cirrelevant to voluntariness[.]\u201d Because of the District Court\u2019s consideration of promptness of his motion, McFarlane argues that \u201cthere is much more than a reasonable probability that the outcome of the hearing would have been different if Houtz had made the appropriate argument regarding voluntariness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b626 The <em>Huttinger </em>test listed three factors for determining if the court should allow the withdrawal of a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">(1) the adequacy of the interrogation by the district court of the defendant\u2019s understanding of the consequence of his plea; (2) the promptness with which the defendant attempts to withdraw the previous plea; and (3) the fact that the plea was the result of a plea bargain in which the guilty plea was given in exchange for dismissal of another charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"><em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19 n. 3. In contrast, the <em>Brady </em>standard focuses on the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a defendant\u2019s plea. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21. We explained in <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23, and again in <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19, that while the <em>Huttinger </em>test is no longer the standard, the <em>Huttinger </em>factors may nonetheless be considered when determining if the plea was voluntarily entered. In fact, \u201ctwo of the criteria from the <em>Huttinger </em>test (the adequacy of colloquy and the existence of plea bargain) bear on the question of voluntariness,\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 23, in addition to other case-specific considerations. Accordingly, consideration of these former <em>Huttinger </em>factors remains appropriate when determining voluntariness under the <em>Brady </em>standard. Therefore, the court did not err when considering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b627 Further, it was not error for the court to consider the promptness of the motion. We have clearly stated that case specific considerations, such as timeliness and reaping the benefit of the bargain, remain relevant. <em>See Muhammad </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Warclub </em>\u00b6 19. The court here considered the totality of the circumstances, including the plea colloquy, the plea agreement, timeliness, and McFarlane\u2019s absconding from justice, and concluded that McFarlane\u2019s motion was little more than \u201can opportunistic attempt\u201d to obtain the benefit of the plea agreement without any of the consequences of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u00b628 Moreover, we have already determined, under Issue I herein, that McFarlane\u2019s plea was entered voluntarily based upon an analysis of voluntariness and case-specific considerations under the <em>Brady </em>standard. Therefore, it is clear that despite Houtz\u2019s improper reliance on <em>Huttinger, </em>the outcome would have been the same under the appropriately cited authority. As such, McFarlane\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not meet the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">b. Failing to challenge the adequacy of the plea colloquy?</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b629 McFarlane also argues that Houtz was ineffective because, as we noted above, he did not challenge the plea colloquy within the motion for plea withdrawal. McFarlane asserts that the District Court\u2019s colloquy was flawed by a failure to enumerate the lesser included offenses of which McFarlane could have been convicted had he proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b630  During the plea colloquy, the court explained the possibility of lesser included offenses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">THE COURT: Now there is this concept of lesser included offenses that may come into play here. I don\u2019t know that there are any under these circumstances, but if you went to trial there is a possibility that a jury might not be able to reach a verdict or might find you not guilty of the charged offense, but instead find you guilty of a lesser included offense. An offense with a lesser penalty. That\u2019s usually a benefit to a Defendant-that possibility at trial, but because there won\u2019t be a trial[,] that lesser included offense possibility won\u2019t be considered. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWn\">MR. MCFARLANE: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Although not enumerating lesser included offenses, the court nonetheless clearly informed McFarlane that he would lose the usually advantageous opportunity to be convicted of any lesser included offenses by entering a guilty plea, and McFarlane acknowledged the loss of that opportunity. Further, while McFarlane complains that this colloquy is insufficient, he fails to demonstrate any lesser included offenses to burglary which would have been applicable under the circumstances of his charge. A court has no duty to inform McFarlane about the possibility of lesser included offenses if such a possibility does not legally exist, <em>see State v. Thee, </em>2001 MT 294, \u00b6 24, 307 Mont. 450, \u00b6 24, 37 P.3d 741, \u00b6 24 (holding that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because there is no duty to inform a client about conviction at trial of a lesser included offense when such a possibility is nonexistent), and thus, McFarlane fails to demonstrate any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>prejudice which could have arisen from this colloquy. Accordingly, McFarlane\u2019s argument that Houtz provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not challenging the sufficiency of the plea colloquy is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
