We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\u00b64 Bob Wilson contacted the Great Falls Police Department early in January of 2005. Mr. Wilson reported bullet-hole damage at the apartment of his daughter, Melissa Wilson. Detective John Schaffer met with Mr. Wilson at his daughter\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">\u00b65 Mr. Wilson handed Detective Schaffer a clipboard with a handwritten map. The map appeared to detail the floor layout of a business. Someone had written the words \u201ccasino,\u201d \u201clounge,\u201d and \u201cliquor store\u201d on the map. Mr. Wilson told Detective Schaffer that he believed the map detailed the layout of either the Lucky Lil\u2019s Casino located on Fox Farm Road (Lucky Lil\u2019s) or an establishment named The Brick. Mr. Wilson also informed Detective Schaffer that his daughter had been dating a guy named Coby.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">\u00b66 Detective Schaffer obtained a search warrant for Melissa Wilson\u2019s (Wilson) apartment. Detective Schaffer\u2019s search revealed several bullet holes in the apartment\u2019s wall. Detective Schaffer recovered a .380 caliber slug from the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">\u00b67 Detective Schaffer went to Lucky Lil\u2019s. The floor plan of the casino closely resembled the floor plan on the handwritten map. Detective Schaffer learned that Wilson recently had quit working at Lucky Lil\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Detective Schaffer grew concerned about the potential for an armed robbery of the casino. Detective Schaffer put out an all-points bulletin notifying officers to locate and stop Wilson\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b68 Detective Schaffer personally stopped Wilson\u2019s car. Wilson\u2019s friend, Jamie Kirkhart (Kirkhart), had been driving the car when Detective Schaffer stopped it. Detective Schaffer arrested Kirkhart pursuant to an active warrant for her arrest. Additional officers collected Kirkhart\u2019s personal property, including Kirkhart\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">\u00b69 Kirkhart asked Detective Schaffer to provide her with a phone number from her cell phone during the arrest. An image taken with the phone\u2019s camera feature appeared as Detective Schaffer turned on the phone. The image that appeared on the phone displays Marler and Wilson sitting together. The image shows Marler holding a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"Av9B\">\u00b610 Detective Schaffer retrieved additional images from the cell phone. One image depicts Marler and two friends, Josh McMunn (McMunn) and Eric Hadnott (Hadnott), sitting together on a couch. The image shows each person displaying a hand-gesture. The image shows Hadnott and Marler holding handguns. Kirkhart told Detective Schaffer that McMunn might have information concerning Marler and Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b611 Detective Schaffer contacted McMunn. McMunn informed Detective Schaffer that Marler had admitted to McMunn to firing a .380 caliber handgun inside Wilson\u2019s apartment. McMunn told Detective Schaffer that Marler and Wilson had attempted to recruit him and Hadnott to assist in robbing Lucky Lil\u2019s. McMunn also told Detective Schaffer that Marler had disclosed to McMunn that he and Wilson needed money in order to move to Tucson, Arizona. McMunn assured Detective Schaffer that he had no interest in assisting Marler and Wilson with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b612 Detective Schaffer learned that Wilson and Marler had been staying at Kirkhart\u2019s residence. The Great Falls Police Department\u2019s high-risk unit traveled to the residence. A car arrived at Kirkhart\u2019s residence as the high-risk unit approached. Hadnott carried a concealed Heckler &amp; Koch USP .40 caliber handgun as he got out of the car. The high-risk unit arrested Hadnott and recovered the handgun. The high-risk unit arrested Marler and Wilson at Kirkhart\u2019s residence. The high-risk unit recovered no additional handguns during the arrests. The Great Falls Police Department recovered an American Arms .380 caliber handgun, however, in a separate investigation. The .380 caliber handgun appeared to match a handgun held by Marler in one of the cell phone images.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u00b613 The State charged Marler with criminal mischief in violation of \u00a7 45-6-101(l)(a), MCA, and conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-102 and 45-5-401, MCA. Wilson unwillingly testified at trial. Wilson testified that the plan to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s had \u201cstarted off as a joke.\u201d She testified that the joke later became a reality. Wilson claimed that she and Marler seriously had considered robbing the casino to fund their plans to move to Tucson, Arizona. Wilson recounted that she and Marler had attempted to recruit McMunn and Hadnott to assist in the robbery. Wilson stated that she and Marler had attempted to recruit McMunn and Hadnott both before and after the plan to rob the casino had become serious. Wilson stated that McMunn and Hadnott did not explicitly agree to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s. She insisted, however, that \u201c[w]hatever we wanted to do, they were there with us.\u201d Wilson stated that she, Marler, McMunn and Hadnott comprised a \u201cfamily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b614 The State questioned Wilson at trial about the holes in her apartment wall. Wilson stated that she and Marler had shot the holes in the wall. The State submitted a .380 caliber handgun into evidence. Wilson stated that she and Marler had used the .380 caliber handgun to shoot the wall. Wilson identified the handgun as the one that she and Marler had used based upon some modifications she had made to the gun\u2019s trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b615 Wilson also testified concerning the cell phone images discovered by Detective Schaffer. Wilson testified that the hand-gestures displayed by Marler, McMunn, and Hadnott in one of the images stood for \u201cModern Outlaw\u201d and represented solidarity among the group. Wilson acknowledged that the same gun admitted as evidence at trial appeared in Marler\u2019s hand in at least one of the cell phone images. She stated that the cell phone\u2019s camera took both photos on the same day, approximately two weeks before her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b616 Detective Schaffer testified concerning his investigation of the plan to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s. He testified that Wilson\u2019s father had provided him with a hand-drawn map that detailed the floor plan of the casino. Detective Schaffer stated that he had found three bullet holes in the wall of Wilson\u2019s apartment. He also stated that he had recovered a .380 caliber slug from the wall. Detective Schaffer stated that he had information that Marler and Wilson had been living together. Detective Schaffer also recounted the statements that McMunn had made to him during their interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b617 McMunn also testified. McMunn stated that he was not close to Wilson. McMunn denied that he, Marler, Wilson, and Hadnott comprised a \u201cfamily.\u201d McMunn stated that Wilson had lied about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>willingness to assist with the plan to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s. McMunn claimed that he had lied to Detective Schaffer about Marler\u2019s plans to move to Tucson. McMunn also claimed that he had lied when he had told Detective Schaffer that Marler had admitted shooting a .380 caliber handgun at Wilson\u2019s apartment wall. McMunn admitted that he had changed his story to \u201c[protect] the guy.\u201d The State asked McMunn if he was \u201cnot being honest [at trial] because you don\u2019t want [Marler] to get in trouble?\u201d McMunn replied \u201cCorrect.\u201d McMunn subsequently contradicted that statement. McMunn claimed that he had lied only when speaking with Detective Schaffer. McMunn asserted that he had been testifying truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b618 McMunn contended that he truthfully had told Detective Schaffer that Marler had approached McMunn and Hadnott about robbing Lucky Lil\u2019s. McMunn claimed that the plan to rob the casino simply constituted a joke at the time that Marler had attempted to recruit assistance. McMunn also stated that he truthfully had told Detective Schaffer that he had no interest in participating in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b619 Marler moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery at the close of the State\u2019s evidence. Marler argued that the State had failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence of Wilson\u2019s accomplice testimony as required by \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. Marler asserted that McMunn met the definition of an accomplice as either \u201cresponsible or legally accountable for the same offense ....\u201d Marler asserted that insufficient evidence existed to corroborate Wilson\u2019s testimony when discounting McMunn\u2019s testimony. The District Court denied Marler\u2019s motion. The jury convicted Marler of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b620 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict. <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 19. A district court properly grants a motion for a directed verdict only when no evidence exists upon which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">\u00b621 Marler argues that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. Marler contends that insufficient independent evidence existed to corroborate Wilson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>testimony that Marler shot holes in Wilson\u2019s apartment wall and conspired with her to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b622  Section 46-16-213, MCA, provides that an accomplice\u2019s testimony alone cannot establish a person\u2019s guilt. A trier of fact may not find a person guilty solely from an accomplice\u2019s testimony \u201cunless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence that in itself and without the aid of the testimony of the one responsible or legally accountable for the same offense tends to connect the defendant ...\u201d with the crime. Section 46-16-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b623  Evidence may corroborate accomplice testimony sufficiently even though standing alone it fails to support a conviction or fails to make out a prima facia case against the defendant. <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 24, 325 Mont. 27, \u00b6 24, 103 P.3d 1037, \u00b6 24. Circumstantial evidence, disputed evidence, or evidence that is consistent with innocent conduct may suffice to corroborate accomplice testimony. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 24. Evidence fails to corroborate accomplice testimony sufficiently if it reveals nothing more than a crime\u2019s occurrence or the circumstances of the crime\u2019s commission. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b624 Marler argues on appeal that insufficient evidence exists to corroborate Wilson\u2019s statement that he had shot her apartment wall. Marler moved the District Court for a directed verdict of acquittal, however, only on the conspiracy to commit robbery charge. We therefore consider only whether sufficient evidence exists to corroborate Wilson\u2019s testimony regarding the conspiracy to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b625 Wilson testified that the plan to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s began as a joke. Wilson stated that she and Marler became serious about the conspiracy to rob the casino after she and Marler had made plans to leave town. Wilson continually employed the terms \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d in her testimony regarding the plan to rob the casino. Wilson explained that the term \u201cus\u201d denoted Marler and Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b626 Wilson admitted to drawing a map of the floor layout of Lucky Lil\u2019s. She identified the map at trial. She testified that the X\u2019s on the map represented exits. She testified that the plan to rob the casino required armed individuals to \u201ccover\u201d each of the exits. Wilson stated that she and Marler had attempted to recruit McMunn and Hadnott to assist with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u00b627 Detective Schaffer provided some corroboration of Wilson\u2019s testimony. Detective Schaffer stated that he had received information that Marler and Wilson had a close relationship and lived together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>McMunn had told Detective Schaffer that Marler had stated that he and Wilson had made plans to leave town. McMunn also had told Detective Schaffer that Marler and Wilson had attempted to recruit McMunn and Hadnott to assist with the robbery, though the robbery was simply a joke at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b628 Detective Schaffer testified that he had learned that Marler and Wilson had moved out of Wilson\u2019s apartment and were staying temporarily at Kirkhart\u2019s apartment. The arrest of Hadnott and the confiscation of his weapon outside Kirkhart\u2019s apartment further supports the testimony that Marler had attempted to recruit armed assistance for the robbery. Hadnott\u2019s presence outside Kirkhart\u2019s apartment constitutes circumstantial evidence of Marler\u2019s involvement in a conspiracy to commit armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b629 The cell phone images further corroborate Wilson\u2019s testimony regarding her relationship with Marler, his relationship with McMunn and Hadnott, and the plan to commit armed robbery. One cell phone image depicts Marler and Wilson sitting together, with Wilson sitting on Marler\u2019s lap. Another image reveals Marler, McMunn, and Hadnott sitting in close proximity together on a couch. All three display the same hand-gesture. Both cell phone images show Marler holding a handgun. One image displays Hadnott and Marler holding handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"A16\">\u00b630 McMunn\u2019s interview statements and trial testimony also corroborated Wilson\u2019s testimony. McMunn\u2019s interview statements indicated that Marler had plans to leave town and had a need for funds. Furthermore, McMunn testified that his interview statement regarding Marler\u2019s recruiting attempt constituted one of only two true statements he had made to Detective Schaffer. This statement connects Marler with the conspiracy, even if he made the statement at a time when the conspiracy remained in its infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b631 Marler contends that McMunn qualifies as \u201cone responsible or legally accountable for the same offense ...\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. Marler argues that the District Court should have discounted any corroboration stemming from McMunn\u2019s out of court statements to Detective Schaffer. The State counters that the District Court found sufficient corroboration solely from the cell phone images and close relationship between Marler and Wilson. The State further asserts that the District Court properly left to the jury the task of determining whether McMunn constituted an accomplice under \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\">\u00b632 We need not determine whether McMunn constituted an accomplice to the conspiracy to rob Lucky Lil\u2019s. <em>State v. Blackcrow, </em>1999 MT 44, \u00b6 23, 293 Mont. 374, \u00b6 23, 975 P.2d 1253, \u00b6 23. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>determine only whether any rational trier of fact could have found that McMunn was not legally accountable for the conspiracy, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Blackcrow, </em>\u00b6 23. Disputed evidence presents a question of fact properly determined by the jury. <em>Blackcrow, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b633 Wilson\u2019s statements implicated McMunn as a co-conspirator. Wilson testified that she, Marler, McMunn and Hadnott comprised a \u201cfamily.\u201d Wilson stated that although McMunn did not explicitly agree to help rob Lucky Lil\u2019s, \u201c[wjhatever we wanted to do, [McMunn and Hadnott] were there with us.\u201d The cell phone image of Marler, Hadnott, and McMunn sitting together on a couch, each displaying the same hand-gesture, further connected McMunn with the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">\u00b634 McMunn\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, contradicted Wilson\u2019s characterization of the group\u2019s relationship. McMunn denied that the group comprised a \u201cfamily.\u201d He testified that he had no intention of assisting in the robbery of Lucky Lil\u2019s. McMunn also testified that he had expressed this fact to Detective Schaffer early in the investigation. Indeed, McMunn\u2019s testimony that he had no intention to help rob the casino constituted one of only two statements at trial that remained consistent with McMunn\u2019s interview statements to Detective Schaffer.</p>\n<p id=\"Az2\">\u00b635 The District Court correctly did not resolve conflicting testimony regarding McMunn\u2019s status as an accomplice with regard to \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA, at the directed verdict stage. <em>Blackcrow, </em>\u00b6 21. We need not consider in the present appeal whether the jury ultimately determined McMunn\u2019s status as an accomplice. Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, however, required the District Court to review all evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. We too must consider McMunn a non-accomplice when undertaking a <em>de novo </em>review of Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, given the conflicting testimony presented at trial concerning his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b636  The State presented independent evidence tending to connect Marler with the conspiracy to commit robbery, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution. Section 46-16-213, MCA, requires nothing more. <em>See State v. Fey, </em>2000 MT 211, \u00b6 21, 301 Mont. 28, \u00b6 21, 7 P.3d 358, \u00b6 21. We conclude that the District Court correctly denied Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b147-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Aym\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u00b638 I dissent. I would conclude there was insufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b639 The elements of the crime of conspiracy are set forth in \u00a7 45-4-102(1), MCA. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">(1) A person commits the offense of conspiracy when, with the purpose that an offense be committed, he agrees with another to the commission of that offense. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit an offense unless an act in furtherance of such agreement has been committed by him or by a coconspirator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAO\">First, there was a total failure of proof that any \u201cact in furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy was committed. However, as the parties did not raise this issue, I proceed to address the Court\u2019s rationale for affirming Marler\u2019s conviction. In this connection, I submit that we cannot accept all of the \u201ccorroborating facts\u201d upon which the Court relies, and if we accept those facts the jury was entitled to consider, there was wholly insufficient evidence independent of the coconspirators\u2019 testimony to establish that Marler agreed with others to commit the offense of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b640 I disagree with the Court\u2019s assertion at \u00b6 35 that \u201cwe too\u201d must consider McMunn a non-accomplice when undertaking a review of Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The problem is that we are alone in our determination that McMunn is a non-accomplice. In this regard, the District Court record is instructive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">COURT: [Ijnsofar that the State is relying on the testimony of Ms. Wilson and Mr. McMunn to corroborate or establish the involvement or linkage between Mr. Marler and this conspiracy, those people are co-conspirators on the evidence that we have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">COURT: Before we get to what [defense counsel] has to say about [the status of McMunn], let me tell you why it seems to me that that is the case on this evidence, is that Ms. Wilson testified squarely and unequivocally that Mr. McMunn, as well as Mr. Marler, were involved in this substantially from very early on, and that they were, in her words, \u201cdown with it,\u201d and in [the prosecutor\u2019s] words, \u201ccompletely on board with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">And Mr. McMunn has denied that. And that\u2019s a question of fact, I guess, for the jury that I don\u2019t need to resolve nor can I resolve it here at the moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">But there\u2019s certainly evidence that is strong here that Mr. McMunn was, in fact, a co-conspirator, notwithstanding his denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Given that the District Court did <em>not </em>presume McMunn to be a non-accomplice, we should not be premising our analysis upon such a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b641 In reviewing the District Court\u2019s denial of Marler\u2019s motion \u201cour review is limited to whether any rational trier of fact, in viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found that [McMunn] was not implicated in the commission of those crimes, and that therefore [his] testimony required no further corroboration.\u201d <em>Blackcrow, </em>\u00b6 23. Here, I find the Court\u2019s assumption that McMunn is a non-accomplice difficult to accept, not only given the record as set forth above, but also given the fact that the evidence upon which the Court relies to prove the existence of the conspiracy also directly implicates McMunn as part and parcel of that conspiracy. The Court asserts that the cell phone pictures are proof of the existence of a conspiracy; McMunn is in those pictures in a manner indicating his membership in the \u201cModern Outlaws.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 29. Moreover, another co-conspirator, Wilson, testified that McMunn was involved in the conspiracy. Opinion, \u00b6 33. Indeed, as noted by the District Court, the prosecution itself believed that McMunn was a part of the conspiracy. Upon what specific evidence, then, does the Court assume that McMunn was a non-accomplice? The only possible evidence to support this position is McMunn\u2019s statement that he was not involved in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b642 In truth, the Court would have it both ways: On the one hand, the Court finds that cell phone images of Marler, McMunn, and Hadnott, and the statements made by McMunn, directly implicate Marler in a conspiracy. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29,30. On the other hand, the Court examines exactly the same evidence to conclude that McMunn is not a part of this conspiracy based on his statements to the contrary. This analysis is inherently inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b643 It bears noting that the District Court did not ultimately ask the jury to make any determination regarding McMunn\u2019s accountability, nor were any jury instructions given as to the ramifications of McMunn\u2019s status as an accomplice or non-accomplice. Therefore, we don\u2019t know <em>how </em>the jury viewed McMunn\u2019s status-either it presumed that McMunn was an accomplice, thus precluding any lawful reliance upon his testimony to establish Marler\u2019s guilt, or that he was not. In any event, because the District Court judge did not presume for purposes of the directed verdict that McMunn was a non-accomplice, neither should we. I therefore submit we have unwisely deviated from the considered approach we have applied to our review of motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>a directed verdict under <em>Blackcrow, </em>and that we err by elevating McMunn to the status of a non-accomplice in order to justify our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b644 According to the Court, the remaining corroborative evidence against Marler (other than McMunn\u2019s testimony) consisted of: (1) Marler and Wilson lived together and had plans to leave town (Opinion, \u00b6 27); (2) Hadnott\u2019s presence outside Kirkhart\u2019s apartment (Opinion, \u00b6 28); and (3) the cell phone images on Kirkhart\u2019s phone (Opinion, \u00b6 29). These \u201cpieces of evidence\u201d do not in any way \u201ctend to connect the defendant\u201d with the crime of conspiracy to commit a robbery. Section 46-16-213, MCA. While we have held that evidence that is \u201cpossibly consistent with innocent conduct\u201d may suffice to corroborate accomplice testimony (Opinion, \u00b6 23; <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 24), we have also cautioned that corroborating evidence \u201c \u2018must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 28 (quoting <em>State v. Kemp, </em>182 Mont. 383, 387, 597 P.2d 96, 99 (1979)). The above evidence simply does not, under the most generous of conjectures, raise <em>more than </em>a suspicion that Marler was involved in a conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"ATm\">\u00b645 That Marler lived with Wilson and was acquainted with the others, and even that he at one time possessed a gun-a gun never connected to the conspiracy-does not support more than a conclusion that Marler hung out with a rough crowd, held a gun for a photo, and liked to act like a tough guy. Such facts could indict hundreds of thousands of immature males; however, they barely support even \u201ca suspicion\u201d that Marler might have been involved in a conspiracy to commit robbery. Under our jurisprudence as set forth in <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Burkhart, </em>this is not enough. Therefore, I would conclude the District Court erred in denying Marler\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, and I would reverse his conviction. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-5\">JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART join in the Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
