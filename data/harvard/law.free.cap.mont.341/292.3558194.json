We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b62 Wilkes presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b63 Whether the WCC properly determined that the sole reliance on actual wage loss in \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, in determining permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits does not violate Wilkes\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b64 Wilkes worked principally as a farmer. He operated his farm as a sole proprietorship. Wilkes elected not to be covered under a workers\u2019 compensation plan through his farm operation. Wilkes worked part-time as a school bus driver. Wilkes\u2019s employer maintained workers\u2019 compensation insurance through State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b65 Wilkes suffered a serious injury in the course and scope of his employment as a school bus driver on March 26, 2002. He sustained a permanent neck injury. State Fund accepted liability and paid to Wilkes medical benefits and temporary total disability benefits. Wilkes\u2019s bus driving job constitutes light-duty labor. Wilkes returned to his part-time bus driving job when he achieved maximum medical improvement. He earns the same wage now as a bus driver that he earned before his injury. Wilkes\u2019s farming duties constitute heavy labor. Wilkes has not been able to resume farming since his injury, however, even after reaching maximum medical improvement. He has been forced to lease out his farming operation as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b66 State Fund determined that Wilkes was not eligible for PPD benefits after he achieved maximum medical improvement. State Fund denied Wilkes\u2019s PPD benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-703(5), MCA, in light of the fact that Wilkes had suffered no actual wage loss from his bus driving job. Wilkes petitioned the WCC for a hearing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA. Wilkes argued that \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the Montana Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. He asserted that the statute impermissibly bases PPD benefits solely on actual wage loss instead of considering other relevant factors, such as age, education, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>lifting restrictions. The statute\u2019s PPD calculation, according to Wilkes, treats unequally similarly situated classes of workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b67 Wilkes and State Fund filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The WCC determined that \u00a7 39-71-703(5), MCA, properly distinguished workers with actual wage loss from workers without actual wage loss in awarding PPD benefits. Wilkes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b68 The WCC based its decision on its interpretation of constitutional law. We engage in plenary review of questions of constitutional law. <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. </em>Corp., 2003 MT 80, \u00b6 9, 315 Mont. 51, \u00b6 9, 67 P.3d 290, \u00b6 9. We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Reesor v. Montana State Fund, </em>2004 MT 370, \u00b6 6, 325 Mont. 1, \u00b6 6, 103 P.3d 1019, \u00b6 6. We presume statutes to be constitutional. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the WCC properly determined that the sole reliance on actual wage loss in \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, in determining PPD benefits does not violate Wilkes\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b6 10 The Legislature previously calculated PPD benefits by considering the injured worker\u2019s age at the time of injury, the injured worker\u2019s education, and the injured worker\u2019s lifting restrictions. Section 39-71-703(a), (b), (d), MCA (1993). The injured worker\u2019s actual wage loss represented just one factor. Section 39-71-703(c), MCA (1993). The Legislature amended the statute in 1995, however, to eliminate the other factors. Mont. S. 375, 54th Leg, Reg. Sess. (March 24,1995). The statute now grants a worker PPD benefits only if the worker can show actual wage loss. Section 39-71-703(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u00b611 Wilkes argues that the new statute violates his constitutional right to equal protection. Wilkes asserts that \u00a7 39-71-703(l)(a), MCA, creates two similarly situated classes of workers: (1) permanently partially disabled workers with actual wage loss who suffer reduced earning capacity; and (2) permanently partially disabled workers without actual wage loss who nevertheless suffer reduced earning capacity. Wilkes argues that denying PPD benefits to workers who suffer reduced earning capacity, but who do not suffer actual wage loss, impermissibly compensates similarly situated workers differently.</p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">\u00b612 The U.S. Constitution and the Montana Constitution provide that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>no person shall be denied equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const, amend XIV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 4. Montana\u2019s equal protection clause ensures that \u201cMontana\u2019s citizens are not subject to arbitrary and discriminatory state action.\u201d <em>Bustell v. AIG Claims Services, </em>Inc., 2004 MT 362, \u00b6 19, 324 Mont. 478, \u00b6 19, 105 P.3d 286, \u00b6 19. We address equal protection claims concerning workers\u2019 compensation statutes using a two part analysis. We determine first whether the State has created a classification that treats differently two or more similarly situated groups. <em>Bustell, </em>\u00b6 20. If the claim satisfies the first step, we next determine whether a legitimate governmental purpose rationally relates to the discriminatory classification. <em>Bustell, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b613 The WCC relied principally on <em>Powell v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877, to conclude that Wilkes had failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, created two similarly situated classes of workers. We considered in <em>Powell </em>whether \u00a7 39-71-1107, MCA, created a discriminatory classification by compensating injured workers\u2019 caregivers differently depending on whether the caregivers were in-home family members or were professional non-family members. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 15. We identified two classes at issue in <em>Powell: </em>(1) \u201cfamily member caregivers who are subject to the limitation on compensation,\u201d and (2) \u201cnon-family member caregivers who are not subject to the limitation on compensation.\u201d <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b614 We noted that the care that a family member provides may be identical to the care a non-family member provides. We determined, however, that the classes were not similarly situated for several reasons. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 24. The family member\u2019s care-giving duties included primarily tasks that the family member would have performed before the accident. The family member could provide \u201cpassive supervision\u201d that would allow the caregiver to pursue other normal activities simultaneously. And the family member caregiver generally possessed a lower skill level than the professional. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 24. We deemed these differences to be more important than any similarities between the classes. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b615 The WCC analogized <em>Powell </em>to Wilkes\u2019s case. The WCC noted the numerous attributes that the two classes at issue in this case share. Members of the two classes have suffered work-related injuries, have reached maximum medical improvement, have permanent physical impairment, have suffered lost earning capacity, and rely on \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, as their exclusive remedy. Actual wage loss constitutes the single distinction between the classes. The WCC noted, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Legislature\u2019s declaration of public policy for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in which it declared that \u201cthe wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-71-105(1), MCA. The WCC determined that actual wage loss constituted \u201ca fundamental distinction, in light of the Legislature\u2019s express public policy that wage loss benefits should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b616 Wilkes advances several arguments to support his contention that the WCC incorrectly determined that the two classes were dissimilar. Wilkes first contends that <em>Powell </em>does not support the WCC\u2019s conclusion. Wilkes argues that the <em>Powell </em>classes contained more significant differences than the single distinction at issue here-actual wage loss. Wilkes asserts that <em>Reesor </em>and <em>Snetsinger v. Montana University System, </em>2004 MT 390, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445, constitute better authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b617 We considered in <em>Reesor </em>whether a statute violated claimants\u2019 equal protection rights by providing for the termination of PPD benefits upon the claimant reaching the age at which the claimant became eligible for social security. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 7. We determined that the statute created two largely identical classes: \u201c(1) PPD eligible claimants who receive or are eligible to receive social security retirement benefits; and (2) PPD claimants who do not receive and are not eligible to receive social security retirement benefits.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 10. Age constituted the only identifiable distinguishing factor between the two classes. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12. We deemed the claimant\u2019s age to be unrelated to the claimant\u2019s ability to engage in meaningful employment. We concluded that the classes were similarly situated, and we proceeded with the equal protection analysis. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"AeK\">\u00b618 We considered in <em>Snetsinger </em>whether the Montana University System\u2019s policy that barred same-sex domestic partners from receiving insurance coverage violated employees\u2019 equal protection rights. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 12. The district court determined that the policy created two dissimilar classes, distinguished by the fact that only one class had dependents, defined as certain children and spouses under the University\u2019s policy. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 20. We rejected as illusory the district court\u2019s distinction. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 27. The University\u2019s definition of \u201cspouse\u201d included unmarried opposite-sex partners who had signed an \u201cAffidavit of Common Law Marriage.\u201d <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 22. Montana law does not support this definition of spouse. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. We concluded that the two classes were similarly situated absent a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>legal definition of spouse supporting the marital status of unmarried opposite-sex partners but not unmarried same-sex partners. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b619 <em>Reesor </em>and <em>Snetsinger </em>do not support Wilkes\u2019s contention that \u00a7 39-71-703(l)(a), MCA, creates two similar classes. Wilkes contends that \u00a7 39-71-703(l)(a), MCA, like the statute in <em>Reesor, </em>creates two largely identical classes distinguished by a single factor - actual wages. Wilkes oversimplifies our analysis in <em>Reesor. </em>We did not determine in <em>Reesor </em>that the two classes were similarly situated merely because a single factor distinguished them. We determined that, age, the single factor at issue, was also \u201cunrelated to a person\u2019s ability to engage in meaningful employment.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12. In other words, we concluded that the two classes were similarly situated because age was irrelevant to the statute\u2019s underlying justification.</p>\n<p id=\"AN5\">\u00b620 Here, however, we agree with the WCC that actual wage loss constitutes \u201ca fundamental distinction ....\u201d The WCC correctly noted the significance of the Legislature\u2019s express public policy that \u201cthe wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-71-105(1). The distinguishing factor between the two classes, actual wage loss, plainly relates to the underlying justification of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b621 Wilkes also contends that actual wage loss constitutes an illusory distinction in the same manner as the distinction in <em>Snetsinger. </em>Wilkes argues that PPD claimants are otherwise similarly situated with regard to benefits for age, education, and lifting restrictions because those factors independently establish reduced earning capacity. Wilkes asserts that actual wage loss constitutes an illusory distinction because it comprises just one factor in reducing an injured worker\u2019s earning capacity. Wilkes urges that age, education, and lifting restrictions should not be conflated with actual wage loss in order to deny PPD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b622 Wilkes\u2019s definition of an illusory distinction does not follow our decision in <em>Snetsinger. </em>We concluded in <em>Snetsinger </em>that marital status was an illusory distinction because it included a definition of spouse not supported by Montana law. The policy\u2019s definition of spouse represented an invalid justification for denying unmarried same-sex couples insurance benefits while allowing them to unmarried opposite-sex couples. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23,27. Montana law, by contrast, clearly supports the use of actual wage loss as the primary factor in awarding PPD benefits. Sections 39-71-703 and 39-71-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u00b623 Wilkes suggests that the primary factor in awarding PPD benefits <em>should be </em>reduced earning capacity as demonstrated by age, education, and lifting restrictions. Although attractive, Wilkes cannot demonstrate any valid authority to support this contention. Wilkes refers instead to a repealed version of the workers\u2019 compensation statute for support. Age, education, and lifting restrictions constituted factors to determine PPD benefits pursuant to the pre-1995 version of \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA(1993). The Legislature amended \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, to exclude those factors in 1995. Mont. S. 375, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess. (March 24, 1995). Actual wage loss represents the primary factor for determining PPD benefits under the amended statute. Section 39-71-703(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b624 Wilkes also supports his contention that PPD benefits compensate for reduced earning capacity by citing decisions of this Court that interpreted pre-1995 formulations of workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>E.g. Hale v. Royal Logging, </em>1999 MT 302, 297 Mont. 165, 990 P.2d 1245; <em>Chagnon v. Telleman Motor Co., </em>259 Mont. 21, 855 P.2d 1002 (1993); <em>Shaffer v. Midland Empire Packing Co., </em>127 Mont. 211, 259 P.2d 340 (1953); <em>Meznarich v. Republic Coal Co., </em>101 Mont. 78, 53 P.2d 82 (1935). Wilkes can point to no authority interpreting the amended version of \u00a739-71-703, MCA, however, that provides that PPD benefits should be determined on the basis of the claimant\u2019s reduced earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b625 We do not dispute that Wilkes\u2019s claims may be valid under pre1995 statutory and decisional law, but the Legislature\u2019s 1995 amendments to \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, have rendered those claims baseless. We agree with the WCC that our reasoning in <em>Powell </em>controls. We determined in <em>Powell </em>that the differences between the two classes at issue were more important than the similarities. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 24. We held that the equal protection challenge in <em>Powell </em>failed because the two classes were not similarly situated. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 26. Wilkes correctly asserts several important similarities exist between the two classes in this case. Both classes have suffered work related injuries. Both have reached maximum medical improvement. Both have physical impairment. Both have suffered lost earning capacity. And both rely on \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, as their exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b626  A single difference exists, however, in the form of actual wage loss. The WCC correctly concluded that this difference was fundamental, in light of the Legislature\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-70-105(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>MCA. Actual wage loss sufficiently distinguishes the two putative classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b627 Wilkes also advances a thoughtful policy argument demonstrating that age, education, and lifting restrictions constitute more equitable factors to determine PPD benefits. Wilkes\u2019s policy argument, however, does not demonstrate that the two classes created by \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA, are similarly situated pursuant to Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
