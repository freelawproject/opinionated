We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction as untimely filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">\u00b64 On May 24, 2006, Molnar filed a complaint alleging that the Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) violated federal and state law by its May 25, 1999, order entered in Docket No. D99.4.82 (1999 Order) granting exempt wholesale generator, or EWG, status to Pennsylvania Power and Light of Montana (PPLM). Molnar\u2019s complaint alleged that the PSC was without authority to grant EWG status and requested the District Court to set aside the 1999 Order. However, the District Court determined that because both \u00a7\u00a7 69-3-402(1) and 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA, required a petition for judicial review of an agency\u2019s decision to be filed within thirty days of the decision, it lacked jurisdiction to review Molnar\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, on September 6, 2006, the court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Appellees PSC and PPLM, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Molnar appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">\u00b65 We review de novo a district corut\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City-County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 339, \u00b6 13, 160 P.3d 552, \u00b6 13. Amotion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) has the effect of admitting all well-pleaded allegations in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>complaint. <em>Meagher, </em>\u00b6 13. The complaint is construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all allegations of fact contained therein are taken as true. <em>Meagher, </em>\u00b6 13. The determination whether a complaint states a claim is a conclusion of law. <em>Plouffe v. State, </em>2003 MT 62, \u00b6 8, 314 Mont. 413, \u00b6 8, 66 P.3d 316, \u00b6 8. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine if interpretation of the law was correct. <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction as untimely filed?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b66 Molnar argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his complaint because the thirty-day statutes of limitation either did not apply or were tolled. PSC and PPLM reply that the District Court correctly applied the statutory thirty-day time limitation on appeals from agency decisions and that this Court need not reach the merits of Molnar\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b67 We have held that only the Legislature may validly provide for judicial review of agency decisions. <em>Nye v. Dept. of Livestock, </em>196 Mont. 222, 226, 639 P.2d 498, 500 (1982). As such, a court\u2019s authority to review administrative rulings is constrained by statute. <em>In re McGurran, </em>1999 MT 192, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 357, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 968, \u00b6 12. This includes the applicable statutes of limitation governing the time for review. <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 12. Accordingly, we have determined that \u201cfiling deadlines for petitions for judicial review are jurisdictional in nature, and the failure to seek judicial review of an administrative ruling within the time prescribed by statute makes such an \u2018appeal\u2019 ineffective for any purpose.\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 12. We faced this same issue involving the same agency in <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. PSC </em>and explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction is controlled by the period of time prescribed by the legislature and is limited to the time provided by the applicable statute. The right to an appeal of an administrative agency\u2019s ruling is created by statute and is limited by the provisions of the statute as to the time within which the right must be asserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">260 Mont. 175, 178, 858 P.2d 364, 366 (1993). <em>See also Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>2002 MT 8, \u00b6 18, 308 Mont. 111, \u00b6 18, 39 P.3d 697, \u00b6 18 (\u201ca court\u2019s jurisdiction to review administrative decisions is statutorily created and limited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b68 Here, two statutes governing judicial review of agency decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>may apply. First, the Legislature provided that PSC decisions are reviewable pursuant to \u00a7 69-3-402(1), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Any party in interest being dissatisfied with an order of the commission fixing any rate, fare, charge, classification, or joint rate or any order fixing any regulation, practice, or service may, within 30 days, commence an action in the district court ... to vacate and set aside any such order ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Second, more generally, the Montana Administrative Procedure Act provides that \u201cproceedings for review must be instituted by filing a petition in district court within 30 days after service of the final written decision of the agency....\u201d Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA. Review under \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, is reserved for \u201ccontested cases.\u201d <em>See Nye, </em>196 Mont. at 226, 639 P.2d at 500-01 (stating that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review\u201d under \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA). However, because application of either \u00a7 2-4-702 or \u00a7 69-3-402(1), MCA, containing identical thirty-day limitation periods, yields the same result under the facts alleged, we need not analyze whether the 1999 Order constituted a \u201ccontested case\u201d to decide this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b69  The time for seeking judicial review of the PSC\u2019s 1999 Order ran for thirty days following issuance of the order in May 1999. The complaint was filed in May of2006, nearly seven years after the period for judicial review ended. Because the thirty-day time limit to seek review of agency decisions had expired when the complaint was filed, the District Court was without jurisdiction under either statute to entertain the request for judicial review of the 1999 Order. Of course, the District Court possessed general subject matter jurisdiction to review the agency decision, but did not have authority \u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 12, from the Legislature to entertain a petition for review filed beyond the time limit provided in the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b610 However, Molnar argues that the statutes of limitation were either inapplicable or were tolled, raising five arguments: (1) the public hearing conducted prior to issuance of the 1999 Order was not properly noticed, thereby resulting in an illegal action by the PSC which may be reviewed without any time restraints; (2) the statutes governing the PSC provide \u201cabsolutely nothing of precision\u201d which would authorize the action it took and thus, the doctrine of <em>expressio unium est exclusio alterius </em>applies and leaves the PSC with \u201cno jurisdiction to grant exempt wholesale generator status\u201d to PPLM; (3) the PSC has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201ccontinuing relationship\u201d with Montana citizens, making the 1999 Order voidable at any time; (4) the PSC and PPLM concealed crucial facts from the public, thereby breaching its fiduciary duty and tolling the thirty-day time periods until the facts were discovered; and (5) the doctrine of equitable tolling applies because of the lack of proper notice and the lack of the PSC\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b611 First, even assuming that the subject time period may be tolled, arguments (3), (4), and (5) are raised for the first time on appeal. We have repeatedly held that this Court considers issues presented for the first time to be untimely and will not consider them. <em>Point Serv. Corp. v. Myers, </em>2005 MT 322, \u00b6 31, 329 Mont. 502, \u00b6 31, 125 P.3d 1107, \u00b6 31 (relying on <em>Day v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1996)). This includes new arguments and changes in legal theory. <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 276, 929 P.2d at 866. The rationale for this rule is that we refuse to fault a trial court \u201c \u2018for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u2019 \u201d <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 276, 929 P.2d at 866 (quoting 5 Am. Jur. <em>2d. Appellate Review, </em>\u00a7 690, pp. 360-61 (1995)). Consequently, we refuse to review these new arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b612 Molnar\u2019s remaining two arguments are framed as jurisdictional and are intertwined. As mentioned, he argues that because the public hearing for the 1999 Order was not properly noticed, and because the PSC\u2019s governing statutes do not mention EWG status, the thirty-day time limit does not apply because the PSC did not have \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to enter the order, and jurisdictional claims can be raised at any time. Essentially, Molnar\u2019s claims are that the PSC acted outside of its statutory authority, both in procedure and in substance. However, Molnar does not cite any legal authority for the proposition that where an agency acts outside of its statutory authority, petitions for judicial review challenging that action need not comply with statutes governing the timing of those petitions. Molnar would have this Court grant him a limitless time period in which to file a petition for judicial review simply because he has pled his claim as one challenging the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. There is no support for such a conclusion and the argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b613  We conclude that the thirty-day statute of limitations was neither tolled nor inapplicable. Consequently, the District Court properly dismissed Molnar\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AqH\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b615 I concur in our Opinion. I also conclude that this appeal was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds and was frivolous under M. R. App. P. 19(5). As a result, I would award attorney fees and costs on appeal in favor of the PSC and PPLM and against Molnar.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b616 To begin with, Molnar\u2019s complaint, filed nearly seven years beyond the statute of limitations, misrepresented the facts and the law. While Molnar complains about the PSC\u2019s 1999 decision, he never appeared before the PSC and never offered objections to its decision. Moreover, as argued by PPLM, it is doubtful that Molnar even had standing to file his lawsuit as he was never a customer of Northwestern Energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b617 Molnar\u2019s lawsuit was dead on arrival in the District Court and, properly, was summarily dismissed. On appeal, Molnar flaunts the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. The sole issue on appeal involves the trial court\u2019s determination to dismiss Molnar\u2019s petition for judicial review as being time-barred. Yet Molnar barely addresses that issue-arguing instead (and poorly at that) the merits of his underlying claim and theories that were not raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b618 M. R. App. P. 19(5) provides that this Court \u201cmay... sua sponte[] award sanctions to the prevailing party in an appeal... determined to be frivolous ... or taken without substantial or reasonable grounds. Sanctions may include costs, attorney fees, or such other monetary or non-monetary penalty as the supreme court deems proper under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b619 In my view, this appeal-not to mention the underlying lawsuit itself-was taken without substantial or reasonable grounds and was frivolous. Therefore, I would award attorney fees and costs on appeal in favor of the PSC and PPLM and against Molnar. There is no reason that taxpayers and ratepayers should have to fund the defense of this nonsense and there is no reason that the courts should have to deal with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b620 With that caveat, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
