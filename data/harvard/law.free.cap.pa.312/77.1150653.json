Two years and eight months later a bill of particulars was ordered. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>was not filed until September, 1931, though it does not appear that the time for filing it was extended. Libellant might therefore have been non-prossed under the Act of May 25, 1878, P. L. 156 (reenacted, section 40, May 2,1929, P. L. 1237), or, generally, for want of prosecution : Waring v. P. R. R., 176 Pa. 172, 35 A. 106. Neither side was diligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">Two grounds for divorce were alleged: That respondent \u201c(1) has by cruel and barbarous treatment endangered the libellant\u2019s life; (2) has offered such indignities to the person of the libellant as to render his condition intolerable and life burdensome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">The case was not referred to a master, nor was a jury trial asked for; it was tried by a judge, who concluded that the charge of cruel and barbarous treatment was not made out, but that libellant was entitled to a decree on the other ground. On appeal to the Superior Court, the decree was reversed in an opinion by the learned President Judge stating that \u201c......the divorce should not be granted because....: .the proofs submitted by the libellant do not come up to the required standard\u201d: 105 Pa. Superior Ct. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In view of the scope of the arguments presented in support of the petitions for the allocatur, and in the three briefs filed by appellant here, we shall briefly note a few recognized principles applicable in divorce. \u201cIt is not of a single act that the law speaks in the clause under which this case falls; but <em>of such a course of conduct </em>or <em>continued treatment </em>as renders the wife\u2019s condition intolerable and her life burdensome...... Never ought divorces to be easily obtained, for marriage is the most sacred of human relations, and should never be dissolved without clear proof of imperious reasons...... Indignities provoked by the complaining party are of course no ground of divorce unless when the retaliation is excessive\u201d: Richards v. Richards, 37 Pa. 225. See, also, May v. May, 62 Pa. 206, 210; Angier v. Angier, 63 Pa. 450, 458; Sowers\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 173; Edmond\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>App., 57 Pa. 232; Middleton v.

Ponthus, 66 Ibid. 257; Stewart v. Stewart, 88 Ibid. 1, 5; Twaddell v. Twaddell, 95 Ibid. 429, 432. \u201cOur statute is a municipal regulation for the protection of the community as well as the wife\u201d or husband: McDermott\u2019s App., 8 W. &amp; S. 251, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In considering whether there is that \u201cclear and satisfactory evidence of the wrong which the law treats as justifying cause for a divorce......the court must be informed what the respondent has done; not what witnesses may conclude, or what they may regard as the character of the conduct\u201d: Edmond\u2019s App., supra. General expressions \u201care of no value unless accompanied by the actual facts on which these assertions are based. We are entitled, in the consideration of the case, to have the particulars as to the words spoken or the things done that constituted the cause of action alleged\u201d: Ford v. Ford, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 350, 352; Bishop v. Bishop, 30 Pa. 412, 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Concerning appellant\u2019s challenge of the power of the Superior Court to examine the evidence de novo for the purpose of review, it is sufficient to quote what was said by President Judge Rice in Fay v. Fay, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 328, 334: \u201cIn Middleton v. Middleton, 187 Pa. 612 [41 A. 291], where the subject of the review of divorce cases on appeal was elaborately considered, Justice Dean said that the Supreme Court had, even since the passage of the Act of 1815, held it incumbent on it, \u2018except where there has been an issue and jury trial,\u2019 to review the testimony and adjudge whether it sustained the complaint of the libellant. In McClurg\u2019s App., 66 Pa. 366, Agnew, J., said that the only exception to the general rule, that the appeal is to be prosecuted de novo on the testimony taken in the cause, \u2018is where a fact has been found by a jury trial according to the act, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>this court will not retry the fact.\u2019 The exception thus plainly recognized in the two cases cited was established in Andrews v. Andrews, 5 S. &amp; R. 374, where the precise question was raised......\u201d The subject was recently considered, with the same result, in Nacrelli v. Nacrelli, 288 Pa. 1, 136 A. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Examining the evidence in the light of these principles we are driven to the conclusion that there was no course of conduct, no continuity of treatment, constituting the cause of divorce contemplated by the statute as heretofore consistently construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The parties were married in November, 1899. The first charge is that in October, 1900, respondent threw a book at libellant, but missed him. At the same period, he says, she \u201cwas continually nagging me and nagging continually.\u201d Libellant\u2019s sister, called on his behalf, said that during the \u201cforepart of their married life,\u201d she visited them \u201ca very short time, possibly two or three days.\u201d Apparently on the relatively slight opportunity for observation so acquired, she testified that respondent \u201cwas always nagging\u201d......\u201cwas very domineering,\u201d would \u201cdemand that he do things such as......\u2018care for the child.\u2019 \u201d Such general expressions, and others of the same character in the record, we lay aside, pursuant to the principle quoted above, as without evidential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">The next specific charge is that in September, 1901, \u201cin a fit of temper [she] broke the frame containing their marriage certificate and made life so miserable that libellant left the home for several weeks.\u201d She gives this explanation of the incident. \u201cQ. He has also accused you of destroying the marriage certificate in a fit of anger in 1901. What about that? A. He was leaving home because I wouldn\u2019t sign the deed for the house. He wanted to go and wanted to take the marriage certificate and I didn\u2019t want him to, and we had a tussle for the certificate and he got it. Q. Did you ever get it again? Was it framed? A. Yes, sir. Q. What happened to the frame? Was .the frame broken? A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Yes, it was all torn off. Q. You were both struggling for it? A. Yes, sir.\u201d Libellant said that he did not remember the cause of the quarrel, did not \u201crecall the cause of the tantrum.\u201d But, and we note the important fact, he did not contradict respondent\u2019s explanation of the cause of the trouble, nor question her account of the matter. If, therefore, we accept as true the statements made by each conconceming this incident, we must apply the rule, quoted above, that \u201cIndignities provoked by the complaining party are of course no ground of divorce unless when the retaliation is excessive.\u201d Nothing excessive is disclosed by the evidence; respondent may have had a good reason for declining to sign the deed, and if, perhaps to coerce her, \u201che was leaving home because [she] wouldn\u2019t sign the deed for the house,\u201d it is not surprising that she resented his taking with him the certificate of their marriage, and struggled to retain it. That incident may be laid aside, as furnishing no ground for desertion. He returned in two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Some time, not definitely specified, between 1901 and 1904, he charged, in the bill of particulars, that she hit him \u201con the head with a large cake of soap while he was in the bathroom.\u201d Though making that allegation under oath, his testimony is that she did not hit him, and that he did not recall the cause of their quarrel. Respondent denies the occurrence. During the same period, he testified, \u201cI went home and the house was locked. She said she had a revolver and would shoot.\u201d Unfortunately, if true, libellant gave no other information about this charge; if true, and if he regarded it as serious, it would seem that he might have stated the circumstances more fully, particularly describing what followed and what he did about it. He also said \u201cOn one occasion in the evening she had a gun in her hand saying she would shoot me. It was discharged out of the rear window.\u201d \u201cQ. Were you in the house? A. Yes, sir.\u201d Respondent\u2019s account is very different and more circumstantial; she states that her husband was not at home; \u201che was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>away fishing.\u201d At night she \u201cheard burglars and I shot out of the back window,\u201d \u201cto scare the burglars.\u201d She denied that she ever threatened to shoot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In July, 1904, according to his testimony, as he \u201cleft the house and was going around the house,\u201d she threw a pot of geraniums at him without striking him. The remaining complaint of this period, is that when their son was born, libellant desired his mother to be in the house, and his wife wired her not to come, a fact, he said, communicated to him by his mother. Respondent denied both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We have substantially covered the record from the time of their marriage until July, 1904, and assume that he charged the worst that happened and as fully as the facts warranted. It remains to be noted that during the period at least one of their children was born. The conduct outlined, in the light of the wife\u2019s explanations, where unrebutted by libellant, would certainly not be sufficient to make the clear case required by the decisions cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">This brings us to a more serious failure in the proofs. The course of conduct charged is broken for a long period, during which, we assume, they lived peaceably, or, at all events, demonstrated that they could live together, notwithstanding incompatibility of temper, not yet recognized as cause for divorce in this State. For the next five years no charge is made against respondent in the bill of particulars except one concerning the discharge of a gun out of the window (already referred to, the record showing some confusion about the time of the occurrence), and an alleged threat to burn down the house. She denies that she made the threat. She states that she took papers to the cellar, and burned them in the furnace, and he does not deny that. Meantime, at least one other child was born to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">We then reach another gap of eight years \u2014 from 1909 to 1917 \u2014 in which no specific charge is made in the bill of particulars. Apparently the thing most complained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of in 1917, was an allegation that libellant was locked out of his house, and required to obtain access by asking a neighbor, who seems to have possessed a key to libellant\u2019s cellar, to admit him through the cellar door. This averment recites that all of the doors were locked, that \u201cthe children at the time were at the movies and libellant could hear respondent walking the floor in a fit of temper.\u201d His evidence concerning the matter is neither clear nor satisfactory. He fixes the time at seven o\u2019clock; d.oes not recall whether the windows were open; does not remember whether he rang the door bell; assumed that the doors were locked by his wife, because \u201cthey were locked inside.\u201d When he got in, he found his wife there \u201cwith her hat and coat on.\u201d His neighbor, who aided him in entering, and who had never been in the house before, testified that when they got into the kitchen, respondent came in with her hat and coat on, and that he did not know whether she had been in the house while they were entering or not. Respondent\u2019s account is somewhat different. She testified that libellant telephoned to her at about six o\u2019clock that \u201che wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner. I had heard rumors about Mr. Esenwein and a certain woman, and I sent the children to the motion pictures and gave them the front door key, and I took the side door key and went over...... and watched my husband in his office.\u201d She finally saw him come out of the building and board a car; she took the same car, seated in the rear, while he sat in the front part of the car, ignorant of her presence. She alighted from the car near their home \u201cand rushed up the alley way into the side door and I left it unlocked, and went in and he came to the front door and couldn\u2019t get in because the children had the key and he stood around there.\u201d She says he was admitted by the neighbor, and that she hid from them and that neither saw her. When libellant and the neighbor went upstairs, she left the house and went to the motion picture theatre and brought home the children. Neither thereafter dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>cussed the incident with the other, though, she says, he might have entered the house by the side door which she had left unlocked. In its effect in this proceeding we consider the incident trivial. To this period, as near as we can detei'mine, may perhaps be referred the evidence of one witness. Mrs. Smith, a next door neighbor, testified that \u201cOn the few occasions we were together she would say belittling things to Mr. Esenwein...... \u201cjust irritating to him, not insulting but just as though she was the manager of the whole establishment......\u201d Such statements are of course subject to the general rule stated above. This witness did not recall ever having been in libellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">After another gap in th A alleged course of treatment, we come to the incident referred to in the bill of particulars, as occurring in November, 1919, which, libellant said, caused his departure from his wife and children. Briefly stated, and without regard to whether her suspicions were well founded or not, \u2014 even assuming they were groundless \u2014 respondent became \u201cangry\u201d because libellant stopped \u201con the street\u201d to talk to his partner and his partner\u2019s wife, in circumstances in which respondent thought she .was intentionally excluded from the conversation, and for that she became \u201ccriticizing and censuring.\u201d Her account is somewhat different, and, it is to be noted, that when he took the stand in rebuttal, he did not deny her testimony or even refer to the subject. She said: \u201cA. We quarreled over a woman that night, and I threatened to tell her husband and he threatened to leave if I would, so he caught me by the wrists and threw me clear across the hall, and I struck my side against the stairway and my health has been impaired ever since. Q. Had that been the first time you had quarreled about that woman? A. Yes, because I never saw anything, but that night I did. She stopped our car there, and she wouldn\u2019t speak to me. She just talked to him. I spoke to her a couple of times and she wouldn\u2019t look at me, and I was indignant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>asked him to take me home and he never let on he heard me, and they were talking. She had her arm on the front seat. Finally I said, \u2018Es, will you please take me home,\u2019 which he did. Of course, I was indignant after that treatment, and he left the next morning, and that was in 1919.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">He testified that when he left he went to live with his partner and Ms wife, the woman referred to by respondent in the foregoing account.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Another incident of 1919, if considered as reflecting discredit on respondent, is just as discreditable to Mm. He was engaged in the commission business with a partner, and with one or more employees. He complains that she went to Ms place of business, toward the end of a business day, found Mm out, and \u201cwhen it came time to close the office\u201d wished to remain. The evidence on this subject came from the employee, who said: \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t go. I went to the policeman in the building and had him come up and she went out in the hall with the policeman.\u201d Of this occurrence, the Superior Court appropriately said: \u201cIt is not likely a subordinate would take upon himself the authority to eject the wife of one of the firm, unless he had been prejudiced against her by the employer and received authority so to do, and libellant admits that he had before this told the employee to watch her, when she came, to see that she carried no weapons, apparently an entirely unnecessary precaution. The incident throws light on his attitude toward his wife, and his willingness to create a situation which would humiliate her. Such action would naturally be provocative of retaliation on her part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In addition, there are general accusations to the effect that his \u201cclothes were washed only part of the'time\u201d; that she \u201cupset all the dishes and other articles on the table\u201d; \u201cinsisted on pulling a large trunk down the front steps\u201d; did not always do the cooking, but left him do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>He also called a witness who visited them at times prior to 1913, who testified \u201cthey always had plenty to eat,\u201d \u201cwell prepared\u201d and a house \u201cwell furnished.\u201d He described going to New Yqrk with libellant to see a broker to whom respondent had written a letter (not put in evidence) about libellant. This witness said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t treat him with any respect at all.\u201d What she did, except for writing the letter, does not appear. The general statement is without value as evidence. We must also conclude that this letter did not affect libellant adversely, because he does not even refer to it in his testimony. Respondent testified that, in writing the letter, she \u201cmeant to help Mr. Esenwein.\u201d There is no evidence that the letter injured him.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">Another witness, Mrs. Boles, testified that she \u201cvisited there and saw her a great deal\u201d; \u201ctook some rather long trips, and spent a good many evenings driving and going to the movies.\u201d \u25a0 She testified that respondent \u201cwould argue about things and start an argument.\u201d These arguments took place \u201cmostly in......Mr. Esenwein\u2019s car,\u201d in the presence of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Libellant said respondent\u2019s conduct made him a \u201cnervous wreck.\u201d He called a physician to rebut respondent\u2019s evidence that he was given to drinking; the doctor testified that he had been the parties\u2019 family physician for many years, and never \u201cnoticed liquor on him.\u201d He was \u25a0not asked (cf. Hare v. Hare, 95 Pa. Superior Ct. 66, 68) whether libellant showed any symptoms of being a \u201cnervous wreck,\u201d or was otherwise adversely affected by alleged indignities inflicted by respondent. In Schulze v. Schulze, 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 325, 332, it was held that a libellant\u2019s statement that he became a \u201cphysical wreck\u201d amounted to nothing by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">It would unduly extend an opinion, already too long, if we recited all the evidence; we have sufficiently shown its general character. There was no course of conduct\u2014 no continuity of treatment \u2014 with the prohibited result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u2022within the accepted meaning of the words of the statute. Libellant has not made out a clear and satisfactory case, as required. Instead of a course of conduct, the episodes divide themselves into groups separated by the long intervals of time stated. This lack of continuity is inconsistent with any course of conduct; it excludes the basic element of the definition. Among the many cases on the subject, see Schulze v. Schulze, 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 325, 330; Wark v. Wark, 73 Ibid. 274, 277; Russell v. Russell, 37 Ibid. 348, 354; Richards v. Richards, supra. There is evidence that respondent undoubtedly behaved badly, but it is equally clear that libellant was not free from blame. Indeed, his evidence, in some measure, carries its own refutation, and seriously shakes credibility. He testified that respondent \u201cwas not a good mother\u201d; was not \u201ca fit person to live with the children.\u201d Yet, when he deserted his family in 1919, he left the children with their mother, though they had then reached ages, about 15 and 17 years, at which, if there had been a contest about custody, their own choice of parent would have been given consideration by the court. After he had testified that respondent was not a \u201cfit person to live with his children,\u201d he was confronted in cross-examination with an agreement made by him in November, 1919, providing for their support, in which he recited that he \u201cbelieves they [children] could best be provided for if under the care of their mother.\u201d No reason was given by him for not taking the evidence of these children for this trial twelve years later. He instructed his counsel that respondent hit him on the head with a large cake of soap, swore to the bill of particulars so alleging, but could not support it with evidence. His omission in rebuttal to deny material parts of respondent\u2019s testimony, varying the effect of evidence given by him, cannot be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The order of the Superior Court is affirmed, costs to be paid by the libellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
