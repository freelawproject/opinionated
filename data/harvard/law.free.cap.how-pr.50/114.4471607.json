On the 12th of June, 1874, an order to show cause was granted, returnable June fifteenth, why the report should not he set aside, for fraud, mistake and irregularity. The motion was made on behalf of Peter A. H. Jackson and S. S.

Public policy requires that the confirmation should not be disturbed when assessments have been collected, and both the city and citizens put in relations where their rights must be seriously affected and prejudiced by disturbing the confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
