The court of appeals affirmed the order appealed from <em>with costs. </em>These costs have been adjusted by the clerk of the court at $106.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">As those costs awarded by the court of appeals are general costs ( <em>White </em>agt. <em>Anthony, </em>23 <em>N. Y., </em>164), they could only be properly adjusted by the clerk <em>(Code, sec. </em>311).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">This disposes of the only question, necessary to be discussed on this motion, and the same is denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
