The said lands are situated in the county of Marquette and State of Michigan, and are known and described as follows: The-west half (\u25a0\u00a3) of the northeast quarter (\u00a3), and the northwest quarter (i) of the southeast quarter (J) of the northeast quarter (i) of the southwest quarter (\u00a3), and the southeast quarter (i) of northwest quarter (\u25a0\u00a3) of section nineteen (19), in township forty-seven (47) north, of range twenty-seven (27). west.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">And the said parties of the second part hereby agree that they will pay or cause to be paid unto the said parties of the-first part the sum of fifty (50) cents a ton for every ton of 2240 pounds of iron ore mined by them on said land, and by them shipped, sold or used. And it is agreed that settlement shall be made between the parties hereto on the first day of April and on the first day of October of each year of said term.

The land was mostly swamp and woods, and was of small value except for mining purposes, and at the time the lease was executed there were no buildings or improvements thereon. In April, 1872, the complainant, who previously had held an equitable interest, acquired by deed from the owners named, an undivided one-sixth interest in the land in question. In December, 1872, the defendant by purchase and assignment became possessed of all the rights of Lonstorf, Maas and Mitchell under the lease, and of all the buildings and machinery placed on the land by them up to the date of the assignment; and defendant thereafter operated the mine on the land up to October, 1882, when it ceased operations, claiming that the ore was practically exhausted in the\u2019mine and that it would not pay to keep the pumps going or the men at work. After defendant purchased, in 1872, it removed nearly all the machinery which had been used by the lessees, and replaced it with a heavier and more expensive kind, and at various times down to the suspension of active operations in 1882, it repeatedly removed some portions of the machinery, replac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ing it oi not as its own convenience or necessity required, \u2022all of which in a general way was known to complainant who made no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Various engine and pump-houses, as well as temporary residences for miners, were also erected upon the land by defendant from time to time as its convenience or the necessities of mining operations required; some of which \u2014 the engine and boiler houses \u2014 were very substantially built, the beds for engines being built of solid masonry; but all the erections for supporting and sheltering machinery were required by the nature of their use to be substantial in order to be useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The dwellings, to the number of 35 or 40 in all, erected at different times, were mostly of a very temporary kind, very cheaply built, a large proportion being built of logs at \u2022an expense of $75 to $150 each, and fourteeu or fifteen were frame, costing $500 to $1000 each. Some were set on posts \u2022and some on dry stone \"walls piled together, and all now nearly worthless. All erections, whether of machinery or buildings, were made and paid for by defendant exclusively for \u201c mining purposes,\u201d and were used for no other purpose, though capable of being used at other mines. The total cost of all machinery and buildings placed on the land by defendant at different times was from. $50,000 to $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">After the defendants had ceased to operate the mine under the claim stated, they notified complainant of their abandonment of mining operations and of their intention to remove their plant and property from the land leased, and offered to sell the same to the owners of the land if they desired to purchase. Complainant entered into negotiations for the. purchase thereof, but without concluding the same, filed his bill of complaint, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cThat under the provisions of said mining lease buildings have been erected upon said property in a very substantial manner, and have become fixtures to the freehold. There has also been erected solid brick and stone foundations upon which have been placed large engines, which have been bolted down solid to the ground. There has also been placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>brick arches large boilers connected with said engines, which have been walled in with brick in said arches built from the ground, and bolted down in the most substantial manner, which brick and stone foundations and arches and engines and boilers have become fixtures to the freehold and a part of the realty; that they were erected upon said property by agreement under said lease, but there was no agreement whatever in said lease permitting the removal of the same upon the surrender of the lease or the expiration of the same, or at any other time, so as to lessen the value of said property and to dismantle said mine and deprive it of its proper equipment of machinery and buildings so permanently affixed to the property;\u201d and praying therein \u201c that said defendant, its servants, agents and attorneys, may be restrained by the injunction of this court, and be decreed to forever desist from tearing up and removing said permanent fixtures, except upon replacing the same with as good at the time of the removal, and not to tear up or remove unless the successful working of said mine shall require it, and upon replacing the same with machinery of at least equal value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The question involved is whether the machinery and buildings placed upon the land have been so affixed to the soil as to become part of the realty so as to preclude the defendant from removing them at or before the termination of the lease. It was conceded that the machinery in question was of the character denominated \u201ctrade fixtures,\u201d and that the intention with which they were annexed as well as the purposes for which they were used, would have a material bearing upon the case. Consequently a large part of the testimony was directed to the manner in which the property had been assessed for taxes; complainant claiming that the property in dispute had generally if not wholly been assessed as real estate, and under the provisions of the lease, been paid by the owners of the land. On the other hand the \u2022defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that the property in question had always been assessed as personal property to the \u2022defendant, and it had paid the taxes levied thereon. The complainant testified to the custom in that vicinity of inserting \u2022clauses in mining leases giving tenants the right to remove fixtures, but the instances within his knowledge were all subsequent to the time when this lease was executed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendant showed by one witness that the custom testified to by complainant was not universal, and that during a residence of seventeen years in the county it had always been the custom, with every lease he ever had any knowledge of, for the lessees to have the privilege of removing the machinery, or any personal property erected thereon. The evidence of custom introduced by both parties is not sufficient to afford any assistance in the construction of the contract between them, or in determining the question before us, and must be laid entirely out of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The rights of the parties must be determined from the lease existing between them, in connection with the nature and use of the property, and the intention of the tenants in making the annexation. While there are certain general principles applicable to all cases arising between landlord and tenant as to what annexations are removable and what not, yet each case must in a great measure depend upon its own peculiar circumstances, and the intention of the party, and the time and manner of making the annexation, which will be of controlling influence in the correct disposition of the questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">It will be noticed that the lease contains no clause reserving the right of re-entry in case of condition broken or failure to perform the covenants by the lessees, and that it entirely omits the clause usually contained in leases requiring the lessees at the expiration of their lease to yield up the premises in good repair. The lease contains no stipulation as to-whether annexations made during the term shall remain or may be removed. The effect of the omissions is to leav\u00e9 the question of intention to be gathered from the stipulations the parties saw fit to embody in the contract between them, in connection with what they have done in the execution thereof. At the time the contract was entered into the mine was undeveloped, and there might or might not be ore found in sufficient quantities to warrant mining operations. ' The grant was to the parties of the second part and their assigns of the right of entering upon the lands for the purpose of searching for iron ore, and of conducting mining and quarry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing operations to any extent they may deem advisable for the term of fifteen years; and the further right to use all the wood and timber standing on the lands as should be necessary for mining purposes, and to erect such buildings and machinery upon the land, and to lay such railroad tracks and tram-ways, and make such other roads as might be necessary and convenient for mining purposes, and to use therefor any timber that might be standing upon the land. This grant of the right to use the timber was a concession by the lessors to the lessees, and does not in any manner affect the matter in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">From the testimony in the case we have no doubt that the machinery and buildings were intended to be accessory to the mining under the provisions of the l\u00e9ase, and that there was no intention in affixing them to the realty to make them accessory to the soil; and it appears that they can be removed without material disturbance to the land. They were such structures as the defendant had a right to erect on complainant\u2019s land, and therefore the defendant occupies a position materially different from what it would be in if it had wrongfully annexed such machinery and buildings to the soil of another. Furthermore it very plainly appears that the property in dispute was not annexed to the land for the better enjoyment of the land itself, but for the exclusive purpose of carrying on the mining operations; and the manner of the annexation also tends to show that it was designed for a temporary purpose in connection with the lease under which defendants were operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Under the facts disclosed by the record in this case, we think the circuit court was right in entering a decree dissolving the injunction and dismissing the complainani\u2019s bill, and the decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
