The heirs of Francis Claremont consisted of four sons, named John, Prancis, Louis and Alexander. The plaintiff claims an undivided half of the above land in fee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and has brought this suit in ejectment to establish his title and obtain possession. His chain of title is as follows: 1st,, the patent above mentioned; 2d, a warranty deed from Louis Claremont and Mary Claremont, of Hamburgh, county of' Fremont and state of Iowa, to Siegfried Higlistone, of \u201c all their right, title and interest\u201d to the land in question, dated. October 7, 1874; 3d, a deed of the land in question from Francis Claremont, Sr., of Richfield, Summit county, Ohio,, to Siegfried Higlistone, dated September 2, 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The defendants claim title through the same patent, and a deed from John Claremont and Rebecca Claremont to Louis-Martin, dated July 8, 1854. This is a full covenant warranty deed of all the land, under which defendant entered into possession in 1866. May 1, 1867, Louis Martin conveyed the whole of the premises in question by warranty deed to his wife, Angelique Martin. April 6, 1878, Angelique Martin, by warranty deed, conveyed the whole of the premises to Mary Ann Burdette. April 21, 1881, Louis and Angelique Martin conveyed all of the premises to Mary Ann Burdette.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On the trial of the case in the court below it was conceded by the plaintiff \u201cthat the defendants, having entered upon said land in 1866, have been in the sole and peaceable possession thereof up to the present time; \u201d but denied that the possession was acquiesced in by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The rulings complained of consist in admitting and excluding testimony against plaintiff\u2019s objections, and in taking the-case from the jury and directing a verdict for defendant. The defendant claimed title to the whole premises by adverse possession, and entry under color of title derived from John Claremont in 1854; that at the time this deed was executed the land was wild and uncultivated, and so remained when he took possession in 1866; and that such possession taken, under a warranty deed was an ouster of his co-tenants, and the statute of limitations commenced to run from that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">There was no evidence in the case that the co-tenants-through whom plaintiffs claim had any notice or knowledge of Martin\u2019s taking possession, or of any claim by him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>adverse to tlieir title. There was testimony tending to prove that Martin only bargained for and purchased from John Claremont his undivided one-fourth interest in the land. Under the proofs in this case the question ought to have been submitted to the jury as to whether Louis Martin entered into possession of the lands in question, claiming title to the whole, and with intention of ousting his co-tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In order to maintain ejectment the plaintiff was required to prove, in addition to all other evidence which he was bound to give, that the defendants actually ousted him, or did some other act amounting to a total denial of his right as such co-tenant. How. Stat. \u00a7 7812. The plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove that he demanded of Mary Ann Burdette to be let into possession with her in 1878, and that she refused and claimed that she owned the whole land, and was in possession and should keep it; and she refused to divide the property with him. Ouster is a question of fact which it is the province of the jury to determine, and the facts and circumstances which went to establish the ouster, ought under proper instructions from the court to have been submitted to the jury. <em>Taylor v. Hill </em>10 Leigh 457; <em>Cummings v. Wyman </em>10 Mass. 465; <em>Purcell v. Wilson </em>4 Grat. 16; <em>Harmon v. James </em>7 Sm. &amp; M. 111; <em>Blackmore v. Gregg </em>2 <em>W. &amp; </em>S. 182; <em>Carpentier v. Mendenhall </em>28 Cal. 484; <em>Clark v. Crego </em>47 Barb. 599. And the burden of proof rests upon the party alleging it. <em>Newell v. Woodruff </em>30 Conn. 492; <em>Van Bibber v. Ferdinand </em>17 Md. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In this case both parties relied upon ouster, and it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove it within the statute of limitations, and if he introduced evidence tending to prove it within that period, then the burden was shifted upon the defendants to prove an actual ouster which occurred anterior to that period. But the circuit judge did not permit \u25a0any of the testimony to go to the jury, and directed them to render a verdict for the defendants. This was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The judgment is reversed and new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\"> Act of April 17, 1828.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
