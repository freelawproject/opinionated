Railroad Co. v. Commonwealth, 122 Ky. 435, 92 S. W. 299; Whitaker v. Commonwealth, 188 Ky. 95, 221 S. W. 215, upon which counsel for the Commonwealth rely for an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The objections interposed by the defendant in the insitant cases clearly were directed not only to the substance of the instructions but, as stated in the record, \u201cto the manner of giving same\u201d as well; and we do not regard the language of the motion and grounds for a new trial quoted above reasonably -susceptible of the construction of referring simply to the substance of the instructions, as argued for the Commonwealth, but consider it sufficient also to direct the court\u2019s attention again to the manner in which they were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">That in such circumstances the error was not waived but is ground for reversal has been held by this court in Ferguson v. Commonwealth, 141 Ky. 557,132 S. W. 1030: Payne v. Commonwealth. 1 Metc. 370; Coppage v. Commonwealth, 3 Bush 532; Harris v. Commonwealth, 141 Ky. 70, 132 S. W. 148; Allen v. Commonwealth, 148 Ky. 327, 146 S. W. 762; Adams Express Co. v. Commonwealth, 163 Ky. 275, 173 S. W. 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Wherefore, the judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
