Timpone, on March 8, 1991. The 12-count complaint charged respondent with a variety of misconduct involving seven clients, and included charges of commingling and conversion of client funds. A hearing on the matter was conducted on July 9, 10, and 23, 1991. The Hearing Board dismissed several of the charges against respondent but found that he had engaged in the following acts of misconduct: commingling client funds, conversion of client funds, failing to maintain complete records of client funds, disregarding a tribunal\u2019s orders, deceit in handling his client fund account, misrepresenting a matter in a written statement submitted during an ARDC investigation, failing to promptly pay client funds, and neglecting several clients\u2019 proceedings. The Hearing Board recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year and until further order of this court. The Review Board adopted the Hearing Board\u2019s findings of fact, but recommended that respondent be suspended for only six months. The Administrator has filed exceptions with this court.</p> <p id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190(42) 191(126)\">Respondent graduated from John Marshall Law School and was licensed to practice law in Illinois in 1970. Respondent concentrates his practice in the domestic relations area and has been associated with several attorneys during the time relevant to these proceedings. According to the evidence presented at the disciplinary hearing, respondent\u2019s practice is hectic. In an average year, respondent is involved in the entry of 100 to 125 decrees in the domestic relations division of the circuit court of Cook County, and tries about 110 to 120 divorce cases. Respondent also generally has about 175 predecree cases and 200 post-decree cases pending at any one time. To keep up with this work, respondent usually begins his day at 4:30 in the morning, and works until 7:15 in the evening. Respondent also receives phone calls and visits from clients at home. Respondent does not enter into written fee agreements with clients and keeps track of the time spent on cases by making notations on the client\u2019s files.</p> <p id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\">Respondent is a member of the Academic Board of Marian Catholic High School and scouts football games for the high school. Respondent also coaches several youth sports teams, officiates for neighborhood athletic leagues, and raises funds for the high school. Finally, respondent is a member of the Olympia Fields Country Club.</p> <p id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191\">Findings of Misconduct</p> <p id=\"b191-7\" pgmap=\"191\">The Hearing Board found that respondent engaged in misconduct with regard to the following clients.</p> <p id=\"b191-8\" pgmap=\"191\">I. Rose Lietza</p> <p id=\"b191-9\" pgmap=\"191(80) 192(96)\">Counts I and II of the Administrator\u2019s complaint charged respondent with, inter alia, conversion of client funds, failure to maintain complete records of client funds, disregarding court orders, and making false, misleading statements to the ARDC. Rose Lietza retained respondent in a difficult divorce action with a $1,500 retainer fee in 1986. On December 30, 1986, the trial court entered an order directing respondent to hold the proceeds of the sale of Lietza\u2019s marital residence in escrow. A January 8, 1987, court order dissolved Lietza\u2019s marriage and provided that the proceeds from the sale of the marital home were to be divided equally. On that same day, respondent closed the sale of Lietza\u2019s marital home. Respondent deposited the net proceeds from the sale of Lietza\u2019s house into his client fund account and issued checks from those funds at Lietza\u2019s instructions. Among the checks issued was one to respondent\u2019s law firm in the amount of $6,359.00 for attorney fees. After this disbursal, $18,665.59 remained from the sale of Lietza\u2019s marital residence.</p> <p id=\"b192-5\" pgmap=\"192\">In February 1987, respondent advised Lietza that her husband would probably attempt to vacate the January 8, 1987, judgment for the dissolution of marriage and try to enjoin her from using the remaining sale proceeds. Respondent suggested that Lietza protect the proceeds by entrusting the money to him. By doing so, respondent advised, Lietza would keep the money from her husband and make it available for future litigation expenses. On February 9, 1987, Lietza wrote respondent instructing him to place the money in a \u201csix-month holding account.\u201d Respondent kept the money in his client fund account.</p> <p id=\"b192-6\" pgmap=\"192\">According to respondent, Lietza authorized him to use the $18,665.59 as prepaid attorney fees and to pay her husband if later litigation so required. Under this agreement, Lietza was to receive any remaining amount of the money after legal expenses and any payments to her husband. Lietza testified that she gave respondent no such authority.</p> <p id=\"b192-7\" pgmap=\"192(47) 193(18)\">On February 5, 1987, Lietza\u2019s husband moved to vacate the judgment for dissolution of marriage and to redistribute the marital home\u2019s sale proceeds. On February 11, 1987, the court ordered Lietza to make an accounting of the marital residence sale proceeds. No such accounting was made. The court ordered Lietza not to dispose of the marital residence on March 13,1987.</p> <p id=\"b193-5\" pgmap=\"193\">On April 23, 1987, respondent wrote an $18,000 check on his client fund account to pay another client\u2019s real estate taxes. This payment depleted respondent\u2019s client fund account to an amount less than $6,000, well below the $18,665.59 he was holding in that account for Lietza. By July 1987, respondent admitted, no proceeds remained from the sale of Lietza\u2019s marital property in his client fund account.</p> <p id=\"b193-6\" pgmap=\"193\">Lietza wrote to respondent several times in August 1988, inquiring about the funds, but received no response.</p> <p id=\"b193-7\" pgmap=\"193\">A settlement was reached in Lietza\u2019s divorce on September 26, 1988, in which Lietza was to pay her husband an additional $9,600. Respondent paid this amount in installments.</p> <p id=\"b193-8\" pgmap=\"193\">On September 26, 1988, Lietza filed a charge against respondent with the ARDC because she felt respondent was not keeping her informed of her divorce proceedings. Later, in December 1988, Lietza met with respondent to discuss her case. Lietza testified that respondent informed her that he would not bill her any further and that he would return to her all the money remaining in the \u201cescrow account.\u201d Respondent never made an accounting to Lietza.</p> <p id=\"b193-9\" pgmap=\"193\">On January 24, 1989, Lietza wrote respondent again asking that he send her the amount remaining in her escrow account and confirming that there would be no attorney fees deducted from the escrow balance. Respondent answered by offering to make an accounting of all monies Lietza had on deposit.</p> <p id=\"b193-10\" pgmap=\"193(39) 194(71)\">In August 1989, Lietza again wrote respondent, asking him for $8,000, the amount she believed was remaining from the sale of her marital assets. Respondent offered to draft a note in which he would pay Lietza $1,000 a month for eight months. As part of this agreement, respondent asked Lietza to sign a form acknowledging that neither party would owe each other any money after the payments. Lietza refused to accept the $8,000 under these circumstances, but as of the time of the disciplinary hearing, had not asked respondent for the money and had not commenced any legal proceedings seeking return of the money.</p> <p id=\"b194-5\" pgmap=\"194\">Respondent testified that he intended the $8,000 offer to be a gift because he felt sorry for Lietza due to her difficult divorce and other problems she had. Respondent also testified that he had spent about 75 hours on Lietza\u2019s case for which he had not billed her and had stopped keeping time records in the case because he did not believe he could collect any money from Lietza. Respondent believed that he was entitled to keep as attorney fees the $6,600 to $8,000 he estimated remained from the $18,665.59.</p> <p id=\"b194-6\" pgmap=\"194(168) 195(64)\">The Hearing Board concluded that an understanding existed between respondent and Lietza in January and February 1987 in which respondent would \u201chold\u201d the $18,665.59 to keep it beyond the jurisdiction of the court in Lietza\u2019s marriage dissolution proceedings. This money would be used in part to pay respondent\u2019s legal fees at the conclusion of Lietza\u2019s marriage dissolution. The Hearing Board further found that while the February 11, 1987, order for an accounting of the marital residence and the March 13, 1987, order directing Lietza not to dispose of those proceeds technically applied only to Lietza, respondent was on notice as early as February 11, 1987, and was under an obligation as an officer of the court not to dispose of what remained of the sale proceeds until further order of the court. The Hearing Board noted that these funds were not respondent\u2019s to use as he saw fit, but were instead subject to the direction of his client and the court. The funds were to be held by respondent, not disposed of. The Hearing Board concluded that respondent used the funds to pay another client\u2019s tax bill, which constituted conversion of client funds. The Hearing Board also found that respondent disregarded a tribunal\u2019s rulings during the course of a proceeding in violation of Rule 7 \u2014 106(a) of the Code of Professional Responsibility (107 Ill. 2d R. 7 \u2014 106(a)).</p> <p id=\"b195-5\" pgmap=\"195\">The Hearing Board also concluded that Lietza knew that she would owe respondent a fee at the conclusion of the dissolution proceedings. This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that even after respondent agreed to waive his fee and pay Lietza $8,000, Lietza did not accept his offer, did not again ask for money, and did not file suit against respondent for the money.</p> <p id=\"b195-6\" pgmap=\"195\">Next, the Hearing Board found that respondent made no accounting to Lietza of the disposition of the marital residence proceeds and had no records to verify what happened to the money. The Hearing Board concluded that in the absence of records to support his estimates, respondent failed to maintain complete records of client funds coming into his possession in violation of Rule 9\u2014 102(cX3) and failed to make an accounting prior to claiming fees from client funds. 107 Ill. 2d R. 9 \u2014 102(c)(3); see In re Soloman (1987), 118 Ill. 2d 286.</p> <p id=\"b195-7\" pgmap=\"195\">Finally, with regard to Lietza, count II charged respondent with sending the ARDC a letter on October 24, 1988, in response to Lietza\u2019s charges, which stated: \u201cI presently have some funds which are being held for her.\u201d The ARDC found this to be a misrepresentation in violation of Rule 1 \u2014 102(a)(4) because when written and sent, respondent was not in possession of any of Lietza\u2019s funds, having already used them without authority. 107 Ill. 2d R. 1 \u2014 102(a)(4).</p> <p id=\"b195-8\" pgmap=\"195\">II. Richard Olson</p> <p id=\"b195-9\" pgmap=\"195(7) 196(188)\">Count XII of the Administrator\u2019s complaint charged respondent with conversion of at least $26,252.22 of a client\u2019s, Richard Olson\u2019s, money. Olson retained respondent in anticipation of a marriage dissolution, and respondent advised Olson to set aside funds to pay for the anticipated proceedings. Respondent suggested that he hold the funds for Olson. On July 17, 1984, Olson gave respondent $24,316 to hold in escrow. On April 23, 1985, Olson gave respondent an additional $29,936.22 to hold in escrow. Respondent deposited this money into one of his personal accounts. Several times after this, between August and October 24, 1985, Olson asked respondent to return $10,000. Respondent informed Olson that the funds were not readily available but gave no explanation for the funds\u2019 unavailability. By October 24, 1985, respondent had returned $10,000 to Olson in separate $5,000 checks. Later, in February, March, and April 1987, Olson asked respondent for $20,000 to help pay real estate taxes. On each occasion, respondent again informed Olson that the funds were not readily available but offered no explanation. However, on April 23, 1987, respondent tendered a check to pay Olson\u2019s taxes in the amount of $18,000.</p> <p id=\"b196-5\" pgmap=\"196\">Olson testified that he was not alarmed by the fact that he did not have ready access to his money. In fact, Olson had no objection to the way respondent handled his money. Olson had also not asked respondent to return any of the remaining money, even though he knew of the disciplinary charges against respondent. However, Olson did not give respondent authority to use any of his money for respondent\u2019s business or personal purposes.</p> <p id=\"b196-6\" pgmap=\"196\">The Hearing Board found that respondent\u2019s deposit of Olson\u2019s $54,252.22 into one of respondent\u2019s personal accounts constituted conversion of client funds. The Board also found that respondent participated in a diversion of Olson\u2019s funds'from the jurisdiction of the court in anticipation of litigation.</p> <p id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">The Hearing Board further found that respondent engaged in deceit in handling his client fund account with respect to reimbursements made to Olson in violation of Rule 1 \u2014 102(a)(4). (107 Ill. 2d R. 1 \u2014 102(a)(4).) The deceit involved paying Olson money from respondent\u2019s client fund account and representing the money was Olson\u2019s when respondent had not deposited any of Olson\u2019s money in the account.</p> <p id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">III. Joseph Serpico</p> <p id=\"b197-6\" pgmap=\"197\">Count X of the Administrator\u2019s complaint charged respondent with conversion of $5,455 of a client\u2019s, Joseph Serpico\u2019s, funds. Serpico retained respondent to represent him in his dissolution proceeding with a $1,000 retainer fee. Prior to the dissolution of marriage, a sale of household goods and furniture generated $5,455 in cash. On December 31, 1985, the court ordered the money from this sale placed in an escrow account. That same day, Serpico gave respondent a check for $5,455 and wrote \u201clegal cost\u201d on the check pursuant to respondent\u2019s advice.</p> <p id=\"b197-7\" pgmap=\"197\">Respondent placed the $5,455 in his client fund account and not in an escrow account. Serpico testified that he never gave respondent authority to use the money for respondent\u2019s personal or business purposes. Moreover, it was Serpico\u2019s understanding that the money would be placed in an escrow account until the conclusion of the litigation.</p> <p id=\"b197-8\" pgmap=\"197\">On January 18, 1986, respondent\u2019s client fund account fell to $5,327.12, an amount below the $5,455 Serpico had given him. Bank records revealed that this same account fell to a negative $0.77 by August 15, 1987, and that a later client trust fund opened by respondent was not opened using Serpico\u2019s funds.</p> <p id=\"b197-9\" pgmap=\"197(18) 198(55)\">An order for dissolution of marriage was entered on February 5, 1987, and provided that respondent was to release the $5,455. Serpico testified that he requested the money from respondent on a number of occasions after the court\u2019s order and on October 4, 1989, wrote to him again requesting the funds and acknowledging $3,200 in legal bills. Serpico asked that respondent return $2,300 plus interest from the money held in escrow.</p> <p id=\"b198-5\" pgmap=\"198\">After requesting the money until February 13, 1990, with no success, Serpico filed suit against respondent for $2,320.70 plus costs. A default judgment was entered against respondent for the amount sought, but as of the date of the filing of the Administrator\u2019s complaint respondent had not yet satisfied the judgment. Prior to this judgment, respondent had sent Serpico several bills for legal services in the amount of $3,437.</p> <p id=\"b198-6\" pgmap=\"198\">Respondent testified that Serpico agreed to have his legal bills deducted from the $5,455. Respondent did not believe he owed Serpico money because the $5,455 plus retainer did not cover respondent\u2019s time and that, in fact, Serpico owed him money.</p> <p id=\"b198-7\" pgmap=\"198\">The Hearing Board found that respondent converted Serpico\u2019s funds when the balance of respondent\u2019s client fund account fell to an amount below the $5,455 Serpico gave respondent to hold. The Hearing Board also found that if it were not for this technical conversion, the dispute between respondent and Serpico could be described as a fee dispute. The Hearing Board further found that respondent\u2019s refusal to satisfy the judgment represented a failure to promptly pay or deliver to a client funds to which the client was entitled in violation of Rule 9\u2014 102(c)(4) (107 Ill. 2d R. 9-102(c)(4)).</p> <p id=\"b198-8\" pgmap=\"198\">IV. John Menor</p> <p id=\"b198-9\" pgmap=\"198(35) 199(82)\">Count III of the Administrator\u2019s complaint charged respondent with failing to deposit $2,305 of a client\u2019s money into an escrow account and using the money for his own purposes without the client\u2019s permission. In the course of representing John Menor in a divorce proceeding, respondent advised Menor to have respondent hold any cash Menor had in his possession. On February 12, 1987, Menor delivered $2,305 in cash to respondent\u2019s home, where respondent\u2019s wife received the money. The money consisted of one $1,000 bill, 10 $100 bills, two $50 bills, five $20 bills, five $10 bills, five $1 bills and 25 $2 bills. The receipt stated that the money, was to be placed in an escrow account.</p> <p id=\"b199-5\" pgmap=\"199\">On February 13, 1987, the court ordered all cash monies held by the attorneys on behalf of their clients placed in the attorneys\u2019 escrow accounts. However, Menor\u2019s $2,305 was kept for a time at respondent\u2019s house and was later placed in a safe deposit box in respondent\u2019s wife\u2019s name until the divorce proceedings ended. The money was never placed in a special escrow account and after Menor\u2019s divorce proceedings, respondent told his wife that the money belonged to them.</p> <p id=\"b199-6\" pgmap=\"199\">Respondent testified that he believed Menor wished him to preserve the money in cash because of the uniqueness of the bills. Menor testified that there was no significance in the denomination of the cash and that he did not authorize respondent to place the cash in a safe deposit box.</p> <p id=\"b199-7\" pgmap=\"199\">Menor requested the return of his money on several occasions after the September 26, 1988, dissolution judgment and was told that a check had been mailed to him. Respondent finally sent Menor a check dated February 10, 1989, in the amount of $1,733.25. Respondent testified that the money was withheld to straighten out Menor\u2019s legal bill. However, it is undisputed that respondent never prepared a legal bill in connection with a final accounting in Menor\u2019s litigation. Menor expected respondent to return approximately $1,800.</p> <p id=\"b199-8\" pgmap=\"199(15) 200(145)\">The Hearing Board concluded that respondent never deposited Menor\u2019s money into an escrow account and that respondent\u2019s belief that the money was unique was not supported by Menor. Even if the bills were unique, the Hearing Board found, it did not relieve respondent of his obligation to segregate the funds for safekeeping, which he did not do. The Board thus found that respondent commingled client funds in violation of Rule 9\u2014 102(a) and failed to maintain complete records of a client\u2019s funds and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding the funds in violation of Rule 9 \u2014 102(c)(3) (107 Ill. 2d Rules 9 \u2014 102(a), (c)(3)). The Hearing Board also found that respondent\u2019s delay in returning Menor\u2019s funds constituted a failure to promptly pay a client funds as requested by the client in the possession of a lawyer which the client is entitled to receive in violation of Rule 9 \u2014 102(c)(4) (107 Ill. 2d R. 9-102(c)(4)).</p> <p id=\"b200-5\" pgmap=\"200\">V. Valerie Zara</p> <p id=\"b200-6\" pgmap=\"200\">Count VII of the Administrator\u2019s complaint charged respondent with neglecting a dissolution of marriage petition. Valerie Zara retained respondent to represent her in her marriage dissolution proceedings in 1983. Respondent filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on behalf of Zara in Cook County on September 2, 1983. Discovery was completed in July 1984, and the case was assigned for trial on December 17, 1984. However, respondent failed to appear several times and the matter was eventually dismissed on April 31, 1986, for want of prosecution. Zara was later divorced in a 1987 proceeding initiated by her husband. Respondent testified that the neglect resulted from a confusing reorganization in the divorce courts and that he did not refile Zara\u2019s petition because Zara\u2019s husband\u2019s attorney agreed to file a petition and pay the filing fees.</p> <p id=\"b200-7\" pgmap=\"200(25) 201(17)\">The Hearing Board found respondent neglected Zara\u2019s petition for divorce in failing to reinstate the case within the time allowed once it was originally dismissed in 1984. However, the Board found that respondent\u2019s conduct did not involve dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation.</p> <p id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201\">VI. Albert Mulkey</p> <p id=\"b201-6\" pgmap=\"201\">Albert Mulkey hired respondent\u2019s firm, Timpone &amp; Rickelman, to represent him in a breach of contract proceeding in 1983. Respondent\u2019s partner, Leonard Rickelman, represented Mulkey in the action, but later left the firm and moved to California in 1986. Mulkey testified that Rickelman informed him that he would return to Chicago to try the case and that the firm would continue to represent him. Mulkey\u2019s case was dismissed on February 4, 1986, for want of prosecution for failure to appear at the trial call.</p> <p id=\"b201-7\" pgmap=\"201\">Mulkey and respondent dispute whether respondent promised to represent Mulkey once Rickelman left the firm. However, the evidence shows that respondent\u2019s firm filed motions bearing respondent\u2019s signature and succeeded in reinstating the case on one occasion. Moreover, respondent had conversations with defense counsel in the matter and paid $1,600 in sanctions for not complying with discovery orders in connection with Rickelman\u2019s handling of the matter. The case was eventually dismissed with prejudice for want of prosecution on April 17, 1986. An April 15, 1988, motion seeking to reinstate the case was stricken because no one appeared for Mulkey at a June 12,1988, proceeding.</p> <p id=\"b201-8\" pgmap=\"201(75) 202(52)\">The Hearing Board found that although Rickelman was Mulkey\u2019s counsel at the beginning of the case, respondent assumed responsibility once Rickelman left the firm. The Hearing Board concluded that respondent\u2019s failure to appear on Mulkey\u2019s behalf or to have another member of his firm do so represented neglect in violation of Rule 6 \u2014 101(a)(3) and failure to carry out a contract of employment in violation of Rule 7 \u2014 101(a)(2) (107 Ill. 2d Rules 6 \u2014 101(a)(3), 7 \u2014 101(a)(2)). Moreover, the Board concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct also prejudiced or damaged Mulkey in violation of Rule 7\u2014 101(a)(3) and was also prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 1 \u2014 102(a)(5) (107 Ill. 2d Rules 7 \u2014 101(a)(3), l-102(a)(5)).</p> <p id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202\">FACTORS IN MITIGATION</p> <p id=\"b202-6\" pgmap=\"202\">The Hearing Board found the following factors in mitigation. First, respondent had not previously been subject to discipline. Moreover, seven character witnesses, including three judges and several attorneys, \u201cconsistently and uniformly attested that [respondent\u2019s] reputation for honesty and integrity was above reproach.\u201d Among the details of this character testimony was that respondent (1) could not deny assistance to anyone needing help; (2) is a vigorous advocate of his clients; (3) assists youth sports and Marian High School; and (4) often works many hours without billing clients, working on cases where clients have stopped paying him or where they cannot afford to pay him.</p> <p id=\"b202-7\" pgmap=\"202\">The Hearing Board concluded, after considering the record as a whole, and specifically noting the demeanor of the witnesses and the credibility of their testimony, that respondent\u2019s handling of each of his client\u2019s funds was not motivated by a dishonest or fraudulent purpose towards his clients. The Hearing Board found instead that the conversions and commingling of funds occurred \u201cbecause [respondent] lost control over the administration of his law practice and *** permitted unprofessional, and unacceptable practices to govern his handling of funds.\u201d The Hearing Board also found:</p> <blockquote id=\"b202-8\" pgmap=\"202(38) 203(169)\">\u201c[Resondent] was literally on the edge of an abyss every day, hardly able to keep up with each day\u2019s schedule, frequently late or missing altogether motion or trial calls, which in turn necessitated additional motions and hearings seeking leave to reinstate cases dismissed for want of prosecution. *** In this frenzy, the proper handling of money was simply overlooked, deemphasized or just plan [sic] forgotten. Corners were cut, not dishonestly or fraudulently, but in order to keep pace with the demands of trying to handle too many cases without proper assistance. Funds destined for the Timpone client funds account were deposited in personal accounts and funds in personal accounts were transferred to the client funds account in order to reimburse or pay funds to clients. Few records were kept, and there was little, if any, attention paid to the keeping of proper records of time spent handling a client\u2019s matters. It was almost inevitable in this atmosphere that Timpone\u2019s client funds account balance would fall below the amounts clients had entrusted to Timpone and that funds belonging to one client or to Timpone himself would be used to reimburse another client without any records or accountings made of these transactions.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b203-5\" pgmap=\"203\">FACTORS IN AGGRAVATION</p> <p id=\"b203-6\" pgmap=\"203\">The Hearing Board found the following factors in aggravation. First, the Board noted that Timpone refused to acknowledge that his handling of his client fund accounts was improper. The Board concluded that Timpone either fails to understand the mandatory rules of conduct or refuses to abide by them. The Hearing Board also noted Timpone\u2019s efforts to remove client\u2019s assets from the jurisdiction of the court to ensure that funds would be available to pay for the divorce proceeding.</p> <p id=\"b203-7\" pgmap=\"203\">HEARING BOARD\u2019S SANCTION</p> <p id=\"b203-8\" pgmap=\"203(57) 204(12)\">The Hearing Board determined in its report filed October 1, 1991, that respondent\u2019s conduct warranted suspension for one year and until further order of this court. The Board found that respondent needed to \u201cconvince the Administrator and the Court that he has remedied the deficiencies in the handling of funds and in the administration of his practice before being readmitted to the bar.\u201d ' \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">REVIEW BOARD</p> <p id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204\">Both the Administrator and respondent filed exceptions with the Review Board. On September 11, 1992, the Review Board filed its report which adopted the Hearing Board\u2019s findings of fact, but recommended a six-month suspension.</p> <p id=\"b204-7\" pgmap=\"204\">THIS COURT</p> <p id=\"b204-8\" pgmap=\"204\">The Administrator has filed exceptions to the Review Board\u2019s finding with this court, and argues (1) the Hearing and Review Boards erred in finding that respondent\u2019s conduct with regard to Lietza\u2019s and Olson\u2019s funds did not involve a dishonest motive; (2) the proper sanction for respondent\u2019s conduct is disbarment (although at oral argument the Administrator argued for a suspension for a significant period of time); and (3) respondent must pay restitution to certain clients. Respondent argues that the Hearing Board and Review Board were correct in their findings concerning Lietza and Olson and that his actions do not require more than a six-month suspension.</p> <p id=\"b204-9\" pgmap=\"204(109) 205(24)\">The Administrator first argues that the Hearing and Review Boards\u2019 finding that respondent\u2019s conduct with regard to Lietza\u2019s and Olson\u2019s funds is in error because it is against this court\u2019s precedent and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Such a finding, the Administrator argues, is contrary to this court\u2019s precedent because this court has held that loose, careless and dilatory practices with client funds and poor bookkeeping practices will not be accepted as explanations for conversion of client funds. The Administrator cites In re Grant (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 247, 253, where this court stated that \u201c[t]he hazards involved in commingling, coupled with the actual conversion of funds *** render explanations such as \u2018poor bookkeeping,\u2019 \u2018failure to fully understand the duty\u2019 and \u2018no dishonest motive\u2019 completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205\">However, as the Review Board noted, while such facts do not excuse or negate the conversion of client funds, they are evidence that the conversions were not due to dishonest motive, but instead due to the careless practices respondent employed. In this regard, such evidence is clearly mitigating in determining the sanction to be imposed. As this court stated in In re McLennon (1982), 93 Ill. 2d 215:</p> <blockquote id=\"b205-6\" pgmap=\"205\">\u201cConversion of a client\u2019s funds, with or without a \u2018dishonest motive,\u2019 simply cannot be countenanced. (In re Feldman (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 7, 11; In re Grant (1982), 89 Ill. 2d 247.) *** Of course, whether the commingling and conversion involved the \u2018dishonest motive\u2019 focused on by the Review Board is highly significant, as are all of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct, in determining the sanction to be imposed. [Citation.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) (McLennon, 93 Ill. 2d at 221.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b205-7\" pgmap=\"205\">Thus, the Hearing Board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s misconduct was due to his frenetic practice, which indicated no dishonest motive to defraud his clients, is mitigating in determining the sanction to be imposed.</p> <p id=\"b205-8\" pgmap=\"205(93) 206(97)\">The Administrator also argues that the Hearing and Review Boards erred in finding that respondent\u2019s dealings with Lietza and Olson did not involve a dishonest motive towards those clients. The Administrator argues that the manner in which respondent \u201cinduced\u201d Lietza and Olson to entrust him with their money, his handling of the funds, and his response to Lietza, Olson, and the ARDC regarding his handling of the funds \u201cclearly and convincingly demonstrate\u201d that respondent\u2019s actions were \u201cdeliberately planned and borne of impure motivations^] *** borne of deception and greed[,] and constituted nothing more than a shell game.\u201d Concerning Lietza, the Administrator notes that respondent ignored two court orders involving Lietza\u2019s money; inaccurately testified as to why the balance in his client fund account fell below zero; offered to pay Lietza $8,000 after she brought ARDC charges; and failed to account for his handling of Lietza\u2019s funds. With respect to Olson, the Administrator argues respondent \u201cinduced\u201d Olson to deposit a substantial amount of money with him which he placed in his personal accounts and implemented a scheme to place Olson\u2019s money outside the jurisdiction of the court.</p> <p id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">This court has noted that the Hearing Board is in a superior position to resolve factual disputes. The Hearing Board\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of witnesses, the resolution of conflicting testimony, and any other fact-finding judgments are entitled to great deference. (In re Blank (1991), 145 Ill. 2d 534, 547.) This is due to the fact that the Hearing Board is able to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and judge their credibility. (In re Hopper (1981), 85 Ill. 2d 318, 323.) Thus, the Hearing Board\u2019s factual determinations will generally not be disturbed unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. See In re Ushijima (1987), 119 Ill. 2d 51, 56-57.</p> <p id=\"b206-6\" pgmap=\"206(93) 207(81)\">We find no reason to disagree with the Hearing Board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s handling of Lietza\u2019s and Olson\u2019s client funds did not involve a dishonest or fraudulent motive towards those clients. Evidence was presented on both sides of this issue, and the Hearing Board, in a better position to judge such matters as credibility and intent, found that respondent did not act with a dishonest motive concerning his clients. Of note here, the Hearing Board placed particular emphasis on the witnesses\u2019 demeanor and credibility in reaching this conclusion. Moreover, despite the Administrator\u2019s argument, the evidence indicated, as the Hearing and Review Boards found, that respondent\u2019s practice was frenetic. Respondent worked from 4:30 a.m. until approximately 7:15 p.m., with a great deal of the day spent in court. Respondent also kept poor business records, not only of his time, but of his disbursals to his clients. Such evidence suggests that respondent\u2019s handling of Lietza\u2019s and Olson\u2019s money was the result of his hectic practice rather than of any dishonest intent towards his clients.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">However, while respondent\u2019s conduct did not involve a dishonest motive towards Lietza and Olson, it did involve a dishonest scheme to hide assets from the jurisdiction of the court to fund future litigation. Moreover, respondent\u2019s handling of Olson\u2019s money involved deceit, as respondent returned money to Olson from his client trust fund account which contained none of Olson\u2019s funds.</p> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">Sanction</p> <p id=\"b207-7\" pgmap=\"207\">In imposing discipline, our purpose is not to punish the attorney, but rather to \u201cprotect the public, to maintain the integrity of the profession and to protect the administration of justice from reproach. [Citations.]\u201d (In re Fox (1988), 122 Ill. 2d 402, 410.) Our goal is to impose sanctions consistent with sanctions imposed for similar misconduct so as to ensure predictability and fairness in future disciplinary cases. (Hopper, 85 Ill. 2d at 324.) We note, however, that each case is unique and must be resolved with respect to its particular facts and circumstances. Ushijima, 119 Ill. 2d at 57.</p> <p id=\"b207-8\" pgmap=\"207(60) 208(92)\">Both the Administrator and respondent have cited numerous cases in their respective arguments for disbarment and a six-month suspension. We find the cases of In re Lewis (1987), 118 Ill. 2d 357, and In re Elias (1986), 114 Ill. 2d 321, to be the most helpful in determining the proper sanction to be imposed in this case. In Elias, an attorney was suspended for three years for failing to maintain trust accounts, depositing client funds into personal and business accounts, commingling and converting client funds for business and personal use, and paying clients with checks which were at times dishonored. Elias induced clients into signing over settlement checks by writing those clients checks which he knew or should have known were drawn on accounts with insufficient funds. While none of Elias\u2019 clients suffered permanent loss, they did suffer injury in that their checks were at times dishonored.</p> <p id=\"b208-5\" pgmap=\"208\">In Lewis, an attorney was suspended for three years for engaging in a pattern of commingling and conversion. Lewis deposited settlement checks into one of his two trust accounts, and then withdrew money from those accounts to fund his professional corporation\u2019s operating account. The clients were eventually paid, and all but one with generous interest. In all, the respondent converted more than $100,000 of his clients\u2019 money temporarily for his own use. This court stated in Lewis:</p> <blockquote id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">\u201cWe have repeatedly stressed the importance of an attorney trust account and the gravity of converting client funds, even if done without an invidious motive. (See In re McLennon (1982), 93 Ill. 2d 215; In re Clayter (1980), 78 Ill. 2d 276.) Commingling or converting a client\u2019s funds is a matter of tremendous concern as it puts the client\u2019s money at risk of depletion or loss to creditors of the attorney entrusted with its safekeeping. Violating that trust is disreputable not only for the attorney involved, but for the entire legal profession.\u201d (Lewis, 118 Ill. 2d at 362-63.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208\">Moreover, this court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b208-8\" pgmap=\"208\">\u201cIt is past time for Illinois attorneys to accept their responsibilities in maintaining client trust accounts for the protection of their client\u2019s financial interests and the reputation of the bar.\u201d Lewis, 118 Ill. 2d at 364.</blockquote> <p id=\"b209-4\" pgmap=\"209\">In the instant case, respondent has converted over $70,000 of his clients\u2019 funds. While mitigating factors do exist, and the Hearing Board found that respondent did not harbor a dishonest motive towards his clients in handling these funds, respondent\u2019s conduct did involve deceit with respect to Olson and dishonesty in his scheme of hiding assets from the court. Respondent also engaged in this conduct despite court orders to account for and not dispose of certain funds. Moreover, respondent\u2019s misconduct was not an isolated incident, but consisted of a pattern of neglect of financial matters and of hiding assets from the court to fund future litigation. We find a three-year suspension from the practice of law appropriate in this case.</p> <p id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">Restitution</p> <p id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">The Administrator argues that respondent owes restitution to Lietza, Olson, and Serpico. Respondent denies any obligation to pay restitution to Lietza and Olson, and argues that he has paid restitution to Serpico.</p> <p id=\"b209-7\" pgmap=\"209\">The Administrator argues that respondent converted $18,665.59 of Lietza\u2019s funds, but notes that he has paid $9,600 of those funds to Lietza\u2019s husband. Thus, the Administrator argues, respondent owes Lietza approximately $9,065.59. However, the Hearing Board found that Lietza knew she would owe respondent attorney fees after her case concluded. Moreover, Lietza did not accept respondent\u2019s offer of $8,000, did not ask for money after this offer, and has not filed suit to recover these funds. Under these circumstances, we do not order respondent to pay Lietza restitution.</p> <p id=\"b209-8\" pgmap=\"209(32) 210(26)\">The Administrator also argues that respondent owes Olson at least $26,252.22 in restitution which respondent admitted spending for his own business purposes. However, Olson testified at the disciplinary hearing that he did not at that time seek the return of his money from respondent. Again, under these circumstances, we do not order respondent to pay Olson restitution.</p> <p id=\"b210-5\" pgmap=\"210\">However, these findings concerning restitution do not prevent any of the parties (including respondent) from seeking payment or return of any monies owed them. The findings are limited to the facts presented before us today.</p> <p id=\"b210-6\" pgmap=\"210\">The Administrator finally argues that as of the hearing date, respondent had made no efforts to satisfy the $2,320 judgment against him. However, respondent asserts in his brief that at the time the brief was being written, he was satisfying the judgment. The Administrator has filed a motion to strike this statement in respondent\u2019s brief, arguing that respondent had not satisfied the judgment. Respondent has also filed a motion supported with affidavit and argues that he in fact at that time was satisfying the judgment. The Administrator has not disputed this claim, and we thus find that respondent has in fact satisfied this judgment.</p> <p id=\"b210-7\" pgmap=\"210\">Accordingly, respondent is suspended from the practice of law for three years.</p> <p id=\"b210-8\" pgmap=\"210\">Respondent suspended.</p> <p id=\"b210-9\" pgmap=\"210\">JUSTICE McMORROW took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
