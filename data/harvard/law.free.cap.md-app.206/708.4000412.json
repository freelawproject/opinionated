But, before a member\u2019s child may have access to the play center, the member must execute a release agreement. The agreement, in addition to setting forth rules for the use of the club, ostensibly releases BJ\u2019s Wholesale from \u201cany and all claims and causes of action\u201d arising from the use of the play center by a member\u2019s child and requires a member to \u201cindemnify, defend and hold harmless\u201d BJ\u2019s Wholesale from any such claims or causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">As a member of BJ\u2019s Wholesale, Russell Rosen executed one of BJ\u2019s release agreements in July 2005. A little more than fifteen months later, on October 22, 2006, Mr. Rosen\u2019s wife, Beily Rosen, entrusted the Rosens\u2019 five-year-old son, Ephraim, to the play center, upon entering BJ\u2019s to shop. While playing there, Ephraim fell head first from \u201can elevated plastic play apparatus,\u201d suffering a serious brain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The Rosens thereafter brought a negligence action, on behalf of Ephraim and themselves, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, against BJ\u2019s Wholesale. In turn, BJ\u2019s filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>a counterclaim against the Rosens, alleging breach of the release agreement Mr. Rosen had signed, and later a motion for summary judgment invoking the same agreement. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of BJ\u2019s Wholesale, concluding that the release agreement was valid and enforceable. Claiming that it is neither, the Rosens noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Because we hold that a parent may not waive by agreement a minor child\u2019s future claim in negligence against what we shall refer to as a \u201ccommercial enterprise\u201d\u2014that is, a for-profit, commercial entity that principally serves private interests <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014we reverse the judgment below. We further hold that the release\u2019s indemnification clause is also unenforceable, because implementation of that clause under the circumstances of this case would obviate the very public policy considerations that underlie our conclusion that the exculpatory clause of the release agreement is both invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">BJ\u2019s Wholesale, a Fortune 500 corporation, operates a chain of \u201cmembership-only\u201d warehouse stores in the eastern United States. Russell and Beily Rosen were members and shopped at the BJ\u2019s store in Owings Mills, Maryland. As a courtesy to its members, BJ\u2019s offers, at its stores, a free, supervised children\u2019s play center, which BJ\u2019s calls the \u201cIncredible Kid\u2019s Club.\u201d But a member\u2019s children may not use the play center, unless the member signs a release, containing exculpatory and indemnification clauses, as well as rules that must be followed to use the play center. The rules speak to address such things as the minimum and maximum ages of a child using the center, the maximum length of time a child may remain at the play center on a single visit, the responsibility of parents to pick up their children and to answer the store\u2019s paging promptly, a prohibition against sick children using the play center, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>At the bottom of the single-page document, in bold print, but what appears to be eight-point type, are exculpatory and indemnification provisions which are the subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, the document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">I hereby acknowledge that the participation in BJ\u2019s Incredible Kid\u2019s Club (the \u201cPlay Center\u201d) is a benefit offered to me \u00e1s a part of my BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club membership. I further acknowledge that I have read, understood and I voluntarily agree to abide by all of the rules appearing above and/or rules as posted in the Play Center and registration area. In consideration for this service, I, individually and on behalf of my child, do hereby waive, release and forever discharge BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, successors and assigns from any and all claims and causes of action of any kind or nature which are in any way related, directly or indirectly, to the use of Play Center which I may have or that hereafter may accrue including any such claims or causes of action caused in whole or in part by the negligence of BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective agents, employees, officers, directors, successors and assigns. I understand that my child is here at my own risk and expense and agree that neither I nor my child will bring any claim or cause of action of any kind or nature against BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective agents, employees, officers, directors, successors and assigns. I further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective agents, employees, officers, directors, successors and assigns from any claims or causes of action of any kind arising from my or my child\u2019s use of the Play Center. By placing my signature below, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>acknowledge and agree that I have read this agreement, understood all of the terms and conditions contained herein, and that this agreement will be in full force and effect during each of my or my child\u2019s visit [sic] to the Play Center. This agreement shall remain in full force and effect at all times whether my child is dropped off at the Play Center by me or any one else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">On July 17, 2005, Russell Rosen signed this agreement. About fifteen months later, Beily Rosen took her five-year-old son Ephraim to the BJ\u2019s Wholesale store in Owings Mills, Maryland. Upon entering the store, she dropped Ephraim off at the play center. While Mrs. Rosen was shopping in BJ\u2019s, Ephraim climbed onto \u201can elevated plastic play apparatus known as Harry the Hippo\u201d at the play center and then fell approximately thirty-eight inches before striking his head on the floor below. Although \u201cmost of\u201d the concrete floor of the play center was covered with thick foam padding, Ephraim landed on a section of floor, which was covered by only a thin layer of carpet. Landing head first, he sustained life threatening injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Ephraim was promptly transported to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, where a CT<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> scan revealed that he had suffered a large, acute epidural hematoma in the right temporal lobe of his brain. He was then transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he underwent a craniectomy<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to relieve the fluid buildup in his brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Ultimately, Russell and Beily Rosen, individually and as parents and next friends of Ephraim, brought a negligence action in the Baltimore County circuit court against BJ\u2019s Wholesale, prompting BJ\u2019s Wholesale to file in response a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>counterclaim, alleging breach of the release agreement signed by Mr. Rosen. When BJ\u2019s later moved for summary judgment, invoking that agreement, the circuit court granted the motion. In so doing, it observed that, under Maryland law, exculpatory agreements executed by adults on their own behalf are enforceable and that there has been no articulation of public policy enforcement of such an agreement executed by a parent of a minor child. From that judgment, the Rosens noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This appeal presents a legal question of first impression in Maryland, that is, whether a release of liability, presented by a \u201ccommercial enterprise,\u201d as previously defined, and executed by a parent, on behalf of a minor child and before the child has sustained any injury, is enforceable. The Rosens contend that it is not, as a matter of public policy. The same is true, they maintain, as to the indemnification clause of the release agreement, since to rule otherwise would, according to the Rosens, obviate the very public policy that renders the exculpatory clause of the same agreement unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The Rosens\u2019 starting point is the settled proposition that, although \u201c[i]n the absence of legislation to the contrary, exculpatory clauses are generally valid,\u201d \u201c[tjhere are circumstances ... under which the public interest will not permit an exculpatory clause in a contraet[.]\u201d <em>Wolf v. Ford, </em>335 Md. 525, 531, 644 A.2d 522 (1994). The <em>Wolf </em>Court enumerated three public policy exceptions to the general rule favoring enforceability of exculpatory agreements: (1) \u201ca party will not be permitted to excuse its liability for intentional harms or for the more extreme forms of negligence, i.e., reckless, wanton, or gross\u201d; (2) \u201cthe contract cannot be the product of grossly unequal bargaining power\u201d; and (3) \u201cpublic policy will not permit exculpatory agreements in transactions affecting the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531-32, 644 A.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The \u201cultimate determination of what constitutes the public interest,\u201d the Court of Appeals has said, \u201cmust be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>considering the totality of the circumstances of any given case against the backdrop of current societal expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 644 A.2d 522. Such a backdrop may be found, the Rosens claim, in the Maryland Code<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in Maryland common law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>which, they point out, reflect a substantial public interest in protecting children and their rights to seek redress for negligence, when that negligence results in injury to them. We agree and add that the public interest in favor of protecting the claims of children carries additional weight where the tortfeasor is a \u201ccommercial enterprise,\u201d for the reasons outlined in the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">BJ\u2019s release agreement contains, as noted earlier, both an exculpatory and an indemnification clause. An exculpatory clause \u201cabsolve[s] [a party] from liability for its future negligence,\u201d <em>Adloo v. H.T. Brown Real Estate, Inc., </em>344 Md. 254, 257, 686 A.2d 298 (1996), by \u201cdenying] an injured party the right to recover damages from the person negligently causing the injury,\u201d <em>Scott v. Pacific West Mountain Resort, </em>119 Wash.2d 484, 491, 834 P.2d 6 (1992), while an indemnification clause \u201cattempts to shift responsibility for the payment of damages to someone other than the negligent party, usually back to the injured party,\u201d thereby \u201cproducing the same result as an exculpatory clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We begin with the exculpatory clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The central issue in this case is whether a parent may waive any and all future tort claims his or her child may have against a \u201ccommercial enterprise.\u201d As to this question, Maryland case law provides little guidance. Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has addressed whether a release signed by a parent waiving any and all future claims that his or her child may have against such an entity is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">That, of course, is not the case where an adult signs an agreement, releasing others from any future claims he or she may have against them. <em>Wolf v. Ford, supra, </em>335 Md. 525, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>644 A.2d 522 (clause in contract signed by eighteen-year-old, which waived any future claims against securities investment firm for trading losses resulting from the firm\u2019s negligence, held valid and enforceable); <em>Seigneur v. Nat\u2019l Fitness Inst. Inc., </em>132 Md.App. 271, 752 A.2d 631 (2000) (pre-injury release signed by adult injured in health and fitness club held valid and enforceable); <em>Boucher v. Riner, </em>68 Md.App. 539, 514 A.2d 485 (1986) (pre-injury release signed by Naval Academy midshipman injured while skydiving held valid and enforceable); <em>Winterstein v. Wilcom, </em>16 Md.App. 130, 293 A.2d 821 (1972) (pre-injury release signed by adult injured while drag racing on private property held valid and enforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In our quest to find case law that does address this issue, we turn to the appellate courts of other states. When we do, we find that a substantial majority of the state courts that have squarely considered whether a release agreement may bar future negligence claims of a child have held that such agreements are invalid and unenforceable on public policy grounds (the \u201cmajority view\u201d). <em>Galloway v. State, </em>790 N.W.2d 252 (Iowa 2010) (holding that parentally executed release, in favor of the state of Iowa, waiving minor child\u2019s personal injury claims as a condition of child\u2019s participation in educational field trip, violates public policy and is unenforceable); <em>Kirton v. Fields, </em>997 So.2d 349, 350 (Fla.2008) (holding that parent lacks authority to execute, on behalf of minor child, pre-injury release in favor of owners and operators of commercial motor sports park, \u201cwhen the release involves participation in a commercial activity\u201d); <em>Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, </em>187 N.J. 323, 338, 901 A.2d 381 (2006) (holding that \u201cparent\u2019s execution of a pre-injury release,\u201d in favor of operator of commercial skate park, \u201cof a minor\u2019s future tort claims arising out of the use of a commercial recreational facility is unenforceable\u201d); <em>Cooper v. Aspen Skiing Co., </em>48 P.3d 1229, 1231 (Colo.2002) (holding that pre-injury release and indemnification agreement, signed by both a mother and her seventeen-year-old son, in favor of for-profit skiing club and related entities, \u201cviolate[d] Colorado\u2019s public policy to protect mi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>nors\u201d), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-22-107(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>Hawkins v. Peart, </em>37 P.3d 1062 (Utah 2001) (holding that parentally executed release, on behalf of minor child, in favor of provider of for-profit trail guide service, containing both waiver of liability and indemnification provision, violates public policy and is unenforceable); <em>Scott v. Pacific West Mountain Resort, supra, </em>119 Wash.2d 484, 492, 834 P.2d 6 (holding that \u201cparent does not have legal authority to waive,\u201d in favor of commercial ski school, \u201ca child\u2019s own future cause of action for personal injuries resulting from a third party\u2019s negligence\u201d); <em>Meyer v. Naperville Manner, Inc., </em>262 Ill.App.3d 141, 146-47, 199 Ill.Dec. 572, 634 N.E.2d 411 (1994) (holding that, in the absence of statutory or judicial authorization, parent cannot waive, compromise, or release minor child\u2019s cause of action, in favor of commercial horse riding stable, \u201cmerely because of the parental relationship,\u201d although parent could waive his own cause of action arising from his child\u2019s injury); <em>Munoz v. II Jaz, Inc., </em>863 S.W.2d 207, 209-10 (Tex.App.1993) (holding that statute which \u201cgrants to the parents of a minor child the power to make decisions of substantial legal significance concerning the child\u201d does not give parents power to waive, in favor of operator of amusement park, child\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries because such an interpretation \u201cwould be against the public policy to protect minor children\u201d). <em>See also Woodman v. Kera LLC, </em>486 Mich. 228, 785 N.W.2d 1 (2010) (holding that pre-injury waiver of liability, signed by parent on behalf of his or her minor child, in favor of operator of commercial children\u2019s play facility, is unenforceable under \u201clongstanding\u201d Michigan common law); <em>Doyle v. Bowdoin College, </em>403 A.2d 1206, 1208 n. 3 (Me.1979) (observing that parent or guardian cannot release \u201cchild\u2019s, or ward\u2019s, cause of action\u201d in favor of private college and directors of summer hockey clinic held at that college); <em>Childress v. Madison </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>County, </em>777 S.W.2d 1 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989) (holding that mother had no authority to release, exculpate or indemnify local government and board of education against liability, on behalf of her twenty-year-old severely retarded son).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Although some state courts, a minority to be sure, have upheld the enforceability of agreements executed by a parent on behalf of a minor child, releasing a potential tortfeasor from future claims of the child (the \u201cminority view\u201d), they have generally done so not where a \u201ccommercial enterprise\u201d was the subject of the release, but where the release was of a claim against either a government agency or non-profit organization, or its agents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Sharon v. City of Newton, </em>437 Mass. 99, 769 N.E.2d 738 (2002) (holding that release and indemnification agreement in favor of a municipality, signed by both a father and his sixteen-year-old daughter, as a condition of permitting her to participate in extra-curricular sports, was enforceable); <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc., </em>82 Ohio St.3d 367, 374, 696 N.E.2d 201 (1998) (holding that \u201cparents have the authority to bind their minor children to exculpatory agreements in favor of volunteers and sponsors of nonprofit sport activities where the cause of action sounds in negligence\u201d and that such agreements \u201cmay not be disaffirmed by the child on whose behalf they were executed\u201d); <em>Hohe v. San Diego Unified School District, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1559, 1563, 274 Cal.Rptr. 647 (1990) (holding that releases in favor of a local school district and a parent, teacher, and student association, signed by a father and his fifteen-year-old daughter, as a condition of permitting her to participate in a hypnotism show sponsored by the association, were not \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Preliminarily, we observe that, while in most of the majority-view decisions noted above, the defendants were commercial entities, there are at least two decisions that have invalidated, on public policy grounds, pre-injury releases, executed by a parent, on behalf of minor children or other legally incompetent persons, where the defendants were governmental agencies: <em>Galloway v. State, </em>790 N.W.2d 252 (release executed by mother, on behalf of minor child, in favor of State of Iowa); <em>Childress v. Madison County, 111 </em>S.W.2d 1 (release executed by mother, on behalf of severely retarded adult child, in favor of county and local school board).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The question of whether a different rule should apply to government agencies, non-profit organizations, and their agents, on the one hand, and commercial enterprises, on the other, must await a case involving such an entity, or action by the General Assembly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For our purposes, it is enough to recognize that, in the instant case, BJ\u2019s Wholesale is unquestionably a commercial enterprise, and, thus, we need not and do not address whether we would apply the same rule, invalidating a parentally executed pre-injury release on behalf of a minor child, that waives any future claims that child may have, against a governmental entity (or, generally, a non-profit organization), as we apply here to a commercial enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The extraterritorial, majority-view decisions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that have invalidated, on public policy grounds, pre-injury agreements, executed by a parent on behalf of a minor child, purporting to release a \u201ccommercial enterprise,\u201d share a number of common features. In each case, a parent had executed, on his or her minor child\u2019s behalf, a release agreement (with or without an indemnification clause) in favor of a private commercial enterprise,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> usually as a pre-condition for allowing the child\u2019s access to and participation in some recreational activity. While participating in that activity, the child sustained injuries, and suit was thereafter brought on the child\u2019s behalf. In each case, the defendant entity attempted to shield itself from liability by invoking the release agreement, and the trial court granted summary judgment or, as in one case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a motion to dismiss. Thus, all of these cases present the same legal issue and were in essentially the same procedural posture. Consequently, in lieu of a repetitious recitation of the facts, procedural posture, and holding of each of these cases, seriatim, an exercise which would serve to obscure, rather than clarify, we shall, instead, distill the holdings of all of these decisions and the reasoning underlying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">There are several common threads running through the majority-view decisions, though, admittedly, not all of these threads appear in every one of those decisions. First, the majority-view decisions have generally taken, as a starting point\u2014which, as we shall later explain, we, in Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>cannot\u2014statutes or rules which prohibit a parent from releasing, without court approval, a child\u2019s cause of action after an injury has occurred and extended those statutes or rules to the prospective, pre-injury setting. <em>See, e.g., Hojnowski, </em>187 N.J. at 333-34, 901 A.2d 381 (reasoning that, under New Jersey law, \u201cafter a minor has suffered a tortious injury, a minor\u2019s parent or guardian may not dispose of a minor\u2019s existing cause of action without statutory or judicial approval,\u201d regardless of whether suit has been filed on the minor\u2019s behalf and that, furthermore, \u201cchildren deserve as much protection from the improvident compromise of their rights before an injury occurs\u201d as afterwards) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>Cooper, </em>48 P.3d at 1233 (observing that the legislature \u201chas demonstrated an on-going commitment to afford minors significant safeguards from harm by passing numerous statutes designed to protect minor children,\u201d the \u201c[mjost significant\u201d of which \u201care the protections accorded minors in Colorado in the post-injury claim context\u201d); <em>Hawkins, </em>37 P.3d at 1066 (observing that there is no source of law \u201cgranting parents in Utah a general unilateral right to compromise or release a child\u2019s existing causes of action without court approval or appointment to that effect\u201d and that, as there is \u201clittle reason to base the validity of a parent\u2019s contractual release of a minor\u2019s claim on the timing of an injury,\u201d it concluded \u201cthat a parent does not have the authority to release a child\u2019s claims <em>before </em>an injury\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Scott, </em>119 Wash.2d at 492-94, 834 P.2d 6 (same). <em>But see Kirton, </em>997 So.2d at 354 (\u201cThe absence of a statute governing parental pre-injury releases demonstrates that the Legislature has not precluded the enforcement of such releases on behalf of a minor child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Second, in declining to enforce such agreements where minors are involved, a number of the majority-view courts have recognized, as the Supreme Court of Utah observed, that an \u201cexculpatory clause that relieves a party from future liability may remove an important incentive to act with reasonable care,\u201d that such clauses are \u201croutinely imposed in a unilateral manner without any genuine bargaining or opportunity to pay a fee for insurance,\u201d unlike post-injury releases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>liability, which \u201cinvolve actual negotiations concerning ascertained rights and liabilities,\u201d and that, \u201cif anything, the policies relating to restrictions on a parent\u2019s right to compromise an existing claim apply with even greater force in the preinjury, exculpatory clause scenario.\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>37 P.3d at 1066. The Supreme Court of New Jersey further observed, moreover, that \u201cat the time a parent decides to release the potential tort claims of his or her child, the parent may not fully understand the consequences of that action and may not have even read the waiver before signing.\u201d <em>Hojnowski, </em>187 N.J. at 333, 901 A.2d 381 (citing <em>Hawkins, </em>37 P.3d at 1066).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Third, expounding on the misalignment of incentives that may occur when exculpatory agreements are permitted, a number of majority-view courts have further noted that the owners and operators of commercial businesses are in a better position than minor children to eliminate hazards on their property and to insure themselves against any risks which cannot be eliminated, as the Supreme Court of Florida did in <em>Kirton v. Fields, </em>997 So.2d at 358. There, the Florida court observed that if \u201cpre-injury releases were permitted for commercial establishments, the incentive to take reasonable precautions to protect the safety of minor children would be removed,\u201d that a commercial business \u201ccan take precautions to ensure the child\u2019s safety and insure itself when a minor child is injured while participating in the activity,\u201d but that \u201ca minor child cannot insure himself or herself against the risks involved in participating in that activity.\u201d <em>Accord Hojnowski, </em>187 N.J. at 335-36, 901 A.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Fourth, several of the majority-view decisions have invoked the state\u2019s duty to act as <em>parens patriae, </em>because, in the words of the New Jersey Supreme Court, although parents \u201cundoubtedly have a fundamental liberty interest\u201d in rearing their children, \u201cthe question whether a parent may release a minor\u2019s future tort claims implicates wider public policy concerns and the <em>parens patriae </em>duty to protect the best interests of children.\u201d <em>Hojnowski, </em>187 N.J. at 339, 901 A.2d 381. <em>See also Kirton, </em>997 So.2d at 353 (observing that a parent\u2019s right to raise a child is \u201cnot absolute and the state as <em>parens patriae </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>may, in certain situations, usurp parental control\u201d); <em>Cooper, </em>48 P.3d at 1235 n. 11 (observing that a parental release on behalf of a minor child is \u201cnot of the same character and quality as those rights recognized as implicating ... parents\u2019 fundamental liberty interest in the \u2018care, custody, and control\u2019 of their children\u201d and that, even if such a release \u201cimplicates a parent\u2019s fundamental right to the care, custody, and control of his child, this right is not absolute\u201d) (quoting <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We turn now to the instant case. In so doing, we do not begin, as many of the majority-view decisions do, with a statute or rule that requires court approval before a parent may release a minor child\u2019s tort claim, after an injury has already occurred. That is because Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), section 6-405 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), provides, in its pertinent portion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">(a) In general.\u2014Any action, including one in the name of the State, brought by a next friend for the benefit of a minor may be settled by the next friend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Furthermore, Maryland Rule 2-202(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">Settlement of suits on behalf of minors. A next friend who files an action for the benefit of a minor may settle the claim in accordance with this subsection. If the next friend is not a parent or person <em>in loco parentis </em>of the child, the settlement is not effective unless approved by each living parent or person <em>in loco parentis. </em>If (1) both parents are dead and there is no person <em>in loco parentis </em>of the child or (2) one of the parents does not approve the settlement, the settlement is not effective unless approved by the court in which the suit is pending. Approval may be granted only on verified application by the next friend, stating the facts of the case and why the settlement is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Consequently, we do not apply the rationale of three of the majority-view <em>decisions\u2014Scott v. Pacific West Mountain Resort, supra, </em>119 Wash.2d 484, 884 P.2d 6; <em>Cooper v. Aspen Skiing Co., supra, </em>48 P.3d 1229; and <em>Hawkins v. Peart, supra, </em>37 P.3d at 1068\u2014since the fulcrum of those decisions was a statute or rule which, contrary to CJ section 6-405 and Rule 2-202, restricts a parent\u2019s authority to settle a minor\u2019s post-injury claim. <em>See Scott, </em>119 Wash.2d at 494 &amp; nn. 17-18, 834 P.2d 6; <em>Cooper, </em>48 P.3d at 1233 &amp; nn. 9-10; <em>Hawkins, </em>37 P.3d at 1066.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals has observed, \u201cThe State of Maryland has a <em>parens patriae </em>interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves and the child\u2019s welfare is a consideration that is of transcendent importance when the child might ... be in jeopardy.\u201d <em>In re Najasha B., </em>409 Md. 20, 33, 972 A.2d 845 (2009) (quotation omitted). Although this quote is drawn from a child-access case, the important public policy it proclaims is broad and certainly applies here, where adults may be jeopardizing the future welfare of their children by signing releases like the one at issue. It is this <em>parens patriae </em>interest which tilts the scales in favor of invalidating a parent\u2019s agreement to release his or her child\u2019s future tort claims against a \u201ccommercial enterprise,\u201d even though such an agreement, if executed by the parent on his or her own behalf, may be enforceable. <em>Wolf v. Ford, supra, </em>335 Md. at 531, 644 A.2d 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Although we are not unmindful of the strong presumption in favor of freedom of contract and the presumption, no less strong, that a parent acts in the best interests of his minor children, we nonetheless adopt the reasoning of <em>Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, supra, </em>187 N.J. 323, 901 A.2d 381, and <em>Kirton v. Fields, supra, </em>997 So.2d 349, and hold that a parent may not legally bind his or her minor child to a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>injury release of tort liability in favor of a commercial enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We anticipate that our holding will provide incentives for owners and operators of commercial facilities open to minor children to: (1) take reasonable safety precautions in the operation and maintenance of their facilities; and (2) obtain adequate insurance to cover the risk of physical injury to their minor patrons, caused by the negligence of their employees and agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that, because commercial enterprises \u201cderive economic benefit from\u201d the provision of their services, \u201cthey are better able to bear the costs associated with injuries than the children or their families,\u201d as they can \u201cspread the costs of insurance among [their] customers.\u201d <em>Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, supra, </em>187 N.J. at 336, 340, 901 A.2d 381. Moreover, as the <em>Kirton </em>Court noted, \u201ca commercial business can take precautions to ensure the child\u2019s safety.\u201d <em>Kirton, </em>997 So.2d at 357. That is, as the <em>Hojnowski </em>Court put it, the \u201coperator of a commercial recreational enterprise can inspect the premises for unsafe conditions, train his or her employees with regard to the facility\u2019s proper operation, and regulate the types of activities permitted to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335, 901 A.2d 381. To the extent that some of these considerations apply to releases of liability in favor of commercial businesses, which are enforceable against adults, the critical difference, we note, is that a minor child is far less capable of looking out for his own safety and welfare than an adult, a difference which, in our view, justifies a more protective rule for children. <em>Kirton, </em>997 So.2d at 359-60 (Anstead, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">BJ\u2019s Wholesale contends that the issue, concerning the enforceability of the indemnification clause, is unpreserved for appellate review, as it \u201cwas mentioned only tangentially in the court below,\u201d was \u201cnot the basis for BJ\u2019s motion for summary judgment,\u201d and was, according to BJ\u2019s Wholesale, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>relied upon nor considered by the trial court in rendering its decision. It further claims that the indemnification clause is not rendered invalid by any public policy consideration and that it is unambiguous and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We disagree. We believe that issue has been preserved for our review. BJ\u2019s quoted the release agreement, including its language regarding indemnification, both in its motion for summary judgment and in its reply memorandum below. Moreover, during the hearing before the circuit court, in its opening statement, BJ\u2019s stated that the Rosens \u201calso agreed to defend, indemnify and hold BJ\u2019s harmless for any claim that the child brought against BJ\u2019s.\u201d Finally, the Rosens\u2019 opposition to BJ\u2019s motion for summary judgment stated that \u201c[ejnforcing this waiver and indemnification clause would violate Maryland\u2019s generally recognized deeply-rooted public policy interest in protecting the best interests of children.\u201d Thus, the enforceability of the indemnification clause was clearly raised before the court below. Under Maryland Rule 8-131(a), that is all that is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Even if the issue were not expressly advanced below, it is, we conclude, \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the enforceability of the exculpatory clause, an issue the circuit court did address. As the Supreme Court of Utah observed, an indemnification clause, by shifting financial responsibility for a minor child\u2019s injury from a tortfeasor to the child\u2019s parent, \u201callow[s] negligent parties to circumvent\u201d the \u201crule voiding waivers signed on behalf of a minor.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Peart, supra, </em>37 P.3d at 1067. Although an indemnification clause \u201ctheoretically\u201d binds only the parent who signed it, \u201cas a practical matter, it could chill,\u201d that court observed, a child\u2019s pursuit of his own claims against a negligent party, <em>as </em>his parent \u201cwould be the ultimate source of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Moreover, in <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 243-44, 932 A.2d 571 (2007), the Court of Appeals observed that \u201cif two or more similar and \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 grounds for summary judgment exist,\u201d an appellate court \u201cmay consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>alternatively any related ground, if raised properly by the litigant in his, her, or its motion for summary judgment, if we find fault with the ground relied upon facially by the trial court.\u201d Thus, although, ordinarily, we \u201cwill consider only the grounds upon which the [trial] court relied in granting summary judgment,\u201d <em>Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 10, 816 A.2d 844 (2003) (quotation omitted), the instant case falls within the exception to that rule, as described in <em>Conaway, </em>401 Md. at 243-44, 932 A.2d 571. Accordingly, we shall address whether the indemnification clause is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We begin by construing the indemnification clause, which, unlike the exculpatory clause, does not refer exclusively to negligence. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\"><em>I further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless </em>BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective agents, employees, officers, directors, successors and assigns <em>from any claims or causes of action of any kind arising from my or my child\u2019s use of the Play Center.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Because this language does not expressly indemnify for negligence, the Rosens claim that it is not \u201csufficiently explicit\u201d to be enforceable, relying on <em>Adloo v. H.T. Brown Real Estate, Inc., supra, </em>344 Md. 254, 686 A.2d 298. But that decision also stated that, in Maryland, an exculpatory (or indemnification) clause \u201cneed not contain or use the word \u2018negligence\u2019 or any other \u2018magic words,\u2019 \u201d but, rather, \u201cis sufficient ... \u2018as long as [its] language ... clearly and specifically indicates the intent to release the defendant from liability for personal injury caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 686 A.2d 298 (quoting <em>Barnes v. New Hampshire Karting Ass\u2019n, </em>128 N.H. 102, 509 A.2d 151, 154 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The indemnification clause follows the exculpatory clause, which states that the parent \u201cindividually and on behalf of [his] child, [does] hereby waive, release and forever discharge BJ\u2019s ... from any and all claims and causes of action of any kind or nature which are in any way related, directly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>indirectly, to the use of Play Center which [he] may have or that hereafter may accrue including any such claims or causes of action caused in whole or in part by the negligence of BJ\u2019s.\u201d In contrast to the exculpatory clause, the indemnification clause appears to express BJ\u2019s intent to be indemnified \u201cfrom any claims or causes of action of any kind arising from [the parent\u2019s or the] child\u2019s use of the Play Center.\u201d It thus shields BJ\u2019s from liability in any case arising from a child\u2019s use of the play center, whether sounding in negligence or not. When viewed in context, the indemnification clause is not limited to BJ\u2019s negligence, and, contrary to the Rosens\u2019 assertion, the indemnification clause is not ambiguous and does not \u201cconsist[ ] of general release language,\u201d and <em>Adloo </em>does not, necessarily, bar its enforceability.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Instead, we are confronted with an indemnification clause that, facially, overreaches. Because \u201ca party will not be permitted to excuse its liability for intentional harms or for the more extreme forms of negligence, i.e., reckless, wanton, or gross,\u201d the indemnification clause, despite its express terms, cannot indemnity BJ\u2019s against its own heightened culpability. <em>Wolf, supra, </em>335 Md. at 531, 644 A.2d 522. Subject to this limitation, however, the indemnification clause unambiguously seeks to require the signatory parent to indemnify BJ\u2019s from its negligent acts arising from use of the play center. We thus consider whether this clause, so construed, is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">For the same public policy reasons relied upon in holding the exculpatory clause unenforceable against Ephraim, we hold that the indemnification clause is unenforceable against his parents. As previously noted, \u201c[w]ere the rule otherwise, it would circumvent the rule regarding exculpatory clauses and the policy of affording protection in the law to the rights of those who are unable effectively to protect those rights themselves.\u201d <em>Childress v. Madison County, supra, </em>777 S.W.2d at 7. \u201cAs a practical matter, release and indemnity provisions in contracts signed by parents or guardians on behalf of their minor children go hand-in-hand: having invali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>dated release provisions, it would be contradictory to then effectively undercut a minor\u2019s rights to sue by allowing indemnity clauses that make such suits for all realistic purposes unlikely.\u201d <em>Cooper, supra, </em>48 P.3d at 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Indeed, indemnification clauses in contracts executed by parents on behalf of their minor children create an unacceptable conflict of interest between a parent and child. <em>Hawkins, </em>37 P.3d at 1067. As the Court of Appeals of New York observed in <em>Valdimer v. Mt. Vernon Hebrew Camps, Inc., </em>9 N.Y.2d 21, 25, 210 N.Y.S.2d 520, 172 N.E.2d 283 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-F\">A fortiori, we are extremely wary of a transaction that puts parent and child at cross-purposes and, in the main, normally tends to quiet the legitimate complaint of the minor child. Generally, we may regard the parent\u2019s contract of indemnity, however well-intended, as an instrument that motivates him to discourage the proper prosecution of the infant\u2019s claim, if that contract be legal. The end result is either the outright thwarting of our protective policy or, should the infant ultimately elect to ignore the settlement and to press his claim, disharmony within the family unit. Whatever the outcome, the policy of the State suffers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED.

That statute provides that a \"parent of a child may, on behalf of the child, release or waive the child\u2019s prospective claim for negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\">. The one minority-view decision, cited by appellee, where a commercial defendant successfully invoked a parentally executed, pre-injury release, did not address either the parents' authority to bind their minor son to the release or whether there was a meaningful distinction between commercial and non-commercial defendants, and thus, we do not find that decision helpful. <em>Brooks v. Timberline Tours, Inc., </em>941 F.Supp. 959 (D.Colo.1996) (applying Colorado law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">. Although the Court of Appeal of California held that a parentally executed release could bar a minor child from recovery for another\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>negligence, the appellate court construed the releases in that case as ambiguous and reversed a trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. <em>Hohe v. San Diego Unified School District, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 1559, 1565-68, 274 Cal.Rptr. 647 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">. In <em>Doyle v. Bowdoin College, </em>403 A.2d 1206 (Me.1979), one of the defendants was Bowdoin College, a private educational institution. In that case, however, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine interpreted the putative releases as being ambiguous and, hence, unenforceable, <em>id. </em>at 1208, and the Maine court stated that it had \"no occasion to reach the further issue whether contractual provisions which relieve a party from liability for that party\u2019s own negligence would be unenforceable and void as contravening public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1207 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">.
