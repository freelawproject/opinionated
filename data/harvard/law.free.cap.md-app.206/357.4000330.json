We, therefore, reverse the second conviction for theft (\u201cCount Five\u201d) and the second conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card (\u201cCount Seven\u201d). We vacate the sentence for the second conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card (\u201cCount Seven\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We answer question III in the negative in all other respects.

Mellott testified that a man, whom she identified as appellant, entered the store with an unidentified man and woman. According to Mellott, appellant gave her a piece of jewelry to clean, and as she was cleaning the piece of jewelry, one of its stones fell out. Mellott offered to send out the piece of jewelry to have it fixed for free. Mellott testified that appellant declined the offer and, \u201cseem[ing] very agitated!,]\u201d started \u201ctrying to bargain with [her]. Maybe to give him free things or something for him having to go get [his piece of jewelry] fixed somewhere else.\u201d According to Mellott, appellant \u201cbegan pointing at the cases saying he wanted things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">According to Mellott, appellant told her to keep her hands above the counter where he could see them, and every time she moved her hands, he became \u201chostile.\u201d Mellott testified that appellant\u2019s \u201cvoice was very strong and loud. He was very demanding of [her] to do exactly what he said. Not to leave the area.\u201d Mellott testified that appellant \u201ctold [her] to stand in a certain spot and he kept saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to do this,\u2019 and he told [her] not to move[.]\u201d According to Mellott, if she did not follow appellant\u2019s directions, appellant \u201cwould start speaking louder towards [her] or demanding [her] to do things.\u201d Mellott testified that she did not feel that she was free to leave and go into the store\u2019s office because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [appellant] was going to do.\u201d When asked: \u201cWhen you said you were scared and fearful were you fearful that you maybe hurt[,]\u201d Mellott replied: \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mellott testified that she felt \u201cvery uncomfortable. [She] was scared for [her] life because [she] didn\u2019t know what was going to happen if [she] didn\u2019t listen to\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">According to Mellott, appellant pointed to a ring that was part of a bridal set that was priced around $2,000, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Mellott testified that appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t have his ID or a credit card.\u201d The unidentified man left the store, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and stood outside while holding a cell phone and a piece of paper. The man spoke into the cell phone, re-entered the store, and handed to appellant the paper\u2014which had a credit card number and an expiration date written on it. Mellott testified that appellant, in a very \u201cangry\u201d voice, ordered her to type the paper\u2019s credit card number into the store\u2019s debit machine. Mellott was not supposed to enter a credit card number without the credit card, \u201cbut because of feeling threatened [she] did do it. [She] continuously asked [appellant] for his ID telling him [that she] could not do it----He told [her that she] had to do it.\u201d Mellott testified that she would \u201cnever\u201d have entered the credit card number if appellant had not acted the way that he did. Mellott testified that she \u201ctyped in a wrong number\u201d and that appellant said, \u201cYou typed in the wrong number. Give it to me. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Mellott then typed in the correct credit card number from the paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Mellott testified that the credit card number was declined and that appellant then chose another ring\u2014the other ring in the $2,000 bridal set. Mellott testified that she charged the credit card number for $1,000, \u201c[b]ut it was two thousand so [appellant] told [her] to do it again.\u201d Mellott rang up two separate charges for $1,000 on the credit card number from the piece of paper. According to Mellott, appellant left the store with the two rings from the $2,000 bridal set. Mellott testified that her cash register was equipped with an alarm button, which she did not press during the incident. During Mellott\u2019s encounter with appellant, one of her coworkers was in the watch repair room, a closet-sized room directly behind the jewelry counter with a door that was \u201calways open.\u201d Mellott testified that, during the encounter, she telephoned Mary Screen, the store manager, to tell Screen that a customer \u201cdidn\u2019t have an ID and [she] didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d According to Mellott, Screen arrived at the store no more than about ten minutes before the transaction\u2019s end.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">As a witness for the State, Screen testified that on June 8, 2008, she was the manager of King\u2019s Jewelry Store and \u201cgot a phone call ... that there[ was] something going on in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>store.\u201d According to Screen, she entered the store and saw Mellott behind the counter waiting on a customer, whom Screen identified at trial as appellant. Mellott looked \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cwas shaking. She was trembling.\u201d According to Screen, appellant was \u201cbeing very impatient. [She] went in and actually made the phone call to the credit card company to get it approved and [appellant] said, \u2018Don\u2019t waste the energy, hang up the phone.\u2019 \u201d Screen testified that appellant made her feel \u201c[v]ery uncomfortable\u201d because of \u201c[h]is demeanor. The way he was speaking.\u201d Screen testified that she had been working at the store since 1999, and had dealt with difficult customers before. Screen responded \u201c[v]ery\u201d when asked if she would classify appellant as \u201c[b]eyond being difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">As a witness for the State, Joan Lamoy testified that, around June or July of 2008, one of her credit cards was declined. Lamoy testified that she called her credit card company and was told that her credit card was declined because of large purchases, \u201cat least a couple thousand dollars,\u201d at a jewelry store. Lamoy testified that she never gave anyone permission to use her credit card number. According to the charging document, Lamoy\u2019s credit card number was the one that appellant used on June 6, 2008, at King\u2019s Jewelry Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">As a witness for the State, Rhonda Maketa testified that, in 2008, she was a \u201cpoint of sale coordinator\u201d at King\u2019s Jewelry Store\u2019s corporate office. Maketa testified that credit cardholders\u2019 banks would contact her office when the credit cardholders disputed charges. Maketa testified that, in July 2008, Heartland Payment Systems\u2014King\u2019s Jewelry Store\u2019s credit card processor\u2014asked her office to investigate two charges that had been made on June 8, 2008, at King\u2019s Jewelry Store in Hagerstown. According to Maketa, Heartland Payment Systems believed that the credit cardholder had not authorized the two charges. The State offered into evidence, as State\u2019s Exhibit 2, a two-page document that Maketa identified as two separate requests to her office from Heartland Payment Systems for \u201cretrieval,\u201d or documentation, of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>$1,000 charges that had been made on June 8, 2008, at the King\u2019s Jewelry Store in Hagerstown. The circuit court admitted State\u2019s Exhibit 2 without objection. Maketa testified that Heartland Payment Systems reversed the two charges of $1,000, leaving King\u2019s Jewelry Store without the merchandise or the $2,000 in payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Jury\u2019s Impaneling</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">On May 16, 2011, a jury panel convened for selection of the jury for appellant\u2019s trial. Before <em>voir dire, </em>the jury panel was sworn, as follows:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">CLERK: Do you and each of you solemnly promise and declare that you shall true answers make to such questions, as the Court shall demand of you? If so please answer I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">JURY PANEL [ ]: (IN UNISON) I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">CLERK: Please be seated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-12\"><em>Voir dire </em>ensued, and a twelve-member jury was selected. The circuit court picked a foreperson, dismissed the jury panel\u2019s remainder, and took a brief recess. The circuit court resumed, ordered the witnesses sequestered, addressed a defense motion, and summoned the jury to begin opening statements. The swearing of the jury appears nowhere in the record. The docket entries say nothing about whether or not the jury was sworn. The record reflects that neither party ever requested that the jury be sworn. After hearing all of the evidence and deliberating, the jury delivered a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">After the State rested, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>[A]s Count 1 [robbery] goes, the State is required to establish that [appellant] took the property from the victim\u2019s [Mellott\u2019s] presence and control, that [appellant] took the property by force or threat of force and that [appellant] intended to deprive the victim of the property. Your Hon- or, [appellant] at this time is most concerned with the allegations as far as element number two, that [appellant] took the property by force or by threat of force. And I would argue [Y]our Honor, in addition to the original, to the first stated argument as far as a[n] incorrect victim having been listedf[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] that there has been no testimony that there was a force or that there was a threat of force. Indeed the testimony that the State has heard was that, or that the State has presented, was that she might, [appellant] spoke in a tone of voice. The voice was strong. The voice was demanding. He spoke louder. She [Mellott] was uncomfortable. She never said he threatened her. She never said that he threatened her with force. Whether or not she, she very well may have been scared. The fact that she might have been scared is an element that is separate and apart from what the elements of a robbery are. Threat or threat of force. There was no[ ] testimony that there was a threat or that there was a threat of force. It\u2019s that simple. There\u2019s no[ ] testimony as to [a] weapon. There was testimony that she was. She was scared. He used a loud voice. Well that in [and] of itself [Y]our Honor I don\u2019t think is sufficient to establish the elements that are required as far as a robbery to allow Count number 1 [robbery] to go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">[I]n order to establish, in order for there to be legal and sufficient evidence [of second-degree assault] to go to the jury, the State has to establish that [appellant] committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the attack with the intent of placing her [Mellott] in fear. What\u2019s most important is that [appellant] had the apparent ability at the time to bring about the offensive physical contact and harm. I think that this is separate and apart from whatever her subjective belief was she believed, she was scared, she believed she was going to be hurt, I believe that\u2019s her belief as far as whether or not there was a force or a threat of force. But as far as whether or not [appellant] had the apparent ability, there was no testimony\u2014The only testimony that the Court heard was that [appellant] was in the store. In fact, the Court actually heard testimony that there were two other people in the store, a customer and a sales clerk. There was no information that\u2014The Court heard the information that she was behind the sales counter. There was no information that he tried to leap the sales counter. There was no information that he leaned forward. There was no testimony whatsoever that he in any way, shape or form, had the ability to carry forth this assault, number one. Number two, or I guess it\u2019s element number three, is that she [Mellott] reasonably feared immediate contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Again, my position would be and based on what the Court\u2019s ruling is that she may have had a subjective] belief of this or whether or not this belief was reasonable. I don\u2019t believe that it was a reasonable belief. There were three, 2 other people in the store. Nobody called the police so I\u2019m not sure how reasonable her belief was. Again, I believe it was a subjective belief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">Your Honor, so far as Count 4 [theft] and Count 5 [same] we would submit on the evidence that has been presented so far. 6 [obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card], 7 [same], 8 [unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number], and 9 [same] [we] also submit with the argument that we don\u2019t believe there has been legally sufficient evidence as far as all the elements that are required under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>obtaining property by theft or misrepresentation or as well as the unlawful disclosing of a payment device number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHh\">The circuit court denied the motion as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Swearing of the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"AAl\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to swear the jury. Appellant argues that \u201c[tjhere is plainly a difference between administering an oath to prospective jurors prior to <em>voir dire, </em>and swearing twelve impaneled jurors.\u201d Appellant asserts that, \u201c[bjecause the jurors who were ultimately selected to hear [appellant\u2019s case were never sworn to well and truly hear the evidence, follow the [circuit court\u2019s instructions and reach a fair verdict, [appellant\u2019s right to an impartial jury was improperly denied[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The State responds that appellant \u201chas failed to rebut the presumption of regularity in the present case [because, although the record does not affirmatively show that the jury was sworn, [appellant has] not overcome the presumption that the jury was, in fact, given the oath.\u201d The State contends that, \u201cother than noting the absence of the oath in the record, [appellant] has not offered any evidence to support his claim that the jury was not sworn.\u201d The State argues that \u201cthere were no affirmative statements by counsel or the [circuit] court on the record and no motion for a new trial alerting the [circuit] court to any problem. Indeed, the first complaint regarding the swearing of the jury comes on appeal.\u201d The State asserts that \u201c[t]he mere fact that the record fails to show an affirmative statement indicating that the jury was sworn does not automatically invalidate the verdict.\u201d Alternatively, the State concedes that, \u201c[i]f this Court should find that [appellant] has established that the jury was not sworn in the present case, the proper remedy is to remand the case for retrial[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In a reply brief, appellant contends that, in <em>Harris, infra, </em>the Court of Appeals did not hold that a presumption of regularity applies to the issue of whether the jury was sworn. Appellant argues that \u201cthe record must affirmatively show that the jury was sworn, that there is no \u2018presumption of regularity\u2019 regarding the swearing of the jury and that he does not bear any burden other than to show that there is no swearing of the jury in the transcript.\u201d Appellant asserts that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there is a presumption of regularity, he \u201chas rebutted that presumption\u201d because \u201cthe transcript lack[s] any affirmative swearing of the selected petit jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">(a) Requirement to Swear the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Maryland Rule 4\u2014312(g)(1) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe individuals to be impaneled as sworn jurors ... shall be sworn.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-312(g)(l) \u201crepresents the codification of a long-standing common law requirement.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>406 Md. 115, 124, 956 A.2d 204 (2008).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In <em>Harris, id. </em>at 132, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded for a new trial where \u201cthe jury which convicted the [defendant] was never sworn[.]\u201d In <em>Harris, </em>after <em>voir dire </em>was conducted, jurors were chosen, and a foreperson was selected, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cDefense Counsel: Your Honor, is the Jury going to be sworn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cThe Court: They\u2019re going to lunch. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cDefense Counsel: I was just asking if they will be sworn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cThe Court: They are excused until 1:30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 956 A.2d 204. \u201cThe transcript [did] not reflect that the jury was sworn once they returned from lunch or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the jury was ever sworn thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 956 A.2d 204. The unsworn jury convicted the defendant, who moved for a new trial on the ground that the jury had never been sworn. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 956 A.2d 204. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and the Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 122, 956 A.2d 204. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">... Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that in a criminal prosecution, the accused is entitled to \u201ctrial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d Courts have held that a sworn jury is an element of an \u201cimpartial\u201d jury and is necessary for a \u201clegally constituted\u201d jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">Consequently, the failure to administer the oath to the jurors in the case at bar was clearly error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 125-27, 956 A.2d 204. The Court held that \u201cthere was no waiver of [the defendantj\u2019s objection to the unsworn jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 122, 956 A.2d 204, because \u201c[djefense counsel twice called the trial [courtj\u2019s attention to the failure to swear the jury\u201d on the day of trial, <em>id. </em>at 130, 956 A.2d 204, and, after the jury delivered a verdict, moved for a new trial on the ground that the jury had never been sworn. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 956 A.2d 204. Nonetheless, the Court stated: \u201c[Pjrineiples of waiver and harmless error are inapplicable when a jury in a criminal case has never been sworn.... [T]he administration of the oath is an essential ingredient of a legally constituted jury and an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 956 A.2d 204. The Court stated that \u201ca jury which has never been sworn falls into the same \u2018structural error\u2019 category as a defective reasonable doubt instruction, the denial of a right to a jury trial, the total deprivation of counsel, discrimination in the selection of juries, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 956 A.2d 204 (emphasis added). \u201cA structural error is one that amounted to structural defects in the trial itself.\u201d <em>Boulden v. State, </em>414 Md. 284, 308, 995 A.2d 268 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Structural error cannot be harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 995 A.2d 268 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In <em>Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 96, 109, 994 A.2d 896 (2010), the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions, determining that a \u201cbelated administration of the oath to jurors\u201d constituted harmless error. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">We agree with the majority view that draws a distinction between (1) a jury which is never sworn or not sworn prior to deliberations, and (2) a jury that is belatedly sworn, but the oath is administered before the commencement of jury-deliberations. As previously discussed, the reasons for treating the former as structural error do not apply to the latter. Accordingly, in the latter situation, the error is subject to a harmless error analysis. Where the defendant is not prejudiced by the delay, the late administration of the oath will ordinarily cure the error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 107, 994 A.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">(b) Presumption of Regularity</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">In <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 122, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals discussed the presumption of regularity generally, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">There is a presumption of regularity which normally attaches to trial court proceedings, although its applicability may sometimes depend upon the nature of the issue before the reviewing court. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Nonetheless, the presumption of regularity is rebuttable. <em>Beales v. State, supra, </em>329 Md. at 274, 619 A.2d at 110-111.

In <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 124, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cany presumption of regularity was overcome\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">The trial transcript clearly shows that the jury was not sworn before the jurors were dismissed for lunch. When the jury reconvened after lunch, the transcript reveals that the Circuit Court proceeded directly with opening statements, without the oath being administered to the jury. According to the trial transcript, which the official reporter of the Circuit Court certified as being \u201ccomplete and accurate,\u201d the jury was not sworn at any point during the trial. The docket entry stating that the jury was not sworn reinforces the accuracy of the transcript.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 122-23, 956 A.2d 204 (emphasis added). The Court discussed <em>United States v. Pinero, </em>948 F.2d 698 (11th Cir. 1991), in which, according to the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[T]he argument that the jury was not sworn was made for the first time on appeal, and the [federal] appellate court pointed out that there were no statements by trial counsel, the court reporter, or anyone else present at the trial, that the jury had not been sworn. In this context, the federal appellate court simply stated that \u201c[t]he mere absence of an affirmative statement in the record ... is not enough to establish that the jury was not in fact sworn.\u201d <em>Pinero, </em>948 F.2d at 700.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">The record in the present matter offers substantially more than the record in <em>Pinero </em>to establish that the jury was not sworn. The docket entries contain the affirmative statement that the jury was not sworn.

After careful consideration of the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Harris, </em>and authorities from Maryland and other jurisdictions, we are convinced that the presumption of regularity applies to the issue of whether a jury has been sworn. In <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 123-24, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals identified the following circumstances that, in combination, overcame \u201cany presumption of regularity,\u201d <em>ie. </em>that the jury had been sworn: \u201cThe docket entries contain[ed] the affirmative statement that the jury was not sworn[, and t]he trial transcript also show[ed] two inquiries from defense counsel regarding the unsworn jury, in addition to an inquiry from the courtroom clerk.\u201d Because of these four references to the jury being unsworn, the Court held that the defendant \u201cdid establish that the jury was not sworn[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 956 A.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">After concluding that the defendant had established that the jury was not sworn, the Court of Appeals discussed cases from other jurisdictions and declined to express an opinion with respect to the presumption of regularity. <em>Id. </em>at 124 n. 1, 956 A.2d 204. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">Since the Court of Special Appeals and the arguments in this Court have focused on whether the presumption of regularity was overcome, we have dealt with the issue on this basis. We point out, however, that there is authority holding that the record must affirmatively show that the jury was sworn. <em>See, e.g., Slaughter v. State, </em>100 Ga. 323, 329, 28 S.E. 159, 161 (1897) (\u201c \u2018[T]he fact of swearing [the jurors] must appear on the record\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Frazier, </em>339 Mo. 966, 980, 98 S.W.2d 707, 715 (1936) (\u201c[I]t is imperative that the jury be sworn to try the cause and that the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>show it\u201d); <em>State v.

Moreover, most of the cases in other states, dealing with the issue of whether jurors were sworn, have not considered the issue in terms of a presumption of regularity. Nevertheless, we need not, and therefore do not, express an opinion with respect to this matter. We have simply assumed, arguendo, that a presumption of regularity is applicable to the issue of whether the jury was sworn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Hams, </em>406 Md. at 124 n. 1, 956 A.2d 204 (emphasis added) (some alterations in original). With this discussion, the Court of Appeals identified four cases, the most recent of which was decided in 1936.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>All four of these cases predate the four cases that, the Court of Appeals determined, support the proposition that \u201c[tjhere is a presumption of regularity which normally attaches to trial court proceedings, although its applicability may sometimes depend upon the nature of the issue before the reviewing court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122, 956 A.2d 204. The four former cases were all decided by courts of other States, while the four latter cases were decided either by the United States Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Ultimately, in <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 123, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals pointed out that in Pinero\u2014a case upon which the State and this Court relied\u2014the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit determined that the defendant had failed to show that the jury had not been sworn. The federal appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The mere absence of an affirmative statement in the record, however, is not enough to establish that the jury was not in fact sworn____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">In the end, then, we are left with an issue of fact\u2014 whether the [trial] court administered the oath to the jury. [An appellate] court, however, is not the appropriate body to resolve factual issues. When the factual issue is raised for the first time on appeal, this is especially true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Pinero, </em>948 F.2d at 700 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). In <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 128, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals concluded that the record on appeal \u201coffer[ed] substantially more than the record in <em>Pinero </em>to establish that the jury was not sworn.\u201d Although the Court declined to express an opinion as to the applicability of the presumption of regularity, <em>id. </em>at 124 n. 1, 956 A.2d 204, a fair reading of <em>Harris </em>is that the absence of an affirmative statement in the record is not enough to establish that a jury is unsworn. From this logic, we conclude that the presumption of regularity applies to the issue of whether a jury has been sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the holdings of the Court of Appeals in <em>Nicolas v. State, </em>426 Md. 385, 44 A.3d 396 (2012), and <em>Black v. State, </em>426 Md. 328, 44 A.3d 362 (2012). In <em>Nicolas, </em>426 Md. at 419, 44 A.3d 396, the Court held that the defendant failed to overcome the presumption of regularity as to whether or not the trial court received a certain note from the jury during deliberations. Although the note was part of the record, the note \u201cwas never mentioned in the trial transcript, it was never marked as an exhibit, it was never responded to by the [trial] court, and it contained no date or time-stamp.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 44 A.3d 396. The Court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\">[T]here is a presumption of regularity which normally attaches to trial court proceedings, although its applicability may sometimes depend upon the nature of the issue before the reviewing court. <em>Harris v. State, </em>406 Md. 115, 122, 956 A.2d 204, 208 (2008) (citations omitted). To overcome the presumption of regularity or correctness, the [defendant] has the burden of producing a sufficient factual record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>for the appellate court to determine whether error was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Id. </em>at at 416, 44 A.3d 396 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In a similar opinion, <em>Black, </em>426 Md. at 337, 342, 44 A.3d 362, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not err in failing to inform the defendant of a jury note which appeared in the record, but was neither dated, time-stamped, nor mentioned in the transcripts. The Court stated: \u201c[Tjhere is a presumption, under [Maryland] Rule 4-326(d), that written jury communications that are received by the trial court will be dated and time-stamped and that the time of any oral communications will be noted in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 44 A.3d 362. Maryland Rule 4-426(d) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll ... communications between the [trial] court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action. The [courtroom] clerk or the [trial] court shall note on a written communication the date and time it was received from the jury.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Pursuant to <em>Black, </em>426 Md. at 369-70, 44 A.3d 362, where a Maryland Rule mandates that a trial court or courtroom clerk take a certain procedural action\u2014and the record on appeal contains no information that negates the occurrence of that procedural action\u2014there is a rebuttable presumption that the trial court or courtroom clerk took that procedural action. Unless the record offers contrary information, there is a rebuttable presumption that the jury in a criminal case was sworn pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-312(g)(l), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe individuals to be impaneled as sworn jurors ... shall be sworn.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We find persuasive <em>State v. Mayfield, </em>235 S.C. 11, 109 S.E.2d 716, 723-24 (1959), in which the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that the defendant had failed to show that the jury had not been sworn where, as here, the record was devoid of any mention of the swearing of the jury. The Supreme Court of South Carolina stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Absence of affirmative statement in the transcript that the jury was sworn furnishes no factual support for [the defendant]^ contention that it was not. [The defendant\u2019s statement that the jury was not sworn stands alone, and is, in our opinion, insufficient to overcome the contrary presumption. But if indeed the jury was not sworn, that was a fact known to [the defendant] during the trial and which he should then and there have called to the attention of the trial [court]. His contention, made for the first time more than eight years afterwards, comes too late. One may not take his chance of a favorable verdict and, after an unfavorable one, raise an objection that should have been made before the verdict was rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Agreeing with the logic of <em>Hams, Pinero, </em>and <em>Mayfield, </em>and applying the holdings of <em>Nicolas </em>and <em>Black, </em>we hold that the presumption of regularity applies to the issue of whether or not a jury has been sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Having determined that the presumption of regularity applies to the issue of whether or not a jury has been sworn, we conclude that appellant failed to rebut the presumption.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record is devoid of any affirmative indication that the jury was unsworn. Neither the docket entries nor the transcript contain an affirmative statement that the jury was unsworn. The record is devoid of any mention by the attorneys or the courtroom clerk as to the jury not being sworn. According to the instant case\u2019s transcript, the circuit court took a twenty-four-minute recess before proceeding to opening statements. The record leaves open the possibility that the jury was sworn during that twenty-four-minute timeframe\u2014or at some other time not on the record. Appellant points us to no affirmative evidence\u2014and we find none in the record\u2014that the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>unsworn.

To hold otherwise would allow\u2014and even encourage\u2014defendants to refrain from calling readily corrected errors to the trial court\u2019s attention, and to attempt to avail themselves of automatic reversals on appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions for robbery, second-degree assault, and obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card. Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for robbery because the State \u201cfailed to prove that a reasonable person under the same circumstances [as Mellott] would have felt apprehension that [appellant] was about to apply force.\u201d Appellant asserts that Mellott\u2019s testimony merely \u201cestablished that she was dealing with an annoyed, rude, and demanding customer. Nothing she testified to would lead a <em>reasonable </em>person to apprehend force or fear for her life[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original). Appellant maintains that Mellott\u2019s \u201c \u2018fear for her life\u2019 was completely unreasonable[,]\u201d as evinced by Mellott\u2019s failure to press her cash register\u2019s alarm button or alert her coworker, who although she was in the watch repair room directly behind the sales counter, never came to Mellott\u2019s aid or called the police. Appellant contends that Screen \u201cfailed to add anything to prove that a robbery had taken place\u201d because she was not concerned enough to call the police between receiving Mellott\u2019s call and arriving at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for second-degree assault because \u201cno reasonable person would have apprehended an imminent battery under the facts present here.\u201d Appellant argues that, \u201c[fjor the same reason that it was not reasonable for [ ] Mellott to fear the use of force by [appellant], it was also not reasonable for [] Mellott to be frightened for purposes of proving second degree assault of the intent to frighten variety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card because \u201c[t]here was absolutely no evidence that [appellant] violated [C.L.] \u00a7 8-204 [theft of a credit card or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>receipt of a stolen credit card] or [C.L.] \u00a7 8-205 [counterfeiting of a credit card] as required for a conviction under [C.L.] \u00a7 8-206(a) [obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card]. Nor was there any evidence to establish that [appellant] used a credit card that he knew to be counterfeited.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The State responds that the evidence was sufficient to support convictions as to all counts. It contends that there was sufficient evidence of robbery because Mellott\u2019s and Screen\u2019s testimony established that appellant \u201cobtained the rings by intimidation.\u201d The State argues that there was sufficient evidence of second-degree assault because \u201c[t]he testimony regarding [appellant\u2019s words, actions, and demean- or showed that the victim\u2019s fear was reasonable and the jury could infer an intent to frighten on that basis.\u201d The State asserts that appellant \u201cfailed to articulate at trial the grounds that he now asserts on appeal, [and] has failed to preserve his claim of error regarding the sufficiency of [the] evidence for obtaining property by\u201d use of a stolen credit card. Alternatively, the State maintains that there was sufficient evidence of obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card because \u201cthe jury could have inferred that [appellant] used a credit card in violation of [C.L. \u00a7 8-204 (theft of a credit card or receipt of a stolen credit card) ] by receiving the stolen credit card number from his companion and using it to obtain the rings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In <em>Morris v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 1, 30-31, 993 A.2d 716 (2010), this Court explained the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution in order to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We defer to the fact-finder\u2019s decisions on which evidence to accept and which inferences to draw when the evidence supports differing inferences. In other words, we give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether ... [we] would have chosen a different reasonable inference. In our independent review of the evidence, we do not distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence because [a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">(Alterations, emphasis, and omission in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">(3) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">(a) Preservation of the Issue of the Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\"> Maryland Rule 4-324(a) provides in pertinent part: A defendant may move for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts ... at the close of the evidence offered by the State and, in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence.

State, </em>422 Md. 422, 428-30, 30 A.3d 891 (2011), the Court of Appeals explained that robbery in Maryland stems from the common law, and is distinguished from mere theft by the element of force, whether actual or threatened. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Robbery in Maryland is governed by a common law standard____ From [robbery\u2019s] earliest days in Maryland law, fear has been a central component in distinguishing the crime of larceny or theft from robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">The hallmark of robbery, which distinguishes it from theft, is the presence of force or threat of force, the latter of which also is referred to as intimidation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">Where ... it is clear that the victim was neither intimidated [n]or put in fear, there must be evidence of actual violence preceding or accompanying the taking. * * * [T]he mere force that is required to take possession, when there is no resistance, is not enough, <em>i.e., </em>the force must be more than is needed simply to move the property from its original to another position; there must be more force than is required simply to effect the taking and asportation of the property. Thus, it is not robbery to obtain property from the person of another by a mere trick, and without force ... nor is it robbery to suddenly snatch property from another when there is no resistance and no more force, therefore, than is necessary to the mere act of snatching.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"And\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>Id. </em>(some omissions in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u201cThe determination of whether there has been an intimidation should be guided by an objective test focusing on the accused\u2019s actions.... \u2018[B]y intimidation\u2019 means ... in such a way that would put an ordinary, reasonable person in fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432, 30 A.3d 891 (citations omitted). For example, in <em>Spencer, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for robbery where the defendant, who never displayed a weapon, \u201centered an automobile service center and stated to the cashier: \u2018Don\u2019t say nothing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 30 A.3d 891. The Court held that \u201c[tjhere was no evidence that Spencer conducted himself in a manner that could cause apprehension in a reasonable person that the petitioner was about to apply force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">The only thing said by the defendant in this case was the statement by [the defendant] not to say anything. This brief statement, by itself, would not cause an ordinary, reasonable person to have felt apprehension that [the defendant] was about to apply force. A reasonable person in the cashier\u2019s shoes on the day that [the defendant] entered the Jiffy Lube service center, when faced with the statement not to say anything, would not automatically hand over the cash register drawer.

Whenever Mellott moved her hands, appellant became \u201chostile.\u201d Although Mellott was not supposed to charge a credit card number without seeing the customer\u2019s credit card or identification\u2014and Mellott \u201ccontinuously asked [appellant] for his ID telling him [she] could not do it\u201d\u2014appellant \u201ckept saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to do this\u2019 \u201d and told Mellott that she \u201chad to do it.\u201d According to Mellott, appellant\u2019s voice was very \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cvery strong and loud. He was very demanding of [her] to do exactly what he said. Not to leave the area.\u201d Because of appellant\u2019s actions, Mellott was \u201cscared for [her] life\u201d and did not feel that she was free to leave the area. Appellant told Mellott: \u201cYou typed in the wrong number. Give it to me. I\u2019ll do it[,]\u201d when Mellott entered the credit card number incorrectly. Appellant told Screen, \u201c[d]on\u2019t waste the energy, hang up the phone[,]\u201d when the manager, Screen, called the credit card company.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellant\u2019s actions were far beyond those of what he describes on brief as \u201can annoyed, rude and demanding customer.\u201d According to Screen\u2014who had been working at the store since 1999 and had dealt with difficult customers before\u2014 appellant went beyond being a difficult customer. Although a rude customer might insist that a sales associate ring up a transaction, appellant told Mellott \u201cto stand in a certain spot\u201d and to keep her hands above the counter, where appellant could see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Mellott could reasonably have believed that appellant possessed a weapon, which he would use if Mellott did not comply with appellant\u2019s demands. <em>See Coles, </em>374 Md. at 128, 821 A.2d 389 (\u201c[P]ossession of an undisclosed weapon may be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Appellant was accompanied by two other individuals, thus outnumbering Mellott and her nearest co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>worker. Although appellant and his two companions did not display a weapon, Mellott could reasonably have believed that appellant and his two companions had the ability to cause Mellott an immediate battery with their bare hands. Mellott\u2019s belief in such a possibility was reasonable, given appellant\u2019s continual demands of her and his \u201cangry[,]\u201d \u201cstrong[,] and loud\u201d voice. Evidence is sufficient to support a finding of intimidation where a defendant approaches a victim and, using a threatening tone or threatening body language, makes demands of the victim. <em>See Dixon, </em>302 Md. at 464, 488 A.2d 962 (The Court of Appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of intimidation where the defendant, according to victim, had \u201ca cold, hard look\u201d in his eyes.).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under the instant circumstances, the jury could reasonably have found that appellant intimidated Mellott.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We find unpersuasive appellant\u2019s argument that the facts show that Mellott\u2019s and Screen\u2019s apprehension was unreasonable because Mellott did not press the cash register\u2019s alarm button or alert her coworker in the room behind her, and Screen did not call the police between receiving Mellott\u2019s call and arriving at the store. The standard for determining whether intimidation is sufficient to constitute robbery turns on how \u201can ordinary, reasonable person\u201d would react to the defendant\u2019s actions, not how the actual victim reacted to the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>Spencer, </em>422 Md. at 432, 30 A.3d 891 (citation omitted). Because the standard is objective, not subjective, the details concerning Mellott\u2019s reactions to appellant\u2019s demands are not dispositive. Because Screen was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the robbery\u2019s victim, whether she could reasonably have been intimidated is not relevant. Based on all of the above, a rational trier of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts were sufficient to support the conclusion that appellant robbed Mellott.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">(b) Second-Degree Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction for second-degree assault because appellant had \u201can apparent present ability [to cause an immediate battery] from the viewpoint of the threatened victim.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>134 Md.App. at 355-56, 759 A.2d 1164. Appellant demanded that Mellott ring up a transaction even though he lacked a credit card or identification. As discussed above, although appellant did not display a weapon, Mellott could reasonably have inferred that appellant possessed an unseen weapon, or that appellant and his two companions had the ability to cause Mellott an immediate battery with their bare hands. Evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree assault where a defendant enters a victim\u2019s workplace and demands threateningly that the victim take a certain action within the scope of the victim\u2019s employment. <em>See Hill, id. </em>at 356, 759 A.2d 1164 (This Court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree assault where the defendant demanded that the victim, a mathematics instructor, give the defendant an A in a course or the defendant \u201cwould kill him, and then [the defendant] raised his jacket to display a gun in a holster. [The defendant] then detailed the manner in which he would dispose of [the victim]\u2019s body.\u201d). Based on all of the above, a rational trier of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts were sufficient to support the conclusion that appellant assaulted Mellott in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">(c) Obtaining Property by Use of a Stolen Credit Card</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Preliminarily, we conclude that the issue of sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction for obtaining proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ty by use of a stolen credit card is not preserved for appellate review. During the motion for judgment of acquittal, Maryland Rule 4-324(a) required appellant to \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why\u201d the evidence was insufficient as to obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card. Appellant\u2019s counsel, however, simply stated: Counts \u201c6, 7, 8, and 9 [we] also submit with the argument that we don\u2019t believe there has been legally sufficient evidence as far as all the elements that are required under the obtaining property by theft or misrepresentation[.]\u201d In the motion for judgment of acquittal, appellant\u2019s counsel: \u201cmerely assert[ed] that the evidence [was] insufficient to support a conviction, without specifying the deficiency, [did] not comply with [Maryland] Rule [4-324(a),] and thus [did] not preserve the issue of sufficiency for appellate review.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>68 Md.App. at 611, 515 A.2d 225 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Alternatively, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card. Although Mellott \u201ccontinuously asked [appellant] for his ID\u201d and told appellant that she could not charge a credit card number without seeing identification and an actual credit card, appellant never produced identification or an actual or purported credit card. Instead, appellant\u2019s male companion left the jewelry store, spoke on a cell phone, and returned with a piece of paper with a credit card number and an expiration date written on it, which appellant then forced Mellott to use for the transaction. In either that month or the next\u2014in June or July 2008\u2014one of Lamoy\u2019s credit cards was declined, and her credit card company told her that the credit card had been used to make large purchases at a jewelry store. Lamoy testified that she had never given anyone permission to use her credit card number. In July 2008, Maketa\u2014King\u2019s Jewelry Store\u2019s point of sale coordinator\u2014was contacted by Heartland Payment Systems, King\u2019s Jewelry Store\u2019s credit card processor. Heartland Payment Systems informed Maketa that it believed that the credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>cardholder had not authorized the two charges at King\u2019s Jewelry Store, and asked Maketa\u2019s office to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">All of the evidence makes clear the following sequence of events, which the jury could reasonably have inferred.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (1) An unknown person, without Lamoy\u2019s knowledge, somehow learned Lamoy\u2019s credit card number and expiration date. (2) On June 8, 2008, appellant and his two companions entered King\u2019s Jewelry Store. (3) Appellant\u2019s male companion briefly exited the jewelry store, spoke on his cell phone with an unknown person who knew Lamoy\u2019s credit card number and expiration date, wrote down this information on a piece of paper, re-entered the jewelry store, and gave the paper to appellant. (4) Appellant, fully aware that he lacked the credit cardholder\u2019s authorization, forced Mellott to enter the credit card number and expiration date and refused to produce identification or an actual or purported credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Although we find no case in which a Maryland appellate court has ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence as to obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card, we hold that evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card where the evidence shows that a defendant obtained goods or services by using, without the credit cardholder\u2019s permission, a credit card number that did not belong to the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Based on all of the above, a rational trier of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts were sufficient to support the conclusion that appellant obtained property by use of a stolen credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">A.

Appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he rings that were stolen were part of a bridal set and were not sold separately. Thus, there was a single taking.\u201d Appellant maintains that the two counts of unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number \u201calso arose out of a single use of a credit card number.\u201d Appellant contends that, \u201c[j]ust because the salesperson had to manually enter the same credit card number two times in order for [appellant] to obtain the bridal set, does not amount to two \u2018disclosures\u2019 under\u201d C.L. \u00a7 8-214.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The State responds that appellant\u2019s \u201csentences are not illegal and [appellant] failed to raise any contention regarding [multiplicity<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] below[; thus], this claim is not properly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>this Court.\u201d Alternatively, the State contends that appellant was properly convicted of two counts of unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number because \u201ctwo uses of the credit card [number] were necessary in order for the payment for the rings to be completed.\u201d The State concedes that, if appellant\u2019s argument regarding multiplicity is preserved for appellate review, appellant should have incurred only one conviction and sentence each for theft and obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">(a) Preservation of the Issue of Multiplicity</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u201cMultiplicity is the charging of the same offense in more than one count.\u201d <em>Brown v.

Mellott\u2019s testimony indicates the following sequence of events. (1) Appellant merely \u201cpointed\u201d at the first ring, without taking it. (2) Appellant forced Mellott to enter Lamoy\u2019s credit card number, but the $2,000 charge did not succeed because of the credit card\u2019s limit. (3) Appellant \u201cchose\u201d the second ring. (4) The two charges of $1,000 each succeeded. (5) Appellant, for the first time, took both rings at once and left the jewelry store. Although appellant took two rings, \u201cthe separate takings were part of a single scheme or continuing course of conduct[,]\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>402 Md. at 756, 939 A.2d 149, because appellant took both rings during the same visit to the same jewelry store. Pursuant to the \u201csingle larceny\u201d doctrine, appellant should have incurred one conviction for theft, and one conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card. For all the reasons discussed above, we reverse the second conviction for theft (\u201cCount Five\u201d) and the second conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card (\u201cCount Seven\u201d). We vacate the sentence for the second conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card (\u201cCount Seven\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">(b)(ii) Convictions for Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of a Credit Card Number</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">As to the convictions for unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number, we are satisfied that the circuit court did not err in entering two judgments of conviction. In the instant situation, \u201ctwo portions of a single statute proscribe certain conduct, and the question is whether the defen-</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>dant can be punished twice because his conduct violates both proscriptions.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>311 Md. at 431, 535 A.2d 485 (citation omitted). C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number and provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person may not use or disclose any credit card number or other payment device number or holder\u2019s signature[.]\u201d Thus, two portions of C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) proscribe appellant\u2019s conduct: one portion bars disclosing another\u2019s credit card number, while the other portion bars using another\u2019s credit card number. Appellant took two actions, each of which was distinct-and thus independently punishable. (1) Appellant disclosed Lamoy\u2019s credit card number to Mellott when appellant showed Mellott the piece of paper with Lamoy\u2019s credit card number written on it. (2) Appellant used Lamoy\u2019s credit card number when appellant forced Mellott to enter Lamoy\u2019s credit card number. Although our reasoning differs from the State\u2019s when it charged appellant with two counts of violating C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>\u2014as well as the State\u2019s reasoning on appeal<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>that has no bearing on our conclusion that appellant was properly convicted of two violations of C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a). For all the reasons discussed above, we affirm the convictions for unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">B. Merger</p>\n<p id=\"Ayg\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in not merging, for sentencing purposes, the convictions for unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number with the conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card because unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number \u201cincludes the elements of\u2019 obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The State responds that appellant \u201cfailed to raise any contention regarding the merger of [convictions for sentencing purposes] below[; thus], this claim is not properly before this Court.\u201d Alternatively, the State contends that the circuit court properly refrained from merging, for sentencing purposes, the conviction for unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number with the conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card. The State argues that \u201cthe conduct of disclosing a credit card number and using a credit card number are not the same, as is evident from the statute which may be violated by either act of using the credit card number or disclosing the credit card number.\u201d We agree with the State on this point. <em>See supra </em>footnote 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">(a) \u201cRequired Evidence Test\u201d for Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In <em>Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 693-95, 827 A.2d 68 (2003), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in, Rich v. State, </em>205 Md.App. 227, 44 A.3d 1063 (2012), the Court of Appeals explained the \u201crequired evidence test\u201d for merger. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">Generally, this Court has relied upon the <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)] \u201crequired evidence test\u201d in resolving double jeopardy challenges involving two offenses stemming from the same act or acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">We outlined the application of the required evidence test in <em>Williams [v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 593 A.2d 671 (1991) ] as follow[s]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">The required evidence test focuses upon the elements of each offense; if all of the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>offense contains a distinct element or distinct elements, the former merges into the latter. The test was explained in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257[,] 267 [353 A.2d 240 (1976)] as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">The required evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other does not, the offenses are not the same for double jeopardy and merger purposes, even though arising from the same conduct or episode. But, where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other, the offenses are deemed to be the same for double jeopardy and merger purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">This does not end the inquiry, however, because the focus is upon the intent of the Legislature. [T]he <em>Blockburger </em>rule does not provide the final answer in cases involving multiple punishment because, when specifically authorized by the legislature, cumulative sentences for the same offense may under some circumstances be imposed after a single trial[ ]. In such instances, the appropriate measure of the allowable unit of prosecution would be what the legislature intended. Indeed, our primary task in a unit of prosecution analysis is to find and give effect to the legislative intent underlying the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\"><em>Purnell, </em>375 Md. at 693-95, 827 A.2d 68 (some citations, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">(b) Rule of Lenity and Principle of Fundamental Fairness</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In <em>Moore v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 655, 686, 18 A.3d 981 (2011), this Court stated: \u201cIf the principles of double jeopardy are not implicated because the offenses at issue do not merge under the required evidence test, merger may still be required under the rule of lenity or the principle of fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>fairness.\u201d (Citation omitted). As to the rule of lenity, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Even though two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, there are nevertheless times when the offenses will not be punished separately. Two crimes created by legislative enactment may not be punished separately if the legislature intended the offenses to be punished by one sentence. It is when we are uncertain whether the legislature intended one or more than one sentence that we make use of an aid to statutory interpretation known as the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d Under that rule, if we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we, in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP_\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As to the principle of fundamental fairness, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaz\">Considerations of fairness and reasonableness reinforce our conclusion [to merge].... We have ... looked to whether the type of act has historically resulted in multiple punishment. The fairness of multiple punishments in a particular situation is obviously important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Implicit in this reasoning is the idea that when a single act is sufficient to result in convictions for both offenses, but the victim suffered only a single harm as a result of that act, then as a matter of fundamental fairness there should be only one punishment because in a real-world sense there was only one crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 686-87, 18 A.3d 981 (alteration and omissions in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In <em>Jackson v.

Both convictions were predicated on the taking of the same property from the same victim in a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>incident.

State, </em>163 Md.App. 305, 321, 878 A.2d 678 (2005), this Court held that the trial court erred in failing to merge, for sentencing purposes, a conviction for theft with a conviction for credit card theft (C.L. \u00a7 8-204). This Court stated: \u201c[L]enity in determining the ambit of ambiguous criminal statutes is particularly appropriate where legislative history of a statute or the relationship between two statutory provisions is not clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 878 A.2d 678. As to the rule of lenity, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">There is nothing in the legislative file that indicates that the General Assembly intended for dual convictions. There is no suggestion in either of the statutory provisions or legislative history or prior court opinions, that one of the purposes in establishing the offense of credit card theft was to compound the punishment for theft. Rather, it would appear reasonable that the credit card theft offenses were enacted to ensure that a credit card thief, who has possession of the physical credit card but has not used it for some reason or another, can still be prosecuted for theft, even though the physical card itself has very little intrinsic value. The rule of lenity instructs that a court not interpret a ... criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what [the legislature] intended. Moreover, the General Assembly typically makes clear when it intends to allow dual convictions or consecutive sentences, and no such direction is present here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 321, 878 A.2d 678 (emphasis added) (alteration and omission in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(3) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">(a) This Court\u2019s Authority to Review an Allegedly Illegal Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Returning to the instant case, we initially note that an appellate court \u201chas the authority to review an allegedly illegal sentence regardless of whether an objection is made at trial[.]\u201d <em>Brown, </em>311 Md. at 431 n. 4, 535 A.2d 485. <em>See also Wilkins v.

The element of disclosure is present in C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) (unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number), but absent from C.L. \u00a7 8-206(a)(l) (obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card).

Appellant\u2019s convictions were not predicated on a single harm or taking of property from the same victim. Rather, appellant caused two distinct harms to two distinct victims\u2014Lamoy and King\u2019s Jewelry Store. By obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card, appellant harmed King\u2019s Jewelry Store by depriving it of two rings, for which King\u2019s Jewelry Store received no payment. By committing unauthorized use and disclosure of a credit card number, appellant harmed Lamoy, the credit cardholder, by invading the sanctity of Lamoy\u2019s credit card number and making an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>unauthorized charge using Lamoy\u2019s credit card number. In Counts Six, Eight, and Nine, the Information identifies Lamoy as the victim. At sentencing, the circuit court ordered appellant to pay restitution to King\u2019s Jewelry Store. Lamoy and King\u2019s Jewelry Store suffered a distinct and separate harm\u2014 Lamoy had her credit card number used or disclosed without her authorization, leading to the declination of her credit card shortly after the use or disclosure, and King\u2019s Jewelry Store was deprived of both money and its merchandise. The rule of lenity and the principle of fundamental fairness apply where a defendant\u2019s convictions are \u201cpredicated on the taking of the same property from the same victim in a single incident.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>141 Md.App. at 198, 784 A.2d 670 (emphasis added); <em>see also Pineta v.

Nonetheless, we observe that the issue of an unsworn jury, although structural error, would be subject to plain error review where the issue is unpreserved. <em>See Savoy v. State, </em>420 Md. 232, 241-42, 243 n. 4, 22 A.3d 845 (2011) (The Court of Appeals applied the Maryland Rule 8-131(a) requirement of preservation to a structural error and stated: \"[U]n-preserved structural errors are not automatically reversible, but, instead, are subject to plain error review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Although in <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 129, 956 A.2d 204, the Court of Appeals stated that the \"principle[ ] of waiver [is] inapplicable when a jury in a criminal case has never been sworn[,]\u201d this statement was <em>dicta </em>because the issue of the unsworn jury had been preserved for appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 956 A.2d 204 (\"[T]here would be no waiver in the present case[ because d]efense counsel twice called the trial [court]'s attention to the failure to swear the jury.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 122, 956 A.2d 204 (\"We shall hold ... that there was no waiver of [the defendant's objection to the unsworn juryf.]\u201d (Emphasis added)).

In any event, the holding of Savoy\u2014which postdates <em>Harris </em>by three years\u2014supersedes <em>Harris. </em>Where the issue of whether the juiy has been sworn is not preserved\u2014even if the presumption of regularity is overcome\u2014rather than automatically reversing, we would determine whether to exercise plain error review. <em>Savoy, </em>420 Md. at 243 n. 4, 22 A.3d 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The instant case's circumstances would fail plain error review\u2019s fourth prong, as set forth in <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 578, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010), because an unsworn jury may be readily corrected. As evidenced by <em>Alston, </em>414 Md. at 96, 994 A.2d 896, an unsworn jury may be readily corrected by a belated administration of the oath\u2014and we should \"not exercise our right to take cognizance of and correct any plain error material to the rights of [appellant], of our own motion, if the alleged error was one that might have been readily corrected if it had been called to the [circuit court]\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Morris v.

Nothing in this opinion encroaches upon the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 131, 956 A.2d 204, that \"the harmless error principle is inapplicable when a jury in a criminal case is never sworn.\u201d <em>See also Boulden, </em>414 Md. at 307, 995 A.2d 268 (The Court of Appeals held that structural error cannot be harmless.). Harmless error does not apply where the issue of an unsworn jury is preserved and the presumption of regularity is <em>rebutted\u2014i.e. </em>it is established that the jury was unsworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 131, 956 A.2d 204, where a defendant is acquitted by an unsworn jury, the \"defendant runs the risk that the State may attempt to prosecute a second time for the same offense[,]\u201d because jeopardy did not attach in the absence of the jury being sworn. The Court identified <em>Spencer v.

In the instant case, we need not reach the issue of whether double jeopardy bars retrial after an acquittal in a trial with an unsworn jury. We would, however, discourage the occurrence of the circumstance and, as the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Harris, </em>406 Md. at 131, 956 A.2d 204, we cannot guarantee that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause would not bar a second prosecution after an unsworn jury acquitted a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">.

Because appellant challenges the convictions, not the charging documents, we find unpersuasive the State's reliance of <em>Ford v.

Presumably, the State charged appellant with two counts of violating C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) because appellant took two rings and forced Mellott to charge Lamoy's credit card number twice. In contrast, we view the two credit card charges as a single \"use\u201d of Lamoy's credit card number\u2014but we view separately appellant\u2019s act of \"disclosing\u201d Lamoy\u2019s credit card number to Mellott by showing her the piece of paper with Lamoy\u2019s credit card number written on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Two hypothetical situations prove that appellant could have violated one or the other of C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a)\u2019s \"use\u201d or \"disclosure\u201d portions. (1) Appellant could have disclosed Lamoy's credit card number, without using it, by showing the piece of paper to Mellott\u2014or anyone else, for that matter\u2014and then leaving, without charging anything to Lamoy's credit card number. (2) Appellant could have used Lamoy\u2019s credit card number, without disclosing it, by forcing Mellott to set up the cash register so that it was ready for the credit card number\u2019s input, forcing Mellott to step away and look away, and then typing Lamoy\u2019s credit card number himself\u2014ensuring that Mellott would not see Lamoy\u2019s credit card number.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Arguably, by using Lamoy\u2019s credit card number, appellant \"disclosed\u201d it to Heartland Payment Systems, King's Jewelry Store's credit card processor. If this were the case\u2014and thus it would be impossible to \"use\u201d a credit card number without \"disclosing\" it\u2014then the Maryland General Assembly would have had no reason for writing C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) to prohibit both \"use\" and \"disclosure.\u201d Instead, C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) could have merely prohibited \"disclosure\u201d because, by defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tion, using a credit card number would disclose it.

Although we conclude that the circuit court properly entered two judgments of conviction for unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number, we find unpersuasive the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Carter v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 224, 370 A.2d 183, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 728 (1977). In <em>Carter, id. </em>at 227-28, 370 A.2d 183, this Court held that the trial court properly entered three judgments of conviction pursuant to the statute that has since been re-codified as C.L. \u00a7 8-204(b) (receiving a credit card known to have been lost or misdelivered). Five credit cards, each with the same account number that belonged to Texaco, were accidentally delivered to the defendant, who was neither affiliated with Texaco nor the credit cards' intended recipient. <em>Carter, </em>35 Md. App. at 225, 370 A.2d 183. The defendant kept some of the credit cards for future use and gave some to his employees. <em>Id. </em>Under <em>Carter, </em>a defendant may receive multiple convictions for misusing multiple credit cards in multiple ways. <em>Carter </em>is not dispositive where, as here, a defendant misuses only one credit card number in one transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">. On brief, appellant refers to the conviction pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) as \"the disclosure conviction\u201d and the conviction pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-206(a) as \"the use conviction.\u201d This distinction, however, applies C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a)'s language\u2014\u201c[ujnauthorized use or disclosure\u201d\u2014to both convictions. For clarity, we continue to refer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>conviction pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) as \u201cunauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number\u201d and the conviction pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-206(a) as \"obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">. We use the singular word \"conviction\u201d because we reverse the second conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card (\"Count Seven\u201d). <em>See supra </em>Part III A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. It is true that, pursuant to our conclusion <em>supra </em>in Part III A regarding multiplicity, appellant violated C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) once by dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>closing Lamoy\u2019s credit card number, and once <em>more </em>by using Lamoy's credit card number. Arguably, because one of the convictions pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) was for use, one of those convictions must, for sentencing purposes, merge with the one remaining conviction for obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 8-206(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Such an argument fails, however, because only the doctrine of multiplicity turns on a particular case\u2019s facts. In contrast, the doctrine of merger turns only on the elements contained in the two statutes in question\u2014regardless of the particular case's facts. As a result, our analysis concerns only the language of C.L. \u00a7 8-214(a) (unauthorized use or disclosure of a credit card number) and C.L. \u00a7 8-206(a)(l) (obtaining property by use of a stolen credit card), rather than what appellant did or did not do. Examining these two statutes, we conclude that the element of disclosure and the element of ''the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services, or anything of value\u201d distinguish them, and prevent merger pursuant to the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
