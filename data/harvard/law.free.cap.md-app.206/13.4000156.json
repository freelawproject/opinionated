On September 10, 2010, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from the desk he used while employed as an assistant to the special education teachers at an elementary school. Following a two day bench trial on September 21 and 22, 2010, the circuit court convicted appellant of both charges and imposed a sentence of thirteen years, with all but seven years suspended and five years of supervised probation. Appellant timely appealed, presenting the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">1. Was the evidence sufficient to convict Appellant of sexual abuse of a minor where the State showed only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>he exchanged inappropriate letters of a non-sexual nature with the alleged victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">2. Did the court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of his desk at his place of employment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">I. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">At the hearing concerning appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, Mr. M.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the principal of the elementary school where appellant was employed, testified that appellant served as a \u201cparaeducator,\u201d which is an assistant to the special education teachers, during the 2009-2010 school year. He stated that on March 17, 2010, a teacher gave him letters written by appellant that were found in the desk of either C.B. or her twin sister, third-grade students who shared a homeroom. Mr. M. testified that he called appellant that evening and left a voicemail message. When appellant returned Mr. M.\u2019s call the following morning, Mr. M. advised that there was an investigation involving inappropriate communications between appellant and a student and that appellant should remain away from the school until further notice. Mr. M. also contacted other administrators, the head of his school\u2019s security, and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">He stated that Detective First Class Erika Heavner and another officer arrived at the school on March 18, 2010. The officers asked Mr. M. about appellant and requested that Mr. M. provide consent to search the desk used by appellant. Mr. M. executed a consent form and led the officers to the desk. The officers opened the drawers and examined the contents as Mr. M. stood nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>At the hearing, Mr. M. described appellant\u2019s desk, which was owned by the school system, as being located in the \u201cfirst grade pod,\u201d an area surrounded by three first grade classrooms, a technology classroom, and an alternative education classroom. This common area also contained two other desks used by two other paraeducators. According to Mr. M., appellant did not share his desk with anyone and, as a returning faculty member, could retain the same desk from year to year. Appellant\u2019s desk could have been locked, but appellant had not requested a key to lock the desk. Mr. M. also indicated that lockers were available for paraeducators to store their personal belongings, but, to his knowledge, appellant had not requested one. Because appellant\u2019s desk was located in a common area between classrooms, Mr. M. observed that there was a good deal of student traffic passing by appellant\u2019s desk between classrooms and that small groups and after-school programs used the common area. He went on to state that the groups using the common area would not need to access appellant\u2019s desk unless \u201cto borrow a pencil or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Lastly, Mr. M. testified that appellant\u2019s employment was terminated soon after March 18, 2010. Mr. M. collected some of appellant\u2019s belongings from the desk, storing them in a bin in his office bathroom. Appellant never returned to the school to collect these items, but Mr. M. was uncertain whether appellant was allowed to enter the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Next, Detective Heavner, who was assigned to the Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Section of the Criminal Investigations Division, Family Crimes Unit of the Howard County Police Department, testified regarding her investigation on March 18, 2010. She indicated that she received Mr. M.\u2019s permission to search the desk. Detective Heavner described the desk as having a vertical column of three drawers labeled \u201cseminars, research data,\u201d \u201cstudent data,\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d and a flat drawer in the center of the desk in front of the chair labeled \u201cutensils.\u201d In the drawers, she found greeting cards and assignments from various students, a printed excerpt of a book entitled \u201cLaughter: A Scientific Investigation,\u201d a blank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cParaeducator/Paraprofessional Voluntary Transfer Request Form,\u201d a drawing of a bear, and a small cardboard box. The box contained a number of folded pieces of paper. She stated that the first piece of paper was addressed to \u201cRaven K,\u201d a nickname for appellant, from \u201cSteeler girl,\u201d a nickname for C.B. Detective Heavner stated that once she saw the first paper on top, she placed all the papers back into the box and seized the box. On March 26, 2010, eight days later, Detective Heavner applied for and executed a search warrant for the box and its contents. The box contained a multitude of notes and cards that appeared to be from C.B. to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Following the receipt of testimony and argument, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the desk. The circuit court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">I make my decisions based on the evidence that\u2019s in front of me, this desk was, in fact, assigned to Mr. Walker, that\u2019s without dispute. This desk was capable\u2014he was invited by the school to lock it if he wished, that\u2019s indisputable. This desk, and I\u2019m looking at State\u2019s [Exhibit] J, the photograph of the front of the desk, has a key lock on the drawer underneath where the seat\u2014or right above the seat, the mid-drawer, it has a key lock. There\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s not capable of locking. This desk is in an open area where people have ample access to it. Given the nature of the use of the area it\u2019s a type of place where you could reasonably expect people to sit down and use the surface when Mr. Walker wasn\u2019t there. Because of the nature of the uses that the school system put it to there weren\u2019t specific work sites, that I could see in photograph G, that would accommodate these interventions,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] so it\u2019s reasonable to think that this desk or any other desk could be used by other persons during these interventions or other uses of this open space and general space. This desk was not locked, it\u2019s clear to me it was not locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>And what\u2019s of importance to me is the labels on the drawers. Just because a person is permitted exclusive use doesn\u2019t mean the person has to agree to permissive use. And look to the facts individually in each case to determine whether or not there\u2019s been demonstrated a subjective expectation that his or her property or possessions will not be searched and whether or not that is an objectively reasonable expectation of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">All I know is that this was assigned to Mr. Walker, that it could have been locked but it was not, that\u2019s in an open use area. And these labels are very important to me, the labels are as follows; on the general drawer it\u2019s labeled utensil and desk items, then are three other drawers, they\u2019re a tower\u2014they\u2019re stacked one on top of each other type drawers on the right side of the desk, the top drawer is labeled seminars and research data, the middle drawer is labeled student data, the middle drawer[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] is labeled materials, learning. Now, if this was Mr. Walker\u2019s personal space that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in then he certainly would not have any need to label the drawers, because he would know what was in the drawers. But, more importantly, the labels on the drawers are for items that cry out for collegial use, for use by other adults involved in the education of the children. There\u2019s no reason to label these things unless the teacher, perhaps, he\u2019s assisting needs to know how to get to student data based on one of the students in Mr. Walker\u2019s absence. There\u2019s no need to put utensils on a drawer except to direct anybody who needs a fork or something where to look. These labels say to anybody who walks by, these drawers contain items that are generally used in the business of bettering our children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">And I think that under the circumstances it has not been demonstrated that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. So, therefore the police action conduct in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>is not impermissible and I\u2019ll deny the motion for that reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the warrantless search of the desk. According to appellant, the court\u2019s findings that (1) the desk was located in a common area rather than a private office; (2) the desk was not locked when the police searched it; and (3) the desk drawers had general, non-personal labels were insufficient to support a finding of no reasonable expectation of privacy. The State counters that the circuit court correctly found that appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the desk because its location suggested that other people would use it, it was not locked, and the labels on the drawers suggested it was for \u201ccollegial use.\u201d Additionally, the State avers that even if appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the desk, the principal\u2019s consent rendered the search valid either under reasonableness or through apparent authority to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion.\u201d <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 531-32, 993 A.2d 626 (2010) (citing <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 362, 987 A.2d 72 (2010); <em>Crosby v.

State, </em>379 Md. 522, 533, 842 A.2d 773 (2004)). We will defer to a court\u2019s fact-finding unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 531, 993 A.2d 626; <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 362, 987 A.2d 72; <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 504-05, 970 A.2d 894. Still, \u201cwe review the ultimate question of constitutionality <em>de novo </em>and must \u2018make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 532, 993 A.2d 626 (quoting <em>Bailey, </em>412 Md. at 362, 987 A.2d 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.... \u201d <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 534, 993 A.2d 626. A defendant who alleges that his or her Fourth Amendment rights have been violated \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating his or her legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or items seized.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 534, <em>993 </em>A.2d 626 (citing <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979)). The challenger must establish (1) a subjective expectation that his or her property will not be searched and (2) that the expectation is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 545, 842 A.2d 773; <em>accord Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998). \u201cA defendant demonstrates a subjective expectation of privacy by showing that he or she sought \u2018to preserve something as private.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. 391, 404, 975 A.2d 862 (2009) (quoting <em>Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577). Furthermore, \u201c[t]o establish that the subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable, a defendant must demonstrate that the law is prepared to recognize the expectation as \u2018legitimate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 148, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (noting that an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy is \u201cmore than a subjective expectation of not being discovered\u201d)). Finally, \u201cwhether a[] [public sector] employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, </em>480 U.S. 709, 718, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized that an employee may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 716, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (citing <em>Mancusi v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>DeForte, </em>392 U.S. 364, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1968)). \u201cAs with the expectation of privacy in one\u2019s home, such an expectation in one\u2019s place of work is \u2018based upon societal expectations that have deep roots in the history of the [Fourth] Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 178 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Appellant directs our attention to <em>Mancusi v. DeForte, </em>392 U.S. 364, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1968), and <em>O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, </em>480 U.S. 709, 107 S.Ct. 1492, 94 L.Ed.2d 714 (1987). In Mancusi,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 392 U.S. at 368, 88 S.Ct. 2120 state officials, without the benefit of a warrant, seized documents from DeForte\u2019s desk, which was located in \u201cone large room, which DeForte shared with several other union officials.\u201d The Court held that DeForte had standing to challenge the admission of the documents at trial based on his Fourth Amendment rights for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">Since the Court in <em>Jones v. United States,[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960) ], explicitly did away with the requirement that to establish standing one must show legal possession or ownership of the searched premises, <em>see </em>362 U.S. at 265-267 [80 S.Ct. 725], it seems clear that if DeForte had occupied a \u201cprivate\u201d office in the union headquarters, and union records had been seized from a desk or a filing cabinet in that office, he would have had standing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Cf. Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 </em>U.S. 344 [51 S.Ct. 153, 75 L.Ed. 374 (1931)]; <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385 [40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920)]. In such a \u201cprivate\u201d office, DeForte would have been entitled to expect that he would not be disturbed except by personal or business invitees, and that records would not be taken except with his permission or that of his union superiors. It seems to us that the situation was not fundamentally changed because DeForte shared an office with other union officers. DeForte still could reasonably have expected that only those persons and their personal or business guests would enter the office, and that records would not be touched except with their permission or that of union higher-ups. This expectation was inevitably defeated by the entrance of state officials, their conduct of a general search, and their removal of records which were in DeForte\u2019s custody. It is, of course, irrelevant that the Union or some of its officials might validly have consented to a search of the area where the records were kept, regardless of DeForte\u2019s wishes, for it is not claimed that any such consent was given, either expressly or by implication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An\"><em>Mancusi, </em>392 U.S. at 369-70, 88 S.Ct. 2120. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that a union employee who shared an office with other union employees had a privacy interest in the office sufficient to challenge successfully the warrantless search of the office. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 88 S.Ct. 2120. Justice White dissented from the majority opinion in <em>Mancusi </em>and stated, \u201c[although the Fourth Amendment perhaps protects the individual\u2019s private desk in a union office shared with other officers or employees, I dissent from the Court\u2019s extension of the protected area to the office door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 88 S.Ct. 2120.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In <em>O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>480 U.S. at 711, 107 S.Ct. 1492 a physician filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against officials at the state hospital where he worked, alleging that their search of his office violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Based on <em>Mancusi, supra, </em>392 U.S. 364, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154, and <em>Oliver, supra, </em>466 U.S. 170, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214, the Court \u201crejected] the contention ... that public employees can never have a reasonable expectation in their place of work[,]\u201d holding that the \u201coperational realities of the workplace, however, may make <em>some </em>employee\u2019s expectations of privacy unreasonable when an intrusion is by a supervisor rather than a law enforcement official.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>480 U.S. at 717, 107 S.Ct. 1492. Furthermore, \u201c[pjublic employees\u2019 expectations of privacy in their offices, desks, and file cabinets, like similar expectations of employees in the private sector, may be reduced by virtue of actual office practices and procedures, or by legitimate regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The physician did not share his desk or file cabinets with any other employees, had occupied the separate office for seventeen years and kept personal materials in his office, including personal correspondence, medical files, correspondence from patients unconnected to the hospital, personal financial records, teaching materials, and personal gifts. <em>Id. </em>at 718, 107 S.Ct. 1492. The Court also noted that there was no evidence that the hospital had any regulations or policies discouraging doctors from storing personal papers and effects in their desks or file cabinets, though \u201cthe absence of such a policy does not create an expectation of privacy where it would not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 107 S.Ct. 1492. Accordingly, the Court held that there was undisputed evidence that the doctor had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his desk and file cabinets. <em>Id. </em>at 718, 107 S.Ct. 1492. Nevertheless, because the search at issue was conducted by a public employer rather than law enforcement, the Court applied a special needs reasonableness analysis, balancing the invasion of the employee\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectations of privacy against the government\u2019s need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719-20, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (citing <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 703, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983); <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 536-37, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Applying precedent to the case at bar yields the conclusion that appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the desk. We recognize that appellant was assigned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>desk and that he had used the same desk in prior school years. Yet, the desk was owned by the school system and was located in a large, open, well-traversed room. This room was referred to as the \u201cfirst grade pod,\u201d connecting several classrooms, and contained desks for two other paraeducators. Because it was so centrally located, students and faculty routinely passed the desk. Small instructional groups and after-school programs also held meetings and conducted other activities in the large room, which was only secured at night when the custodians locked the doors leading to the outer hallways.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Appellant could have taken steps to safeguard what he kept in the desk, but did not. The principal of appellant\u2019s school indicated that although other people at the school likely would not have reason to open the drawers of the desk, he stated that someone might look in the desk \u201cto borrow a pencil or something like that.\u201d Furthermore, at the time of the search, the drawers read \u201cseminars, research data,\u201d \u201cstudent data,\u201d and \u201clearning.\u201d Regardless of who originally placed them on the drawers, the labels suggested that the drawers contained school-related materials accessible to a wide range of persons, rather than appellant\u2019s personal, private items. <em>Cf. O\u2019Connor, </em>480 U.S. at 718, 107 S.Ct. 1492 (employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in desk and file cabinet in own office not shared with anyone else in which he stored personal documents); <em>Gillard v. Schmidt, </em>579 F.2d 825, 828 (1978) (guidance counselor who was responsible for maintaining confidential student records and whose desk was in an office secured by a locked door had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his desk). Appellant could have used a private locker provided to him by the school, but he did not. Appellant had the option of locking the desk, but he did not. The aforementioned facts, taken together, indicate that appellant did not have a subjective expectation of privacy, and even if he did, such an expectation was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances presented. Accordingly, we discern no error in the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>II.

The journal was admitted into evidence, and Ms. P. stated that she had become concerned earlier in the school year when she read a story C.B. wrote detailing a camping trip with appellant. She brought the issue to the attention of the school psychologist because C.B. imagined going camping with an adult. The psychologist, however, found no issues with the journal entry because C.B. did not describe sharing a sleeping bag with an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Both teachers, Ms. C. and Ms. P., described appellant as \u201cfriendly\u201d and someone with whom students \u201cwere always willing to work.\u201d He would give students \u201chigh fives\u201d in the hallways and acted more like a friend than a teacher. Ms. C. stated that several students, including C.B., would hug appellant when he entered the classroom, with C.B. usually initiating the hugs. Ms. C. stated that she also hugged students if the student initiated the hug, but that she would only hold a student\u2019s hand for behavioral purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Moreover, Ms. P. testified that she had chastised appellant for giving a student a chocolate bar, which was unfair to other students and contrary to the county school policy, and that appellant was understanding and indicated that he had not realized it was improper. Ms. P. also articulated that appellant paid more attention to C.B., her sister, and another female student. She witnessed appellant discuss football with C.B. and her sister. She also saw appellant hug C.B., who appeared to have a crush on appellant, but she did not see appellant and C.B. holding hands. Ms. P. stated that she occasionally hugged students when they initiated, but that she did not hold students\u2019 hands, even for disciplinary purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Mr. M. testified and reiterated much of his testimony from the suppression hearing. He elaborated that during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>course of appellant\u2019s employment at the school, he had conversations with appellant, especially during appellant\u2019s first year of employment, regarding appellant\u2019s \u201coverly friendly approach.\u201d Specifically, Mr. M. stated that he counseled appellant about hugging students, to minimize the length of a hug, to \u201chug on the side,\u201d and to extend a hand for a handshake instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Next, Detective Heavner testified, restating much of her testimony from the suppression hearing. She stated that on March 18, 2010, before going to the school, she responded to a telephone call from C.B.\u2019s mother, advising that she had recovered papers from C.B.\u2019s backpack. Detective Heavner retrieved the papers, which the State introduced as evidence. The papers included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u2022 A heart-shaped piece of paper on which appellant wrote a letter to C.B., stating that he \u201cmissed [her] so much,\u201d that he \u201chate[s] the weekends\u201d because he did not get to see her, expressed sadness that she lost a game, told her that she was \u201cstill a winner to [him],\u201d said he \u201cjust want[s] to hold, hug, and be with [her],\u201d and wished her well on the Maryland School Assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u2022 A letter from appellant to C.B., wishing her a \u201cgreat weekend\u201d and stating. \u201c[h]ere is something sweet for the sweetest girl I now.

The State played the interview for the circuit court. Arriving wearing a Ravens jacket, appellant admitted during the interview that he gave C.B. letters and drawings beginning around Christmas of 2009. He maintained, however, that there was nothing in the letters \u201cabout touching [him] inappropriately or anything like that\u201d and that he never attempted to contact C.B. outside of school. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">I care for her greatly.... I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody\u2019s kids.... And, I, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m about, and I\u2019m not about ... child grooming.... [M]y intent is not to groom somebody\u2019s child with the purpose of committing any type of lewd act or anything like that, I just, it was just conversations going back and forth.... [N]othing romantic, no I, I wouldn\u2019t say it was romantic at all, it just, I just, I just really care for her because you know, she reminded me a lot of when I was a kid ... and when I was around her age, um, she used to share with me a lot of issues that she had with anger and I used to share with her, well, I had a lot um, then, you know, any, you know, when, when you\u2019re writing back and forth, you know, it just sometimes, it just, you, you\u2019re going back and forth and you\u2019re going back and forth and you know, and I should have cut it off[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Appellant further stated that \u201cit\u2019s not even a physical connection at all, it\u2019s not, I have no sexual fantasies about [C.B.] whatsoever, or anybody\u2019s children.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant ended the interview by asking whether he could tell C.B.\u2019s parents that he was sorry and stating that he was willing to transfer to a different school to help C.B. and her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Detective Heavner testified that she received additional papers from C.B.\u2019s mother in the following month, including a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>letter in which appellant told C.B. that she \u201ccan be honest with [him]\u201d and \u201ctell [him] anything\u201d and stated that he would never \u201churt [her]\u201d and would \u201cunderstand\u201d if C.B. \u201cwant[ed] a boyfriend or like[d] someone.\u201d Detective Heavner also searched appellant\u2019s apartment pursuant to a warrant, but did not find any child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">C.B.\u2019s mother testified that she recalled an afternoon in December 2009 when C.B. got off the school bus in tears. She explained that C.B. was upset because appellant might be transferring to another school that school year or the next. She stated that C.B. was visibly upset the entire afternoon, which was a Friday, but that it was not \u201can issue by the time [C.B.] went back to school\u201d the next Monday. C.B.\u2019s mother stated that the school contacted her on March 17, 2010 regarding the letter in C.B.\u2019s desk. She took C.B. and her twin sister to the Child Advocacy Center, where they met with detectives. She also searched C.B.\u2019s backpack and room, finding the letters she gave to Detective Heavner. She elaborated that soon after finding the letters, C.B. was upset and displayed temper tantrums when they would discuss appellant. According to C.B.\u2019s mother, C.B.\u2019s behavior returned to normal \u201calmost immediately,\u201d but there were two consecutive days in August 2010 when C.B. was upset because she had been thinking of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">C.B. testified that she knew appellant as a \u201cfriend at school.\u201d She recalled exchanging letters with appellant in which they referred to each other as \u201cRaven K\u201d and \u201cSteeler girl,\u201d but she could not remember when they began exchanging letters. She stated that she and appellant would hand each other letters at the end of the school day as she headed to her bus. They would hug each other, but only in the presence of other children, with whom appellant also regularly exchanged hugs and \u201chigh fives.\u201d Finally, C.B. testified that appellant held her hand and gave her money and candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, appellant entered stipulations into evidence that C.B.\u2019s two brothers would have testified that they knew appellant from elementary school, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>regularly gave candy to students, and that he was generally a fun and nice guy. Appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that appellant\u2019s actions, save for the letters to C.B., were not particular to C.B. because appellant gave hugs, candy, and \u201chigh fives\u201d to other students and were not criminal under the Maryland sexual abuse statute and related case law. As to the attempted sexual abuse charge, appellant argued that the evidence did not demonstrate that he took a substantial step toward engaging in a sexual act with C.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The court denied the motion, but waited until it announced the verdict to state the reasoning. When it did announce the verdict, the court first stated that there was no dispute that appellant, as a paraeducator, was a person with temporary care or responsibility for C.B. Then, the court summarized the evidence and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Now as far as the crimes themselves that [appellant] is charged with, to date all of the Maryland cases that involve allegations or convictions for child sex abuse have involved physical acts that were sexual in nature. So this probably, at least from a reported opinion standpoint, I\u2019m not sure about unreported, is the first case in which there wasn\u2019t actual physical contact that was sexual in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">So although there was, as I indicated, testimony and stipulations that [appellant] hugged other students and gave other students money and candy, there is no evidence presented that any of these other students received the type of notes that [appellant] sent to [C.B.] or the inappropriate attention he showered upon her. So the <em>gravamen </em>of the offense of child sexual abuse isn\u2019t the act itself but [t]he abuse of the child. [Appellant] certainly was in a position of authority. He was able to gain [C.B.\u2019s] trust and then he abused that trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">The notes he sent to her professed his love for her, his desire to spend time with her, share his dreams and fantasies including sleeping with her in his arms. He also told her he thought about kissing her but wouldn\u2019t do it if she didn\u2019t want him to. But certainly put that invitation out there for a future event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>At least two of the notes referred to the Twilight Trilogy and the Eclipse movie where [appellant] cast himself in the role of Cullen and [C.B.] in the role of Bella. And the movie itself was not, obviously, sought to be admitted into evidence and there wasn\u2019t a lot of testimony about the movie itself. But I think it\u2019s fairly common knowledge that this trilogy is geared toward teenagers and younger, clearly involving romance. Cullen is the vampire and Bella is the teenage girl who falls in love with him. So there wasn\u2019t any evidence presented with that. It doesn\u2019t form the basis of my ultimate decision in this case. But I just mention it for the fact that I believe that\u2019s fairly common knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">Sexual acts are not only limited to physical acts. Taking all of the evidence into consideration I find that the totality of the letters, the hugging, the holding hands, were all evidence that [C.B.] was exploited and exploited within the meaning of the Child Sexual Abuse Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">These letters set the stage for future acts and were extremely suggesting in an inappropriate and sexual manner. Certainly not the types of letters a thirty eight year old man in his position should send to an eight year old girl. As I mentioned, he used these actions in order to gain her trust and then subsequently abused her trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">The letters were, I know there\u2019s a suggestion that the letters were inappropriate and perhaps passionate but not sexual in nature. It\u2019s hard to read these letters, including the totality of these letters, and not find that they were sexual from the standpoint that the passionate comments they contained bordered, almost border on obsession, contained expressions of jealousy and certainly had sexual undertones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">Unfortunately, [appellant\u2019s] fantasies became an eight year old girl\u2019s reality. And this is evidenced by the effect that these letters and these actions had on [C.B.] as observed by her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">So I find that the letters, the hugs, hand holding and fantasies were all for [appellant\u2019s] benefit and he exploited [C.B.] for his benefit. He kept all of the notes that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>received which is further evidence that the exploitation was for his benefit. And in looking at the legislative intent of this statute, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the legislative intent would not include these actions as falling within the ambit of the Child Sexual Abuse Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">And like any interpretations of a statute, the case law is going to develop as the cases get presented in terms of interpreting that statute. But clearly the type of action here falls within the scope and the legislative intent to protect the emotional and psychological welfare of children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">So, as far as the actual verdict, I do find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [appellant] had temporary custody of [C.B.], that he took advantage of her and unjustly and improperly used her for his own benefit. And I find that he did exploit her within the meaning of the Child Sexual Abuse Statute. So I will find him guilty of Count One[,] [sexual abuse of a minor],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">I will also find him guilty of Count Two, finding beyond a reasonable doubt in terms of the attempted sexual abuse of a minor, that he took substantial steps beyond mere preparation. So I find him guilty of both counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">B.

Still, the statute does not define \u201csexual molestation\u201d or \u201cexploitation of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In 1963, \u201c[t]he General Assembly first evidenced its concern with the mistreatment of children ... when it added \u00a7 11A to Art. 27 of the Maryland Code, later codified as \u00a7 35A of that article, declaring an assault on a child to be a felony.\u201d <em>Pope v.

In 1973, the General Assembly amended the child abuse statute to provide \u201cthat whenever \u2018abuse\u2019 was used in \u00a7 35A, it shall mean \u2018any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>physical injury or injuries sustained by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of malicious act or <em>acts...

The Court of Appeals, applying the rules of statutory construction, concluded that it was \u201c \u2018evident that the [General Assembly] plainly intended to broaden the area of proscribed conduct punishable in child abuse cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 396 A.2d 1054 (quoting <em>State v.

State, </em>84 Md.App. 157, 161, 578 A.2d 300 (1990), applying the prior statute, we held that the General Assembly, \u201cin enacting child abuse statutes, recognizes society\u2019s interest in protecting the privacy, health, and emotional and psychological welfare of its children.\u201d \u201cExploitation of children, through child pornography or sexual molestation and abuse, victimizes the children and possibly causes future psychological harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982)) (other citations omitted). Looking at the plain, dictionary meaning, we defined \u201cexploitation\u201d to occur when \u201cthe parent or person having temporary or permanent custody of a child took advantage of or unjustly or improperly used the child for his or her <em>own </em>benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 578 A.2d 300 (emphasis in original).

The Court considered \u201cthe purpose of the child abuse statute, the amendments in which the [legislature generally expanded the scope of liability and actions constituting child abuse ... and the modern trend in broadly recognizing and punishing all forms of child abuse[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 722 A.2d 887. The Court concluded that \u201cthe definition of sexual abuse in [Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, Section 35C(a)(6)(i) ] contemplates not just an affirmative act in directly molesting or exploiting a child, but one\u2019s omission or failure to act to prevent molestation or exploitation when it is reasonably possible to act and when a duty to do so ... exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 722 A.2d 887. The Court noted that the \u201cword \u2018involves\u2019 connotes a broad sense of inclusion, such as an act <em>relating </em>to sexual molestation or exploitation [and] expand[ed] the scope of the word \u2018act\u2019 from just the deed of molestation or exploitation into something done by the accused that relates to the molestation or exploitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 722 A.2d 887. Moreover, \u201c[b]y clarifying that sexual abuse need not necessarily lead to physical injuries in order to be prosecuted, the legislature recognized the extensive emotional, psychological, or physical damage that sexual abuse can cause a child[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 722 A.2d 887. \u201c[T]he General Assembly, through its various changes to the language of the [child sexual abuse] statute, consistently expanded [the statute\u2019s] scope and applicability to better achieve the goal of protecting \u2018children who have been the subject of abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 722 A.2d 887 (quoting 1973 Md.

For a fourth-degree sexual offense, \u201c[t]he intentional touching, whatever its scope, must be perpetrated \u2018for sexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 379, 933 A.2d 447. Conversely, \u201c[t]here is no comparable mental requirement in the sexual child abuse law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, sexual child abuse of a minor is broader than a fourth-degree sexual offense. <em>Tate II, </em>182 Md.App. at 124, 957 A.2d 640. We reiterated that \u201c[although \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 includes ... five statutorily listed examples, it most definitely is not limited to those examples.\u201d <em>Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 375-76, 933 A.2d 447; <em>see also Degren, </em>352 Md. at 428, 722 A.2d 887. Additionally, \u201c[t]he non-commission of so much as a single one [of the statutorily listed examples] does not necessarily imply the non-commission of [sexual abuse of a minor].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 933 A.2d 447. We recognized that a defendant may touch a minor in such a manner to constitute \u201csexual molestation or exploitation,\u201d without amounting to \u201csexual contact\u201d for fourth-degree sexual offense, because the contact may not be for \u201csexual arousal or gratification, or for the abuse of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376-81, 933 A.2d 447. In fact, in light of the defendant\u2019s own testimony, we noted that \u201c[i]t takes no stretch of the imagination to conclude that the jury may have found the [defendant\u2019s] behavior to have been inappropriate but may also have believed the [defendant] that his actions were not motivated by \u2018sexual arousal or gratification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 933 A.2d 447 (quoting C.L. \u00a7 2-301(f)(2)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Our holdings in <em>Tate I </em>and <em>Tate II </em>indicate that there is no specific <em>mens rea </em>requirement for sexual abuse of a minor under C.L. \u00a7 3-602, but we must determine whether appellant\u2019s <em>actus reus </em>amounted to sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The body of Maryland case law addresses varieties of physical contact with a minor child and whether that physical contact amounted to sexual molestation or exploitation. <em>See, e.g., Crispino v. State, </em>417 Md. 31, 45, 7 A.3d 1092 (2010) (french kissing a minor for ten minutes while on top of her in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>bed); <em>Tribbitt, 403 </em>Md. at 642, 943 A.2d <em>1260 </em>(teacher and coach grabbing a student\u2019s buttocks and inner thighs, rubbing her vaginal area, and sticking his hand down her pants); <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 424, 722 A.2d 887 (a wife\u2019s failure to prevent her husband from abusing a minor child); <em>Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 374, 933 A.2d 447 (stepfather putting hands in sixteen-year-old stepdaughter\u2019s underwear and rubbing the area around her vagina); <em>Brackins, </em>84 Md.App. at 161-62, 578 A.2d 300 (stepfather requesting that twelve-year-old stepdaughter unbutton blouse and taking photograph of her exposed breasts). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals has recognized that the General Assembly intended for C.L. \u00a7 3-602 and its predecessor to \u201ccover a wide range of conduct.\u201d <em>Crispino, </em>417 Md. at 43, 7 A.3d 1092. In <em>Crispino, </em>417 Md. at 43, 7 A.3d 1092 (quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 419-21, 722 A.2d 887), the Court recently reiterated the broad scope of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">[W]e noted that the \u201cword \u2018involves\u2019 connotes a broad sense of inclusion, such as an act <em>relating </em>to sexual molestation or exploitation,\u201d and \u201cexpand[ed] the scope of the word \u2018act\u2019 from just the deed of molestation or exploitation into something done by the accused that relates to the molestation or exploitation.\u201d We further observed that, \u201c[b]y clarifying that sexual abuse need not necessarily lead to physical injuries in order to be prosecuted, the [Legislature recognized the extensive emotional, psychological,. or physical damage that sexual abuse can cause a child\u201d, and \u201cthrough its various changes to the language of the statute, consistently expanded its scope and applicability to better achieve the goal of protecting \u2018children who have been the subject of abuse.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Appellant posits that to avoid C.L. \u00a7 3-602 being void for vagueness, we must interpret the statute to require that the defendant acted for the purpose of achieving or obtaining sexual arousal or gratification. <em>See Moss v. Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>279 Md. 561, 566, 369 A.2d 1011 (1977) (\u201cWe are also mindful of the familiar principle of law whereby if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>there are two reasonable constructions that can be placed upon a statute, one of which will result in its unconstitutionality and the other of which will not, we must construe the enactment so as to avoid conflict with the State or Federal Constitutions.\u201d). \u201cThe void-for-vagueness doctrine as applied to the analysis of penal statutes requires that the statute be \u2018sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway v. State, </em>865 Md. 599, 614, 781 A.2d 851 (2001) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 8, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992)). We disagree with appellant\u2019s characterization that he was convicted of sexual exploitation without committing an overtly sexual act because a rational fact-finder could easily determine that the content and sheer volume of appellant\u2019s letters to C.B. constituted exploitative behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Based on what appellant characterizes as a lack of precedential authority in Maryland, he directs our attention to an out-of-state case for the proposition that his conduct, though certainly reprehensible, did not amount to sexual exploitation. In <em>Sullivan v. State, </em>766 P.2d 51, 56 (Alaska Ct.App.1988), the Alaska Court of Appeals held that evidence that the defendant wrote notes to a minor asking her to \u201cbe my girlfriend,\u201d \u201ckiss me,\u201d let him \u201cfeel\u201d and \u201ckiss\u201d her \u201cprivate parts,\u201d and \u201ctake off [her] clothes\u201d \u201cestablishe[d] only that [he] engaged in preparatory conduct and not that he took a substantial step toward sexual conduct\u201d with the minor as required for attempted sexual abuse of a minor. However, in <em>Braun v. Alaska, </em>911 P.2d 1075 (Alaska Ct.App.1996), that Court elaborated on its decision in <em>Sullivan. </em>There, the defendant appealed his convictions of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor and attempted second-degree abuse of a minor, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support these convictions. <em>Braun, </em>911 P.2d at 1077. The Court held that evidence of the defendant touching several children underneath their clothing and asking to take photographs of them naked was sufficient to support his convictions because the Alaska legislature had expressly removed the requirement that the \u201csexual contact\u201d be with the \u201cintent to obtain sexual gratifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078 (citing <em>Van Meter v. Alaska, </em>743 P.2d 385, 389-91 (Alaska Ct.App.1987)). Therefore, we do not find <em>Sullivan </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Appellant also cites out-of-state statutes that limit sexual exploitation of children to the creation of child pornography. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251; Alaska Stat. \u00a7 11.41.455; Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-3553; Ga.Code \u00a7 16-12-100; Iowa Code \u00a7 728.12; 17-A Me.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 282; N.C.

We then defined \u201csexual exploitation\u201d to have occurred when \u201cthe parent or person having temporary or permanent custody of a child took advantage of or unjustly or improperly used the child for his or her <em>own </em>benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 162, 578 A.2d 300. Furthermore, \u201c[tjo be convicted of exploitation and, therefore, child abuse, threats, coercion, or subsequent use of the fruits of the acts are not necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nowhere in <em>Brackins </em>nor any other case in Maryland have Courts required that the benefit be sexual gratification or sexual benefit. Indeed, we have stated that \u201csexual abuse of a minor pursuant to [C.L.] \u00a7 3-602 does not involve any specific intent or special <em>mens rea.\u201d Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 379, 933 A.2d 447; <em>see also Tate II, </em>182 Md.App. at 121, 957 A.2d 640 (A violation of C.L. \u00a7 3-602 \u201carguably requires no more than objective behavior that has an adverse sexual impact on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>victim,\u201d while \u201ca fourth-degree sexual offense ... requires subjectively that the sexual conduct be committed with the specific intent of producing \u2018sexual arousal or gratification.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The circuit court was well aware of this broad definition of sexual abuse and the legislative intent behind C.L. \u00a7 3-602. Its finding that appellant exploited C.B. within the meaning of C.L. \u00a7 3-602 was not erroneous. The court relied on the totality of the circumstances, which included appellant\u2019s interactions with C.B., the content and sheer volume of the notes and letters, and the obvious emotional distress C.B. suffered as a result of appellant\u2019s actions. The court stated, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to read these letters, including the totality of these letters, and not find that they were sexual from the standpoint that the passionate comments ... almost border on obsession, contained expressions of jealousy[,] and certainly had sexual undertones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The circuit court held that appellant had temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of C.B., and appellant does not challenge such a finding on appeal. <em>See Ellis v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 522, 541-50, 971 A.2d 379 (2009) (holding that teacher had temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of student, even though student was not in teacher\u2019s class). The court also concluded that appellant \u201ctook advantage of [C.B.] and unjustly and improperly used her for his own benefit,\u201d exploiting her within the ambit of C.L. \u00a7 3-602. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we cannot conclude that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in its fact-finding. In our own <em>de novo </em>review of the statutory and case law, we hold that the circuit court did not err in its determination that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant, through the totality of his actions and correspondence with C.B., exploited her pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 3-602 and had an adverse sexual, emotional, and psychological impact on her. <em>See Tate II, </em>182 Md.App. at 121, 957 A.2d 640. There was sufficient evidence that appellant\u2019s interactions with C.B. and his notes and letters with sexual undertones fell within the ambit of C.L. \u00a7 3-602, as the actions involved sexual exploitation. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Crispino, </em>417 Md. at 43, 7 A.3d 1092 (quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 419, 722 A.2d 887) (\u201c \u2018[IJnvolves\u2019 connotes a broad sense of inclusion, such as an act <em>relating </em>to sexual molestation or exploitationf.]\u201d). Appellant \u201ctook advantage of or unjustly or improperly used [C.B.] for his ... <em>own </em>benefit\u201d as the sheer volume of letters evidenced a fascination or attachment of a sexual nature. <em>See Brackins, </em>84 Md.App. at 162, 578 A.2d 300. Moreover, appellant\u2019s actions clearly had an extensive emotional or psychological impact on C.B., which the General Assembly sought to prevent in its enactment and various amendments to C.L. \u00a7 3-602 \u201cto better achieve the goal of protecting \u2018children who have been the subject of abuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crispino, </em>417 Md. at 44, 7 A.3d 1092 (quoting 1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 835 (title clause)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appellant urges us to adopt \u201c[t]he general definition of \u2018sexual exploitation\u2019 [as] \u2018[t]he use of a person, especially] a child, in prostitution, pornography, or other sexually manipulative activity that has caused or could cause serious emotional injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. West Lake Academy, </em>548 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1407 (8th ed.2004)). We are not persuaded, however, because Maryland courts have already adopted a definition of exploitation. <em>See Brackins, </em>84 Md.App. at 161, 578 A.2d 300 (\u201cTo be convicted of exploitation ... [t]he State need only prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the ... person having temporary or permanent custody of a child took advantage of or unjustly or improperly used the child for his or her <em>own </em>benefit.\u201d). Yet, even accepting appellant\u2019s favored definition of exploitation, we cannot hold that the circuit court erred in concluding that appellant exploited C.B. Through the totality of appellant\u2019s actions and letters, the State provided sufficient evidence that appellant used C.B. for \u201c \u2018sexually manipulative activity that has caused or could cause serious emotional injury,\u2019 \u201d as evidenced by the testimony of C.B., her mother, her principal, and her teachers. <em>Id. </em>(quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1407 (8th ed.2004)). Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s actions and letters, in conjunction with the impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>on C.B., supplied a sufficient basis for the circuit court to convict him of sexual abuse of a minor under C.L. \u00a7 8-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Finally, we point out that in <em>Cooksey v. State, </em>359 Md. at 24 n. 1, 752 A.2d 606, the Court of Appeals noted that \u201ctouching a person\u2019s buttocks\u201d or \u201crubbing against the victim\u201d clearly represented \u201csexual molestation or exploitation\u201d to constitute sexual child abuse, even though it would be questionable whether the same acts amounted to sexual contact for a sexual offense. In <em>Tate I, </em>176 Md.App. at 378, 933 A.2d 447 (quoting <em>Cooksey, </em>359 Md. at 24 n. 1, 752 A.2d 606), we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Section 461(f) of Article 27 [from which \u00a7 3-301 (f) is derived without substantive change defining sexual contact] includes within the definition of \u201csexual contact\u201d <em>the intentional touching of the victim\u2019s anal or genital areas </em>or other \u201cintimate parts\u201d for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. <em>Whether the touching of a person\u2019s \u201cbuttocks\u201d would suffice as sexual contact is not clear. It might, </em>however, depending on the circumstances, <em>constitute sexual molestation or exploitation, even if it did not constitute sexual contact. The same situation could arise from \u201crubbing against\u201d the victim.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">(Emphasis in <em>Tate </em>I). Similarly, while there was no evidence that appellant\u2019s interactions with C.B. fell within the scope of \u201csexual contact\u201d for a sexual offense, the magnitude of the conduct provided sufficient evidence for the circuit court to convict appellant of sexual abuse of a minor under C.L. \u00a7 3-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Teachers at C.B.'s school testified that paraeducators would often assist them with other classroom activities as well, involving the entire class.
