Namely, we must determine whether the Circuit Court for Howard County was correct in concluding that: (1) the differential diagnosis performed by Dr. Shoemaker was reliable and acceptable to establish general and specific causation, and (2) the differential diagnosis method is generally accepted in the medical community.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Appellees, Josephine Chesson, Martha Knight, Carole Silberhorn, Linda Gamble, Kenneth Lyons, and Connie Collins, were employees of the Baltimore Washington Conference of the United Methodist Church (\u201cBWCUMC\u201d), located at 9720 Patuxent Woods Parkway, Columbia, Maryland. In late 2002, several employees complained that there was an odor emanating throughout the walls of the facility. A maintenance crew investigated the situation and discovered mold in the walls. Two types of mold were found: Aspergillus and Stachybotrys. As a result of the exposure, each appellee filed a claim against BWCUMC and its insurer, appellant, Montgomery Mutual Insurance Company, with the Maryland Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d). The claims alleged that appellees suffered an accidental injury or occupational disease, known as sick building syndrome, as a result of the exposure. A hearing was held and the Commission disallowed two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>appellees\u2019 claims and awarded the remaining appellees partial compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Each appellee noted an appeal and the cases were consolidated. Before trial, appellant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the testimony of Dr. Shoemaker. Appellant argued that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony should be excluded because his methodologies and theories regarding the causal nexus between exposure to mold and human health effects were not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Recognizing that Dr. Shoemaker was a board certified physician, who devoted a significant portion of his practice to caring for individuals who were exposed to water damaged buildings, the court denied the motion. The court then noted that a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The Commission\u2019s decisions were subsequently reversed and appellant noted an appeal. Among other things, on appeal, appellant argued that the circuit court committed error by not conducting a <em>Fryer-Reed </em>hearing. <em>Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>170 Md.App. 551, 556, 907 A.2d 873 (2006). We held that the court correctly declined to conduct a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing because Dr. Shoemaker performed \u201ccertain tests\u201d that were \u201cnot so unorthodox that would warrant subjecting them to a <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 907 A.2d 873. Specifically, we noted that a hearing was unnecessary because \u201cexpert opinions concerning the cause or origin of an individual\u2019s condition are not subject to <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">An appeal was noted and a petition for certiorari was granted. <em>See Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006). In reversing our decision, the Court of Appeals held that a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing should have been held \u201cto determine whether the medical community generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>accepts the theory that mold exposure causes the illnesses that [appellees] claimed to have suffered, and the propriety of the tests Dr. Shoemaker employed to reach his medical conclusions.\u201d <em>Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chesson, </em>399 Md. 314, 328, 923 A.2d 939 (2007). Noting that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony involved more than generally accepted medical opinion and diagnosis, the Court explained that \u201cDr. Shoemaker employs medical tests to reach a conclusion that is not so widely accepted as to be subject to judicial notice of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 923 A.2d 939 (footnote omitted). Indeed, because \u201cDr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony was based on scientific opinion regarding the causal link between mold exposure and sick building syndrome ...,\u201d the Court of Appeals reasoned that \u201chis theories regarding causation and the tests he employed to diagnose [appellees] were subject to <em>Fry e-Reed </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 923 A.2d 939. Accordingly, the case was remanded for the limited purpose of determining \u201cwhether Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s methodologies used for diagnosis and theories regarding the causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects are generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 923 A.2d 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">At the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, Dr. Shoemaker explained the genesis of his theories and methodologies. Dr. Shoemaker began a rural family practice in Pocomoke City in 1980. Around 1997, some of his patients began developing acute and chronic symptoms from exposure to the Pocomoke River, and tributaries adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. One of the symptoms, diarrhea, was treated with Cholestyramine, a drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of elevated cholesterol. Cholestyramine was prescribed because it was commonly used \u201cin primary care medicine to treat secretory diarrhea.\u201d As Dr. Shoemaker expected, the diarrhea reduced; but surprisingly, there was an improvement concerning issues associated with memory, headaches, coughing, and muscle aches. Based on this, Dr. Shoemaker published a paper in the Maryland Medical Journal reviewing other cases in which patients suffered memory loss, cognitive impairments, headaches, rashes, abdominal pain, di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>arrhea, redness of the eyes, and bronchial spasms that were caused by exposure to the Pocomoke River.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Soon thereafter, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene appointed a committee to examine some of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s patients. The Center for Disease Control Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) worked with the committee and developed a case definition for the illness: Possible Estuary-Associated Syndrome (\u201cPEAS\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In diagnosing patients that purportedly had PEAS, Dr. Shoemaker would review possible exposure, consider factors that could contribute to potential physical and cognitive issues, conduct a physical examination, order medical testing, and thereafter, develop a differential diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In 1998, Kenneth Hudnell, Ph.D., published an article that explored the benefits of using visual contrast sensitivity testing as a biomarker for PEAS. Dr. Shoemaker started using the testing soon thereafter. According to Dr. Shoemaker, the test results indicated that there were distinguishable markers between people exposed to the Pocomoke River and those who were not. At this point, realizing that he was treating patients who were not exposed to pfiesteria, dinoflagellates, or algal blooms, Dr. Shoemaker believed that his patients must have been exposed to water damaged buildings that contained visible mold.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In treating the patients who were exposed to water damaged buildings, Dr. Shoemaker would initially remove samples of visible mold from a person\u2019s workplace or residence. Then he would remove the patient from the exposure and prescribe Cholestyramine. The person would remain on Cholestyramine and away from his or her workplace or residence for approximately two weeks. If the symptoms subsided, Dr. Shoemaker would remove the patient from Cholestyramine and instruct him or her to stay away from the exposure. The patient would then be evaluated approximately two to three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>days later. Assuming the patient was not exhibiting the previous symptoms, the patient, again, would be exposed to the mold. This exposure would occur without Cholestyramine being prescribed. If the symptoms arose again, the patient would be retreated with Cholestyramine.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Not long after, Dr. Shoemaker added blood tests to review whether the treatment was working. After that, he created a two-tiered case definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To satisfy the first tier, the following had to occur: (1) a patient had a potential for exposure to water damaged buildings, (2) there was the \u201cpresence of multiple health symptoms for multiple health systems,\u201d and (3) confounders were absent (i.e. untreated or uncontrolled medical conditions). If a patient satisfied these requirements, the results from the blood and visual contrast sensitivity tests would be reviewed to determine whether three of the following were present: (1) one of fifty-four kinds of immune response genotypes known as HLA, (2) reduced levels of melancyte stimulating hormone (\u201cMSH\u201d), (3) elevated levels of matrix metalproteinase-9 (\u201cMMP9\u201d), (4) deficits in visual contrast sensitivity, (5) dysregulation of ACTH and cortisol, and (6) dysregulation of ADH and osmolality.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">According to Dr. Shoemaker, HLA is inspected because it is a genetic measure that reviews immune response genes that \u201chelp turn down innate immunity following exposure .... \u201d When \u201cHLA is working, ... innate immune re-signals get converted into antibodies that then protect [a person].... \u201d Dr. Shoemaker next explained that the level of MSH is analyzed because it is a hormone that regulates innate immunity in the body. According to him, MSH deficiency is generally present in individuals exposed to water damaged buildings because innate immune responses are not being properly regulated. Dr. Shoemaker thereafter noted that levels of MMP9 are reviewed because \u201cMMP9 looks directly at a unified presentation of a kind of innate immune element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>called a cytokine----\u201d As for the visual contrast sensitivity test, Dr. Shoemaker explained that this test is used because its results illustrate \u201cinflammatory changes that cause reduction of blood flow in small blood vessels in the retina.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Shoemaker provided that ACTH and cortisol are examined to determine whether there is a \u201cdisruption of a secondary mechanism to compensate for original inflammation ...,\u201d and ADH and osmolality are examined to review the hypothalamic center. All in all, these measurements are supposed to illustrate inflammation, which, according to Dr. Shoemaker, is a biomarker for illnesses related to exposure to water damaged buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Hung Cheung, M.D. (\u201cDr. Cheung\u201d), a board certified physician in internal and occupational medicine, testified in opposition to Dr. Shoemaker. In his \u201chealth-based approach\u201d to evaluating patients associated with exposure to mold, Dr. Cheung explained that he reviewed a patient\u2019s complaints and medical history, assessed environmental conditions, and then determined whether environmental conditions were the cause of a patient\u2019s complaints. To evaluate the environment exposure, Dr. Cheung used the four \u201cP\u2019s\u201d: (1) pollution, which could range from the ozone to mold, to endotoxins, (2) pathway, simply meaning the method in which the pollutant travels throughout the building, (3) pressure, which explains the direction of flow of the pollutant, and (4) person, because exposure is not possible without a person. Because there are different types of exposure, Dr. Cheung explained that he had to determine which one caused a patient\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Thereafter, recognizing that Dr. Shoemaker could render a diagnosis using the differential diagnosis method, Dr. Cheung testified that the issue of causation has \u201cnothing to do with differential diagnosis.\u201d Instead, he merely believed that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s differential diagnosis exposed the human health effects being suffered. Dr. Cheung then explained that the scientific literature does not support the notion that exposure to toxic mold by inhalation in water damaged buildings causes certain human health effects. Ultimately, Dr. Cheung explained that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s methodology, treatment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>opinion regarding causation are controversial and not generally accepted in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Approximately fourteen months after the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the circuit court issued findings of fact. In relevant part, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s Qualifications and Experience</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">1. Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker, M.D., is Board Certified in Family Practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">2. Dr. Shoemaker has no advanced training or certification in toxicology, allergy, epidemiology, genetics, mycology, immunology, rheumatology, industrial hygiene, neuropsychology, pulmonology, endocrinology, or teratology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">3. Dr. Shoemaker employs each of these areas on a regular basis in the practice of medicine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">4. With respect to diagnosis and treatment of human health consequences of persons exposed to toxicity from water damaged buildings, Dr. Shoemaker has been primarily a diagnostician and treating physician. His approach has been that of a clinician in the practice of medicine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">5. Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s medical group has addressed the medical question of health consequences or illness as a result of exposure in water damaged buildings more than four thousand seven hundred (4700) times since starting this area of interest in his practice of medicine in 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">6. In the years following 1998, about seventy-five (75) percent of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s medical practice was devoted to the diagnosis, care, and treatment of patients who had illness acquired following exposure to water damaged buildings. Now the portion of his practice devoted to this specialized area of medicine is about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ninety-five (95) percent and has been since 2002, when he sold his family practice and moved into a new medical office and practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">7. By 2005, Dr. Shoemaker had treated over three thousand (3000) patients with health problems from exposure to the complex chemical mix found in water damaged buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">9. In these cases, samples of visible mold were taken from the home or workplace and sent to a reference laboratory. Also, it was not uncommon to notice odors in areas of water damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">10. About twenty-five (25) percent of the patients treated by Dr. Shoemaker for illness acquired following exposure to water damaged buildings were referred to him by other physicians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\n<em>Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s Use of Differential Diagnosis is with Patients Exposed to Water Damaged Buildings</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">31. A differential diagnosis is a preliminary or working diagnosis. The follow up treatment and testing is meant to rule in possible, likely causes and rule out other confounders, in order to arrive at a final diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">32. The use of this method is taught from the first day in medical school. For centuries, it has been a standard technique utilized by physicians in the diagnosis of illness and in the care and treatment of patients, and it continues to be a standard technique today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">35. [The] method, which [Dr. Shoemaker] followed with each ... [appellee], was to see the patient, take a medical history, perform a physical examination, order medical testing, and then start with a differential diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">36. In addition to Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s reliance on the history given by the patient and a physical examination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>results of certain blood tests and studies were used to show an absence of confounders, such as other diseases that could account for or contribute to inflammatory problems that patients may have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s Repetitive Exposure Protocol and Treatment Protocol</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">37. In order to attempt to establish a causal relationship between the exposure and the health effects or illness, Dr. Shoemaker utilized a repetitive exposure protocol, which is a five (5) step process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">38. Step one (1) of the protocol is called Base, which stands for baseline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">39. Step two (2) is called AC 1, which means after treatment (Cholestyramine), the first time around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">40. Step three (3) is called HOC, or alternatively, OROC. The acronym HOC stands for patient home off Cholestyramine, if the suspect building is a work place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">41. Step four (4) is called BOC. The patient is placed back in the building for three (3) days and off the Cholestyramine. If the patient does not become ill, then there is no step five. If the patient does become ill again under BOC, only then does step five (5) occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">42. Step five (5), called AC2, means after Cholestyramine, the second time around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">43. Based upon the findings of one hundred and one (101) patients in some forty (40) buildings, Dr. Shoemaker found that there was something in the exposure to the indoor air that was causing the illness. He did not find or conclude that it was exclusively mold itself which was the cause of the illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">44. The technique of repetitive exposure protocol is an example of a component of differential diagnosis and has been routinely and regularly practiced by clinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>physicians to prove prospective causation, <em>i.e., </em>prospective acquisition, of illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">45. The time honored goal of repetitive exposure analysis is to isolate that exposure, eliminate and rule out confounders, and confirm the cause of illness with diagnostic studies and tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">46. Under this process, the patient becomes the control for his own health and the short term interventions of three (3) days of exposure and then three (3) days of no exposure is more reliable from a diagnostic standpoint than a longer term period of time or study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">47. The essence of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s treatment protocol is to eliminate the exposure to potential toxicity on the front end and lower or eliminate toxicity at the back end, through the binding action with Cholestyramine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">48. According to Dr. Shoemaker, Cholestyramine has a positive charge and the toxins have a negative charge, so that they attract one another and bind into a large compound, preventing its reabsorption into the system. The compound, including the toxins, is eliminated from the system and hence the patient\u2019s toxicity is lowered and their symptoms relieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">49. The treatment protocol has proved effective in the acute phase illness in thousands of patients who have been treated by Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">50. The results of a treatment protocol also serve as a diagnostic tool. The response to a given therapy or treatment can be an essential element of the ongoing refinement of a differential diagnosis process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">51. Over a ten (10) year period, Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s treatment protocol underwent eleven (11) refinements or changes, but the basic approach remained the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">54. Dr. Shoemaker published the treatment protocol as of 2005 in a book called <em>Mold Warriors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\n<em>The Two Tier Analysis Employed by Dr. Shoemaker after 2002</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">55. After 2002, Dr. Shoemaker stopped taking new patients unless they had a chronic fatigue illness. With a larger patient base in this new area of practice, Dr. Shoemaker was able to collect data and to rule out a variety of possible confounders. He utilized a Two Tier system in arriving at a common case definition of the illness suffered by his new patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">56. By this time, the water damaged building cohort of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s practice constituted about two-thirds of his practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">57. Under the model, the Tier One criteria were to establish that all patients must have the potential for exposure to water damaged building(s) somewhere, and the absence of any untreated and uncontrolled medical conditions that could be a confounder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">58. The second Tier is much more restrictive and precise. To meet Tier Two of the case definition, a patient must meet at least three (3) of six (6) secondary criteria, to eliminate any false positives in the diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">59. Dr. Shoemaker is able to reach a diagnosis to a reasonable degree of medical certainty just from taking into account the Tier One factors. Under Tier One, there is (1) a finding of the potential for exposure; (2) the presence of multiple health symptoms; and (3) a ruling out the presence of confounders through the differential diagnosis analysis. This process involves employment of the repetitive exposure protocol....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">60. By mid-2003, the second Tier criteria were used to increase restrictiveness so that no false positives would be included in the diagnosis. The second Tier findings provided increased weight to the opinion, but was not necessary in order for Dr. Shoemaker to diagnose biotoxin or toxin illness from exposure to water damaged buildings to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>61. The degree of certitude solely based on Tier One analysis is over fifty (50) percent. Dr. Shoemaker would not proceed with the Tier Two analysis if the patient does not pass the Tier One level. The degree of certitude increases to the high nineties (90) if the diagnosis is based on both Tiers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">62. The blood tests and studies in the Tier Two inquiry are attempting, first and foremost, to measure inflammation and, in the process of doing so, assist Dr. Shoemaker in isolating the potential cause of illness from other confounders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">63. There are six (6) secondary criteria in the Tier Two analysis. They are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">1) The presence of one of fifty-four (54) kinds of immune response gynotypes, call HLA, a genetic marker found on chromosome 6[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">2) A reduction of an inflammation preventing hormone, Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone, or MSH;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">3) An elevated level of an inflammation representing enzyme called Matrix Metallic Proteinase Nine or MMP9;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">4) An abnormal relationship of hormone pairs ACTH, a hormone that stimulates adrenals to cortisol;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">5) An abnormal relationship of hormone pairs Antidiuretic hormone ADH to osmolality; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">6) A visual contrast test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">64. Criterion two (2) under the Tier Two analysis, the reduction of MSH, is found in over nine-two (92) percent of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s patients. This MSH hormone is important in the regulation of innate immune responses and therefore the deficiency results in abnormalities of the innate immune responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">65. The third criterion, elevated MMP9, is quite common in the biotoxin and toxin illnesses treated by Dr. Shoemaker. The list of illnesses for which MMP9 is elevated is quite small. An elevated level of MMP9 is an example of inflamation, which can also be found in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>patient with acute lung disease, connective tissue problems, or multiple sclerosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">66. Criterion number four (4), abnormal relationship of ACTH to cortisol, is something that Dr. Shoemaker has encountered in over four thousand (4000) patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">67. The blood work and visual contrast, which is criterion six (6) in Tier Two are part of the later stages of the diagnostic protocol used by Dr. Shoemaker, but are not part of the treatment protocol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">68. Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s data base showed that where there were at least three (3) of the six (6) criteria found, all of those patients were in the exposed category and had already been diagnosed under the Tier One analysis as ill from exposure to a water damaged building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">69. The data base showed that where there were only one (1) or two (2) but less than three (3) of the criteria, all of those persons were in the control group, i.e., those who had not been exposed to a water damaged building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">70. The test for the presence or absence of these six (6) criteria were all standard blood tests that were performed by a commercial laboratory. The results were placed in the patient\u2019s medical file and became part of the data base that Dr. Shoemaker maintained for all of his new patients with exposure to water damaged buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">71. Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s patients who are diagnosed with a biotoxin or toxin illness have an innate immunity response and not acquired immunity, such as someone suffering allergy or asthma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">72. In the early years, up until 2003, the blood test results that were ordered were essentially normal. Then, starting in mid-2003, Dr. Shoemaker ordered the Tier Two blood studies and tests that looked at the markers for innate immune response activity. He found that results were now abnormal in many respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>73. Under this newer approach the focus was on innate immunity and inflammation was consistently identified as the central and major problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Dr. Cheung\u2019s Methodology</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">143. Dr. Cheung is conducting two epidemiology studies. One is in Maryland and involves seven thousand six hundred (7,600) participants. The study involves over three hundred (300) sites and there are air samplings for mold, surface swabs for mold in the air handling units, measurements for endotoxins, skin cells, and measurements for sixty-four (64) different compounds that are within indoor environments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">144. To assess whether the exposure to the chemical mix in the work environment is causing illness to the occupants, Dr. Cheung relies upon the concept of four (4) \u201cPs\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\"><em>145. The </em>first \u201cP\u201d is the pollutant, which could be anything: maybe the ozone, or the mold, or the endotoxin, or the odor, or various other things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">146. The second \u201cP\u201d is the pathway which is how the pollutant travels and how it gets around in the exposed location or building. The ventilation system is often a major factor under the second \u201cP\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">147.

In determining causation of adverse health effects from exposure to toxic mold in water damaged buildings, it is important that a diagnostician consider the synergistic effect from the combination of chemicals in any given building, and not simply consider strength or potency and quantity of toxic mold alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">152. Most mold assessment exposures are subjective by their very nature. Even if scientific methods are used, an objective mold assessment is very difficult to obtain and rarely used without the subjective complaints. Testing techniques and methods are static by their nature. Exposures are ever-changing and therefore a static test cannot be an accurate measure. Each of the four (4) \u201cPs\u201d is constantly changing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>Dr. Cheung\u2019s Scientific Opinion on Causation in These Proceedings</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">155. Dr. Cheung has testified that, in his opinion, the use of differential diagnosis procedure and diagnosis of CBAI fails to establish general causation or specific causation and is therefore unreliable. It merely gets to what the health condition may be, but without the causation analysis, it fails to prove causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">156. General causation in environmental medicine and research, in Dr. Cheung\u2019s opinion, is the equivalent of scientific causation which is at the nine-five (95) percent level of probability. It must be proved to this degree of certainty, by a rigid research based standard, according to Dr. Cheung.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">157. In Dr. Cheung\u2019s opinion, causation analysis and scientific or general causation really have nothing to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>with differential diagnosis, the method followed by Dr. Shoemaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">159. Dr. Cheung rendered his opinion that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s diagnosis of CBAI is not generally accepted ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">160. Dr. Cheung testified that, in his expertise, water damage in buildings may be the cause of health consequences and human health illness. He breaks the human health consequences into three categories: First, is the allergic or hypersensitivity group. Second, it is classified as infection or infections. The third category is the toxic effects associated with mold. The toxic effects, in Dr. Cheung\u2019s opinion, are usually associated with ingestion and not inhalation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">162. Dr. Cheung contends that the various studies do not support Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s conclusions. These studies do not show that exposure to toxic mold by inhalation in water damaged buildings are in high enough concentrations to show an association with fatigue, memory loss, join[t] pain, muscle aches, confusion, weakness, depression, or disorientation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">163. Dr. Cheung acknowledged that if forty (40) people are in a water damaged building where visible mold is present and can be smelled, that it would be a good indication of an exposure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">164. Dr. Cheung noted that the Maryland State Task force on Indoor Air Quality Trial Report of July 1, 2002, investigated a wide variety of biological agents present in indoor environments that could potentially cause health problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">165. The report specifically stated that molds and fungi can cause significant human health effects, including allergies, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other health effects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>166. The specific health effects depend both on the nature and extent of the exposure and the underlying health status of the exposed individuals. Mold growth in buildings can have adverse health consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">167. The Report concluded on page eleven (11) that there is an inadequate base of scientific knowledge to get health-based mold standards for buildings because of uncertainties about the levels of mold, the relationships between mold exposure and different health effects, and differences in susceptibility from person to person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">168. Finally, the Report stated that exposures to indoor mold contamination can and should be minimized, and mold growth and contamination in offices can and should be prevented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">169. Dr. Cheung\u2019s opinion is that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s diagnosis, treatment methodology and opinion on the [causal] relationship between human health effects and water damaged buildings is not generally accepted by the scientific community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">170. Dr. Cheung does not have any problem with Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s use of Cholestyramine to treat patients for exposure to mycotoxins in water damaged buildings nor to his treatment regimen or ordering them to be removed from the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">171. Although he has no criticism of these steps by Dr. Shoemaker in his treatment, he does not believe that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s treatment protocol proves either general or specific causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">172. Dr. Cheung\u2019s complaint is that Dr. Shoemaker does not have the field investigators investigate the building to determine scientifically what chemicals or toxins are actually present in the indoor air and, if any, whether they are of sufficient potency to cause, generally and specifically, adverse health consequences to any of the buildings occupants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>173. Dr. Cheung believes the physician should guide the investigation as well as the communication and resolution of the problem.

Dr. Shoemaker testified that this hands-on sampling is not part of his job as a diagnosing physician. Dr. Cheung does not know whether Dr. Shoemaker actually does this hands-on investigation sampling himself or relies upon others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">An opinion was issued approximately six months after the findings of fact. In concluding that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s differential diagnosis method was reliable and acceptable to establish general and specific causation, the circuit court indicated that the \u201cquestion of admissibility of expert medical testimony to prove general or specific causation appears to be a case of first impression in Maryland.\u201d Indeed, noting that there was \u201cno judicial consensus regarding admissibility,\u201d the court explained that there were two \u201cdistinct\u201d approaches in toxic tort cases: (1) the toxicological approach<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) the clinical-medical approach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The circuit court explained that the toxicological approach recognizes that the differential diagnosis method was reliable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>However, the court noted that a differential diagnosis alone was not sufficient to establish general or specific causation under the toxicological approach. Because of that, the circuit court explained that the toxicological approach \u201cdeemphasizes the temporal relationship between exposure to a toxin and the onset of symptoms, focusing on specific dose-response relationships for the toxins.\u201d Conversely, the court noted that the clinical-medical approach \u201cacknowledges that differential diagnosis is the ... generally accepted method by which a clinician diagnoses the various illnesses he or she encounters in a myriad of patients.\u201d Moreover, the circuit court explained that the clinical-medical approach permits \u201ca clinical physician to express an opinion, derived from differential diagnosis, that a particular toxic substance caused the patient\u2019s symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUL\">Inferring that the toxicological approach was undesirable because it was \u201cinflexible,\u201d the circuit court articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">Even if scientific methods are used, an objective and accurate mold assessment is very difficult to obtain, and is rarely used without subjective complaints. Testing techniques and methods are static by their very nature. Exposures, on the other hand, are ever changing and therefore a static test or even a series of such tests cannot be an accurate measure of the levels of concentration of toxicity or the duration of an exposure in any particular area of a water damaged building. Nor do static tests truly reflect a person\u2019s exposure over an extended period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">No government agency has yet established a standard to determine a safe range or a dangerous range of indoor mold or other mycotoxin levels. Strict adherence to the toxicological approach would thus require a plaintiff to present information that does not yet exist. Without such information, there is no redress for the serious health problems that he or she may have suffered. One can only hope that future plaintiffs may find their luck enhanced by further scientific research. Today\u2019s plaintiff, under the toxicological approach, must accept that mold cannot be the scientific or legal cause of his or her symptoms, despite general acknowledgment that molds and fungi can cause significant human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>effects and the standard practice of vacating and remediating water damaged buildings where molds and other toxins are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Noting that the clinical-medical approach would be used to determine the admissibility of Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">An integral part of any differential diagnosis process is a determination by the clinician of the general and specific causation of the patient\u2019s illness. This Court finds that an expert medical opinion based upon a properly conducted differential diagnosis is reliable. Therefore, a medical opinion based upon this methodology is admissible to prove general and specific causation of illness from exposure to toxicity in a water damaged building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">After that, the circuit court concluded that Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s testimony was admissible because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">(1) The medical community is the relevant scientific community to determine whether differential diagnosis is a well recognized and generally accepted procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">(2) Differential diagnosis is well recognized and generally accepted in the medical community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">(3) Two of the well recognized methods to establish the presence of toxicity and an exposure are the presence of black or visible mold and an odor. Dr. Shoemaker verified the presence of visible mold and an odor in the building where [appellees] and other employees were exposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">(4) There is no requirement that toxic mold alone be identified or determined to be in sufficient quantity to be the pollutant. In establishing an exposure, the medical doctor must consider the combination or chemical mix present in any particular water damaged building for a finding of general and specific causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">(5) Dr. Shoemaker was aware of the exposure to microbial growth and proliferation before meeting with [appellees]. He ... met with [appellees] for purposes of diagnosis and treatment rather than litigation. Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s expertise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>in treating patients exposed to toxicity dates back to 1980, and is not litigation-driven.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">(6) Dr. Shoemaker took a detailed medical history and conducted a physical examination of [appellees] as a part of his routine diagnostic process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">(7) Dr. Shoemaker determined that there was a cohort of fifty (50) employees who were exposed. Of that number, eleven (11) employees were determined not to be ill and therefore were not tested. Dr. Shoemaker found twenty-two (22) employees who showed evidence of illness that could be ascribed to the exposure. Seventeen (17) other employees were examined and tested by other health care providers. Where a number of people become ill following an exposure, the temporal relationship between the exposure and illnesses becomes stronger and furnishes compelling evidence of causation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">(8) Dr. Shoemaker relied upon strong evidence of the temporal relationship between the onset and exacerbation of symptoms upon treatment and removal from exposure. He also relied upon the reported relapse of symptoms in three (3) of [appellees] following their exposure to boxed files that had been removed from the vacated office building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">(9) Dr. Shoemaker, after performing a differential diagnosis, was able to reach a final diagnosis to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to [appellees]. In doing [so], he relied upon evidence of an exposure, the presence of multiple health symptoms, and diagnostic studies and blood tests, to rule in probable causes and rule out alternative causes of [appellees\u2019] illnesses. The Tier Two (2) studies confirmed the final diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Because appellant noted a timely appeal, we must determine whether the circuit court was correct in its <em>Frye-Reed </em>determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The present case was remanded to determine whether the \u201cmethodologies used for diagnosis and theories regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>causal connection between mold exposure and certain human health effects are generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d <em>Chesson, </em>399 Md. at 336, 923 A.2d 939. After the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, the circuit court concluded that the differential diagnosis performed by Dr. Shoemaker was reliable and acceptable to establish general and specific causation. On appeal, we must conduct a <em>de novo </em>review and independently determine whether Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s methodologies and theories are admissible under the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>370 Md. 191, 201 n. 5, 803 A.2d 1034 (2002) (\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision regarding admissibility under <em>Frye-Reed </em>is <em>de novo </em>.... \u201d); <em>see also Clemons v.

Differential diagnosis \u201cis a scientific method that laymen would refer to as the process of elimination.\u201d <em>CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 204, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004). Stated another way, differential diagnosis \u201cis a standard scientific technique of identifying the cause of a medical problem by eliminating the likely causes until the most probable one is isolated.\u201d <em>Westberry, </em>178 F.3d at 262 (citing <em>Baker v. Daikon Shield Claimants Trust, </em>156 F.3d 248, 252-53 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In conducting his differential diagnosis, Dr. Shoemaker testified that he interviews a patient to review his or her medical history, conducts the repetitive exposure protocol, and reviews the results of blood and visual contrast sensitivity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tests. According to him, a patient\u2019s symptoms can be attributed to exposure to water damaged buildings if: (1) he or she had exposure to a water damaged building, (2) there were symptoms that were indicative of exposure, and (3) no con-founders were present. Once this occurs, Dr. Shoemaker reviews the blood and visual contrast sensitivity tests for three of the following: (1) one of fifty-four kinds of immune response genotypes known as HLA, (2) reduced levels of MSH, (3) elevated levels of MMP9, (4) deficits in visual contrast sensitivity, (5) dysregulation of ACTH and cortisol, and (6) dysregulation of ADH and osmolality. If three are present, Dr. Shoemaker indicated that the diagnosis, in essence, is verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Appellant argues that repetitive exposure, blood testing, and visual contrast sensitivity testing are not generally accepted in diagnosing and treating illnesses from exposure to mold. Instead, appellant contends that the generally accepted method,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">is to interview the patient, examine the patient, and perform allergy testing and spirometry (airway) testing. Then the doctor attempts to rule out environmental causes, other than the building in which the mold was found. He or she also attempts to rule out other illnesses or conditions that cause similar symptoms through, for example, review of prior medical treatment records. Upon completion of the evaluation of the patient through history, testing and diagnostic analysis, a diagnosis is then provided and causal relationship can be addressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reviewed the notion of general acceptance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>covery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The \u201c \u2018general acceptance\u2019 rule\u201d articulated above was adopted in <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 389, 391 A.2d 364 (1978). There, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">On occasion, the validity and reliability of a scientific technique may be so broadly and generally accepted in the scientific community that a trial court may take judicial notice of its reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">Similarly, a trial court might take judicial notice of the invalidity or unreliability of procedures widely recognized in the scientific community as bogus or experimental. However, if the reliability of a particular technique cannot be judicially noticed, it is necessary that the reliability be demonstrated before testimony based on the technique can be introduced into evidence. Although this demonstration will normally include testimony by witnesses, a court can and should also take notice of law journal articles, articles from reliable sources that appear in scientific journals, and other publications which bear on the degree of acceptance by recognized experts that a particular process has achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 380, 391 A.2d 364. (citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">At bottom, the <em>Reed </em>Court explained that \u201cbefore a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 391 A.2d 364. To be sure, \u201cif a new scientific technique\u2019s validity is in controversy in the relevant scientific community, or if it is generally regarded as an experimental technique, then expert testimony based upon its validity cannot be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Recently, the Court of Appeals in <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 971 A.2d 235 (2009), discussed the issue of general acceptance and the differential diagnosis. There, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>filed suit against the defendants, arguing that administered vaccinations, which were thimerosal-laden, caused autism and mental retardation. <em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 971 A.2d 235. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts, Dr. Geier, used a differential diagnosis to establish \u201ca genetic susceptibility thesis.... \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 614, 971 A.2d 235. In doing so, he \u201cperformed urinary porphyrin, mercury toxicity, testosterone and genetic polymorphism tests....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 971 A.2d 235. (footnotes omitted). The circuit court concluded that none of these were \u201cgenerally accepted by the medical community, including clinical geneticists and pediatricians, as appropriate tests for either the work-up of a patient with autism or to determine the underlying cause of autism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). The court then noted that Dr. Geier failed to consider unknown genetics\u2014the most important alleged cause of autism\u2014when conducting the differential diagnosis. <em>Id. </em>Based on that, the circuit court concluded that the \u201ccausation opinions on the etiology of autism cannot be based on a differential diagnosis that includes thimerosal as a potential cause of autism because the science does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 purported theory of a causal connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argued that the circuit court was incorrect in holding that Dr. Geier neglected to consider unknown genetics. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 971 A.2d 235. According to the plaintiffs, Dr. Geier considered genetics, and genetic interactions, but \u201cunknown genetics accounted] for less than 5% of autism cases, and he need not discount all possible causes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because there was significant authority suggesting that unknown genetics accounted for the majority of autism cases, the Court of Appeals held that the court did not err in concluding that unknown genetics was the most prevalent cause of autism. <em>Id. </em>at 617, 971 A.2d 235. Moreover, the Court articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">We agree that Dr. Geier did not sufficiently consider genetics in his differential diagnosis equation. This conclusion is similar to that reached in <em>[Wilson, supra, </em>370 Md. at 191, 803 A.2d 1034], in which we recognized that the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>expert, in applying the product rule, did not account for a genetic linkage between siblings, who may have died of SIDS, rather than been murdered by their father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">Based on [the circuit court\u2019s] rejection of Dr. Geier\u2019s underlying hypothesis and methodology, i.e. the identification of specific genes and differential diagnosis, we hold that [its] ultimate determination\u2014that Dr. Geier\u2019s genetic susceptibility theory is no more than hypothesis and conjecture, devoid of a generally accepted methodology to support it\u2014 should not be disturbed by us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 971 A.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">At the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Shoemaker testified that he conducts a differential diagnosis by using the repetitive exposure protocol, blood testing, and the visual contrast testing, to conclude that exposure to water damaged buildings causes certain human health effects. These underlying methodologies have been recognized in scientific publications authored by Dr. Shoemaker. <em>See </em>Ritchie C. Shoemaker, Judith M. Rash, Elliott W.

Specifically, the article highlighted the fact that \u201c[e]xposure to specific agents was not demonstrated....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Considering that, we believe Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s admission that he does not account for exposure amounts when conducting his differential diagnosis, which Dr. Cheung testified was integral to diagnosing illnesses associated with exposure, is similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>situation in <em>Blackwell </em>in which the doctor did not sufficiently consider genetics in his differential diagnosis. <em>See Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 617-18, 971 A.2d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In <em>Young v. Burton, </em>567 F.Supp.2d 121 (D.D.C.2008), the United States District Court for the District of Columbia examined the methodologies and theories of Dr. Shoemaker. However, because the Supreme Court in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), concluded that <em>Frye </em>was superseded by the Federal Rules of Evidence, the <em>Young </em>Court reviewed the methodologies and theories pursuant to <em>Daubert </em>rather than <em>Frye.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nevertheless, because Federal Rule of Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>702<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014the rule that concerns expert testimony\u2014addresses the notion of reliable principles and methods, we shall consider <em>Young </em>as it pertains to that issue. <em>See Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 604-07, 971 A.2d 235 (reviewed federal cases that use the <em>Daubert </em>standard for the issue of reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><em>Young </em>involved a review of whether Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s diagnosis and theories relating to general and specific causation were \u201csufficiently grounded in scientifically valid principles and methods----\u201d <em>See Young, </em>567 F.Supp.2d at 122. Most relevant to this case, the <em>Young </em>Court reviewed \u201cwhether it was generally accepted in the scientific community that exposure to a water[ ]damaged building causes [CBAI].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. Recognizing that there were scientific articles that suggested exposure to mold could cause upper and lower respiratory problems, the <em>Young </em>Court articulated that there was also literature that stated there was insufficient evidence to suggest that exposure to damp indoor environments caused other symptoms attributed to toxicity. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39. Based on that, the <em>Young </em>Court held that the scientific community did not agree that exposure to water damaged buildings caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the \u201cwide-ranging effects\u201d articulated by Dr. Shoemaker. <em>Id. </em>at 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Although <em>Young </em>is instructive, because it was decided under the umbrella of <em>Daubert, </em>it is necessary to review <em>Wilson, </em>370 Md. at 191, 803 A.2d 1034, a Maryland case that addressed relevant <em>Frye-Reed </em>issues, to determine whether Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s theories regarding causation are generally accepted in the scientific community. There, the defendant\u2019s wife gave birth to Brandi Jean Wilson (\u201cBrandi\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 196, 803 A.2d 1034. Brandi died not long after birth. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 803 A.2d 1034.

Today, understanding of the etiology of SIDS still is incomplete. SIDS remains a \u201cdiagnosis of exclusion,\u201d meaning that a \u201cdiagnosis of SIDS reflects the clear admission by medical professionals that an infant\u2019s death remains completely unexplained.\u201d <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Medical studies consistently have identified the following risk factors for SIDS: prone sleep position, sleeping on a soft surface, maternal smoking during pregnancy, overheating, late or no prenatal care, young maternal age, prematurity and/or low birth weight, and male sex. <em>See </em>Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS, <em>Changing Concepts of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Implications for Infant Sleeping Environment and Sleep Position, </em>105 PEDIATRICS 650 (2000). African Americans and American Indians have consistently higher rates, two to three times the national average. <em>Id. </em>Because the cause of SIDS remains unknown, none of those risk factors are of help in calculating the probability that a child will die of SIDS. Robert M. Reece, <em>Fatal Child Abuse and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Critical Diagnostic Decision, </em>91 PEDIATRICS 423 (1993).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Beyond these commonly accepted risk factors, there is little agreement as to the causes of SIDS. This is particularly true with regard to the role of genetics. Some ... argue that it is generally accepted that there is no genetic defect or condition that can be tied to SIDS. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cthe issue of recurrent SIDS within a family raises the possibility of genetically determined conditions.... But when SIDS occurrences among siblings of SIDS cases were compared with those among non-SIDS siblings in maternal age\u2014and birth rank matched\u2014control families, there was no statistically significant difference in SIDS rates.... Thus, the notion that having a SIDS baby makes having another more likely was dispelled.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">In contrast, a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association presents a study suggesting that SIDS may result from a genetic condition. <em>See </em>Michael J.

The report noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cSeveral studies that have evaluated SIDS among siblings have found that having a sibling who died of SIDS is a significant risk factor. However, others have failed to find such a relationship or have shown that siblings of infants who have died of SIDS are at risk for all causes of infant death, not just SIDS. In addition, most of the studies reporting familial SIDS have the limitation of having been conducted during a period when case and scene investigations were not routine and assignment of the SIDS diagnosis may have been flawed. Thus, the true risk is unknown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIX\">John Kattwinkel, et al., <em>Changing Concepts of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: Implications for Infant Sleeping Environment and Sleep Position, </em>105 PEDIATRICS 650 (2000).

Dearborn, <em>Specific Molds Associated with Asthma in Water-Damaged Buildings, </em>J. of Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine, Vol. 48, No. 8, at 852-58 (2006) (noting that there was a relative moldiness index developed to predict the development of asthma in individuals exposed to water damaged buildings); Dick Menzies, Paul Comtois, Joe Pasztor, Fatima Nunes, James A. Hanley, <em>Aeroallergens and Work-Related Respiratory Symptoms Among Office Workers, </em>J. of Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology, Vol. 101, No. 1, at 38-44 (1998) (concluding that avoiding the exposure of aeroallergens could prevent a small group of office workers from having work-related respiratory tract issues). Based on these articles, it is well settled that exposure to water damaged buildings can effect respiratory issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\">. Our citation to <em>Adverse Health Effects of Indoor Molds </em>is slightly different than the original because we could only locate the reprint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. <em>Adverse Human Health Effects Associated with Molds in the Indoor Environment </em>was updated in 2011. Nothing noteworthy was changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. The authors of <em>The Medical Effects of Mold Exposure </em>recognized the Institute of Medicine\u2019s conclusions concerning mycotoxins. <em>See </em>Robert K. Bush, Jay M. Portnoy, Andrew Saxon, Abba I. Terr, and Robert A. Wood, <em>The Medical Effects of Mold Exposure, </em>J. of Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology, Vol. 117, No. 2, at 329 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">. Interestingly, Dr. Shoemaker acknowledged that there were \u201cnaysayers\u201d who disagreed with his theory. However, he merely criticized these pieces on collateral issues. Dr. Shoemaker questioned <em>Adverse Human Health Effects Associated -with Molds in the Indoor Environment </em>because of legislative activities associated with the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, and <em>The Medical Effects of Mold Exposure </em>because of a purported conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\">. At the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, the parties discussed whether the circuit court should consider whether Dr. Shoemaker's theories and methodologies were generally accepted at the present time, or when the <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing was supposed to have been held. Although it is an interesting issue, because Dr. Shoemaker\u2019s theories have never been generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, we need not address the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
