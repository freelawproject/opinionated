Jeffrey Schwartz, M.D., and vicarious liability against appellant, H. Jeffrey Schwartz, M.D., P.A. Prior to trial, Johnson filed a motion in limine to bar the introduction of informed consent evidence, which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted, thus excluding any evidence or mention of informed consent. The case proceeded to a five-day jury trial. During the trial, appellants objected to the testimony of Johnson\u2019s expert witness, arguing that the expert presented new opinions not previously disclosed in discovery. The trial court overruled the objection and then allowed the testimony as rebuttal evidence in response to appellants\u2019 defense theory. Appellants also made a motion to strike a juror for bias and then another motion to strike the same juror for juror misconduct; the trial court denied both motions. At the end of the trial, the jury found that Dr. Schwartz\u2019s negligence caused Johnson\u2019s injuries and awarded Johnson past medical expenses in the amount of $23,791.19 and non-economic damages in the amount of $650,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On appeal, appellants present three questions for review by this Court, which we have rephrased:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">1. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion by excluding evidence that appellants advised Johnson of the risks and complications of a colonoscopy, which evidence was offered by appellants in support of its defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>assumption of the risk and of compliance with the standard of care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by refusing to strike a juror for alleged bias and misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in allowing Johnson\u2019s expert witness to present an expert medical opinion as rebuttal evidence that had not been disclosed in discovery?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">For the reasons set forth herein, we shall answer questions 1, 2, and 3 in the negative and thus shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">On September 12, 2008, Johnson filed a complaint against appellants, claiming that Dr. Schwartz was negligent by \u201cfailing to properly perform the elective outpatient colonoscopy to ensure that [ ] Johnson\u2019s colon was not perforated [and] failing to employ an appropriate and careful technique.\u201d Johnson alleged that, as a result of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s negligence, he \u201csuffered and continues to suffer severe conscious pain and suffering, has required multiple medical treatments and surgeries to correct this condition, has ongoing symptoms of Short Bowel Syndrome which are permanent, and has otherwise been injured and damaged.\u201d Johnson also claimed that H. Jeffrey Schwartz, P.A., was vicariously liable for Dr. Schwartz\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">On October 16, 2009, Johnson filed a \u201cMotion in Limine to Bar Introduction of Informed Consent Form or Mention of Doctrine of Informed Consent by Defendant.\u201d Johnson argued that, because he had not pled a claim of lack of informed consent, \u201cany testimony or documentary evidence pertaining to that issue would be legally irrelevant, and could only serve to confuse the jury on the relevant issue of [appellants\u2019] medical and surgical negligence.\u201d Appellants responded that evidence of informed consent was relevant to their affirmative defense of assumption of the risk, and thus \u201c[a]t a minimum the jury should not be prevented of considering evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>supporting such a defense.\u201d On November 2, 2009, the trial court granted Johnson\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">A five-day jury trial was held from November 2, 2009 through November 6, 2009. Evidence was presented through the testimony of Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Richard Dwoskin, Johnson\u2019s expert in internal medicine and gastroenterology, Johnson, Dr. Kenneth Maxwell Brown, appellants\u2019 internal medicine expert, and Dr. David Kafonek, appellants\u2019 gastroenterology expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On the first day of trial, appellants\u2019 counsel explained during his opening statement that \u201cpart of the dispute is, did [the injury] happen when the tip was going in and cut a hole on the way in or cut a hole on the way out with the tip or did it happen a different way; a way called bowing.\u201d Counsel set forth appellants\u2019 theory of the case, namely that Dr. Schwartz performed the colonoscopy \u201ccorrectly\u201d and that the \u201ctear or perforation resulted from a complication or risk called bowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">On the second day of trial, Dr. Dwoskin testified that, to a reasonable medical probability, he believed that Dr. Schwartz \u201cdeparted from standards of care in the manner in which he performed th[e] colonoscopy on [ ] Johnson.\u201d Specifically, Dr. Dwoskin stated that the injury to the colon was caused by \u201cmechanical damage with the instrument itself\u2019 namely, \u201cthe tip of the colonoscope against the wall of the colon.\u201d Later, Johnson\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Dwoskin: \u201c[A]ssume it was a bowing injury [and not a tip injury]. If it were a bowing injury would that mean there was no negligence on the part of Dr. Schwartz?\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel objected, arguing (1) that, when \u201cthe doctor was deposed in this case[,] [he] offered no opinions about whether a bowing injury would or would not be a breach of the standard of care,\u201d and (2) that Johnson\u2019s counsel had the responsibility to supplement Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s expert opinion with his opinion regarding bowing injuries, so that appellants would have had the opportunity to question him about such opinion prior to trial. Johnson\u2019s counsel responded that Johnson was not obligated to supplement Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Dwoskin\u2019s expert opinion, because appellants had not asked for Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion on a bowing injury in an interrogatory or at deposition, and instead, had questioned Dr. Dwoskin about his opinion, which related solely to a tip injury. Johnson\u2019s counsel further argued that, regardless, \u201cthis [wa]s not a new opinion\u201d of Dr. Dwoskin, because he \u201cstill doesn\u2019t believe this [wa]s a bowing injury,\u201d and that \u201cthis [wa]s really rebuttal testimony,\u201d because Dr. Dwoskin would not be available for rebuttal \u201cafter [appellants\u2019] experts testify to say this bowing nonsense is just that.\u201d The trial court agreed with Johnson\u2019s counsel, overruled appellants\u2019 objection, and allowed Johnson\u2019s counsel to \u201cask it essentially as rebuttal testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">That same day, during Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s cross-examination and before the presentation of appellants\u2019 case, Alternate Juror Number 2 (\u201cAlternate Juror 2\u201d) passed a note to the court, which stated that Alternate Juror 2 heard Juror Number 4 (\u201cJuror 4\u201d) say: \u201cI know we shouldn\u2019t discuss it, but I\u2019m ready to finish this.\u201d When the court questioned Alternate Juror 2 about the note, Alternate Juror 2 stated that he also heard Juror 4 also say: \u201cHe cut him, he should get paid.\u201d Juror 4 denied having come to any conclusive opinions about the case and denied having told anyone any of his opinions about the case. Appellants\u2019 counsel moved to strike Juror 4. The court then questioned the remaining jurors; two jurors heard a juror either comment that the trial was going to take three or four days or asked why the trial was taking three or four days, but each juror stated that they were not influenced by the comment or question; the remaining jurors stated that they had not heard any such comment or question and that they had not formed any opinions about the case. Subsequently, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion to strike Juror 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On the fourth day of trial, during the direct examination of Dr. Kafonek, Juror 4 requested a break. At this point, appellants\u2019 counsel requested to approach the bench and expressed his concern that Juror 4 was \u201cobserved on multiple occasions\u201d to be \u201cnodding and his eyes looking like he\u2019s getting sleepy and ready to fall asleep.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>asked that everyone \u201cwatch that as well,\u201d but did not ask for any further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">During the cross examination of Dr. Kafonek, appellants\u2019 counsel again asked to approach the bench. Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that Juror 4 had fallen asleep for the fifth time that day, had to ask for a recess, and had been \u201clate almost everyday.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel stated that he did not want a mistrial, but that he thought Juror 4 needed to be \u201creplaced\u201d and requested that Juror 4 be \u201cexcused.\u201d The court denied the request, explaining that the court had observed that Juror 4 had been \u201cparticularly attentive],\u201d \u201cvery keen as to what\u2019s going on,\u201d and \u201cd[id]rit look anymore drowsy than anyone else looks and anymore alert than anyone else looks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As previously stated, at the conclusion of trial, the jury found that Dr. Schwartz was negligent and that his negligence was the cause of Johnson\u2019s injuries. The jury awarded damages to Johnson in the amount of $23,791.19 for past medical expenses and in the amount of $650,000.00 for non-economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On November 13, 2009, appellants filed a motion for new trial, which the court denied in an order entered on January 13, 2010. On January 14, 2010, appellants filed a notice of appeal to this Court. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">MOTION IN LIMINE REGARDING INFORMED CONSENT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">On October 16, 2009, Johnson filed a \u201cMotion in Limine to Bar Introduction of Informed Consent Form or Mention of Doctrine of Informed Consent by Defendant.\u201d Johnson argued that, because he had not \u201casserted a cause of action claiming violation of informed consent,\u201d the informed consent form was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d He further contended that \u201cany mention by [appellants] of this doctrine should be prohibited.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Johnson asserted that appellants \u201cmay seek to introduce the standard preoperative consent form signed by [ ] Johnson [ ] and may also attempt to introduce evidence that [Johnson] was otherwise warned of the possibility of colonoscopy complications,\u201d in \u201chope [of] escaping] the consequences of [Dr. Schwartz\u2019s] surgical negligence by persuading the jury that [ ] Johnson somehow assumed the risk that the operation would result in a perforation of his colon.\u201d Johnson concluded that \u201cany testimony or documentary evidence pertaining to that issue would be legally irrelevant, and could only serve to confuse the jury on the relevant issue of [appellants\u2019] medical and surgical negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">On October 27, 2009, appellants filed an opposition to Johnson\u2019s motion. Appellants responded that the failure to allege a cause of action for violation of informed consent was \u201cirrelevant to the introduction of evidence regarding the consent by [Johnson] to the surgery at issue.\u201d Appellants contended that their \u201centire defense is premised on the contention that bowel perforation is an accepted risk or complication of colonoscopy.\u201d Appellants further argued that the evidence of informed consent is relevant to their affirmative defense that Johnson assumed the risk, and thus \u201c[a]t a minimum the jury should not be prevented of considering evidence supporting such a defense.\u201d Because, according to appellants, \u201c[a]ll of the experts in this case ... agree that perforation is a known risk of even the most carefully performed colonoscopy,\u201d and because \u201cthese risks were clearly explained to [Johnson], a reasonable jury could conclude that he accepted the risk of the perforation for the benefit of knowing whether he had bowel cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On November 2, 2009, prior to the beginning of trial, the court held a hearing on Johnson\u2019s motion in limine. Johnson argued that \u201c[i]nformed consent is not a defense to negligence.\u201d Johnson asserted that, although Maryland \u201chas not spoken to this issue,\u201d his research indicated that of all the \u201cother states that have addressed this have held that informed consent information cannot be presented in a negligence case.\u201d He further contended that he was \u201cunable to find any appellate opinion where the assumption of the risk defense was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>upheld in a medical malpractice case.\u201d According to Johnson, if the court were to allow an assumption of the risk defense to be asserted in the instant case, it would be \u201ccontrary to the medical malpractice law of [ ] Maryland\u201d and \u201crelieve[ appellants] of any responsibility for the consequences of [Dr. Schwartz\u2019s] conduct[;] [i]n other words, if Johnson has assumed the risk, whether [Dr. Schwartz wa]s negligent makes no difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Appellants responded that Johnson was essentially arguing that \u201cin Maryland, assumption of the risk is no longer a defense available in a negligence case involving a physician professional malpractice.\u201d Appellants pointed to <em>Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991), <em>in </em>support of the proposition that, although it may be rare, \u201cthere may be cases where assumption of the risk in a medical malpractice case is, in fact, an issue.\u201d According to appellants, a screening colonoscopy case is \u201cexactly the kind of case where assumption of the risk\u201d should be permitted as a defense in a medical malpractice case, because a screening colonoscopy is a test that \u201cyou can decline\u201d and decide not to accept after hearing the potential risks. Appellants explained that they were not contending that \u201cJohnson consented to negligence\u201d and suggested that the court could instruct the jury that Johnson \u201cdid not accept the risk of negligence being performed on him. He accepted the risk of a perforation occurring in a certain number of these cases absent negligence as every expert has testified to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In response, Johnson proposed that, to avoid confusing the jury and \u201crun[ning] the risk of the jury using information improperly,\u201d the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">let [appellants\u2019] counsel make exactly the argument he said he intends to make which is that these [perforations] happen in so many cases and this was one of these unavoidable cases. Let [Johnson] argue that this was due to negligent technique, not one of those unavoidable cases and Iea[ve] the informed consent issue out entirely, which all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>these courts that have considered it have found to be the appropriate avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The trial court determined that assumption of risk would not be an available defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">[I]t appears that the assumption of risk functions as a complete bar to recovery because, it is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if something occurs. And that\u2019s the problem that I\u2019ve had, [appellants\u2019 counsel], with regard to the consideration of the issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">The court finds that in this case even with the deposition testimony that these perforations occur absent medical negligence, to allow [appellants] to put forth the defense of assumption of risk as an abandonment of the right to complain about whatever occurred to [Johnson], I\u2019ll have to side with [Johnson] in that regard. [Appellants] will be able to argue that which was just argued before the court with regard to the motion in limine in this case. But the motion in limine is granted in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">(Quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Appellants then asked the trial court to reconsider its decision, because, even if the defense of assumption of risk was not permitted, appellants should be permitted to \u201cput in valid evidence of discussions that happened in advance that corroborate the center of what [Dr. Schwartz] says why he didn\u2019t do something wrong.\u201d Appellants argued that such evidence was relevant to the case \u201cwhen it\u2019s in the records, it\u2019s part of the process that went on and it is really the heart of the [d]efense that Dr. Schwartz and his experts are going to offer ... it\u2019s offered to corroborate the essence of the [defense.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">After a brief recess, the court ruled, in pertinent part: Knowledge by the jury of informed consent does not help [Johnson] prove negligence nor does it help [Dr. Schwartz] show he was not negligent. The admission of evidence concerning a Plaintiffs consent could only serve to confuse a jury because the jury could conclude contrary to the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and evidence that consent to the surgery was ta[nt]amount to consent to the injury which resulted from the surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">The jury could conclude waiver in this case and that would be plainly wrong. The issue of informed consent has become irrelevant. Again, the motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">(Quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Appellants argue on appeal that they were \u201cunjustifiably prevented from presenting their primary defense,\u201d because they were unable to present evidence of informed consent. Specifically, appellants contend, as they did before the trial court, that \u201c[i]n defense of a negligence action, a defendant may assert that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury, thereby barring recovery completely.\u201d Appellants claim that under Maryland law, \u201cassumption of the risk is a permissible defense in medical negligence actions.\u201d Appellants state that, had they been able to introduce such evidence, they would have shown that Dr. Schwartz provided Johnson with \u201ca comprehensive explanation of the alternatives, risks and benefits of undergoing the proposed procedure,\u201d including \u201cinforming [] Johnson of the risk of bowel perforation.\u201d Thus, according to appellants, \u201c[ajfter having been duly informed, [ ] Johnson knowingly accepted the risk of perforation despite the proper performance of the procedure.\u201d Moreover, appellants contend that, although assumption of the risk may not be appropriate for a case involving life-saving treatment, a colonoscopy is a screening procedure, which Johnson \u201cabsolutely could have simply declined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Appellants also argue, as they did before, that evidence of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s disclosure of the risk of bowel perforation to Johnson was part of the proper medical and surgical performance of a colonoscopy and thus was relevant to the standard of care. Appellants point to the deposition testimony of Johnson\u2019s expert \u201cthat physicians are required by applicable medical standards to warn their patient[s] prior to colonoscopy of known risks, such as perforation.\u201d Appellants conclude that \u201cthe jury should have been allowed to hear evidence of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>[Johnson\u2019s] own expert admitted, at least in one report, that Dr. Schwartz provided competent care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Johnson responds that \u201cassumption of the risk is almost never available as an affirmative defense\u201d in a medical malpractice negligence action. He explains that \u201c[a] patient who consents to a procedure with knowledge of an unavoidable risk of complication does not waive the right to complain of physician negligence that causes that complication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Johnson also argues that, because the concepts of medical negligence and lack of informed consent are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d and his claims are based on appellants\u2019 \u201cactive negligence,\u201d the doctrine of informed consent is not at issue in the instant case Thus, according to Johnson, evidence of informed consent is \u201cboth irrelevant and unduly prejudicial in medical malpractice cases without claims of lack of informed consent.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Finally, Johnson argues that appellants were \u201cfully permitted\u201d to and did introduce expert testimony that he \u201csuffered a known complication resulting from appropriate, non-negligent care.\u201d Johnson concludes that \u201c[t]he grant of the Motion in Limine in no way limited Appellants\u2019 ability to present evidence that [ ] Johnson\u2019s perforation was a non-negligent complication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Assumption of the Risk</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u201c[T]o establish the defense of assumption of risk, the defendant must show that the plaintiff: (1) had knowledge of the risk of the danger; (2) appreciated that risk; and (3) voluntarily confronted the risk of danger.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship v. Martin, </em>348 Md. 84, 90-91, 702 A.2d 730 (1997). The doctrine of assumption of risk arises from \u201can intentional and voluntary exposure to a known danger and, therefore, consent on the part of the plaintiff to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward [him] and to take [his] chances from harm from a particular risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 702 A.2d 730 (quotations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>and citation omitted). In other words, assumption of risk means voluntarily \u201cincurring that of an accident which may not occur, and which the person assuming the risk may be careful to avoid after starting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). Whether the plaintiff \u201cvoluntarily exposed\u201d himself to a known risk, \u201cthere must be some manifestation of consent to relieve the defendant of the obligation of reasonable conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 702 A.2d 730 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Maryland recognizes assumption of risk as an affirmative defense. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-323(g). If the defendant establishes assumption of risk by the plaintiff, it \u201cfunctions as a complete bar to recovery because it is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if an accident occurs.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 91, 702 A.2d 730 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In Maryland, assumption of risk may be a defense in a medical malpractice case, but as the Court of Appeals recognized in <em>Newell, </em>it is a \u201crare situation\u201d where assumption of risk is an issue. 323 Md. at 730, 594 A.2d 1152 (quotations and citation omitted). We have not found any Maryland authority, and the parties have not cited to any such authority, that applies an assumption of risk defense in a medical malpractice ease such as the instant one. Therefore, we shall resolve this issue by reference to relevant cases from our sister jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">When Assumption of Risk Defense is Permitted</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">A review of cases from our sister jurisdictions indicates that assumption of risk has been recognized as a defense in medical malpractice cases in certain discrete factual circumstances:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(1) where the patient refused treatment suggested by a physician; and (2) where the patient elects to follow unconventional medical treatment. Two cases, <em>King v. Clark, </em>709 N.E.2d 1043 (Ind.Ct.App.1999) and <em>Boyle v. Revici, </em>961 F.2d 1060 (2d Cir.1992), which appellants cite to support their position, specifically address these two situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>Patient\u2019s Refusal of Treatment Suggested by Physician</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In <em>King, </em>the patient, appellant, filed a complaint against her physician, appellee, asserting that he \u201cfailed to timely diagnose and treat [her] breast cancer.\u201d 709 N.E.2d at 1045. At the conclusion of all of the evidence at a jury trial, the appellant moved for judgment with respect to the issues of contributory negligence and incurred risk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1046. The trial court denied her motion, gave instructions with regard to contributory negligence and incurred risk, and entered judgment upon the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the appellee. <em>Id. </em>In her appeal, the appellant challenged the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding contributory negligence and incurred risk. <em>Id. </em>The Indiana Court of Appeals upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding contributory negligence and incurred risk. <em>Id. </em>at 1047-48. With regards to incurred risk, the Court stated that \u201ca patient\u2019s ... incurred risk operates as a complete defense to medical negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046. The Court specifically determined that the evidence most favorable to the verdict supported a finding of contributory negligence or incurred risk, because the appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">waited three to four weeks before seeking a medical evaluation of the symptomatic left breast in October of 1993. Moreover, she did not report her symptoms when she contacted [the appelleej\u2019s office on October 16, 1993. [The appellant] also delayed an additional five weeks before obtaining the diagnostic testing that [the appellee] had ordered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Furthermore, the Court noted that the appellant sought treatment from another doctor who diagnosed her with cancer, advised her that this was an \u201caggressive cancer requiring immediate treatment,\u201d and referred her to an oncologist. <em>Id. </em>The oncologist recommended that the appellant \u201cimmediately begin six courses of chemotherapy, followed by a mastectomy, radiation therapy, and more chemotherapy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellant \u201celected to disregard\u201d the oncologist\u2019s recommendations and sought consultations from other physicians. <em>Id. </em>The appellant ignored the recommendation of another doctor with whom she consulted one month later, and eventually took the recommendation of a subsequent doctor and began treatment on January 31, 1994. <em>Id. </em>The appellant, however, completed only four of the six chemotherapy sessions. <em>Id. </em>From these facts, the Court of Appeals in <em>King </em>determined that \u201cthe jury could have concluded that [the appellant]\u2019s conduct may have demonstrated a disregard for the risk, and that she may have voluntarily incurred the risk of disregarding the recommendations of four physicians to undergo a mastectomy and treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"Aaj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Several other states have held assumption of the risk to be an available defense in similar factual situations. For instance, in <em>Connelly v. Warner, </em>248 A.D.2d 941, 670 N.Y.S.2d 293 (1998), the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, held that, in a case based \u201csolely on medical malpractice\u201d with no separate cause of action for lack of informed consent, the trial court did not err in failing to strike the affirmative defense of assumption of risk where the patient refused to have a naso-gastric tube inserted prior to surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In <em>Baxley v. Rosenblum, </em>303 S.C. 340, 400 S.E.2d 502 (App.1991), the Court of Appeals of South Carolina held that, based on the particular facts of the case, the trial judge had a duty to submit the defense of assumption of risk to the jury in a medical malpractice action. <em>Id. </em>at 507. The appellant was the appellee\u2019s patient <em>and </em>was a doctor himself. <em>Id. </em>at 504. The Court determined that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">[i]n this case, the evidence permitted a reasonable inference that [the patient] voluntarily chose to incur known medical risks. In 1984, [the physician] made a preoperative diagnosis of cancer of the bladder. From that time forward, if not before, [the patient] knew a person with his symptoms is at risk for cancer. He also knew a patient takes a serious health risk when he withholds information about his symptoms and their progression, and when he ignores his doctor\u2019s recommendations for treatment. We have already detailed evidence showing that [the patient] did both of these things. He knew there was a risk of complications from the May 1987 surgery that would require further treatment. In each instance, he made a voluntary decision to take the risk.... On the basis of this evidence, the trial judge had a duty to submit the defense of assumption of the risk to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>Lyons v. Walker Reg\u2019l Med.

The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARb\">The jury, in applying the court\u2019s charge on contributory negligence and assumption of risk to all of the testimony, could have concluded that [the patient], with knowledge of the seriousness of his sickness and with the appreciation that it posed significant danger, including death, failed to exercise care for his own safety, by putting himself in the way of the danger about which he was warned, including death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\n<em>Patient\u2019s Election to Follow Unconventional Medical Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In <em>Boyle, </em>a cancer patient was advised by conventional cancer specialists to undergo surgery to resect her tumor. 961 F.2d at 1062. The patient, however, decided to explore noninvasive alternatives, and consulted with the appellant about what cancer treatments he could offer her. <em>Id. </em>The appellant\u2019s treatments consisted of \u201curine monitoring, urinalyses and the ingestion of various mineral compounds that [the appellant] claim[ed] retard and reduce the size of cancerous tumors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellant testified that he had alerted the patient that \u201chis medications were not FDA approved and that he could offer no guarantees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite this admonition, the patient decided to go forward with the appellant\u2019s cancer treatment, and within a year, passed away. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">On appeal, the appellant claimed that the trial court \u201cerred by failing to instruct the jury to decide whether the decedent expressly assumed the risks that caused her injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1061-62. The Second Circuit defined \u201cexpress assumption of risk\u201d under New York law as \u201cresulting] from agreement in advance that defendant need not use reasonable care for the benefit of plaintiff and would not be liable for the consequence of conduct that would otherwise be negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). The Court recognized that it had previously held in <em>Schneider v. Revici, </em>817 F.2d 987 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Cir.1987) that \u201ca jury charge on express assumption of risk is proper in medical malpractice cases where a patient knowingly forwent conventional medical treatment and instead accepted the risks that caused the injuries.\u201d <em>Boyle, </em>961 F.2d at 1062. In other words, \u201ca patient may expressly assume the risk of malpractice and dissolve the physician\u2019s duty to treat a patient according to the medical community\u2019s accepted standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1063. The Court determined that the appellant had presented evidence that the patient had \u201cexpressly assumed a risk in opting for the unconventional cancer treatment,\u201d and reversed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">When Assumption of Risk Defense is Inapplicable in Medical Malpractice Case</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">As explained above, our review of out-of-state case law indicates that the viability of assumption of risk as a defense in medical malpractice cases, premised on negligence as opposed to informed consent, is limited to certain factual situations. The rationale for the limited viability of the assumption of risk defense in a medical malpractice action may be explained by the elements of the defense itself; for a person to \u201cassume the risk,\u201d he or she must have had knowledge of the risk of the danger, appreciated that risk, and voluntarily accepted that the risk could occur. <em>See ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 90-91, 702 A.2d 730. Therefore, in the healthcare context, for a patient to have \u201cassumed the risk\u201d of a negligent medical procedure, he or she must have voluntarily accepted the risk that the doctor would negligently complete the procedure. Such a factual scenario, however, will almost never occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In our view, for a court to hold that a patient assumed the risk of a physician acting negligently in a medical procedure is \u201ctantamount to a finding that the [physician] owed no duty\u201d to the patient. <em>Storm v. NSL Rockland Place, LLC, </em>898 A.2d 874, 880 (Del.Super.Ct.2005). We agree with the Superior Court of Delaware\u2019s rationale for this conclusion in <em>Storm:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>[T]here is virtually no scenario in which a patient can consent to allow a healthcare provider to exercise less than \u201cordinary care\u201d in the provision of services[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Even if given, a patient\u2019s consent to allow a healthcare provider to exercise less than ordinary care would be specious when considered against the strict legal, ethical and professional standards that regulate the healthcare profession. Regardless of whether the patient elects to have healthcare or requires it, the patient appropriately expects that the treatment will be rendered in accordance with the applicable standard of care. This is so regardless of how risky or dangerous the procedure or treatment modality might be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 884 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Furthermore, the very nature of actions involving medical malpractice limits the applicability of the assumption of risk defense. As courts in other jurisdictions have recognized, \u201c[t]he disparity in knowledge between [doctors] and their [patients] generally precludes recipients of [medical] services from knowing whether a [doctor]\u2019s conduct is in fact negligent.\u201d <em>Morrison v. MacNamara, </em>407 A.2d 555, 567 (D.C. 1979). <em>See also Dennis v. Jones, </em>928 A.2d 672, 677 (D.C.2007); <em>King v. Solomon, </em>323 Mass. 326, 81 N.E.2d 838, 840 (1948); <em>Los Alamos Med. Ctr. v. Coe, </em>58 N.M. 686, 275 P.2d 175, 179 (1954); <em>Kelly v. Carroll, </em>36 Wash.2d 482, 219 P.2d 79, 90 (1950). As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">[i]n the context of medical malpractice, the superior knowledge of the doctor and his expertise in medical matters and the generally limited ability of the patient to ascertain the existence of certain risks and dangers that inhere in certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>medical treatments, negates the critical elements of the defense, <em>ie., </em>knowledge and appreciation of the risk. Thus, save for exceptional circumstances, a patient cannot assume the risk of negligent treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><em>Morrison, </em>407 A.2d at 567-68. <em>See also Knight v. Jewett, </em>3 Cal.4th 296, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696, 705-06 (1992) (stating that a patient \u201cby voluntarily encountering\u201d a risk of injury does not \u201c \u2018impliedly consent\u2019 to negligently inflicted injury or \u2018impliedly agree\u2019 to excuse the surgeon from a normal duty of care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Accordingly, we hold that, except in cases involving a refusal or delay in undergoing recommended treatment or the pursuit of unconventional medical treatment, a healthcare provider cannot invoke the affirmative defense of assumption of risk in a medical malpractice claim brought by his or her patient where a breach of informed consent has not been alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Schwartz performed a routine diagnostic screening colonoscopy on Johnson. The record reflects that Johnson neither refused any treatment recommended to him by Dr. Schwartz, nor did he pursue an unconventional form of treatment. Therefore, the facts in the instant case are distinguishable from the situations in which a defense of assumption of risk have been applied in medical malpractice actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Furthermore, based on our holding and the supporting rationale above, we conclude that the defense of assumption of risk is not applicable in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Dr. Schwartz\u2019s argument that Johnson voluntarily assumed the risk of a bowel perforation confuses the defense of assumption of risk with a defense to a claim of a breach of informed consent. A bowel perforation, according to Dr. Schwartz, is a normal and usual complication associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the performance of a colonoscopy, and thus can occur <em>without </em>any negligence on the part of the physician. The defense of assumption of risk, however, assumes that the defendant, <em>ie., </em>a doctor in a malpractice case, was negligent. <em>See ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 92, 702 A.2d 730 (stating that \u201cthere must be some manifestation of consent <em>to relieve the defendant of the obligation of reasonable conduct </em>\u201d) (quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis added). Dr. Schwartz did not concede in the trial court, nor does he in this appeal, that he was negligent in the performance of the colonoscopy on Johnson. What Dr. Schwartz is arguing, in essence, is that Johnson voluntarily assumed the risk of a <em>non-negligent </em>complication of a colonoscopy. That can be raised only as a defense to a claim of a breach of informed consent, which claim was not brought by Johnson in the instant case. In other words, a patient\u2019s voluntary assumption of a risk normally associated with a particular medical treatment or procedure, after having been properly informed of the same, occurs in virtually every case and does not relieve the physician of compliance with the applicable standard of care. To hold otherwise would mean that Johnson consented to allow Dr. Schwartz to exercise less than ordinary care when Dr. Schwartz conducted the colonoscopy. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the defense of assumption of risk was not available to Dr. Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Informed Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Appellants next contend that Johnson\u2019s \u201cdecision to not assert a lack of informed consent claim ... should not have prevented [appellants] from showing that the discussion occurred,\u201d because such discussion \u201cwas part of the proper medical and surgical performance of a colonoscopy.\u201d They claim that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s ruling on [Johnson]\u2019s Motion denied the jury essential relevant information.\u201d They assert that, at a minimum, they were \u201centitled to have evidence of the informed consent submitted to the jury\u201d with \u201cappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>instruction^]\u201d on the role of informed consent \u201cas evidence of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s compliance with the standard of care.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u201cBreach of informed consent and medical malpractice claims both sound in negligence, but are <em>separate, disparate theories </em>of liability.\u201d <em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>410 Md. 1, 18, 976 A.2d 1020 (2009) (emphasis added). A patient alleging an informed consent claim complains that \u201ca healthcare provider breached a duty to obtain effective consent to a treatment or procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, 976 A.2d 1020. The doctrine of informed consent thus</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGu\">imposes on a physician, before he subjects his patient to medical treatment, the duty to explain the procedure to the patient and to warn him of any material risks or dangers inherent in or collateral to the therapy, so as to enable the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice about whether or not to undergo such treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\"><em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 439, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977). The physician\u2019s \u201cduty to disclose\u201d requires that the physician explain to the patient \u201cthe nature of the ailment, the nature of the proposed treatment, the probability of success of the contemplated therapy and its alternatives, and the risk of unfortunate consequences associated with such treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 379 A.2d 1014. Breach of informed consent must be pled as a separate count of negligence. <em>Zeller v. Greater Balt. Med. Ctr., </em>67 Md.App. 75, 83, 506 A.2d 646 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In comparison, a patient alleging medical malpractice argues that a \u201chealthcare provider breached a duty to exercise ordinary medical care and skill based upon the standard of care in the profession.\u201d <em>McQuitty, </em>410 Md. at 18, 976 A.2d 1020. In other words, medical malpractice is \u201cpredicated upon the failure to exercise requisite medical skill and, being tortious in nature, general rules of negligence usually apply in determining liability.\u201d <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 618, 865 A.2d 603 (2005) (quotations and citation omitted). Because claims of informed consent and medical malpractice are \u201cseparate, disparate theories of liability,\u201d we agree with John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>son that evidence of appellants providing informed consent to Johnson is irrelevant to Johnson\u2019s medical malpractice claim. <em>See McQuitty, </em>410 Md. at 18, 976 A.2d 1020. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by precluding the admission of evidence of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Even if evidence of informed consent was relevant, cases from our sister jurisdictions indicate that the admission of such evidence in a medical malpractice case would be prejudicial to the patient. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <em>Hayes v. Camel, </em>283 Conn. 475, 927 A.2d 880 (2007) is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In <em>Hayes, </em>the Court determined that other state courts that \u201chave considered this issue uniformly have concluded that evidence of informed consent, such as consent forms, is both irrelevant and unduly prejudicial in medical malpractice cases without claims of lack of informed consent.\u201d 927 A.2d at 888-89. As part of its rationale, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Knowledge by the trier of fact of informed consent to risk, where lack of informed consent is not an issue, does not help the plaintiff prove negligence. Nor does it help the defendant show he was not negligent. In such a case, the admission of evidence concerning a plaintiffs consent could only serve to confuse the jury because the jury could conclude, contrary to the law and the evidence, that consent to the [procedure] was tantamount to consent to the injury which resulted from that surgery. In effect, the jury could conclude that consent amounted to a waiver, which is plainly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 889 (quoting <em>Wright v. Kaye, </em>267 Va. 510, 593 S.E.2d 307, 317 (2004)). Stated differently, \u201cwhether the plaintiff patient had given informed consent to [a] procedure generally is irrelevant and \u2018carrie[s] great potential for the confusion of the jury\u2019 in an action wherein only medical malpractice is pleaded, and the information given to the plaintiff is not at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(first alteration added) (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Waller v. Aggarwal, </em>116 Ohio App.3d 355, 688 N.E.2d 274, 275 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>In the instant case, during its deliberations, the jury asked questions about what types of warnings Johnson received from Dr. Schwartz regarding the colonoscopy.

Cook, </em>338 Md. 598, 615, 659 A.2d 1313 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The rationale for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>deference is \u201cbased on the fact that in evaluating the excluded juror, the trial judge has the opportunity to question the juror and observe his or her demeanor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the trial judge is \u201cphysically on the scene, able to observe matters not usually reflected in a cold record[, and] has his finger on the pulse of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Appellants argue that the court should have replaced Juror 4. They contend that \u201c[j]uror misconduct is an absolute ground for dismissal\u201d and that juror misconduct includes sleeping, inattentiveness, and \u201c[a] juror\u2019s indication of a fixed opinion on the merits prior to submission of the case for deliberations.\u201d They assert that Juror 4\u2019s \u201cdenial of some of the accusations was unconvincing at best and varied during the course of the Court\u2019s questioning of him.\u201d They further claim that \u201c[t]he fact that other jurors confirmed that he was indeed talking about the case before [appellants] had opened their case in chief, which was a violation of the Court\u2019s instructions not to do so, combined with the evidence of him not paying attention and/or falling asleep during [appellants]\u2019 case, was ample evidence of juror misconduct warranting his dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Johnson responds that \u201c[t]here is no evidence of juror bias or misconduct that merits setting aside the jury verdict.\u201d He contends that appellants failed to demonstrate \u201cwith specificity that [J]uror [4] was sleeping or inattentive\u201d and did not make any \u201caffirmative showing of prejudice.\u201d Johnson further relies on the court\u2019s observations that Juror 4 had been \u201cparticularly attentive]----He\u2019s very keen as to what\u2019s going on....

Have you made any comments with regard to having your own opinion about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">[JUROR 4]: Oh, no, no. I don\u2019t give my opinion.

Everybody was actually....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">THE COURT: You understand the court\u2019s admonition with regard to not discussing the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-12\">[JUROR 4]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">THE COURT: Even making comments with regard to how long you think the case may take?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">[JUROR 4]: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">THE COURT: Or expressing any opinion about the case with regard to the testimony or any of the exhibits or any of the evidence or anything of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">[JUROR 4]: Yes, sir.

So, I haven\u2019t seen their witnesses, so I don\u2019t have an opinion either way yet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Appellants\u2019 counsel made a motion to strike Juror 4. The court then questioned the remaining jurors. The foreperson indicated that Alternate Juror 2 passed the note directly to the court and that she never saw the note. She recalled that one of the jurors stated that \u201c[h]e thought that [the case] was going to take four days,\u201d but did not recall him saying anything else. She stated that she did not think that Juror 4 had reached any opinion about the case. She asserted that this had not influenced her in any way that would cause her to \u201cmake up [her] mind prior to hearing all the evidence in this case\u201d and that she was able to be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Of the remaining jurors, only Juror 3 had heard a juror say, \u201cwhy is it taking three or four days\u201d; the other jurors stated that they had not heard any comments about the case from any of the jurors. All of the jurors indicated that they had not formed any opinion regarding the case. As a result, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion to strike Juror 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Appellants argue that Juror 4\u2019s \u201cdenial of some of the accusations was unconvincing at best,\u201d and that, because the other jurors \u201cconfirmed\u201d that he talked about the case prior to the presentation of appellants\u2019 case, that the trial court should have stricken Juror 4. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Appellants are required to do more than just contend that bias occurred; they must prove that the bias \u201cactually occurred\u201d and that they were prejudiced by such bias. <em>Wright, </em>24 Md.App. at 313, 330 A.2d 482. The record reflects that, upon questioning by the court, Juror 4 admitted to stating that \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be a four day thing,\u201d but denied making any comments regarding \u201chaving [his] own opinion about the case.\u201d Juror 4 further affirmed that he understood the court\u2019s instructions to not discuss the case with any of the other jurors, that he was able to \u201cadhere\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>court\u2019s instructions, and that he had not formed any opinion about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The court then questioned the other jurors, and only Alternate Juror 2, Juror 3, and the foreperson heard Juror 4 comment about why the trial was going to take four days, but were not influenced by the statement. All the remaining jurors stated that they had not heard any statement by Juror 4 and had not formed any opinion about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Appellants did not adduce any evidence to contradict these statements. In other words, appellants failed to prove that Juror 4 actually violated the trial court\u2019s instructions by making up his mind prior to the submission of the case for deliberations or by communicating his opinion of the case to the other jurors. Furthermore, appellants did not show that they were prejudiced by Juror 4\u2019s statement about the length of the trial, because only three jurors heard the statement, none of the jurors were affected by it, and none of the jurors had formed any opinion about the case as a result of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Although appellants also contend that Juror 4\u2019s denial and explanation were \u201cunconvincing\u201d as indicated above, we defer to the trial judge\u2019s determination, because the trial judge had the \u201copportunity to question [Juror 4] and observe his [] demeanor.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>338 Md. at 615, 659 A.2d 1313. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to strike Juror 4 for bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Juror Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">On November 5, 2009, the fourth day of trial, during the direct examination of Dr. Kafonek, Juror 4 requested a break. At this time, appellants\u2019 counsel asked to approach the bench and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">I just want to note for the record that before we took the break at the request of [Juror 4] that he was observed on multiple occasions\u2014four times by Dr. Schwartz\u2019s count with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>his nodding and his eyes looking like he\u2019s getting sleepy and getting ready to fall asleep. I\u2019ve seen that before, but not to the point where\u2014not today\u2014but not to the point where I\u2019ve come to the bench. I simply ask to the extent the court can watch that as well as everyone else in the courtroom that you do that. I\u2019m not asking for any relief at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">That same day, during the cross examination of Dr. Kafonek, appellants\u2019 counsel requested to approach the bench, when the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Juror number four is falling asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: He\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... I just looked over he had his head down, he had his eyes closed. When I stood up apparently he looked up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL.]: It\u2019s the fifth time today. He\u2019s had to ask for a recess. He\u2019s been late almost everyday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">THE COURT: And you\u2019re requesting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, I mean, I don\u2019t want a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Nobody wants that. But I think that Dr. Schwartz\u2014and Dr. Schwartz is the one pulling my sleeve and I got a client to represent here. So, I mean, I think I have to\u2014I think there\u2019s something physiological going on. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything\u2014 this fellow is not trying to do that, but I think he needs to be replaced and I request that he be excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ2t\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: Absolutely not. I mean, I\u2019ve participated in cases where jurors close their eyes, put their heads down, nod on occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">... This fellow has actually within our observation been one of the most attentive throughout the course of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>trial. I think he\u2019s also one who had indicated that he was diabetic and earlier in the trial had to take a break to get something to eat. I believe that was him. But throughout\u2014other than what counsel is describing today\u2014and I must say I haven\u2019t noticed it, although I do not doubt what counsel says he and his client may have observed\u2014 other than this fairly brief episode of this trial, this guy has been very attentive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">THE COURT: My observations of the juror over the course of the trial is that he\u2019s been particularly attentive] (inaudible) when a witness comes down and presents testimony right at the bar. He\u2019s very keen as to what\u2019s going on. Today, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s particularly sleepy or anything like that. I mean, he doesn\u2019t look anymore [sic] drowsy than anyone else looks and anymore [sic] alert than anyone else looks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArI\">He has given the court the\u2014he has said to the court that he suffers from diabetes and that one day we addressed that and it seemed to perk him up in some respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">I note your request to dismiss him, but I\u2019m not going to dismiss him at this time. Rest assure [sic] your client that you had made those concerns again now on the record itself and I will keep an eye on the juror throughout the course of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Appellants claim that \u201cthe evidence of [Juror 4] not paying attention and/or falling asleep during [appellants]\u2019 case\u201d warranted his dismissal. As explained above, appellants must support their claim by \u201cproving] that the misconduct actually occurred and that [appellants] w[ere] prejudiced thereby.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>24 Md.App. at 313, 330 A.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In <em>Hall v. State, </em>223 Md. 158, 177, 162 A.2d 751 (1960), the Court of Appeals addressed the issue of misconduct committed by a sleeping juror. In <em>Hall, </em>the Court reviewed the evidence presented by counsel for the party alleging juror inattentiveness; specifically, the Court considered counsel\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that \u201ccertain jurors appeared to be asleep\u201d and a newspaper reporter\u2019s statement that \u201cit appeared that one of the jurors was sleeping,\u201d but he could not say \u201cdefinitely\u201d that anyone was sleeping. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78, 162 A.2d 751. The Court weighed this evidence against statements from the three jurors involved, all of whom denied sleeping or being inattentive, and a statement from the opposing counsel that \u201che did not notice any inattentiveness on the part of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 162 A.2d 751. In determining that \u201c[tjhere [wa]s no showing that the defendant was in any way prejudiced,\u201d the Court also emphasized that \u201c[t]he length of time the juror was asleep is not shown, nor does it appear what testimony was introduced during that time, nor that it was of any importance or extent, nor whether favorable or unfavorable to the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). The Court concluded that, \u201c[w]ithout stronger evidence that the misconduct alleged actually occurred, and a showing of prejudice to the appellant, we cannot say that there are grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants\u2019 argument that Juror 4 was sleeping and inattentive is supported by the statements of Dr. Schwartz and his counsel. Weighing against their statements are (1) Johnson\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that he had not noticed any inattentiveness and that Juror 4 \u201cha[d] actually within our observation been one of the most attentive throughout the course of this trial\u201d; and (2) the trial court\u2019s own observations of Juror 4. In particular, the trial court observed that \u201cover the course of the trial ... [Juror 4 has] been particularly attentive] ... when a witness comes down and presents testimony right at the bar. He\u2019s very keen as to what\u2019s going on.\u201d The court also noted that \u201che doesn\u2019t look any more drowsy than anyone else looks and any more alert than anyone else looks.\u201d As explained above, where the trial court has the opportunity to observe the juror\u2019s demean- or, we will defer to the court\u2019s observations. <em>Cook, </em>338 Md. at 615, 659 A.2d 1313. Therefore, the evidence presented supports the conclusion that the trial court\u2019s decision not to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Juror 4 for sleepiness or inattentiveness was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Even if the evidence supported the conclusion that Juror 4 was inattentive or sleeping, appellants did not adduce sufficient evidence to show that they were prejudiced. Appellants stated that they observed Juror 4 falling asleep on the fourth day of trial, when appellants presented Dr. Kafonek for examination. There was no evidence, however, about the length of time that Juror 4 was asleep, what testimony was being introduced during that time, or whether such testimony was of any importance or favorable or unfavorable to appellants. <em>See Hall, </em>223 Md. at 178, 162 A.2d 751. Without such evidence, as in <em>Hall, </em>we cannot conclude that appellants were prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision not to strike Juror 4. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to strike Juror 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">On the first day of trial during opening statements, appellants\u2019 counsel explained that \u201cpart of the dispute is, did [the injury] happen when the tip was going in and cut a hole on the way in or cut a hole on the way out with the tip or did it happen a different way; a way called bowing.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel explained appellants\u2019 theory of the case to the jury, specifically that Dr. Schwartz \u201cperformed [the colonoscopy] correctly and that the tear or perforation resulted from a complication or risk called bowing,\u201d which appellants contended could happen without \u201cnegligence or mistake.\u201d On several occasions during his opening statement, appellants\u2019 counsel asserted that their experts would testify about what bowing is and why they believed that the injury \u201cwas that bowing complication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">During the presentation of his case-in-chief, Johnson called Dr. Dwoskin as his expert in internal medicine and gastroenterology. During direct examination, Dr. Dwoskin testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Schwartz \u201cdeparted from standards of care in the manner in which he performed this colonoscopy on[ ] Johnson\u201d when Dr. Schwartz \u201ccaused a tear in ... this portion of the colon in [ ] Johnson.\u201d He further explained that Dr. Schwartz tore Johnson\u2019s colon through \u201cmechanical damage with the [colonoscope] itself.\u201d With mechanical damage, Dr. Dwoskin indicated that there are two types of injuries that can occur, one caused by \u201cbowing\u201d of the colonoseope and one caused by the \u201ctip\u201d of the colonoseope. He testified that \u201cit\u2019s likely that the tip of the scope was bent,\u201d and it was the tip, not any bowing of the colonoseope, that caused Johnson\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">After eliciting Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion that Dr. Schwartz breached the standard of care by causing Johnson\u2019s injury with the tip of the colonoseope, Johnson\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Dwoskin about bowing injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, doctor, you talked about the possibility of a bowing injury and that the circumferential nature of this injury was inconsistent with bowing. Is that your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">[DR. DWOSKIN]: Yes. Bowing injuries, stretching injuries, looping injuries, it\u2019s the same thing, are typically along the long a[xis]. They\u2019re called longitudinal, the long a[xis].[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: But, doctor, I want you to assume for purposes of my question that this was a bowing injury of some kind. Now, I understand your testimony that the physical evidence is inconsistent with that, but assume that it was a bowing injury. If it were a bowing injury would that mean there was no negligence on the part of Dr. Schwartz?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Appellants\u2019 counsel objected and requested to approach the bench. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... [T]he doctor was deposed in this case and offered no opinions about whether a bowing injury would or would not be a breach of the standard of care____[W]e asked have you told us all your opinions about the breaches, he said, yes, it was a tip injury and that ... if it was the tip injury it violated the standard of care. And I object to him offering new opinions that we have not had an opportunity to conduct discovery on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: First of all, they didn\u2019t ask him if it was a bowing injury and if it was a bowing injury whether it was negligent. He can\u2019t answer the unasked question. The reason they didn\u2019t ask it is because the bowing theory came up for the first time in the opinions of their experts who were deposed after Dr. Dwoskin. Now, I don\u2019t know if they knew about their bowing theory when they deposed Dr. Dwoskin or not, but they never asked him about a bowing injury and if it w[as] a bowing injury whether it would be negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">THE COURT: But they did ask him what exactly [was] his opinion on all of the injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: No. What they asked was, doctor, what do you believe the negligence here is? And he said the negligence is he perforated the colon with this twisting technique and I hold that opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability. They never asked him about any alternate theory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Now they come in here with an alternate theory of bowing and he was never asked that at his deposition and that\u2019s on them, not on us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">I want him to be able to render an opinion that if bowing was the technique\u2014it was never asked of him before and not even raised until their expert\u2019s deposition. But if this were a bowing injury, would that signify negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Two points. One is he was asked, have you told us all of the opinions you hold as to any negligence of Dr. Schwartz. This gentleman has told us from his general information bank that he knows that there are bowing mechanisms of injury. So that if his opinion was that it was a tip, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon him to tell us in deposition even if I\u2019m wrong, even if it\u2019s some other mechanism, it violates the standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">... Second\u2014and we asked him, tell us all of your opinions months and months and months ago. Second point: [appellants\u2019] experts were deposed months ago.

I understand that it is your opinion that this was not a bowing injury, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">[DR. DWOSKIN]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">[JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. But if you assume for purposes of my question that this was a bowing injury, do you have an opinion that you can state to a reasonable degree of medical probability as to whether that mechanism of injury would signify negligence on the part of Dr. Schwartz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">[DR. DWOSKIN]: Yes, I do have an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">That that would also be negligent[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">Appellants argue that Johnson never disclosed Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion regarding Dr. Schwartz\u2019s negligence, assuming the injury had been caused by bowing, in any of the discovery conducted in the case, including Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s \u201cdeposition, in response to the Court\u2019s Scheduling Order which required disclosure of expert opinions[,]\u201d or in interrogatory responses. Appellants assert that, despite Johnson\u2019s failure to disclose Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s \u201cadditional opinions,\u201d the trial court permitted him to testify about this issue over appellants\u2019 objection. Appellants contend that they have been \u201cunfairly prejudiced,\u201d because the court \u201callow[ed] an expert witness to offer an entirely new, previously undisclosed, and completely prejudicial theory of liability in the middle of trial[.]\u201d They argue that this is at odds with the \u201cpurpose of discovery,\u201d which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201cto prevent a party from proceeding to trial in a confused or muddled state of mind regarding the facts and claims in dispute\u201d and \u201cto avoid ambush at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Johnson responds that \u201cthe testimony of [Dr. Dwoskin] was permissible rebuttal evidence,\u201d and not the introduction of \u201ca new theory of liability.\u201d He asserts that appellants concede that this was \u201crebuttal testimony,\u201d and, according to Johnson, such rebuttal testimony is \u201ca matter for the exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d which will not be reversed unless the ruling was \u201cboth \u2018manifestly wrong\u2019 and \u2018substantially injurious.\u2019 \u201d Johnson contends that appellants were \u201cin no way prejudiced by the brief general \u2018rebuttal\u2019 testimony of Dr. Dwoskin being offered during [Johnson\u2019s] case,\u201d and thus the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Johnson also argues that (1) Dr. Dwoskin was deposed before any of appellants\u2019 experts were disclosed or deposed; and (2) appellants\u2019 counsel never questioned Dr. Dwoskin at his deposition about their bowing theory. Johnson claims that his counsel questioned Dr. Dwoskin about the defense theory at trial after hearing appellants\u2019 counsel \u201cadvance! ] the theory\u201d in appellants\u2019 opening statement. He contends that appellants cannot argue that they were \u201cunfairly \u2018surprised\u2019 \u201d by Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s testimony when (1) \u201cthey failed to inquire at his deposition, [ (2) ] heard his testimony a day before any defense expert took the stand, and [ (3) ] they fully and fairly covered with [their] experts their areas of disagreement with Dr. Dwoskin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">This Court previously addressed the issue of rebuttal evidence in the medical malpractice context in <em>Riffey v. fonder, </em>36 Md.App. 633, 375 A.2d 1138, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 745 (1977). We defined rebuttal evidence as \u201cany competent evidence which explains, is a direct reply to or a contradiction of material evidence introduced by ... a party in a civil action\u201d during the other party\u2019s presentation of their case. <em>Id. </em>at 645-46, 375 A.2d 1138. In other words, \u201c[a'jlthough rebuttal evidence is a matter of right, for evidence to be admissible as \u2018true\u2019 rebuttal ... it must respond to new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>matter.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook 104 (Matthew Bender, 4th ed., 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Whether evidence is properly admitted as rebuttal testimony involves two different inquiries: \u201c(1) whether the proffered evidence does or does not satisfy the rebuttal ... standard; and (2) regardless of the answer to this question, whether the proffered evidence should be admitted or excluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Holmes v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 518, 525 n. 1, 705 A.2d 118 (1998), this Court addressed the standard for reviewing the admission of rebuttal evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Because it is not always easy to draw the line between what is rebutting evidence and what is evidence properly adducible in chief, it is often stated that the admissibility of rebuttal testimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. The trial judge does, for example, have discretion to vary the order of proof ... The trial judge has discretion to exclude rebuttal ... No trial judge, however, has discretion to make an erroneous finding of fact. When the question is whether proffered evidence does or does not explain, contradict, and/or reply to a new matter introduced by the other side, the trial judge\u2019s finding of fact will be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous. When the question is whether rebuttal ... evidence was erroneously admitted or excluded for some other reason, the trial judge\u2019s ruling will be affirmed unless it was manifestly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">(Quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellants introduced in then-opening statement to the jury their theory that Dr. Schwartz \u201cperformed [the colonoscopy] correctly and that the tear or perforation resulted from a complication or risk called bowing.\u201d Appellants also told the jury that their theory would be supported by their experts\u2019 testimony. In contrast, Dr. DwosMn testified, in Johnson\u2019s case in chief, that Dr. Schwartz caused Johnson\u2019s injury with the tip of the colonoscope against the wall of the colon. Johnson\u2019s counsel then posed a hypothetical to Dr. Dwoskin, asking him to \u201cassume for the purposes of [the] question that this was a bowing injury, do you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>have an opinion that you can state to a reasonable degree of medical probability as to whether that mechanism or injury would signify negligence on the part of Dr. Schwartz?\u201d Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s testimony in response to Johnson\u2019s hypothetical thus did not go to Johnson\u2019s own theory of causation, and, instead, was rebuttal evidence that \u201cexplain[ed] [and] [wa]s a direct reply to\u201d appellants\u2019 theory of causation. <em>See Riffey, </em>36 Md.App. at 645, 375 A.2d 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Although rebuttal evidence is typically introduced after the defendant\u2019s case is completed, <em>see </em>Murphy, Maryland Evidence Handbook at 104, the trial judge has the discretion to vary the order of proof. <em>See Sippio v. State, </em>350 Md. 633, 665, 714 A.2d 864 (1998). <em>See also </em>Md. Rules 5-611(a). In the instant case, Dr. Dwoskin had to return to Florida after his testimony, and thus was unavailable to testify in Johnson\u2019s rebuttal case. Under the circumstances, the trial judge permissibly accepted rebuttal evidence prior to the presentation of appellants\u2019 evidence. <em>See Sippio, </em>350 Md. at 665, 714 A.2d 864. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion as to appellants\u2019 theory of the case as rebuttal testimony in Johnson\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The focus of appellants\u2019 argument, however, is that they were \u201cunfairly prejudiced\u201d by the admission of Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s testimony regarding bowing, because this \u201centirely new, previously undisclosed, and completely prejudicial theory of liability\u201d was unknown to them prior to trial, and therefore \u201c[t]his trial by surprise put the[m] at an insurmountable disadvantage.\u201d Appellants support this argument by claiming that Johnson was required to, but never did, supplement Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s expert opinions with his opinions regarding bowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Maryland Rule 2-402(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">A party by interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person, other than a party, whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial; to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify; to state the substance of the findings and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the grounds for each opinion; and to produce any written report made by the expert concerning those findings and opinions. A party also may take the deposition of the expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">If under Rule 2-402(g), appellants had asked Johnson through interrogatories to \u201cstate the substance of the findings and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion,\u201d then Johnson would have been required to supplement his interrogatory responses \u201cpromptly\u201d with any expert opinion of Dr. Dwoskin that was obtained prior to trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-401(e). Johnson is correct, however, that he did not have the responsibility to supplement a <em>deposition; </em>his duty was to supplement any other response to \u201ca request or order for discovery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">From the record before the trial court, it is unclear whether appellants actually propounded such an interrogatory on Johnson. Although appellants represented that they propounded interrogatories on Johnson, they did not direct the trial court to any interrogatory propounded on Johnson regarding the disclosure of expert opinions. Appellants argued to the trial court that Johnson found out about appellants\u2019 causation theory at their experts\u2019 depositions and, in anticipation of presenting Dr. Dwoskin to testify about bowing at trial, Johnson should have supplemented his interrogatory answer prior to trial with Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s expert opinion on bowing. Johnson argued that Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion was not presented in an interrogatory answer and, instead, was presented at deposition; thus he argued that he did not have to supplement Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">As previously indicated, the trial court was not shown any of the interrogatories propounded by appellants on Johnson. Had the trial court been able to review those interrogatories, it could have determined whether appellants had asked Johnson for Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s expert opinions and grounds for such opinions, and, if so, under Rule 2-401(e), Johnson would have been required to supplement Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinions. Based on the arguments presented to the trial court, appellants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>asked about Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinions at <em>deposition, </em>and not through a discovery method that would require supplementation under Rule 2-401(e). Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to find a discovery violation by Johnson.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Moreover, appellants did have the opportunity to question Dr. Dwoskin about his opinions regarding bowing in his deposition, but failed to do so. The bowing theory was, in fact, appellants\u2019 theory of causation. Appellants presumably knew of their own theory of causation at the time of Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s deposition and could have asked Dr. Dwoskin about the bowing theory at that point. Also, because Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion on bowing was presented in Johnson\u2019s case in chief, instead of in Johnson\u2019s rebuttal case, appellants were able to have their experts comment on Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s bowing opinion in the defense case. Therefore, even if Johnson should have disclosed Dr. Dwoskin\u2019s opinion on the bowing theory of causation prior to trial, the trial court\u2019s failure to exclude such opinion did not prejudice appellants and thus was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\">.

Because of a specific constitutional provision regarding the defense of assumption of risk, Arizona sits in a unique position with how assumption of risk may be applied in a medical malpractice case. No such provision exists in Maryland law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">.
