Following Mrs. Dixon\u2019s death from pleural mesothelioma, Mr. Dixon pursued her claims as representative of her estate, and the Dixons\u2019 four adult daughters joined their father as plaintiffs, who are now appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Prior to trial, appellants settled with GP, Honeywell, and UCC, but Ford\u2019s cross-claims against those defendants remained for adjudication as potential joint tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Ford moved <em>in limine </em>for a hearing to challenge appellants\u2019 proffered expert on the issue of causation, as well as to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony. Trial commenced on April 15, 2010, and the court denied Ford\u2019s motions, along with certain objections Ford raised during the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">On April 27, 2010, the jury returned a verdict awarding appellants a total of $15,000,000 in compensatory damages, which the court reduced to $6,065,000 in accordance with the non-economic damages cap of Maryland Code (2006), \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d). Ford subsequently filed post-trial motions requesting a new trial and revisions or judgments notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) on both its own cross-claims and appellants\u2019 direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>claims. The court denied Ford\u2019s motions for new trial and JNOY, but ruled that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent and revised the judgments against Ford and GP to adjust for the latter\u2019s contribution as a joint tortfeasor. The court entered its revised judgment in favor of appellants in the collective amount of $3,032,500.00, from which both appellants and Ford filed timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The parties\u2019 briefs present a total of eight questions between them,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but our opinion need only address the first of Ford\u2019s questions presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">I. Did the trial court err when it denied Ford\u2019s motion to exclude appellants\u2019 expert epidemiological opinion on \u201csubstantial contributing factor causation\u201d where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>expert\u2019s testimony did not quantify the probability of causation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer yes and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Joan Dixon died of pleural mesothelioma on February 28, 2009, having initiated a suit against Ford and various other entities involved in the asbestos market, including GP, Honeywell, and UCC. The complaint alleged that Mr. and Mrs. Dixon \u201cparticipated in home improvement and maintenance projects throughout the 1960s and 1970s during with [sic] they worked with and around Defendants\u2019 asbestos products,\u201d and that \u201c[throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Mrs. Dixon was exposed to asbestos dust created by Mr. Dixon\u2019s work with and around asbestos-containing automobiles and asbestos-containing replacement parts for those automobiles including ... brakes[.]\u201d Appellants further alleged that Mrs. Dixon\u2019s \u201cexposure to Defendants\u2019 asbestos containing products and asbestos containing vehicles and the inhalation of asbestos fibers from the products and vehicles caused her disease and eventual death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In response to interrogatories, appellants stated that they \u201cbelieve Joan Dixon may have been exposed to asbestos through her and her husbands\u2019 use of and exposure to various building materials, including but not limited to Georgia Pacific pre-mixed drywall joint compound which, upon information and belief, contained Union Carbide Corporation\u2019s Calidria brand asbestos.\u201d Deposition testimony established that Mrs. Dixon personally sanded joint compound and cleaned up after at least five home construction and renovation projects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Appellants settled with GP, Honeywell, and UCC prior to trial. Their settlement agreements did not determine whether the defendants were joint tortfeasors, and so they remained in the case nominally as Ford\u2019s cross-defendants, unrepresented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Appellants sought to introduce Dr. Laura Welch as an expert in asbestos epidemiology and proffered her opinion on causation. Ford did not dispute that Dr. Welch was qualified to render expert testimony on the subject of epidemiology, but instead objected to the methods and substance of her causation opinion. The court denied Ford\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Dr. Welch testified on direct \u201cthat mesothelioma in particular is a dose-response disease. Every increasing [asbestos] dose increases the likelihood of getting it, [and] additional doses decrease the time it takes to get the disease as exposure goes up.\u201d When asked to assume that Mrs. Dixon was exposed to asbestos in various other ways, Dr. Welch stated that in her opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u201cevery exposure to asbestos is a substantial contributing cause and so brake exposure would be a substantial cause even if [Mrs. Dixon] had other exposures.\u201d On cross-examination, Dr. Welch further explained her opinion that every exposure to asbestos is a \u201csubstantial contributing cause\u201d of mesothelioma:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">Q. Now, with regard to your opinions about asbestos and causation which you have given this jury, it\u2019s your opinion, Doctor, that each and every exposure contributes to the development of mesothelioma no matter where it comes from in asbestos exposure; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">A. Right. When somebody has got mesothelioma, all the exposures they have were contributing factors, that\u2019s my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">Q. And it doesn\u2019t matter to you whether the exposure is on a frequent basis, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">A. No. I mean, an exposure can be like one event. On a frequent basis, you would be talking about a task or something like that. But I think each one of those discrete exposures is a contributing factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">Q. So it can be one event in order to be, in your view, a substantial contributing cause to the development of mesothelioma?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">A. Correct. It could be one day of work, for example, or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">Q. So it doesn\u2019t have to be a regular course of work? It doesn\u2019t have to be something they do occupationally for a period of time; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">A. No, not necessarily. Because we are talking about somebody who has already got the disease. And I think everyone of the exposures that go into making their sum total of exposure to asbestos is a contributing factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Against this general causal backdrop, Dr. Welch explained the basis of her opinion that Mrs. Dixon\u2019s exposure to automobile brake dust was a substantial contributing factor of Mrs. Dixon\u2019s disease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>The easiest way to do that is to turn back to my paper we kept discussing, the Amicus brief that walks through the information that supports a conclusion that brake mechanics are at an increased risk for mesothelioma. So we have a lot of data that the kind of asbestos that\u2019s in brakes, chrysotile, causes mesothelioma. We have a lot of information that brief or low-level exposure to asbestos causes mesothelioma. And I think [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] had a number of those papers up there on the slides we put together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">And one other part of it is that, as you and I just talked about, asbestos is, in my opinion, the only recognized cause of mesothelioma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">And we know that brake mechanics have exposure to asbestos as has been demonstrated in industrial hygiene studies. There [are] lots of studies that show that exposure occurs. It occurs to [sic] substances known to cause mesothelioma, that people working with friction products get enough asbestos exposure to cause other nonmalignant diseases. And to me, all those studies allow me to say exposure to asbestos by working with brakes can be a substantial contributing cause of mesothelioma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Dr. Welch admitted that no epidemiological studies had specifically investigated the risk of mesothelioma among wives of brake mechanics. However, Dr. Welch explained that such a study would be practically impossible; if the rate of disease in a group of workers was two-and-a-half cases per hundred thousand\u2014as in the case of mesothelioma\u2014such a study would require thirty-thousand subjects and twenty years to reach a statistically significant conclusion. Instead, Dr. Welch testified that she formed her opinion from the generally accepted fact that asbestos dust left on a worker\u2019s clothing can be transmitted to family members in the home environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In its defense, Ford called epidemiologist and risk assessment expert Herman J. Gibb, Ph.D., who testified that none of eighteen epidemiological studies in evidence showed \u201cany evidence that vehicle mechanics have an increased risk of mesothelioma.\u201d By contrast, Dr. Gibb testified that epidemiological studies showed that the risk of mesothelioma among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>construction workers exposed to asbestos dust is up to seven times greater than the risk of mesothelioma among the general population. Dr. Gibb admitted on cross-examination that only three of the studies that Ford relied upon categorically examined \u201cbrake mechanics,\u201d as opposed to \u201cauto workers\u201d or generic \u201cmechanics.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">After the close of evidence, the jury deliberated and returned a verdict against Ford, awarding $5,000,000 to Mrs. Dixon\u2019s estate, $4,000,000 to Bernard Dixon, and $1,500,000 to each of the Dixons\u2019 four daughters, for a total of $15,000,000. After applying the non-economic damages cap of CJ \u00a7 11-108, the court entered judgment awarding $5,000,000 to Mrs. Dixon\u2019s estate, $426,000 to Bernard Dixon, and $159,750 to each of the Dixons\u2019 daughters, for a total of $6,065,000. Ford filed a series of post-trial motions seeking a new trial, JNOV, and revised judgments. On March 10, 2011, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order that granted Ford\u2019s request to revise the judgments so as to account for GP as a joint tortfeasor under CJ \u00a7 3-1404. Accordingly, the trial court halved the awards to each of the appellants and, on April 21, 2011, entered judgment awarding $2,500,000 to Mrs. Dixon\u2019s estate, $213,000 to Bernard Dixon, and $79,875 to each of the Dixons\u2019 daughters, for a total of $3,032,500 against Ford. Ford\u2019s remaining motions were denied. Appellants and Ford then filed timely appeals, bringing the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Ford argues that the trial court erred when it admitted Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony on the issue of causation and supports its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>argument with three premises. First, Ford contends that Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony was inadmissible under the holdings of <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), and <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 971 A.2d 235 (2009). Second, Ford argues that Dr. Welch\u2019s opinion deserves special scrutiny under <em>Frye-Reed </em>\u201cin the face of epidemiological evidence to the contrary,\u201d which Ford introduced in its defense. Third, Ford argues that \u201cDr. Welch\u2019s causation opinions fundamentally are at odds with \u2018the frequency, regularity and proximity\u2019 requirements for substantial factor causation\u201d set forth in <em>Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. Balbos, </em>326 Md. 179, 604 A.2d 445 (1992). In response, appellants argue first that Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony was not subject to the <em>Frye-Reed </em>test because it was based upon her specialized knowledge, training, and skill in a relevant field of inquiry. Second, appellants argue that Ford\u2019s epidemiological studies are not conclusive. Third, appellants argue that the <em>Balbos </em>standard \u201cis a test of legal causation,\u201d and that Dr. Welch\u2019s ultimate opinion was admissible because it addressed only \u201cmedical or epidemiological causation.\u201d For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion under Maryland Rule 5-702 when it admitted Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Ford, </em>204 Md.App. 1, 27 n. 20, 40 A.3d 514 (Md.App. 2012) (Zarnoch, J. concurring and dissenting) (whereas <em>Frye-Reed </em>determinations are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>Rule 5-702 decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>Reed, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted the test first articulated in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C.Cir.1923), now known in Maryland as the <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard: \u201c[Bjefore a scientific opinion will be received as evidence at trial, the basis of that opinion must be shown to be generally accepted as reliable within the expert\u2019s particular scientific field.\u201d 283 Md. at 381, 391 A.2d 364. In <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>the Court applied <em>Frye-Reed </em>to a novel theory of causation. Drawing from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>GE v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), the <em>Blackwell </em>Court held that where an expert derives an untested hypothesis from generally accepted theories and research <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>methods, the trial court must weigh the \u201canalytical gap\u201d between the established theories and methods on one figurative side, and the expert\u2019s opinion on the other. 408 Md. at 605-08, 971 A.2d 235 (\u201cGenerally accepted methodology, therefore, must be coupled with generally accepted analysis in order to avoid the pitfalls of an \u2018analytical gap.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Despite their perceived differences, the parties in fact agree on the fundamental scientific principles undergirding the expert testimony on both sides. Ford\u2019s <em>amici, </em>among them several eminent researchers and professors,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> note that \u201c[m]any scientists would argue that each exposure adds, not to the disease, but to the probability of the disease,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he risk or probability of developing a disease is proportional to the extent of the exposure or cumulative exposure.\u201d The <em>amici </em>do not quantify how \u201cmany\u201d scientists hold this view, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d) has reported that there is \u201cgeneral agreement among scientists and health agencies\u201d that \u201c[e]xposure to any asbestos type <em>(i. e., </em>serpentine or amphibole) can increase the likelihood of lung cancer, mesothelioma, and nonmalignant lung and pleural disorders.\u201d <em>Toxicological Profile for Asbestos, </em>DHHS Public Health Service, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 20 app. F (2001), available at http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp61.pdf. <em>See also Asbestos, asbestosis, and cancer: the Helsinki criteria for diagnosis and attribution, </em>23 Scand. J. Work Environ. Health 311, 314 (1997) (\u201cCumulative exposure, on a probability basis, should thus be considered the main criterion for attribution of a substantial contribution by asbestos to lung cancer risk.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The question open to scientific debate is the <em>extent </em>to which various asbestos exposures increase the risk of mesothelioma. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Notably, calculations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency indicate that even ambient air levels of asbestos increase one\u2019s risk of cancer and mesothelioma.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Toxicological Profile for Asbestos </em>at 24 app. F. This finding comports with studies appellants cite for the proposition that there is no perfectly \u201csafe\u201d amount of asbestos exposure; rather, decreasing exposure implies only decreasing risk, and vice-versa. <em>See </em>John T. Hodgson &amp; Andrew Darnton, <em>The quantitative risks of mesothelioma and lung cancer in relation to asbestos exposure, </em>44 Ann. Occup. Hyg. 565-601 (2000) (it is likely that \u201cthe exposure response curve simply starts to descend more steeply from some point on the cumulative exposure scale.\u201d); Y. Iwatsubo <em>et at, Pleural mesothelioma: dose-response relation at low levels of asbestos exposure in a French population-based case-control study, </em>148 Am. J. Epidemiol. 133-42 (1998) (estimating an odds ratio of 1.1 for exposures less than ,5f/ml-years); <em>Asbestos, </em>23 Scand. J. Work Environ. Health at 313 (\u201cMesothelioma can occur in cases with low asbestos exposure. However, very low background environmental exposures carry only an extremely low risk.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We therefore have a settled scientific theory of causation, and it is captured by what philosophers of science call \u201cprobabilistic causation,\u201d a logical model that accounts for the inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ent uncertainty in counterfactual truth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Christopher Hitchcock, <em>Probabilistic Causation, </em>The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). The probabilistic model of causation incorporates the fundamental limitations on human knowledge that prevent absolute certainty about any given inference, including counterfactual causal assertions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Interestingly\u2014and not surprisingly\u2014the motivation for probabilistic causation is the same as the justification that Justice Harlan ascribed to the legal burden of proof in his dissent from <em>In Re Winship:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">[I]n a judicial proceeding in which there is a dispute about the facts of some earlier event, the factfinder cannot acquire unassailably accurate knowledge of what happened. Instead, all the factfinder can acquire is a belief of what probably happened. The intensity of this belief\u2014the degree to which a factfinder is convinced that a given act actually occurred\u2014can, of course, vary. In this regard, a standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication. Although the phrases \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d and \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d are quantitatively imprecise, they do communicate to the finder of fact different notions concerning the degree of confidence he is expected to have in the correctness of his factual conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">397 U.S. 358, 370, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Probabilistic causation is, of course, different in kind from the legal burden of proof. The former is a mental model that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>states causal assertions as <em>continuous conditional probabilities, </em>whereas the latter is a <em>discrete threshold </em>for legal action set at some level of belief in specific causation. In spite of this difference, both doctrines rest on the premise that empirical inquiry can only ever give a certain <em>degree of certainty </em>in an inference of fact from evidence, including conditional and counterfaetual assertions of causation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And in both scenarios, a decision maker must weigh the costs of inaction against the expected costs of acting wrongly; we shall return to this point, below.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Despite the parties\u2019 (unrecognized) agreement on the science of mesothelioma causation and the conceptual framework that it entails, Ford attacks Dr. Welch\u2019s methodology on the grounds that it is not generally accepted. Specifically, Ford argues that Dr. Welch\u2019s opinion testimony violated the tenets of <em>Blackwell </em>and <em>Balbos </em>by using \u201cdownward extrapolation\u201d to arrive at the conclusion that every asbestos exposure is a \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d in causing eventual mesothelioma. As we now explain, Ford\u2019s argument conflates scientific causation and legal causation in attacking Dr. Welch\u2019s methodology. However, Dr. Welch <em>herself </em>also conflated those concepts, and so her testimony did not \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\u201d as required by Maryland Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Like the closely-related concept \u201cproximate cause,\u201d the term \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d goes beyond the logically simple question of whether the defendant\u2019s action (or inaction) was a \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201csufficient\u201d condition of harm to the plaintiff. Both proximity and substantiality describe whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause, using that word in the popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility!)]\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 481 (1965). Where the question of causation is probabilistic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201csubstantiality\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d necessarily imply some test of magnitude,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>viz., </em>how much must exposure have <em>increased </em>one\u2019s <em>risk </em>of harm in order to hold the responsible party liable? <em>See </em>William M. Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, <em>Causation in Tort Law: An Economic Approach, </em>12 J. Legal Stud. 109, 133 (1983) (\u201cprobability of injury and administrative cost are ... the two factors that we have argued determine the willingness of the courts to invoke the concept of legal or proximate causation to excuse injurers from liability for certain accidents.\u201d); Guido Calabresi, <em>Concerning Cause and the Law of Torts: An Essay for Harry Kalven, Jr., </em>43 U. Chi. L.Rev. 69, 78 (1975) (\u201cThe judgment involved in choosing to forbid or restrict particular behavior is precisely the kind of judgment that depends on the existence of a causal link, for there is no reason to prohibit or restrict behavior that we do not believe will increase the chances of injury in the future.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">If risk is our measure of causation, and substantiality is a threshold for risk, then it follows\u2014as intimated above\u2014 that \u201csubstantiality\u201d is essentially a burden of proof. Moreover, we can explicitly derive the probability of causation from the statistical measure known as \u201crelative risk,\u201d as did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>DeLuca v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>911 F.2d 941, 958 (3d Cir.1990), in a holding later adopted by several courts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>reasons we need not explore in detail, it is not prudent to set a singular minimum \u201crelative risk\u201d value as a legal standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>But even if there were some legal threshold, Dr. Welch provided no information that could help the finder of fact to decide whether the elevated risk in this case was \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Dr. Welch testified that, in her opinion, <em>\u201cevery exposure </em>to asbestos is a <em>substantial contributing cause </em>and so brake exposure would be a substantial cause even if [Mrs. Dixon] had other exposures.\u201d And while we have no doubt that Dr. Welch is well-qualified to render some opinion as to the <em>likely </em>intensity of Mrs. Dixon\u2019s exposure and the <em>likely </em>effect it had on her risk of mesothelioma, Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony implied only that both were \u201cmore than nothing.\u201d For obvious reasons an infinitesimal change in risk cannot suffice to maintain a cause of action in tort. Thus, whatever information Dr. Welch conveyed could not possibly have helped the jurors to weigh the substantiality of Ford\u2019s contribution to Mrs. Dixon\u2019s disease. <em>See Moeller v.

For these reasons and in these circumstances (ie., where probabilistic causation is the generally accepted scientific theory of causation and scientific expert testimony is required), we join with several other courts in requiring quantitative epidemiological evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bland v.

First, Ford complains that \u201cdownward extrapolation\u201d is not a reliable method to establish substantial factor causation, but that argument is only trivially true. As we have seen, \u201csubstantiality\u201d is a legal concept and not an objective property testable by the scientific method. The contributions of science end at quantitative estimates of exposure and risk. Thus, it is primarily Dr. Welch\u2019s <em>conclusion, </em>and not her <em>methodology, </em>with which we take issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Second, we agree with Ford\u2019s contention that \u201ccase reports\u201d and other anecdotal evidence are not probative of either general or actual causation,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but we must point out that Ford severely overstates the strength of its own epidemiological evidence. As Dr. Welch rightly explained, fifteen of Ford\u2019s eighteen proffered studies measured mesothelioma incidence in \u201cvehicle mechanics\u201d without quantifying or controlling for varying exposures within that broad industrial category. Furthermore, the leading epidemiological report cited by Ford and its <em>amici </em>that specifically studied \u201cbrake mechanics,\u201d P.A. Hessel <em>et al, Mesothelioma Among Brake Mechanics: An Expanded Analysis of a Case-control Study, </em>24 Risk Analysis 547 (2004), does not at all dispel the notion that this population faced an increased risk of mesothelioma due to their industrial asbestos exposure. In cases of rare diseases, a measure known as the \u201codds ratio\u201d provides an estimate of the \u201crelative risk,\u201d which is the \u201ctimes\u201d the default risk without exposure increases with exposure (a relative risk of two implies a doubled risk, three implies a tripled risk, and so forth). Federal Judicial Center, <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>348-50 (2d ed.2000). When calculated at the 95% confidence level, Hessel <em>et al. </em>estimated that the odds ratio of mesothelioma could have been as low as 0.01 or as high as 4.71, implying a nearly <em>quintupled risk </em>of mesothelioma among the population of brake mechanics. 24 Risk Analysis at 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Third, we would not use language so strong to describe Ford\u2019s arguments about the \u201canalytical gap\u201d in this case, but Professor Vern R. Walker dispelled similar notions in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>comprehensive article \u201cRestoring the Individual Plaintiff to Tort Law by Rejecting \u2018Junk Logic\u2019 About Specific Causation,\u201d 56 Ala. L.Rev. 381 (2004). In it, Professor Walker explains that <em>any </em>opinion rendered as to the likelihood of <em>actual </em>causation in a specific case must bridge the \u201canalytical gap\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> between epidemiological research and the plaintiffs situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">The first [is] the problem of ... finding that a reference group adequately represents the specific individual\u2014that is, that it adequately matches the plaintiff in all causally relevant variables, such as being a woman, being age forty, having no history of cancer in the immediate family, and so forth. The second [is] the uncertainty in assigning a particular probability to the individual case, even when the reference group adequately represents the specific individual. These two major sources of uncertainty can be called, respectively, uncertainty about plaintiff-representativeness and uncertainty about assigning a probability to the individual plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 384-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Thus, it could be said that while epidemiology can provide an accurate estimate of general causation among a population that controls for as many variables as possible, actual causation lies outside the bounds of epidemiological inquiry <em>per se. </em>See <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>at 381. Epidemiology <em>informs </em>an opinion of actual causation by establishing general causation, but the link between the two will always require some degree of untested inference and uncertainty, which brings us to our third point of clarification. It would be folly to require an expert to testify with <em>absolute certainty </em>that a plaintiff was exposed to a <em>specific </em>dose or suffered a <em>specific </em>risk. Dose and risk fall on a spectrum and are not \u201ctrue or false.\u201d As such, any scientific estimate of those values must be expressed as one or more possible <em>intervals </em>and, for each interval, a corresponding <em>confidence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that the true value is within that interval. <em>See id. </em>at 117-21 (discussing the statistical \u201cconfidence interval\u201d). Importantly\u2014and as we discussed above\u2014there is no logical reason to discriminate between uncertainty in the limits of epidemiological or medical knowledge and uncertainty in the particular facts of the case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We rely on experts to bridge the analytical gap between general and actual causation by applying the facts of the case to existing epidemiological research about general causation. If the facts of the case must be proven with reasonable certainty <em>(i.e., </em>certainty that exceeds the burden of proof), it follows that an expert must <em>estimate </em>exposure and risk with reasonable scientific or medical certainty. Here, Dr. Welch could have taken appellants\u2019 allegations as hypothetical facts and estimated the likelihood that Mrs. Dixon suffered various exposures<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to asbestos, as well as the likely risks attendant to those possible exposures taken from epidemiological studies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, it is a necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>truth of statistics that Dr. Welch would have been <em>more </em>confident that Mrs. Dixon suffered <em>at least </em>low asbestos exposure, but <em>less </em>confident that Mrs. Dixon suffered <em>at least </em>some <em>higher </em>level of exposure. <em>Id. </em>at 119 (\u201cFor a given confidence level, a narrower interval indicates a more precise estimate. For a given sample size, increased confidence can be attained only by widening the interval.\u201d). The same would be true of risk estimates: Dr. Welch could be <em>more </em>certain of <em>at least </em>some low risk to Mrs. Dixon and <em>less </em>certain of <em>at least </em>some <em>higher </em>risk. Armed with expert estimates, rendered with reasonable certainty, the jury could then have weighed the evidence to determine whether the factual foundations and methods of the risk estimate were sound <em>and </em>whether the resultant risk was \u201csubstantial.\u201d Instead, Dr. Welch\u2019s opinion merely implied that there was some non-zero probability that Mrs. Dixon was exposed to asbestos from Ford\u2019s products, and that this resulted in some non-zero increase in her risk of contracting mesothelioma. As such, Dr. Welch\u2019s conclusion that the risk and probability of causation was \u201csubstantial\u201d provided the jury with nothing more than her subjective opinion of \u201cresponsibility,\u201d not scientific evidence of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Practical and statistical limitations may have prevented Dr. Welch from providing any particular estimates of Mrs. Dixon\u2019s exposure or relative risk, or from opining with any reasonable certainty that the probability of causation was enough that a reasonable person would consider it substantial. But lack of epidemiological data does not give an expert license to state</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>his or her <em>belief </em>that exposure and risk\u2014however low they may be\u2014are \u201csubstantial.\u201d While under Rule 5-704 Dr. Welch\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,\u201d the remainder of her opinion lacked any information that would \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d as required by Rule 5-702. Having erroneously gained the court\u2019s imprimatur of expert testimony, Dr. Welch\u2019s unhelpful opinion was prejudicial to Ford and demands a new trial, either without her opinion on substantiality or else with some quantitative testimony that will help the jury fulfill its charge. We therefore vacate the judgments in favor of appellants and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">JUDGMENTS VACATED.

In <em>Daubert II, </em>43 F.3d at 1320-21, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that causation under a preponderance standard is equivalent to a \"relative risk\" of two. In other words, the <em>Daubert </em>court held that a plaintiffs risk of injury must have at least doubled in order to hold that the defendant's action was \"more likely than not\u201d the actual cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The problem with this holding is that relative risk does not behave like a \"binary\u201d hypothesis that can be deemed \"true\u201d or \"false\u201d with some degree of confidence; instead, the uncertainty inherent in any statistical measure means that relative risk does not resolve to a certain probability of <em>specific </em>causation. In order for a study of relative risk to truly fulfill the preponderance standard, it would have to result in 100% confidence that the relative risk exceeds two, which is a statistical impossibility. In short, the <em>Daubert </em>approach to relative risk fails to account for the twin statistical uncertainty inherent in any scientific estimation of causation. <em>See </em>Steve Gold, Note, <em>Causation in Toxic Torts: Burdens of Proof, Standards of Persuasion, and Statistical Evidence, </em>96 Yale L.J. 376, 384 (1986) (failure to distinguish between \"fact probability\u201d and \"belief probability\u201d \"works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>hidden doctrinal changes and encourages the application of simpleminded quantitative rules and narrow limits on evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">All of this is not to say, however, that any and all attempts to establish a burden of proof of causation using relative risk will fail.
