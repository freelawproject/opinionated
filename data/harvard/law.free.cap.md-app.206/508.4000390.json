Appellant was sentenced to three years, with all but eighteen months suspended, plus three years of supervised probation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>for transporting a handgun on a roadway. Appellant was also sentenced to five years, with all but eighteen months suspended, plus three years of supervised probation, for possessing a regulated firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime, to be served concurrently with the first sentence. Sentences on the vehicle offenses were suspended generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In this appeal, appellant challenges his handgun convictions, raising the following two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">I. Did the court err in instructing the jury that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">II. Is the evidence sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions for transporting a handgun on a roadway and possession of a regulated firearm after conviction of a disqualifying crime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Applying lessons from the Court of Appeals\u2019 recent decisions in <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 26 A.3d 979 (2011), and <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 31 A.3d 922 (2011), we shall hold that in the circumstances presented here, the trial court erred in giving a so-called \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d jury instruction. Because (1) there was no defense \u201coverreaching\u201d warranting such an instruction as a curative measure, (2) the trial court failed to instruct the jury to consider the lack of forensic evidence in evaluating reasonable doubt, and (3) the State used the instruction to undermine appellant\u2019s legitimate \u201cfailure to fingerprint\u201d defense, appellant\u2019s weapons convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">At trial, it was undisputed that a loaded and operable revolver was found underneath the seat of the car that appellant was driving when he was arrested on November 12, 2009. The State presented testimony by Prince George\u2019s County Police Officer Phillip Martin that, while patrolling the parking lot of a Forestville apartment complex that evening, he stopped appellant\u2019s Mitsubishi 3000 GT because it did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>a front license plate. Appellant was driving and had a passenger in the front seat. The officer obtained Maryland identification cards from appellant and his passenger, then asked appellant to move his vehicle into a parking space. As appellant was backing his car into a spot next to a larger vehicle, Officer Martin lost sight of appellant\u2019s vehicle for approximately fifteen seconds. The officer then discovered that the passenger had left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Because appellant did not have a driver\u2019s license, proper vehicle tags, current vehicle registration, or proof of vehicle insurance, his vehicle was impounded. During an inventory search, Officer Martin reached underneath the driver\u2019s seat from the back seat and found a silver revolver \u201cjammed up towards the middle toward the front of the seat.\u201d The handgun was loaded with five bullets, and test-firing later established that it was operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Appellant\u2019s defense to the weapons charges was that his passenger was merely a \u201cneighborhood\u201d acquaintance to whom he was giving a ride in exchange for gas money, and that it was the passenger who, \u201cunbeknownst\u201d to appellant, put the handgun under the driver\u2019s seat before he \u201cbailed out.\u201d Appellant asserted that, because he did not know about the gun, he did not have the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to convict him of either possessing the weapon after conviction for a disqualifying crime or knowingly transporting the gun on a public roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In his opening statement, defense counsel asked the jury to \u201cplease consider not only what evidence the State shows you, but what evidence is missing. I think there\u2019s going to be quite a bit missing in this case.\u201d During Officer Martin\u2019s cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony that, although the police department has technicians who can recover and analyze fingerprint and DNA evidence and appellant\u2019s fingerprints were available following his arrest, Officer Martin did not conduct or request any such testing on the gun or bullets. On re-direct, Officer Martin explained that police policy did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>not require fingerprinting or DNA sampling of firearms and that it was not his \u201ccommon practice\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">At the State\u2019s request and over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court, in its instructions to the jury before closing arguments, advised the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">During this trial you have heard testimony of witnesses and may hear arguments of counsel that the State did not utilize a specific investigative technique or scientific test. However, I instruct you that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove this case. Your responsibility as jurors is to determine whether the State has proven based solely on the evidence presented the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In closing argument, the State repeatedly invoked this jury instruction. The prosecutor, after emphasizing the significance of the evidence that the gun was found in appellant\u2019s vehicle under his seat, addressed the lack of fingerprint or DNA evidence to connect appellant to the gun. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">You heard in the defendant\u2019s cross examination of the State\u2019s witness this business about fingerprints. You take fingerprints? Did you recover DNA? Well, the Officer told you and you also heard from the Judge telling you that the State is not required to use any specific scientific investigative technique. The Officer doesn\u2019t have to. He\u2019s not required by law or his police department policy to fingerprint the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">He\u2019s not required to recover DNA. That\u2019s something that you watch on TV, but on the date today, it\u2019s not required and it\u2019s not done. He said I never recovered DNA or fingerprints from the gun. He doesn\u2019t do that. Nor in the instructions that you heard from the Judge, you don\u2019t hear one of those instructions that says we have to produce any fingerprint evidence in order for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>you to find him guilty. There\u2019s no element of the offense that says that that\u2019s something that we have to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoO\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Defense counsel, at the end of appellant\u2019s closing argument, acknowledged the jury instruction but asked the jury to conclude that the State should have performed fingerprint tests on the weapon as a matter of \u201cfairness.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">Now, the fingerprints, the DNA. Let\u2019s think about that for a minute. The Judge has said that as a matter of law the State is not required to show you fingerprints, but I think it\u2019s just as an element of fairness you ought to require the State to show you fingerprints. The State is saying to you in effect [appellant] knew that gun was there. [Appellant] put that gun there by inference. Well, why don\u2019t you require, and I think you should, the State could do a very simple thing. Test the gun. Test the bullets for fingerprints. See if there\u2019s any proof at all that [appellant] ever handled that gun. There is no such proof. And I think what you ought to require of the State, but you ought to require of the police before you convict someone of a serious crime is proof, which is readily obtainable, and it is there. It\u2019s something that they can certainly bring here. They don\u2019t even bother to do that. The gun was under the seat so that means it\u2019s him. I think you ought to require those things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In its rebuttal closing, the State again invoked the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction to counter appellant\u2019s \u201cmissing evidence\u201d defense. At the outset, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">I\u2019ll just start since it\u2019s the last point that was made in saying that you are required to apply the law. You\u2019re not allowed to make up your own sense of what the law is in this case. You were selected as jurors in this case because when the Judge asked you as part of voir dire whether you would be able to apply the law that he gave you, you indicated that you would be able to apply the law. Not some magical theory or defense theory or interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tion of the law, but what the law is. And the Judge already told you that the State as a matter of law, is not required to produce fingerprints or DNA evidence. Let me get that out of the way. It\u2019s not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">(Emphasis added). Later, the State concluded by re-emphasizing the jury\u2019s obligation, when determining whether appellant had the requisite knowledge of the gun, to apply \u201cthe law that you\u2019ve heard,\u201d \u201c[n'Jot this magical thing that you are pulling out of the air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We shall add facts as they pertain to our discussion of the issues raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The \u201cAnti-CSI Effect\u201d Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Appellant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in instructing the jury that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case.\u201d Because an understanding of the evolving jurisprudence regarding the use of such \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d jury instruction is essential to our resolution of this appeal, we shall examine first the trilogy of Maryland cases on this topic: <em>Evans v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 549, 922 A.2d 620, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 Md. 648, 929 A.2d 890 (2007), <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 26 A.3d 979 (2011), and <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 31 A.3d 922 (2011).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">We shall set the stage for our discussion by addressing the origin and purpose of an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d jury instruction. The term \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d as applied to jury instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>stems from \u201c[t]he popularity of forensic dramas\u201d on television, including the program <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation </em>and its spin-off progeny. <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 457-58, 26 A.3d 979 (Harrell, J., concurring). Judge Harrell stated in his concurring opinion that these forensic investigation programs have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9K\">garnered increased media attention in recent years, with speculation that the shows produced a \u201cCSI effect\u201d that may skew jury verdicts, most frequently in criminal law matters. The theory behind the so-called \u201cCSI effect\u201d is that the millions of viewers of forensic dramas develop unrealistic expectations about the availability and results of specific scientific forensic techniques, such as DNA sequencing, fingerprint analysis, and ballistics analysis, increasing the likelihood of a finding of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d where such forensic evidence is not produced, and, thus, an increased likelihood for an acquittal or hung jury.... Although debate continues regarding whether a \u201cCSI effect\u201d actually exists, among researchers that believe it does, the actual effect on jurors in the courtroom is a subject of great debate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 26 A.3d 979 (Harrell, J., concurring) (citations and footnote omitted). <em>See generally Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 467-70, 31 A.3d 922 (reviewing published studies, articles, and cases considering the \u201cCSI effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cDespite the divergence\u201d among those studying the issue, there is no question that \u201cthe so-called \u2018CSI effect\u2019 is injected into American jurisprudence and has led to changes in model jury instructions, in prosecution tactics, and in both voir dire questions and jury instructions given by judges.\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 461, 26 A.3d 979 (Harrell, J., concurring) (footnote omitted). Among the \u201cdefensive prosecution techniques\u201d designed \u201cto curb the possible \u2018CSI effect\u2019\u201d are requests for \u201cspecialized jury instructions\u201d like the one challenged in this appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 462, 26 A.3d 979 (Harrell, J., concurring). Such instructions have been referred to variously as \u201canti-CSI effect,\u201d \u201cno duty,\u201d and \u201cinvestigative or scientific techniques\u201d instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 26 A.3d 979; <em>id. </em>at 456 n. 1, 26 A.3d 979 (Harrell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\n<em>Evans v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The first case to emerge in this area was this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Evans. </em>Evans and a co-defendant were convicted of selling heroin to an undercover police detective, who was the State\u2019s sole witness to the transaction. 174 Md.App. at 552-53, 555-56, 922 A.2d 620. On cross-examination, the detective testified that, although the police department had audio and video recording equipment available to record potentially illegal drug transactions, he did not arrange for his transaction with appellant to be recorded because he did not have authority to order the use of the recording equipment. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 922 A.2d 620. The trial court gave the following \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d jury instruction just before closing arguments began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">During this trial, you have heard testimony of witnesses and may hear argument of counsel that the State did not utilize a specific investigative technique or scientific test. You may consider these facts in deciding whether the State has met its burden of proof. You should consider all of the evidence or lack of evidence in deciding whether a defendant is guilty. However, I instruct you that there is no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case. Your responsibility as jurors is to determine whether the State has proven, based on the evidence, the defendants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 562, 922 A.2d 620 (emphasis added). Thereafter, defense counsel for both Evans and his co-defendant argued in closing that the State\u2019s failure to present either recorded evidence of the transaction or fingerprint evidence created reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>On appeal, Evans challenged the jury instruction on the ground that it improperly \u201crelieved the State, in the minds of the jurors, of the burden to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 922 A.2d 620. Noting the dearth of \u201cappellate attention\u201d given to the common defense strategy of \u201cpoint[ing] to evidence not offered by the State,\u201d including \u201cthe lack of fingerprint evidence,\u201d this Court concluded that, although Evans failed to preserve his reasonable doubt objection for appellate review, the challenged instruction was \u201cnot substantially different in substance from\u201d an instruction affirmed by the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Saldarriaga, </em>204 F.3d 50 (2d Cir.2000). <em>See Evans, </em>174 Md.App. at 552, 562, 566, 570, 922 A.2d 620.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We observed that \u201c[i]n both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>instances ... the court\u2019s instructions made clear that the State was not relieved of its burden to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 922 A.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">This Court concluded that the instruction given in Evans\u2019 trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">was a correct statement of the law, was applicable to the facts in the case and was not fairly covered by other instructions given. The robust and vehement closing arguments of counsel regarding the failure to employ audio or video surveillance equipment and the lack of any other investigative or scientific evidence produced by the State warranted giving the instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">In sum, we are satisfied that the State\u2019s burden in this case was in no way compromised by the admonition that there was no responsibility, in law, for the State to produce evidence simply because it was available, even though such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>evidence might have made the discharge of the jury\u2019s duty easier. That having been said, we stress that the salutary-effect of the instruction is found in the advisement that the absence of such evidence should be factored into the juror\u2019s determination of whether the State has shouldered its burden if, <em>and only if, </em>the absence of such evidence, itself, creates reasonable doubt. The absence of evidence, available to the State, may not, <em>ipso facto, </em>constitute reasonable doubt. The risk is greatest that such an instruction will run afoul of the prohibition against relieving the State of its burden where the instruction is predominant in the overall instructions and its relation to the reasonable doubt standard unclear. Consequently, the preferable practice is for the court\u2019s instruction to be promulgated in conjunction with the explication of the State\u2019s burden to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 922 A.2d 620 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Thereafter, the Court of Appeals issued its decisions in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb. </em>The opinions in those two cases \u201cdid not overrule explicitly the holding in <em>Evans, </em>but created a new basis for evaluating the giving of \u2018anti-CSI effect\u2019 jury instructions,\u201d by establishing that instructions like those given in <em>Evans, Atkins, </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>although not improper <em>per se, </em>should not be propounded unless the defense does something to warrant the instruction as a curative measure. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 462-63, 31 A.3d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Atkins v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In <em>Atkins, </em>the defendant was convicted of assaulting three people with a knife during a fight. 421 Md. at 437-39, 26 A.3d 979. The type of knife used in the altercation was critical to both the prosecution and the defense. One of the prosecution witnesses testified that, just before one of the victims was stabbed, \u201che saw Atkins reach into his pocket and apparently remove something\u201d that the witness could not describe. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 26 A.3d 979. Atkins claimed that he used a folding knife from his pocket in self-defense, then threw that knife away. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 439-40, 26 A.3d 979. The State, on the other hand, maintained that Atkins used a 12-inch \u201cRambo-style\u201d knife, featuring a non-folding six-inch blade, which had been seized from his home after the fight. <em>Id. </em>at 439 &amp; n. 3, 26 A.3d 979. Over Atkins\u2019 objection, the knife was admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 440, 26 A.3d 979. No scientific or forensic tests were performed on the knife, and there was no testimonial evidence linking it to the assaults. <em>Id. </em>at 439, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Defense counsel cross-examined the police officer who seized the knife about the lack of forensic testing for blood, DNA, or fingerprints on the weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 26 A.3d 979. At the State\u2019s request, over Atkins\u2019 objection, the trial court propounded the same \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction that was given in <em>Evans, </em>also at the close of the evidence and before closing arguments. <em>Id. </em>at 441-42, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in giving that instruction, because it \u201cwas not proper under the facts of the case, was fairly covered in the instructions actually given, and, rather than solving a problem arising from the circumstances of the case, created a problem that unfairly prejudiced the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 26 A.3d 979. Writing for the Court, Judge Greene distinguished <em>Evans </em>on \u201cmultiple\u201d grounds, the last of which was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZG\">Finally, in <em>Evans, </em>defense counsel gave \u201crobust and vehement closing argument\u201d in addition to extensive cross-examination on the issue of the failure of police to record the transaction. The trial court stated explicitly that the cross-examination warranted the instruction, and the Court of Special Appeals also relied on the closing argument to justify the use of the instruction. Thus, the intermediate appellate court viewed the instruction as necessary to correct defense counsel\u2019s argument that the State was required to produce certain evidence. In the present case, defense counsel briefly cross-examined on the issue, but did not argue lack of evidence in closing. Unlike in <em>Evans, </em>where counsel distorted the law, thus requiring a curative instruction, counsel in the present case merely pointed out on cross-examination what proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>dures were available but did not incorrectly state the law or the State\u2019s burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 26 A.3d 979 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Court concluded that the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction given in Atkins\u2019 case improperly relieved the State of its burden of proof and undermined the defense by commenting on the weight of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 26 A.3d 979. The Court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">As discussed above, the foot long, non-folding black knife was the centerpiece of the State\u2019s case and thus the instruction was of critical importance. The primary concern when evaluating whether a trial judge abused his or her discretion in giving this type of instruction is the risk that \u201csuch an instruction will run afoul of the prohibition against relieving the State of its burden where the ... relation [of the instruction] to the reasonable doubt standard [is] unclear.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>174 Md.App. at 571[, 922 A.2d 620]. This case exemplifies that risk; the instruction as worded effectively undermined the defense theory of self defense, and relieved the State of its burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">[D]efense counsel had every right to inquire about steps the State undertook to connect the defendant and the particular knife found in Atkins\u2019s home to the crime. As we have held previously, a defendant has the right to raise a defense based on the lack of evidence presented by the State. <em>Sample v. State, </em>314 Md. 202, 207, 209 [550 A.2d 661] (1988). We stated in <em>Sample </em>that when \u201cthe State has failed to utilize a well-known, readily available, and superior method of proof to link the defendant with the criminal activity, the defendant ought to be able to comment on the absence of such evidence.\u201d <em>Sample, </em>314 Md. at 207 [550 A.2d 661] (1988) (interpreting <em>Eley v. State, </em>288 Md. 548 [419 A.2d 384] (1980) (which held that the trial court erred \u201cin precluding counsel from argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing the logical inferences from the facts and gaps in [the] evidence,\u201d <em>Eley, </em>288 Md. at 551 [419 A.2d 384], and that under the circumstances, \u201cit is not unreasonable to allow the defendant to call attention to [the State\u2019s failure to produce fingerprint evidence],\u201d <em>Eley, </em>288 Md. at 555 [419 A.2d 384])). In order to probe into the utility of scientific testing to connect the knife introduced by the State to the crimes charged, defense counsel engaged in cross-examination of the detective, asking whether the police department was capable of looking for skin cells or blood on the knife, and whether such testing was performed in this case.

Stabb was convicted of inappropriately touching the seven-year-old daughter of his ex-girlfriend by putting his hand on her \u201cprivate\u201d inside her underwear. 423 Md. at 457, 31 A.3d 922.

Defense counsel was correct. Stabb\u2019s defense argued properly and without undue emphasis the lack of corroborating physical evidence of the crime, and questioned Detective Seichepine and Sullivan as to the likelihood of the existence of such evidence and why a SAFE was not performed, but did not \u201charp\u201d impermissibly on the lack of physical evidence in its case-in-chief or during closing arguments. In fact, the main thrust of Stabb\u2019s defense rested on an alibi theory. His closing arguments focused also on numerous ways the defense contended that the State had failed to satisfy its reasonable doubt burden, only one of which was its failure to perform a SAFE. When the defense did allude to the lack of corroborating physical evidence, its comments were \u201clegitimate, brief, and reasonable,\u201d as in <em>Atkins. </em>These factors distinguish the present case from <em>Evans.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">Further, Stabb did not advance a \u201cmissing evidence\u201d argument that implied that \u201cmissing\u201d evidence would favor him; rather, counsel alluded to the absence of corroborating physical evidence because the State chose not to administer a SAFE. The State responded, during recross-examination of witnesses and in closing arguments, to defense counsel\u2019s implication regarding the lack of a SAFE, i.e., why a SAFE was not administered and the unlikelihood that a SAFE, had it been administered, would have yielded testable DNA or fingerprints. Rebuttal by the State was the proper approach. When the trial judge injected the pertinent instruction into the jury\u2019s calculus, it had more \u201cforce and effect than if merely presented by counsel,\u201d and could have influenced impermissibly the drawing by the jury of inferences regarding the absence of physical evidence. In giving the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction to the jury, the trial court directed effectively the jurors not to consider the absence of a SAFE or corroborating physical evidence.

Nor did counsel specifically argue that the instruction improperly undermined appellant\u2019s defense by effectively directing the jury to disregard or discount the lack of fingerprint and DNA evidence.

Defense counsel\u2019s objection, albeit brief, rested on this same principle that, in the circumstances presented in the instant case, there was no need for the court to give an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. In this respect, appellant\u2019s objection was similar to the defense objection in <em>Atkins </em>that the pattern instruction on reasonable doubt \u201csufficiently covered\u201d the objectives of the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction, which the Court of Appeals treated as having preserved that jury instruction challenge for appellate review. <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 441 n. 5, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Articles 21 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, criminal defendants have the right to require the State to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to have \u201ctrial judges refrain from making statements that may improperly influence the jury.\u201d <em>Savoy v.

Viewed through the analytical framework established by <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>the issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in giving an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction in the circumstances presented here, so that it improperly relieved the State of its burden to prove appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and invaded the province of the jury by directing it to disregard or discount appellant\u2019s defense of a lack of forensic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Although the Court of Appeals has expressly declined to declare the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d jury instruction improper <em>per se, Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>make it clear that such an instruction is not appropriate unless the defense has overreached, for example <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>by improperly suggesting to the jury that the State was obligated to conduct scientific tests or that the \u201cmissing evidence\u201d from such tests would be favorable to the defendant. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 462-63, 472-73, 31 A.3d 922.

As explained below, we conclude that, as in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>the preemptive \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction given in this instance was not warranted as a curative measure, and furthermore, that the instruction was flawed in that it did not advise the jury to consider the lack of forensic evidence in determining whether the State proved appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">At trial, the chief contested factual issue was whether appellant knew that the revolver was in his vehicle. Although the presence of the weapon underneath the driver\u2019s seat occupied by appellant provided sufficient evidence for the jury to infer that appellant knew about it,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellant attempted to rebut that inference by pointing out that the passenger had better access to the place where the weapon was hidden, that appellant fully cooperated with Officer Martin during the stop, and that the State failed to test the gun and bullets for fingerprints or DNA evidence that could have shown whether he had handled them. As in <em>Atkins, </em>where the issue was whether the untested weapon could be forensically linked to the crime, thereby contradicting Atkins\u2019s claim of self-defense, here the issue was whether the untested weapon could be forensically linked to appellant, thereby contradicting appellant\u2019s lack of knowledge defense. This lack of forensic evidence was \u201can integral part of the defense\u2019s theory,\u201d because it \u201caddressed directly the State\u2019s demonstrative evidence introduced against\u201d appellant. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 471, 31 A.3d 922; <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 450, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The record here also resembles <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>in that appellant\u2019s defense did not overreach in a manner that war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ranted correction via an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. In cross-examination and closing argument, defense counsel simply pointed out that, although the gun could have been tested for fingerprints or DNA in an effort to obtain evidence of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the gun by showing that he had handled it, no such testing was requested or performed. Here, as in <em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb, </em>defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination and closing argument regarding the State\u2019s failure \u201cto utilize a well-known, readily available, and superior method of proof to link\u201d appellant to the revolver through fingerprints or DNA was a \u201clegitimate, brief, and reasonable\u201d effort to advance appellant\u2019s defense that the lack of forensic evidence created reasonable doubt as to whether he knew about the revolver. <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 471, 31 A.3d 922 (quotations omitted); <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 452-53, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appellant employed none of the tactics identified by the Court of Appeals as possible grounds for an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 473, 31 A.3d 922. In contrast to the defense arguments that warranted the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction given in <em>Evans, </em>here defense counsel did not distort the law by suggesting that the jury could not convict without forensic evidence or that the State was legally required to perform fingerprint or DNA tests. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 471-72, 31 A.3d 922; <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 450-51, 26 A.3d 979.

To the contrary, defense counsel merely asserted, in a manner that cannot be characterized as undue \u201charp[ing],\u201d that the weapon and bullets should have been tested for fingerprints or DNA as a matter of \u201cfairness.\u201d <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 471, 31 A.3d 922. Thus appellant did not engage in the type of improper \u201cdefense tactics emphasizing repeatedly\u2014often to the point of chastising law enforcement officials\u2014the failure to use specific investigative techniques\u201d that might have \u201cinfluence[d] jurors inappropriately\u201d so as to justify an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction as a curative measure for defense overreaching. <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 464, 26 A.3d 979 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>(Harrell, J., concurring); <em>see Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 472-73, 31 A.3d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><em>Atkins </em>and <em>Stabb </em>teach that, because \u201ca defendant has the right to raise a defense based on the lack of evidence presented by the State,\u201d he is entitled to present a \u201cfailure to fingerprint\u201d defense via cross-examination and closing argument without automatically triggering the type of preemptive \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction given in this case. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 472-73, 31 A.3d 922; <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 451-62, 26 A.3d 979. In the absence of defense overreaching, the proper approach is to refrain from injecting an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction into the jury\u2019s calculus, thereby avoiding the risk of undue judicial influence on \u201cthe drawing by the jury of inferences regarding the absence of physical evidence,\u201d and instead, to leave it up to the State to address the lack of forensic evidence defense through re-direct examination and rebuttal. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 472, 31 A.3d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In addition, even though the Court of Appeals has held that an \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction in the form used in <em>Evans, Atkins, </em>and <em>Stabb </em>may not be treated as \u201cimproper <em>per se, </em>\u201d <em>see, e.g., Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 462-63, we do not reach that same conclusion about the instruction propounded in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Unlike the instruction given in all three of those cases, the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction given at appellant\u2019s trial did not include an advisement that the jury should consider the <em>lack of </em>scientific evidence in deciding whether the State had proved appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, jurors were effectively told that, in determining whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knew about the gun in his car, the government was not obligated to conduct fingerprint or DNA tests and that jurors should consider only the evidence presented, which in this instance consisted of testimony by the lone witness at trial, Officer Martin. Because the trial court failed to also instruct that the absence of fingerprint or DNA evidence should be factored into each juror\u2019s determination of whether the State had satisfied its burden of proof, the \u201canti-CSI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>effect\u201d instruction ran afoul of the requirement that \u201cany instruction regarding what the State must produce in proving its case must be properly related to the reasonable doubt standard.\u201d <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 454, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The subject instruction, which was given verbatim as requested by the State, created the danger recognized in <em>Atkins, </em>that a \u201cjury, discussing the evidence presented and the lack of scientific testing, would remember the trial judge telling them that the State need not present such evidence, and conclude that the State d[id] not have to connect affirmatively the defendant to the [weapon.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the adverse impact of this flawed instruction on the jury was heightened by the State\u2019s repeated invocation of the instruction in closing argument. The prosecutor reminded the jurors that \u201cthe Judge\u201d had told them that they are required to apply the law that the State \u201cis not required to produce fingerprint or DNA evidence.\u201d The State\u2019s use of \u201cthe \u2018high and authoritative\u2019 position of the trial judge\u201d as an offensive sword to undercut appellant\u2019s lack of knowledge defense increased the already intolerable risk that the jury would view the instruction as a direction by the trial judge to disregard or discount appellant\u2019s defense of the State\u2019s failure to fingerprint the gun or test for DNA. <em>See id. </em>at 453, 26 A.3d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In sum, because there was no overreaching by defense counsel to justify a preemptive \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction and the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction was fatally flawed for not advising the jury to consider the lack of forensic evidence in evaluating reasonable doubt, we hold that the trial court erred in giving the \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d instruction. In constitutional terms, the instruction improperly relieved the State of its burden to prove appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and thus violated appellant\u2019s right to have the jury determine the facts. <em>See Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 472, 31 A.3d 922; <em>Atkins, </em>421 Md. at 455, 26 A.3d 979. Given the importance of the lack of fingerprint and DNA evidence to appellant\u2019s defense, this error was not harmless. We therefore must reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for transporting a handgun on a roadway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>and possessing a handgun after conviction for a disqualifying crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Appellant argues that \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain the convictions for both weapons offenses, \u201c[bjecause the State did not prove that appellant had knowledge that the gun was in the car and the evidence indicated that the passenger was responsible for the gun\u2019s location under the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d Although we have reversed those convictions, we must address the claim of insufficiency, because appellant cannot be retried for those crimes if the State failed to present sufficient evidence to convict him in the first trial. <em>See Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d); <em>In re Petition for Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 313, 539 A.2d 664 (1988) (\u201c[I]f the evidence was insufficient to go to the jury in the first place, double jeopardy principles preclude a new trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Appellate courts evaluate the sufficiency of evidence by determining \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>see Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 184, 999 A.2d 986 (2010). \u201cIf the evidence \u2018either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u2019 then we will affirm the conviction.\u201d <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)). \u201cBecause the fact-finder possesses the unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony, we do not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>415 Md. at 185, 999 A.2d 986. Thus, \u201c[w]e defer to the jury\u2019s inferences and determine whether they are supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Both of appellant\u2019s weapons convictions were for statutory offenses. In Maryland, \u201c[a] person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person ... has been convicted of a disqualifying crime.\u201d Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 5-133 of the Public Safety Article. In addition, \u201ca person may not ... knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public.\u201d Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 4-203(a)(l)(ii) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">To obtain convictions for both of these crimes, the State had to prove that appellant was aware of the presence of the gun in his vehicle. The possession charge requires an affirmative showing of knowledge in order to establish appellant\u2019s dominion and control over the weapon. <em>See generally Neal v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 297, 316, 991 A.2d 159, <em>cert. denied, </em>415 Md. 42, 997 A.2d 792 (2010) (\u201cBecause a person \u2018ordinarily would not be deemed to exercise \u201cdominion or control\u201d over an object about which he is unaware,\u2019 knowledge of the contraband\u2019s presence is a prerequisite to the exercise of dominion and control.\u201d) (quoting <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 649, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988)). For the transporting charge, however, \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun under [C.L. \u00a7 4-203(a)(l)(ii) ] transports the handgun knowingly.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 4-203(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to convict him of these offenses, because of Officer Martin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>testimony that appellant denied knowledge of the gun and freely admitted the traffic violations, and the reasonable inference that the gun was in a location where \u201cit would have been natural for a passenger\u201d to place it but \u201cawkward for someone sitting in the\u201d driver\u2019s seat to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument ignores the statutory presumption that he knowingly transported the gun found in his vehicle. C.L. \u00a7 4\u2014203(a)(2). This presumption, although rebuttable, provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for appellant\u2019s transporting conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Regarding the possession charge, under Maryland law, \u201cknowledge of the contents of the vehicle can be imputed to the driver of the vehicle.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 550, 823 A.2d 664 (2003). The Court of Appeals has held that \u201cthe status of a person in a vehicle who is the driver, whether that person actually owns, is merely driving or is the lessee of the vehicle, permits an inference, by a fact-finder, of knowledge, by that person, of contraband found in that vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such an inference of knowledge may be drawn even though there was a passenger in the vehicle who arguably had equal access and a greater evidentiary nexus to the weapon. For example, in <em>Smith, </em>the undisputed evidence that Smith was the driver of a leased car was sufficient to establish his knowledge of a gun found in the trunk, even though the weapon was covered by a jacket belonging to one of two passengers and was not tested for fingerprints. <em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 558-59, 823 A.2d 664. When, as in this case, the contraband is discovered under the driver\u2019s seat within appellant\u2019s reach, such an inference of knowledge may be stronger. <em>Cf. Larocca v. State, </em>164 Md. App. 460, 476, 883 A.2d 986 (2005) (en banc) (evidence that marijuana was found \u201cimmediately underneath the [driver\u2019s] seat in a small car, in arm\u2019s reach, where it was readily accessible to him\u201d supported an inference that driver knew about its presence). Therefore, the jury could infer that appellant knew about the weapon found in his vehicle based on his status as the driver and owner of the vehicle, as well as the location of the weapon underneath his seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Because the State presented sufficient evidence to convict appellant of transporting a handgun on a roadway and possessing a handgun after a disqualifying crime, appellant may be retried on those charges.
