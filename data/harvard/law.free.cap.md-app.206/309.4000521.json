Ann., Crim. Law Art. (C.L.) \u00a7 7-104 (theft of property with a value of at least $1,000),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> C.L. \u00a7 9-502 (making a false statement when under arrest). On August 11, 2011, the circuit court sentenced appellant to ten years\u2019 imprisonment concurrent with pre-existing sentences, with all but four years suspended, for conspiracy to commit theft; six months\u2019 imprisonment concurrent for making a false statement when under arrest; and four years\u2019 supervised probation. Appellant noted an appeal raising two issues, which we rephrase:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">I. A Did the circuit court err in finding that Sergeant Mark White had reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop of the vehicle in which appellant was a passenger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>B. Did the circuit court err in finding that law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Q\">II. Did the circuit court err in determining that appellant knowingly waived the right to a jury trial, or in failing to announce its determination on the record pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-246(b)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We answer both questions in the negative, and therefore, affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"As8\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On January 31, 2011, appellant filed with the circuit court a Supplement to Omnibus Motion to Suppress Evidence, in which appellant moved \u201cto suppress all evidence obtained as a result of an illegal traffic stop and illegal detention and search on or about October 5, 2010[.]\u201d The motion stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">[T]he Police Officers had no reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic violation had occurred and therefore no legal basis to stop the vehicle. <em>Whren v. [United States</em>], 517 U.S. 806 [116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89] (1996), <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424 [769 A.2d 879] (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">[Appellant] has standing to challenge the illegal stop of the vehicle. <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 U.S. 2[4]9 [127 S.Ct. 2400, 168 L.Ed.2d 132] (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">[A]fter the vehicle was stopped, the Officer determined that the vehicle\u2019s driver had a suspended license. The driver was taken to the officer\u2019s vehicle where he was issued traffic citations. After the citations were written, the passengers in the vehicle were illegally detained. <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356 [735 A.2d 491] (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">[ ] The detention of the passengers was [a] \u201csecond stop.\u201d The Officers had no independent reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to detain the passengers after making the decision to issue the driver traffic citations. <em>Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. [598, 753 A.2d 556, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 487, 759 A.2d 231] (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Suppression Hearing as to the Initial Traffic Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On February 1, 2011, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion to suppress. As a witness for the State, Sergeant Mark White testified that on October 5, 2010, he was driving a marked police vehicle north on Interstate 270 in Montgomery County. Sergeant White testified that he passed a black Ford Expedition that, he noticed in his rearview mirror, had headlamps that \u201cwere emitting a blue color which caught [his] attention[.]\u201d Sergeant White testified that \u201cthe blue tint could\u2019ve very well been halogen lights. There was no way for [him] to determine that unless [he] got up in front of the\u201d headlamps. Sergeant White testified that he was aware of a statute that mandated white headlamps.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sergeant White testified that he initiated a traffic stop, and after checking the Expedition\u2019s license plate number through the Motor Vehicle Administration and the National Crime Information Center, learned that the Expedition\u2019s owner, Antoine Norris, had a suspended driver\u2019s license due to a child support violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Sergeant White was the only witness for the State at this stage of the motion hearing. After Sergeant White testified, the circuit court heard argument and ruled from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">The standard is whether an officer, a reasonable police officer in the situation that the officer is in, can articulate reasonable, articulable suspicion and develop probable cause for a traffic stop. And it doesn\u2019t have to make sense to the Court, it doesn\u2019t have to make sense to counsel, but in the officer\u2019s situation, he sees a car going down the road, it\u2019s got blue lights. The law says you can\u2019t have blue lights; it says you have to have white lights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">And then he gets up close and he says\u2014I think it\u2019s a reasonable inference from his testimony even though he wasn\u2019t, there was no attempt to nail him down on this. I learned something about it. I didn\u2019t realize that halogen lights have a bluish tint; I didn\u2019t know that. But apparent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ly the officer knows that the halogen lights may have a bluish tint and he say[s], upon close[r] examination, I mean they couldn\u2019t have been halogen lights. I think a reasonable inference is, obviously, halogen lights are not illegal so far as I know. But how could you know that without closer examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">And so for reasons that I hope I have articulated clearly, I don\u2019t find that there was a lack of probable cause for making the traffic stop, so the motion to suppress for that reason would necessarily be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Suppression Hearing as to the Search</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">After the circuit court ruled as to the initial traffic stop, Sergeant White testified that he approached the Expedition to speak with Norris, the Expedition\u2019s owner, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. According to Sergeant White, Norris gave him an expired learner\u2019s permit. Sergeant White testified that he asked Norris to exit the Expedition. According to Sergeant White, Norris complied and sat in his marked police vehicle while the two of them had a conversation. Sergeant White testified that he wrote three citations for Norris\u2014two for driving with a suspended license, and one for driving with an obstructed windshield. Sergeant White testified that he intended to search the Expedition because of Norris\u2019s suspended license, and that he intended not to let Norris continue driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">During Sergeant White\u2019s conversation with Norris in the marked police vehicle, three other law enforcement officers arrived. Sergeant White testified that one of the other law enforcement officers, Officer Robert Sheehan, asked the passengers in the Expedition to exit the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">As a \"witness for the State, Officer Sheehan testified that in October 2010, he learned via radio that Sergeant White was initiating a traffic stop. Officer Sheehan testified that he pulled up behind Sergeant White\u2019s marked police vehicle before he walked up to the driver\u2019s window of the black SUV, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>whose driver\u2019s seat was empty. Officer Sheehan testified that he started a conversation with the vehicle\u2019s passengers and asked where the passengers were coming from and where they were going. According to Officer Sheehan, after every question that he asked, the passengers would \u201call look at each other and then one of them would respond with an answer.\u201d (Emphasis added). Officer Sheehan testified that he \u201cwas having some difficulty hearing them because of the way traffic was going by.\u201d Officer Sheehan testified that, because of his difficulty hearing and the passengers\u2019 behavior, he asked them to exit the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">According to Officer Sheehan, the two passengers in the backseat.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cimmediately\u201d exited the vehicle, but the female passenger in the front seat\u2014whom the not guilty agreed statement of facts identified as Mashea Ray (\u201cMashea\u201d)\u2014 \u201cstarted moving around and reaching for stuff, which [made Officer Sheehan] very nervous.\u201d Officer Sheehan testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know if she was trying to access a weapon of some sort. So [he] asked her once again to get out of the vehicle. She didn\u2019t get out of the vehicle.\u201d Officer Sheehan testified that he walked around to the vehicle\u2019s passenger side and once again asked Mashea exit the vehicle. According to Officer Sheehan, Mashea said that it was \u201ccold out; [she] need[ed] to grab [her] jacket.\u201d Officer Sheehan testified that Mashea \u201cgrabbed her jacket from the floor that was directly behind her seat\u201d before starting to exit the vehicle. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Officer Sheehan testified that he asked Mashea \u201cif there were any weapons in her jacket[,]\u201d and that Mashea replied \u201cno.\u201d Officer Sheehan asked Mashea if he could search the jacket to make sure, and Mashea replied \u201cyes.\u201d Officer Sheehan found a \u201clarge wallet,\u201d which he removed from the jacket. Officer Sheehan asked Mashea if it was her wallet, and she replied \u201cyes.\u201d Officer Sheehan asked if Mashea\u2019s identification was in the wallet, and she replied \u201cno.\u201d Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Sheehan asked if he could search the wallet to make sure, and Mashea \u201csaid something to the effect of yeah, it[ was] not in there.\u201d Officer Sheehan testified that, he \u201csaw a whole stack of credit cards inside the wallet that to [him] appeared to be fake credit cards. [He] starting pulling them out and one by one[, and he would] say the name on the credit card and [ ] ask [Mashea], who\u2019s this person?\u201d According to Officer Sheehan, every time that he showed a credit card to Mashea, \u201cshe said she didn\u2019t know\u201d who the person was whose name was on the credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">After Officer Sheehan testified, the prosecutor argued, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">[W]e concede that the officers did not have-because the decision had been made to issue the citations, under <em>Knowles v. Iowa, </em>the officers could not do a search incident to an arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">So, although Officer White or Sergeant WTiite articulated that\u2019s what he was thinking at the time, we concede legally he couldn\u2019t have done that at that point.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">[T]he State\u2019s argument is they [the law enforcement officers] have to get these people [Norris, appellant, Mashea, and the unknown juvenile female] out of there because we\u2019re stuck on [Interstate] 270, as the <em>Timmons </em>[v. <em>State, </em>114 Md.App. 410, 690 A.2d 530 (1997) ] case notes. Sometimes you\u2019re in those situations where you have something that looks like a seizure but is not actually a seizure because of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">Once that non-seizure, if you will, occurs and [appellant] is asked out of the car with the female, what happens next is a variety of consent things with the female, which we already, he [appellant] has no standing to contest. That leads to what are readily apparent fraudulent credit cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>And at that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">After hearing argument, the circuit court ruled from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">[T]his was good police work. People do things sometimes thinking that they have to give the police consent. They think, she [Mashea] probably thought she had to say you can search my jacket. She didn\u2019t have to say that; she could\u2019ve said no, give me my jacket, you\u2019re not searching my jacket. But she said oh yeah, go ahead. You can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">[T]here\u2019s no challenge that the consent that she [Mashea] gave was not valid consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">[S]earches of persons or places or automobiles without a warrant are presumed to be unreasonable, unless there is some carefully articulated exception to the warrant requirement. And I find you have such an articulated exception here. You have an intervening cause that essentially interrupted what was about to be an illegal search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">So I think this illegal search was interrupted by the consent search of the young woman [Mashea] who had contraband on her, and then of course, once tbe police discover contraband, they\u2019re not going to ignore that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">And so for reasons that I\u2019ve probably articulated, perhaps ad nauseam, the motion to suppress will be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Not Guilty Agreed Statement of Facts Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">On April 18, 2011, the circuit court accepted appellant\u2019s plea of not guilty with an agreed statement of facts. Prior to the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And I do have the advice of rights form that [appellant] has signed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">THE COURT: All right, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019ve signed as well. I have crossed out a number of items that deal with the appeal issues because he would maintain his appeal rights\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Based on the not guilty agreed statement of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">THE COURT: All right, sir, [appellant], you\u2019ve gone over the rights that you give up when you enter a plea of guilty[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] in a criminal case with your lawyer, correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aim\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">THE COURT: And you\u2019ve discussed them with him, you understand what they are, and you have signed this advice of rights form, correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. State, are you satisfied that this matter is being, this plea is being entered voluntarily with full awareness of potential consequences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">THE COURT: All right, thank you. Mr. State, even though I have a memorandum of the agreed facts in this case and the elements of the offense, would you state them for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If I could just interrupt.

There\u2019s a cap of four years un-executed incarceration. The State will enter a nolle prosequi to Counts 2 and 3 at sentencing, and the State will defer to the Court as to [appellant]\u2019s bond status between the date of trial and the date of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[Appellant] will waive any right under Maryland [R]ule 4-345(e) to request a modification of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">Are those the complete terms of the agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A86\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: They are, Your Honor. [Appellant], understanding those terms of the agreement\u2014 Are those the terms of the plea agreement that you and I discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes. What was it about the bond issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIz\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The bond is that the State\u2019s not going to be asking to have your bond revoked\u2014 [APPELLANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The above-referenced advice of rights form\u2014which contains appellant\u2019s name (\u201cBashawn Ray Montgomery\u201d), address, and date of birth\u2014was entered into evidence as an attachment to the not guilty agreed statement of facts. A checkmark in ink appears next to each of the following items on the advice of rights form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">1. What is your name? [\u201cBashawn Montgomery\u201d is handwritten here.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">2. State your address, occupation, and age. How far did you go in school?

By proceeding in a guilty plea, you are giving up your right to contest the evidence. If you were to proceed to trial, I would have the opportunity of making additional motions, such as a motion to suppress, to exclude certain statements, to exclude certain questions from the testimony, to challenge a search or seizure, and to request that the Judge instruct the jury in certain ways as to the law of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">10.

The State read into the record the not guilty agreed statement of facts, which established that law enforcement officers had determined that the credit cards from the wallet were \u201ccounterfeited.\u201d The not guilty agreed statement of facts demonstrated that some of the counterfeited credit cards bore the name \u201cRobert Smith[.]\u201d According to the not guilty agreed statement of facts, the name \u201cRobert Smith\u201d also appeared on a fraudulent identification card with appellant\u2019s photograph that had been found on the unknown juvenile female who had been a passenger in the Expedition. The not guilty agreed statement of facts established that the counterfeited credit cards had been used to purchase Nordstrom gift cards, one of which appellant used on October 4, 2010, to purchase merchandise at Nordstrom. According to the not guilty agreed statement of facts, the Expedition in which appellant had been a passenger on October 5, 2010, contained Nordstrom shopping bags with merchandise therein, of which appellant claimed ownership. After appellant was arrested, \u201c[wjhile at the police station, [appellant] claimed his name was Daylin Seymour on numerous occasions.... Only after [appellant] had been processed by the Commissioner was it determined that [appellant]^ true name was Bashawn Ray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">After the State\u2019s reading of the not guilty agreed statement of facts, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">THE COURT: Any additions, modifications or corrections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. We agree that\u2019s the evidence the State would\u2019ve put forward. I would make a motion for judgment of acquittal and submit, and we rest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">THE COURT: Very well. The motion for judgment of acquittal is denied. The Court finds that there is a sufficient factual predicate in the statement of facts upon which the parties agree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">A. Reasonable Articulable Suspicion to Initiate the Traffic Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in finding that Sergeant White had reasonable articulable suspicion to stop the Expedition in which appellant was a passenger. Appellant argues that the circuit court \u201cconcluded that Sergeant White could not [have known] that the headlights were lawful halogen lights until <em>after </em>he conducted the stop. This is akin to saying that the officer could stop the Expedition because it may or may not have had unlawful headlight equipment.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Appellant asserts that \u201cSergeant White\u2019s belief that the headlights may or may not have emitted an unlawful color ... amounted] to nothing more than a hunch[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The State responds that Sergeant White had reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop of the Expedition in which appellant was a passenger. The State contends that \u201cSergeant White needed only reasonable [articulable] suspicion, and not absolute certainty, of a traffic violation in order to properly stop the Expedition.\u201d The State argues that \u201cSergeant White\u2019s observation that the headlights \u2018were emitting a blue color\u2019 was sufficient to supply\u201d reasonable articulable suspicion.

Probable Cause to Arrest Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"Afs\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>him. Appellant argues that this \u201ccase is easily distinguishable from <em>Pringle </em>and is more closely aligned with <em>Di Re </em>[because] the counterfeited] credit cards were inside a personal wallet, which was inside a personal jacket both of which belonged to [Mashea] and was not \u2018accessible to all.\u2019 \u201d Appellant asserts that because Mashea \u201cclaimed sole ownership of both the jacket and the wallet[, her] admission that the contraband belong[ed] to [her] may dissipate any probable cause\u201d to arrest the remaining passengers. (Citation and emphasis omitted). Appellant maintains that [Mashea]\u2019s \u201cactions were consistent with her sole ownership [because both] of the [other passengers], including [appellant], immediately got out of the Expedition when ordered to do so; however, [Mashea] had to be told three times to get out of the [Expedition], indicating that she had something to hide.\u201d Appellant contends that he \u201chad no dominion or control over [Mashea\u2019s] personal belongings[.]\u201d Appellant concedes that, \u201cwhere it is reasonable for police to believe a common enterprise to commit a crime exists among passengers in a car, there is probable cause to arrest all of the passengers.\u201d Appellant argues, however, that \u201cmere proximity to or association with one suspected of a crime does not provide probable cause to arrest.\u201d Appellant asserts that, unlike drug dealing, credit card counterfeiting \u201cis not so open a crime that passengers in the same vehicle would necessarily be engaged in a joint criminal enterprise particularly when those credit cards are kept in the personal wallet inside the coat of another passenger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The State responds that appellant\u2019s argument \u201cis pure appellate afterthought that has no basis in the record and should not be addressed.\u201d The State contends that appellant\u2019s \u201carrest was a non-issue at the suppression hearing\u201d because \u201c[t]here was no testimony about [appellantj\u2019s arrest[.]\u201d The State argues that the circuit \u201ccourt did not address [appellant\u2019s arrest, and [appellant\u2019s] counsel did not argue as grounds for the motion [to suppress] that [appellant] was arrested without probable cause.\u201d The State asserts that \u201cit would be patently unfair to reverse the [circuit] court based on an argument that neither the State nor the [circuit] court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>any occasion to address, and that the record does not support.\u201d Alternatively, the State maintains that appellant\u2019s \u201cargument is deficient on its face because it makes no connection (and the record does [not] establish any connection) between his supposedly unlawful arrest and the evidence he wishes to suppress[.]\u201d The State does not address the merits of appellant\u2019s argument concerning probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In a reply brief, appellant contends that the issue of probable cause to arrest him is preserved for appellate review because the circuit court found that when law enforcement officers discovered the counterfeited credit cards in the wallet, they had probable cause to arrest all of the passengers. Alternatively, appellant argues that \u201cthe question of whether [law enforcement officers] had probable cause to arrest [appellant] is sufficiently interrelated with the argument made by defense counsel that this Court should treat them as if both were raised.\u201d Appellant asserts that there was a connection between his arrest and the evidence to be suppressed because the discovery of the Nordstrom shopping bags in the vehicle and his statement to law enforcement officers, claiming ownership of the bags, occurred after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">(2) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In <em>Ornelas v.

Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 374, 368, 124 S.Ct. 795, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003), the Supreme Court held that a law enforcement \u201cofficer had probable cause to believe that [the defendant] had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance\u201d where, during a consent search of a vehicle in which the defendant was a passenger, the law enforcement officer discovered controlled substances. Even though the defendant denied owning the drugs, the law enforcement officer had probable cause to arrest him. <em>Id. </em>at 368, 374, 124 S.Ct. 795. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">In this case, [the defendant] was one of three men riding in a Nissan Maxima at 3:16 a.m. There was $763 of rolled-up cash in the glove compartment directly in front of [the defendant]. Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men. Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine. Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe [the defendant] committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">[The defendant]^ attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing. His reliance on <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>[444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979)], and <em>United States v. Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948), is misplaced. In <em>Ybarra, </em>police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance. Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra. Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarra\u2019s pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin. We stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">[A] person\u2019s mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>rise to probable cause to search that person. Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">We held that the search warrant did not permit body searches of all of the tavern\u2019s patrons and that the police could not pat down the patrons for weapons, absent individualized suspicion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">This case is quite different from <em>Ybarra </em>[. The defendant] and his two companions were in a relatively small automobile, not a public tavern. In <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999), we noted that a car passenger\u2014-unlike the unwitting tavern patron in Yba'tra\u2014will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing. Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men. The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">In <em>Di Re, </em>a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place. The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons. There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the driver\u2019s seat and Di Re in the front passenger\u2019s seat. Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons. Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched. After noting that the officers had no information implicating Di Re and no information pointing to Di Re\u2019s possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>eluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime. We said [a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person. No such singling out occurred in this case; none of the three men provided information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><em>Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 371-74, 124 S.Ct. 795 (emphasis added) (some alterations in original) (footnote, internal quotation marks, and some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In <em>Houghton, </em>526 U.S. at 304-05, 119 S.Ct. 1297 the Supreme Court explained that the government has a substantial interest in cases that involve searches of vehicles. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Whereas the passenger\u2019s privacy expectations are, as we have described, considerably diminished, the governmental interests at stake are substantial. Effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired without the ability to search a passenger\u2019s personal belongings when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence of criminal wrongdoing is hidden in the car. As in all car-search cases, the \u201cready mobility\u201d of an automobile creates a risk that the evidence or contraband will be permanently lost while a warrant is obtained. In addition, a car passenger\u2014 unlike the unwitting tavern patron in Ybarra\u2014will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing. A criminal might be able to hide contraband in a passenger\u2019s belongings as readily as in other containers in the car\u2014perhaps even surreptitiously, without the passenger\u2019s knowledge or permission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">(4) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">(a) Whether or Not the Evidence Was Fruit of Appellant\u2019s Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">In this case, we agree with the State that there is no connection between appellant\u2019s arrest and the counterfeited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>credit cards that he moved to suppress.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s arrest is a non-issue with regard to the suppression of the counterfeited credit cards from the wallet of which Mashea claimed ownership. Officer Sheehan asked Mashea for, and received, consent to search the jacket for weapons. After Officer Sheehan discovered a wallet in the jacket, he asked Mashea for, and received, consent to search the wallet for identification. Officer Sheehan then discovered the counterfeited credit cards. Appellant was not arrested until after these events. Thus, Officer Sheehan\u2019s discovery of the contraband-\u2014the counterfeited credit cards that resulted in the instant conviction\u2014-was not a product of the arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule applies to the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d\u2014 that is, evidence that results from law enforcement officers\u2019 unconstitutional actions. <em>See Cox v.

Because Officer Sheehan\u2019s discovery of the counterfeited credit cards did not result from appellant\u2019s arrest, the issue of whether law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest appellant is a question that we need not address with respect to the counterfeited credit cards.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">(b) Probable Cause to Arrest Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">To the extent that appellant challenges his arrest as a basis for suppression of the Nordstrom shopping bags and his statement claiming ownership of them, upon <em>de novo </em>review, we are satisfied that law enforcement officers had probable cause for the arrest.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 373, 124 S.Ct. 795 (\u201c[A] car passenger ... will often be engaged in a common enterprise with\u201d his or her fellow passengers.

Because of the passengers\u2019 suspicious behavior, Officer Sheehan asked the passengers to exit the Expedition.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Officer Sheehan could reasonably have attributed the contraband\u2014a stack of counterfeited credit cards\u2014to appellant because the contraband was accessible to all of the passengers. The counterfeited credit cards were in a wallet that was in a jacket that nobody was wearing. Rather, the jacket was sitting on the backseat floor, where the passengers\u2014including appellant\u2014could have accessed it. Indeed, it would have been easier for appellant, who was sitting in the backseat, to access the jacket than for Mashea, who was sitting in the front seat. Where contraband is in a location that is \u201caccessible to all\u201d of a vehicle\u2019s passengers, law enforcement officers may reasonably believe that the passengers have \u201cknowledge of, and exercise[] dominion and control over,\u201d the contraband. <em>Pringle, </em>540 U.S. at 372, 124 S.Ct. 795 (The Supreme Court held that a law enforcement officer had probable cause to arrest a vehicle\u2019s passenger where cocaine was stored in the backseat\u2019s armrest). Based on the reasonable belief that appellant actually or constructively possessed the counterfeited credit cards, Officer Sheehan had probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">That Mashea claimed ownership of the jacket and the wallet is not dispositive because it does not change the circumstance that the counterfeited credit cards were accessible to appellant. <em>See Stone v.

Ownership of contraband\u2019s container\u2014here, a wallet within a jacket\u2014is merely one of multiple factors to consider when determining possession. <em>See Belote v. State, </em>199 Md.App. 46, 55, 20 A.3d 143 (2011) (This Court noted that \u201cownership or some possessory right in the premises or the automobile in which the contraband is found\u201d is one of four non-exclusive factors to consider in determining possession. (Citation omitted)). We decline to read <em>Pringle </em>as extinguishing probable cause to arrest any other passenger as soon as one passenger claims ownership of contraband. To hold otherwise would allow perpetrators to \u201cthrow themselves on the grenade\u201d by claiming ownership in contraband, thus exculpating others.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Appellant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Pringle </em>and rely on <em>Di Re </em>fails.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the instant case, in addition to the counterfeited credit cards being accessible to appellant, further evidence of appellant\u2019s knowledge of and control over the counterfeited credit cards existed, as appellant and his two fellow passengers, after every question that Officer Sheehan asked, would \u201call look at each other and then one of them would respond with an answer.\u201d (Emphasis added). This suspicious behavior strongly suggested a common enterprise among all of the Expedition\u2019s passengers, including appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion that credit card counterfeiting, unlike using or dealing controlled dangerous substances, \u201cis not so open a crime that passengers in the same vehicle would necessarily be engaged in a joint criminal enterprise[,]\u201d there is no reason to treat possession of counterfeited credit cards any differently from possession of controlled dangerous substances. Criminal statutes govern the possession of both counterfeited credit cards and controlled dangerous substances. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 8\u2014205(b)(3)(i) (\u201cA person may not, with the intent to defraud another[,] possess ... a falsely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>made instrument or device that purports to be a credit card, with knowledge that the instrument or device was falsely made[.]\u201d) (emphasis added); C.L. \u00a7 5-601(a)(l) (\u201c[A] person may not [ Jpossess ... a controlled dangerous substance[.]\u201d) (emphasis added). Appellant points us to no statute or case\u2014 and we find none\u2014pursuant to which counterfeited credit cards belong to a unique class of contraband whose possession cannot be attributed to more than one person. For all the reasons discussed above, we conclude that law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Waiver of the Right to a Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"AqK\">(1) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in determining that appellant knowingly waived the right to a jury trial. Appellant argues that the circuit court \u201chad no basis on which to infer that [appellant\u2019s decision to waive his right to a jury trial was made knowingly.\u201d Appellant asserts that he \u201cwas not adequately informed about the nature of a jury trial[.]\u201d Although appellant concedes that he replied affirmatively when the circuit court asked him whether he had gone over the rights that he would give up by not demanding a jury trial, appellant maintains that \u201cthe record does not disclose the contents of the discussion between [appellant] and his attorney, and in particular whether his attorney ever advised him about the presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Alternatively, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to announce its determination of knowledge on the record, as required by Maryland Rule 4-246(b). Appellant argues that \u201c[a]t no time did the [circuit] court state that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. Nor can the [circuit] court\u2019s language be construed as encompassing a [determination] that the waiver was knowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The State responds that \u201c[t]he record sufficiently established] that [appellant] was aware [of] the nature of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to [a] jury trial when he elected to waive that right.\u201d The State contends that \u201c[t]hese circumstances, in their totality, are sufficient to show a knowing waiver.\u201d The State argues that \u201c[t]he advice of right[s] form filled out and signed by [appellant] shows that he was aware of his right to a jury trial, and was sufficiently informed of the nature of that right.\u201d The State asserts that appellant \u201cconfirmed for the [circuit] court, on the record, that he had reviewed and discussed those rights with his attorney, that he understood them, and that he signed the form.\u201d The State contends that the purported lack of an on-the-record determination of knowledge \u201cdoes not render [appellant]^ waiver deficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The State argues that the purpose of Maryland Rule 4-246(b)\u2019s requirement of an on-the-record announcement \u201cis not to safeguard [a] defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial per se, but [rather] to facilitate a reviewing court\u2019s inquiry into whether [or not] that right was safeguarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Alternatively, the State asserts that the purported lack of an on-the-record announcement was \u201ca \u2018technical rule violation\u2019 subject to [forfeiture<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] and harmless error analysis.\u201d The State maintains that appellant engaged in \u201cgamesmanship\u201d by failing to object below, as he \u201chad no reason to do so because his jury trial waiver was the product of a plea agreement intended to facilitate\u201d the instant appeal. The State contends that any error was harmless because the purported lack of an on-the-record announcement \u201cwas a technical oversight that did not affect the constitutional validity of [appellant\u2019s waiver or the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In a reply brief, appellant contends that his waiver of the right to a jury trial was not knowing because the two documents to which the State points\u2014the advice of rights form and the other document with appellant\u2019s signature\u2014did not inform him that \u201che would be presumed to be innocent or that a jury would consist of twelve persons.\u201d Appellant asserts that the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Boulden, infra, </em>is misplaced because that case \u201cconcerned the timing of compliance with Maryland Rule 4-246[ (b) ], not, as in [his] case, with the failure to comply with the rule at all.\u201d (Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">(2) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">(a) Whether or Not a Waiver of the Right to a Jury Trial Is Knowing</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In <em>Aguilera v.

This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that, [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the [defendant] shall enjoy the right to a jury trial. The Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">A defendant may waive his or her right to a trial by jury and elect instead to be tried by the court.

The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">Although the law does not require the [trial] court to use a specific form of inquiry in determimng whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial is knowing and voluntary, the record must demonstrate an intentional relinquishment of a known right. What questions must be asked will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">In determining whether a waiver is knowing, the [trial] court should seek to ensure that the defendant understands that: (1) the defendant has the right to a trial by jury; (2) unless the defendant waives a trial by jury, the case will be tried by a jury; (3) a jury consists of 12 individuals who reside in the county where the court is sitting, selected at random from a list that includes registered voters, licensed drivers, and holders of identification cards issued by the Motor Vehicle Administration, seated as jurors at the conclusion of a selection process in which the defendant, the defendant\u2019s attorney, and the State participate; (4) all 12 jurors must agree on whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty and may only convict upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (5) if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision, a mistrial will be declared and the State will then have the option of retrying the defendant; and (6) if the defendant waives a jury trial, the court will not permit the defendant to change the election unless the [trial] court finds good cause to permit the change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Maryland Rule 4-246(b)\u2019s committee note) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In <em>Walker v.

To waive the constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury the trial [court] must be satisfied that there has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. Because only the defendant can validly waive his or her right to trial by jury, the defendant must directly respond to the waiver inquiry. Moreover, in determining whether the defendant made the waiver knowingly, we will look to the totality of the circumstances....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">In the case at bar, the record shows that [the defendant] obviously had \u201csome knowledge\u201d of his right to a jury trial, because he (1) made a considered decision to pray a jury trial rather than stand trial in the District Court, (2) had been a criminal defendant in at least one jury trial presided over by the very same [trial] court judge who presided over the case at bar, (3) was represented by counsel, who reached an agreement with the State, pursuant to which the State would drop all but one of several charges then pending against the defendant in the [trial] court, (4) elected to proceed on a \u201cnot guilty agreed statement of facts\u201d in order to preserve for appellate review some issue that was thereafter abandoned, and (5) advised the [trial] court that he understood that he was \u201cwaiving any right to have a jury trial of this matter, as well as a [bench] trial[.]\u201d Under these circumstances, the [trial] court had an adequate basis to determine that [the defendants waiver was knowing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">While it is true that the \u201csome knowledge\u201d requirement includes an on-the-record showing that the defendant knows that (1) a criminal defendant is presumed to be innocent and cannot be convicted unless the trier of fact is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and (2) if the defendant did not waive a jury trial, his or her case would be tried by a jury of twelve persons, it is clear that the requirement was satisfied in the case at bar because it is unreasonable to hypothesize that [the defendant]\u2014having elected a jury trial when facing criminal charges on at last one prior occasion\u2014does not know either the prosecution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>burden of persuasion or the number of persons who would be on the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 378, 382-83, 385, 958 A.2d 915 (citations, footnotes, and some internal quotation marks omitted) (one alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">(b) Procedure for Waiver of the Right to a Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Maryland Rule 4-246(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">A defendant may waive the right to a trial by jury at any time before the commencement of trial.

As to harmless error, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">We also conclude that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the violation of [Maryland] Rule 4-246 constituted harmless error. An error is harmless and does not entitle a defendant to a new trial if the reviewing court is able to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict. Although the rules of procedure are precise rubrics to be strictly followed ...[,] [i]t does not follow, however, that the harmless error doctrine has no application to the Maryland Rules and that a violation of a procedural rule can never be harmless. There is no basis in authority or logic for such a holding. The violations of certain rules, however, because of the nature and purpose of these particular rules, can rarely be deemed harmless error. The right to jury trial and the right to counsel are among such rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">The actual denial of the unwaived right to trial by jury is ordinarily a structural error and is not subject to harmless error review. A structural error is one that amounted to structural defects in the trial itself. Clearly, the violation here of [Maryland] Rule 4-246 was error, though not structural. Thus, we must determine whether [the defendant] was prejudiced by the tardy waiver. If not, then the error was harmless and she is not entitled to a new trial.... [B]ecause [the defendant] waived voluntarily and knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>her right to trial by jury on the record, albeit mid-trial, we similarly do not see how the late waiver, when it was otherwise voluntary and knowing, was prejudicial to [the defendant].

Appellant did not object in the circuit court with regard to any issue as to the waiver of the right to a jury trial. Appellant could have objected to the circuit court\u2019s alleged errors prior to the State\u2019s reading of the not guilty agreed statement of facts or the circuit court\u2019s finding of guilt.

A defendant forfeits the right to appellate review of any issue as to the waiver of the right to a jury trial where the first complaint arises on appeal. <em>See Boulden, </em>414 Md. at 293, 296, 289, 995 A.2d 268 (The Court of Appeals held that, by complaining for the first time on appeal, the defendant forfeited the right to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s failure to announce the waiver of the right to a jury trial on the record until after the State rested.).

Appellant told the circuit court that: (1) he had gone over, with his attorney, the rights that he would give up by not going to trial, and (2) he understood those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>A defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to a jury trial is knowing where the record shows that the defendant, who is represented by counsel, has \u201csome knowledge\u201d of what a jury trial entails. <em>See Walker, </em>406 Md. at 382-83, 958 A.2d 915 (The Court of Appeals held that the defendant knowingly waived the right to a jury trial where the defendant \u201cwas represented by counsel, who reached an agreement with the State, pursuant to which the State would drop all but one of several charges then pending against the defendant in the [trial] court, ... elected to proceed on a \u2018not guilty agreed statement of facts\u2019 ... and ... advised the [trial] court that he understood that he was \u2018waiving any right to have a jury trial of this matter, as well as a [bench] trial[.]\u2019 \u201d (One alteration in original) (footnote omitted)); <em>see also Boulden, </em>414 Md. at 295 n. 5, 995 A.2d 268 (The Court of Appeals listed elements of a jury trial\u2014including that \u201cthe defendant has the right to a trial by jury[,]\u201d that \u201ca jury consists of [twelve] individuals who reside in the county where the court is sitting, selected at random[,]\u201d and that \u201call [twelve] jurors must agree on whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty and may only convict upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\u2014that a trial court should explain to defendant before allowing a waiver of the right to a jury trial.).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that he was not informed that a jury is comprised of twelve persons, or that he would be presumed innocent at a jury trial, fails because appellant was informed of both matters via the advice of rights form, on which appellant placed checkmarks next to the items that stated that \u201cthe jury would consist of twelve persons unless you agree to a lesser number,\u201d and that neither a jury nor the circuit court could convict him unless it found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under the standard of \u201csome knowledge,\u201d the defendant\u2019s knowledge \u201cneed not be \u2018complete\u2019 or \u2018entire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>406 Md. at 379, 958 A.2d 915 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>(citation omitted). Thus, the record need not show that the defendant had full knowledge of a jury trial. <em>See Walker, id. </em>at 379-81, 958 A.2d 915 (The Court of Appeals discussed cases in which the Court held that the defendants knowingly waived the right to a jury trial, even though some elements of a jury <em>trial\u2014e.g. </em>the requirement of unanimity and the jury selection process\u2014were not explained to the defendants.). For all the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in accepting the not guilty agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">(b)(ii) Merits as to the Circuit Court\u2019s Compliance with Maryland Rule 4-246(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Having determined that appellant has forfeited the right to appellate review of the issue, we nonetheless are equally satisfied that the circuit court complied with Maryland Rule 4-246(b), pursuant to which a trial court may not accept a waiver of the right to a jury trial until the trial court \u201cdetermines and announces on the record that the waiver is made knowingly[.]\u201d We note initially that, \u201c[ajlthough [Maryland] Rule 4-246 provides the procedures for waiver of the right to trial by jury, the ultimate inquiry regarding the validity of a waiver is whether there has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right[.]\u201d <em>Boulden, </em>414 Md. at 295, 995 A.2d 268 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, appellant knowingly waived his right to a jury trial. The issue of whether the circuit court followed procedure is secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Upon review of all of the circumstances here, we conclude that the circuit court complied with Maryland Rule 4-246(b)\u2019s requirement that its determination of knowledge be announced on the record. The circuit court announced its determination in the form of a leading question that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>addressed to the prosecutor: \u201cMr. State, are you satisfied that this matter is being, this plea is being entered voluntarily with full awareness of potential consequences?\u201d The prosecutor responded in the affirmative. The circuit court was under no obligation to obtain the State\u2019s approval before accepting the not guilty agreed statement of facts. By asking the question, the circuit court demonstrated its awareness that a waiver of the right to a jury trial must be made knowingly. Implicit in the circuit court\u2019s question was its understanding and determination that the waiver of the right to a jury trial had been entered knowingly. The circuit court effectively determined on-the-record that the waiver of the right to a jury trial was knowingly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">We decline to hold that the circuit court erred simply by announcing its determination with respect to the not guilty agreed statement of facts in the form of a leading question rather than a declarative sentence, <em>e.g. </em>\u201cI find that his plea is being entered voluntarily with full awareness of its potential consequences.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A trial court complies with Maryland Rule 4-246(b) by stating its determination on the record in an intelligible form. <em>See Aguilera, </em>193 Md.App. at 439, 997 A.2d 888 (Maryland Rule 4-246(b) does not require a trial court to \u201cengage in any fixed litany.\u201d (Citations omitted)). For all the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in accepting appellant\u2019s waiver of the right to a jury trial under Maryland Rule 4-246(b).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Alternatively, we conclude that any error in complying with Maryland Rule 4-246(b) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As discussed above, appellant knowingly waived the right to a jury trial. Announcing the determination that appellant knowingly waived the right to a jury trial would not have changed the case\u2019s outcome or affected the content of the not guilty agreed statement of facts that led to the convictions. Thus, any technical rule violation by the circuit court did not prejudice appellant. A trial court\u2019s error in following Maryland Rule 4-246(b)\u2019s procedural requirements is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the error does not prejudice the defendant. <em>See Boulden, </em>414 Md. at 305, 308, 995 A.2d 268 (The trial court\u2019s failure to announce the defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to a jury trial on the record until after the State rested was \u201ca technical rule violation\u201d that constituted harmless error because the defendant \u201cwaived voluntarily and knowingly her right to trial by jury on the record[.]\u201d). In this case, any failure by the circuit court to follow Maryland Rule 4-246(b)\u2019s procedural requirements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

A not guilty agreed statement of facts is not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea where a defendant pleads not guilty to preserve for appellate review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>See Ward v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 664, 672-73, 451 A.2d 1243 (1982). For purposes of the instant appeal, however, the circuit court's use of the term \"a plea of guilty\u201d is not relevant because, regardless of whether appellant pled guilty or proceeded by way of a not guilty agreed statement of facts, appellant waived the right to a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\">.

On brief, appellant argues that Sergeant White lacked reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop because Sergeant White could not have been certain as to whether the Expedition\u2019s headlamps were halogen lights, which, according to the circuit court, \"are not illegal as far as I know.\u201d But regardless of whether or not the Expedition\u2019s headlamps were halogen lights, Sergeant White believed that they emitted blue light\u2014thus violating Section 22-203(b) of the Transportation Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. On brief, appellant alleges that Sergeant White admitted that the Expedition's headlamps did not violate any part of the traffic code and that he did not issue a repair order. Appellant bases these allegations on the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now with regard to the lights, you did not issue a traffic citation for any type of illegal traffic light under the traffic code, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">[SERGEANT WHITE]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So would you agree with me there was no actual, in the Maryland traffic code, there was no violation that was committed with regards to the lights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">[SERGEANT WHITE]: It would be a repair order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">This exchange establishes only that Sergeant White did not cite Norris for the illegal headlamps. Contrary to appellant\u2019s allegations, Sergeant White did not admit that the Expedition\u2019s headlamps did not violate any part of the traffic code or that he did not issue a repair order.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">More importantly, that Sergeant White supposedly did not issue a repair order is not relevant because reasonable articulable suspicion turns only on what the law enforcement officer observed prior to the initial traffic stop, not what the law enforcement officer did after the initial traffic stop. <em>See Williams, </em>401 Md. at 686, 934 A.2d 38. That the headlamps supposedly were not illegal and that they supposedly merited only a repair order is not relevant because the \"the State has no ... burden of proving a violation to justify an officer\u2019s action at the <em>initial investigatory stage </em>....

The issue of whether law enforcement officers had probable cause to arrest appellant is preserved for appellate review because it was raised in the circuit court. Ironically, it was the prosecutor who raised the issue in the circuit court by arguing: \"[A]t that point, just as if drugs had been discovered, they\u2019ve got probable cause to arrest everybody.\u201d Afterward, the circuit court, ruling from the bench, endorsed the State's position by stating: \"[Ojnce the police discover contraband, they're not going to ignore that.\u201d That appellant did not mention probable cause while arguing before the circuit court is not relevant. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a), to be preserved for appellate review, an issue simply needs to be \u201craised in or decided by the trial court,\u201d regardless of which party raises the issue. <em>See Webb v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 580, 595, 589, 971 A.2d 949 (2009) (This Court considered an issue to be preserved, even though the State, not the defendant, raised the issue in the trial court.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">. At trial, the State conceded that, because Sergeant White cited Norris rather than arresting him, law enforcement officers could not have legally searched the Expedition as a search incident to arrest. <em>See Knowles v.

We do not reach the issue of whether law enforcement officers could have legally searched the Expedition before discovering the counterfeited credit cards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">. It is undisputed that the counterfeited credit cards were discovered before appellant\u2019s arrest. At oral argument, as to the counterfeited credit cards, appellant contended that, pursuant to <em>Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210, a trial court may suppress contraband that was discovered before a defendant's arrest if there is a lack of probable cause for the arrest. We disagree. In <em>Di Re, id. </em>at 592, 68 S.Ct. 222 the Supreme Court held that the defendant was illegally arrested with a lack of probable cause. The Court concluded that law enforcement officers did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant merely because he was sitting in the same vehicle as a person who, according to an informant's tip, was selling contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 583, 68 S.Ct. 222. After the defendant was arrested, he complied with law enforcement officers\u2019 request to empty his pockets, which contained contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 68 S.Ct. 222. Thus, <em>Di Re </em>is inapposite here, where contraband\u2014namely, counterfeited credit cards\u2014were discovered before appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. At oral argument, appellant contended that his arrest preceded the discovery of the Nordstrom shopping bags and his statement claiming ownership of the Nordstrom merchandise. Although there was no testimony about the Nordstrom shopping bags, the record suggests that law enforcement officers did not discover the Nordstrom shopping bags\u2014and appellant did not make the statements about the Nordstrom shopping bags\u2014until after Officer Sheehan discovered the counterfeited credit cards. The record leaves unclear whether law enforcement officers\u2019 discovery of the Nordstrom shopping bags\u2014as well as appellant\u2019s statements about the Nordstrom shopping bags\u2014occurred before or after appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">.
