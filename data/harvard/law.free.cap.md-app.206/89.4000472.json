Law Art. (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 2-201 (first-degree murder); C.L. \u00a7 4-204 (use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence). On September 29, 2010, the circuit court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and nineteen years\u2019 imprisonment consecutive for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, the first five years to be served without parole. Appellant noted an appeal raising three issues, which we quote and re-order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">I. Whether the [circuit] court erred by admitting extensive gang-related evidence, including expert testimony, that [appellant] was a member of the Black G[uer]rilla Family gang?[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">II. Whether the [circuit] court erred by asking the venire a \u201cCSI\u201d type voir dire question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">III. Whether the [circuit] court erred by admitting evidence that [appellant attempted to call] his friend, Austin Lockwood, an individual who would later testify as a State\u2019s witness at [appellant\u2019s] trial, from jail?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer each question in the negative. As such, we shall affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">On February 21, 2009, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Officer Bernard Cox of the Baltimore City Police Department received a call to report to the 2500 block of West Baltimore Street in Baltimore City for a shooting. Upon arrival, Officer Cox found the body of Hubert Dickerson, Jr. and a large number of shell casings in the area. Officer Cox notified the homicide division, and Detectives Robert Dohony and Julian Min assumed responsibility for the investigation. The medical examiner determined that Dickerson died as a consequence of multiple gunshot wounds. On April 17, 2009, appellant was indicted in connection with the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Motion Concerning Gang-Related Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On July 20, 2010, prior to the start of trial, the State moved to introduce evidence that the shooting was related to appellant\u2019s membership in the Black Guerrilla Family (\u201cBGF\u201d) gang. The State advised that it intended to introduce fact evidence to establish that the motive for the offense was related to appellant\u2019s membership in the BGF, and to call Sergeant Dennis Workley of the Baltimore City Police Department as an expert in the area of gangs to testify about the workings of the BGF and appellant\u2019s tattoos, and to opine that appellant is a BGF member. According to the State, appellant\u2019s gang affiliation was directly connected to the issues of identity and motive and, therefore, admissible under Maryland Rule 5-404(b). In addition to the above, the State advised that, \u201cassuming that the[] witnesses recant[ed] and their statements c[a]me in, [it] intended] to put on [Sergeant] Workley who has previously [been] qualified as a gang expert to testify as to what BGF is, [and] what they do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel contended that \u201cwhether or not [appellant] is in the [BGF] or is not in the [BGF] ha[d] absolutely nothing to do with this case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that such evidence was not admissible as proof of either identity or motive, and that \u201c[a]ll the State wants to do is poison the well because of the bad publicity everybody gets from the [BGF].\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel concluded: \u201cI think the prejudice outweighs the probative value and I don\u2019t really think that the [BGF] had anything to do with this shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">After hearing argument from counsel, the circuit court determined that the gang-related evidence, including fact and expert testimony, was admissible to explain \u201c... why [appellant] is the person who did the shooting!.]\u201d The circuit court ruled orally from the bench as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">All right. Based upon my understanding at this time and in what was presented to me before, I am prepared to allow this information to come in. I believe that it is relevant in that the theory of the State\u2019s case as all parties seem to consider that the murder was as a result of a debt that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>owed, but why [appellant] is the person who did the shooting because a debt was owed to Bam[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] involves a question of their relationship. That their relationship that the State is prepared to prove involves the [BGF]\u2014I believe makes that relevant evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">Also, the fact that in Mr. Falcon\u2019s[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] recorded statement, he claims to have been in an encounter between Bam whose name we will bring out later and [appellant] in which [appellant] is praised for doing the shooting, he came in saying ... That\u2019s my boy. Straight G[uer]rilla. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an insult. I believe that is praise and based upon that, I think that it is part and parcel of communications between possible co-conspirators here, but there is a way to avoid the prejudice involved. We\u2019ve taken step number one already. We voir dired the jury to make sure that the mention of gangs is not something that would affect their ability to be fair and impartial and when the time comes for me to instruct the jury at the end of the trial, I\u2019ll want proposed instructions from each one of you about how I should address this and why the information was allowed so as to minimize the prejudice if any that is attended to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">After the circuit court\u2019s ruling, the following exchange occurred between appellant\u2019s counsel and the court when appellant\u2019s counsel sought clarification as to making objections during trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I was wondering since any mention of the [BGF] obviously, you know, I\u2019m going to be objecting to that and I\u2019ve heard you ma[k]e your ruling---- [D]o I have to get up and object every single time the word [BGF] comes in or can I have a continuing objection to anything that has to do with the [BGF] because I don\u2019t think it should be mentioned in this trial. If you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>want me to get up and make an objection every time, I will, but I just want to make sure the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">THE COURT: I understand exactly what you\u2019re saying, [appellant\u2019s counsel,] and this is a complex area with the continuing objection because if you\u2014if I don\u2019t allow the continuing objection, you will underline the fact that you consider it to be prejudicial every time it\u2019s mentioned and I will allow you a continuing objection except as to matters that we have not discussed here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">THE COURT: All right. If it\u2019s something beyond what we have talked about, about these witnesses who are on tape and whose commitment to testifying is questioned, to the extent that it\u2019s mentioned by them, with them, to them and from them, I\u2019ll allow your continuing objection. To the extent that it comes in beyond that from someone, I\u2019ll want you to object. To the extent that the State is bringing in people to explain what this reference means, your objection before they testify will be sufficient for that. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. So, just, I think I understand what you\u2019re saying. Are you saying like if they try to bring experts in, I should object again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">THE COURT: You\u2019ll object before the expert testifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">THE COURT: And the experts won\u2019t be testifying until it\u2019s relevant for them to do so. So, at that time, I can reconsider the decision that I\u2019ve made here, but you object. That gives me a chance to reconsider it. As to these statements that we\u2019re going over and the opening statement from the State, you don\u2019t have to object to that because I am specifically now ruling that that is going to be admissible evidence. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">At trial, Dominick Falcon testified as a witness for the State. Falcon\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that he had made to detectives, incriminating appellant, following the shooting. As such, during Falcon\u2019s testimony, the State introduced as substantive evidence an audio recording of an interview Falcon had with detectives on March 4, 2009. In the interview, Falcon stated that he heard appellant say, \u201cI just killed a boy. That\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to do it[.]\u201d Falcon told law enforcement officers that, after the shooting, he heard Bam praise appellant, saying \u201cthat\u2019s my boy, straight G[uer]rilla.\u201d Falcon explained that \u201cGuerrilla\u201d meant \u201cbeing in a gang. BGF, Black G[uer]rilla Family.\u201d Falcon also stated that appellant\u2019s nickname is \u201c69\u201d and that Barn\u2019s nickname is \u201cBootsy and Bam for real.\u201d The following exchange occurred between Falcon and Detective Min:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">DETECTIVE MIN: Okay, Bootsy or Bam and that\u2019s the nickname on the street and they\u2019re a member of BGF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">MR. FALCON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">DETECTIVE MIN: Okay. What do those letters stand for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">MR. FALCON: Black G[uer]rilla Family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In the interview, Falcon stated that, during the conversation with appellant, appellant stated \u201cthat he actually shot the boy, shot him on Baltimore and Shipley[.]\u201d Falcon identified appellant from a photographic array and wrote on the back of the array, \u201cWe had a conversation ... He [appellant] was bragging about killing a boy on Baltimore Street. He was saying that\u2019s how you were supposed to do the job, not a half job. I had this conversation with 69.\u201d Falcon also identified Bam from a photographic array and wrote on the back of the array, \u201c[h]e was there too and they were talking about that\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to do the damn thing. Bam told 69 to kill him and Bam was saying, that\u2019s my f[ ] son. That\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Falcon told detectives that Bam was the boss and that appellant was a hit man for Bam. During Falcon\u2019s interview, Falcon and Detective Min had the following exchange as to Bam and appellant\u2019s relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>DETECTIVE MIN: And you were telling me about the relationship between 69 and Bam and what was the relationship between them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">MR. FALCON: They like, Bam like, like the head owner for real guy. They say so and they listen to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">DETECTIVE MIN: The boss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">MR. FALCON: Yes, he was the boss, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">DETECTIVE MIN: And does 69 work for Bam[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">MR. FALCON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">DETECTIVE MIN: Okay and how do you know this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">MR. FALCON: Cause I see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">DETECTIVE MIN: What do you mean see it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">MR. FALCON: Like, I used to work for him too. DETECTIVE MIN: You used to work for Bam too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">MR. FALCON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">DETECTIVE MIN: What did you do for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-15\">MR. FALCON: Selling heroin and cocainfe] for real.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At8\">DETECTIVE MIN: So possibly, 69 is like a hit man for Bam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">MR. FALCON: Yeah, he like a hit man for real.... Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af9\">DETECTIVE MIN: Okay and you say he always carries a gun with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-17\">MR. FALCON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">At trial, Falcon testified that he lied to law enforcement officers when he told them that appellant admitted to committing the murder. Falcon testified that he lied during the March 4, 2009, interview, because law enforcement officers found cocaine and marijuana on him and he was scared, so he \u201ccame up with a lie.\u201d Falcon testified that he had no firsthand knowledge of appellant admitting to the crime. Detective Min, however, testified that no drugs were found on Falcon when law enforcement picked him up for the interview. Detective Min testified that, during the interview, Falcon told law enforcement officers that his life would be in danger if he testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Austin Lockwood testified at trial as a witness for the State, and his testimony was inconsistent with a statement that he had made to detectives, incriminating appellant, after the shooting. As a result, during Lockwood\u2019s testimony, the State introduced as substantive evidence an audio recording of an interview Lockwood had with detectives on March 5, 2009. In the interview, Lockwood stated that appellant is a member of the BGF. At a point, during trial, the recording was stopped, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... This is [when] we\u2019re going to get into all that stuff about the [BGF]. I still have a continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">THE COURT: You have an objection and I have allowed the tape in completely. So, [your] objection was previously noted as to the tape ... and those portions of the tape that come in.... All right. We\u2019ll continue with the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">(Taped statement of Austin Lockwood played for the Court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cDETECTIVE PURTELL: [Appellant]^ part of an organization, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">MR. LOCKWOOD: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">DETECTIVE PURTELL: And would you tell us the name of the organization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">MR. LOCKWOOD: BGF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">DETECTIVE PURTELL: Is this a violent group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">MR. LOCKWOOD: Yeah, extortion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">DETECTIVE PURTELL: Extortion, violence and where are they primarily? Are they in the jails? Are they in the streets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-15\">MR. LOCKWOOD: They\u2019re in jails, the jails, but it overlaps in the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-16\">DETECTIVE PURTELL: It overlaps to the street and are you a member of BGF?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-17\">MR. LOCKWOOD: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>DETECTIVE PURTELL: So, if you would go over to the jail, there would be some safety issues; is that correct? [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">MR. LOCKWOOD: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">DETECTIVE PURTELL: Cause you\u2019re not BGF and the suspect 69 is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">MR. LOCKWOOD: Yeah, that\u2019s right.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In the interview, Lockwood advised the detectives that appellant is known as \u201c69,\u201d and that \u201c \u201869\u2019 murdered a guy on Baltimore Street.\u201d Lockwood described the events on the night of the shooting as follows: \u201cDude was walking and \u201969\u2019 approached him, did some business stuff and shot him and killed him.\u201d Lockwood explained that \u201cbusiness stuff\u201d meant that the victim owed \u201c69\u201d money. Lockwood told the detectives that he was \u201c[rjight up the street,\u201d had a clear view of the shooting, and it was definitely \u201c69\u201d who had fired the gun. Detective Min testified that he was present for the interview and Lockwood identified appellant as the shooter from a photographic array. On the back of the photographic array, Lockwood wrote: \u201c69 murdered the guy on the corner on Friday, 21st of \u201809. 69 is the person in the picture. I saw 69 sho[o]t the man[.j\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In contrast, at trial, Lockwood testified that although he recalled speaking with detectives prior to trial on March 5, 2009, he did not recall the content of the conversation. Lockwood testified that he made statements to law enforcement officers during the interview because he had been in a fight with appellant, and Bam told him that he wanted appellant off the street. Lockwood testified that he, in fact, did not see appellant \u201cdo anything\u201d and that he had previously attempted to explain that to the court. Detective Min testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Lockwood told law enforcement officers he was afraid that appellant, who was his roommate from \u201ctime to time[,]\u201d would kill him \u201cas soon as the interview was over[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Joshua Johnson, who knew appellant for approximately a year at the time of trial, spoke with homicide detectives about the murder prior to trial and testified as a witness for the State. Detective Min testified that Johnson had been arrested on drug charges and told detectives that he had information relating to the homicide. At trial, Johnson testified initially that he \u201creally [couldn\u2019t] remember\u201d any conversations he overheard related to the murder. Later, however, Johnson testified that he overheard \u201c69\u201d say that he killed somebody. Johnson testified that appellant said that someone owed Bam money, and that Bam instructed appellant to kill this person. When asked whether people are afraid of appellant and Bam, Johnson testified, \u201cYeah.\u201d Johnson testified that appellant said he used a .45 caliber \u201cglock\u201d gun to shoot the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Ashley Sparrow testified at trial as a witness for the State. Like Lockwood\u2019s and Falcon\u2019s, Sparrow\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with a statement that she had made to detectives following the shooting. As a result, during Sparrow\u2019s testimony, the State introduced as substantive evidence an audio recording of an interview Sparrow had with detectives on February 27-28, 2009. In the interview, Sparrow stated that she overheard a conversation between \u201c69\u201d and \u201cStacks.\u201d When \u201cStacks\u201d asked \u201c69,\u201d \u201cIs that n[] dead?,\u201d Sparrow heard \u201c69\u201d respond, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead, but I know I popped his a[ ].\u201d Sparrow stated that she \u201ckind of figured they w[ere] talking about the guy on Baltimore Street[.]\u201d During the interview, Sparrow identified Bam and \u201c69\u201d from photographic arrays.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In contrast, at trial, Sparrow testified that, although she recalled speaking with detectives, she was intoxicated 'And high at the time and did not remember anything that she said. Sparrow testified that she could not recall anything about the photographic arrays. Sparrow testified that she never heard appellant say that he shot someone. Detective Min testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>that, when Sparrow spoke with detectives on February 27, 2009, she did not appear to be intoxicated or high. Detective Min testified that Sparrow told him that she would not testify in court because she would be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, Sergeant Dennis Workley of the Baltimore City Police Department testified as an expert witness for the State in the field of gangs, gang membership, gang insignia, gang ranking, and gang identification. Sergeant Workley gave testimony on the following topics: (1) the history and structure of the BGF, (2) the Division of Corrections\u2019s classification of appellant as a member of the BGF and appellant\u2019s membership in the gang, and (3) appellant\u2019s tattoos. Sergeant Workley testified that the BGF is a prominent prison gang in Maryland and that it controls \u201cmost of the jails in the State[,]\u201d \u201cwhat goes on inside[,j\u201d \u201cthe narcotic trade inside\u201d the jails, and \u201cthe inflow of information going back and forth\u201d from outside to inside of the jails. Sergeant Workley testified that the BGF is run like a business, uses it own language, ranks its members, and has a published constitution that outlines the gang\u2019s rules. The State asked Sergeant Workley, \u201c[a]nd has the Department of Corrections listed [appellant] as a member of the [BGF]?,\u201d to which Sergeant Workley replied, \u201c[y]es, they have.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the question or response. A certified copy of the Division of Corrections\u2019s records listing appellant as a gang member, State\u2019s Exhibit No. 36, was not admitted into evidence. Sergeant Workley testified that, in his opinion, appellant is a member of the BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Sergeant Workley examined pictures of appellant\u2019s tattoos and testified that several of the tattoos had gang-related meanings. For example, Sergeant Workley testified that tattoos of \u201cBaltimore\u201d and \u201cFranklin,\u201d on the outside of appellant\u2019s right and left forearms, indicated the area in which appellant does business, that a tattoo of a weapon and \u201c187,\u201d on the inside of appellant\u2019s left forearm, stood for \u201ca penal code in California for homicide[,]\u201d that an \u201cOG\u201d tattoo, on appellant\u2019s left forearm, meant \u201coriginal gangster\u201d and corresponded to a tattoo of \u201cwork real, real n[ ] don\u2019t die[,]\u201d also on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>appellant\u2019s left forearm, that another tattoo of weapons, on appellant\u2019s left bicep, stood for \u201cdeath before dishonor[,]\u201d and that appellant had tattooed his \u201cstreet name\u201d (\u201cSixx 9\u201d) on his left pectoral muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">During Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s tattoos, the following exchange occurred during a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... I just want to make sure ... I\u2019ve objected properly for the record .... to the best of what I\u2019ve heard in the case, nobody ever said that this was a gang ordered hit. So, that\u2019s why I have to object to all this stuff about, about the gang and the prejudice is outweighing the probative value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Then you have these tattoos that have guns. These tattoos have death before dishonor and all this other stuff and this is a, this is a murder case and none of this stuff has anything to do with the identification of [appellant] involved in this particular murder. It isn\u2019t like anybody said, I saw this tattoo. I saw anything. So, we\u2019ve got a murder case and I just think that the prejudice clearly outweighs the probative value. It poisons the well for the jury. So, that\u2019s why I have to object to all of these and any of [Sergeant Workley]\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">THE COURT: All right____ I understand your objections .... Because we have witnesses who have changed their testimony from the time that they met with the police shortly after this event to, to taking four different tac[k]s of denying their statements. One said that he lied because he was ordered to do so by Bam, to lie on [appellant]. Another said, he doesn\u2019t remember anything about what he said, but then in Court, identified and said, oh yeah, I did say that. That\u2019s what it was. The third person said that she was drunk and didn\u2019t know anything about any of these statements.

I think because of the way in which the information came from the reluctant witnesses, it is unavoidable. Had the witnesses not been and I am satisfied afraid to testify, we could have kept this all out, but because they changed their testimony because I am satisfied they were afraid to testify truthfully, then everything they said virtually has to come in to explain why they\u2019ve changed their testimony. It is something of ... a very negative side [e]ffect of witnesses being afraid not to testify because if they testify, we can focus on their testimony. If they don\u2019t testify and rely on what they have said in the past, it\u2019s virtually everything they\u2019ve said in the past comes in. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s part of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Now, the witness who is before us now and the evidence that we\u2019re considering is only for the purpose of establishing whether or not [appellant] is a member of a gang.

Because neither side advanced an instruction, the circuit court proposed an instruction concerning the gang-related evidence. In response to the circuit court\u2019s proposed instruction, appellant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI\u2019m in a bad spot because I\u2019m objecting to all the gang stuff coming in and I\u2019m going to try to come up with an instruction to cure it. So, I\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>leave it with the Court.\u201d The circuit court solicited suggestions and told the parties that it could \u201calso give nothing.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cWell, I certainly want something that he\u2019s not being charged with any crime of being in a gang.\u201d At the end of the discussion, the circuit court noted: \u201cAll parties are in agreement.

The State argued that the telephone call was relevant because it demonstrated that appellant was attempting to locate Lockwood to intimidate him and prevent him from testifying, and because it would assist in explaining why Lockwood would change his story and recant his eyewitness identification of appellant at trial. In response, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that at the time of the call on October 5, 2009, appellant did not know the names of the witnesses in the case against him as the State had only provided numbers (\u201cwitness number one, witness number two[,]\u201d etc.), rather than names. The circuit court observed that, although appellant was not told the names of the witnesses, \u201c[tjhere\u2019s a big difference between not knowing and not being told. Not being told and knowing is almost evidence of guilt.\u201d After hearing argument from both parties, the circuit court denied the motion to exclude the telephone call, ruling orally from the bench, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>I mean, ... if it means anything, it means well\u2014it is open to the interpretation the State\u2019s presenting or it\u2019s open to an interpretation that means absolutely nothing. That\u2019s the art of arguing what the evidence is, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a reason to exclude the evidence. It is evidence that will not cause us to go off on any type of tangent and it is consistent and [the] motion to exclude the conversation of October 5, 2009 is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">At trial, Sergeant Monique Mitchell testified, as a witness for the State, about the procedures for recording inmate telephone calls at the Baltimore City Detention Center. During Sergeant Mitchell\u2019s testimony, the State moved to play State\u2019s Exhibit No. 24, the CD of the October 5, 2009, telephone call to Lockwood, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1L\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, with the Court\u2019s permission, I\u2019ve marked for identification as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 24, the CD and I would like to play that for [Sergeant] Mitchell to hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">THE COURT: Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m objecting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">THE COURT: Come on up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just want to play the initial part of what she\u2019s talking about, first and then have her go into more detail about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">THE COURT: Well, what\u2019s your, what\u2019s the basis of your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: This is not, just let me make sure I understand.

The Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred by admitting gang-related evidence, specifically, the pretrial statements by Lockwood and Falcon, as well as Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony concerning the BGF. Appellant argues that the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the BGF and appellant\u2019s involvement with the gang were not relevant to the issues in the case as there was no evidence that the murder was gang-related and, even if \u201cminimally relevant,\u201d the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Appellant asserts that there \u201cwas absolutely no evidence admitted at trial that the victim of the shooting was a member of a rival gang, did anything to provoke the ire of the BGF, or was in any way connected with the BGF[,]\u201d or that the victim owed money to anyone. Appellant maintains that the circuit court abused its discretion by allowing Sergeant Workley to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>testify about the BGF, appellant\u2019s tattoos, and appellant\u2019s classification as a gang member by the Division of Corrections, and to offer the opinion that appellant was a member of the BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant acknowledges that it was permissible for- the State to present evidence that witnesses recanted their statements because of fear, but maintains that it was not permissible for the witnesses to testify that the reason for their fear was his gang affiliation. Appellant argues that Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony \u201cran too far afield\u201d from explaining witnesses\u2019 recantations, and that the jury did not need expert testimony to \u201cunderstand that it is reasonable for a citizen to fear a gang member.\u201d Appellant contends that the admission of the gang-related evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as there was no physical evidence linking him to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The State responds that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting gang-related evidence for the purpose of explaining the reason the witnesses recanted statements previously provided to law enforcement officers. The State contends that the circuit court properly determined that the gang-related testimony was relevant and admissible because it explained inconsistencies between the witnesses\u2019 pretrial statements and trial testimony. The State argues that, under the circumstances of the case, the circuit court appropriately found that evidence of appellant\u2019s relationship with Bam, including that appellant was a member of the BGF, as well as evidence concerning the BGF generally, \u201cwas relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of the in-court testimony given by Lockwood, Johnson, Sparrow and Falcon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The State maintains that, because appellant failed to present any argument on appeal in support of the contention that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, this Court should decline to address the issue. On the merits, the State argues that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in determining that the danger of unfair prejudice did not sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>stantially outweigh the probative value of the gang-related evidence. Alternatively, the State asserts that any error in admission of the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, given: (1) the circuit court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>question, asking whether jurors could be fair and impartial even if evidence demonstrated that appellant had a connection to a gang; and (2) the circuit court\u2019s limiting jury instruction as to how the gang-related evidence was to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">In a reply brief, appellant contends that \u201cthe threshold requirement established in <em>[Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 32 A.3d 2 (2011) ] to allow for expert testimony regarding the [BGF] has simply not been met in this ease[,]\u201d as the State failed to present evidence that the BGF was connected to the shooting. Relying on <em>Gutierrez, </em>appellant argues that expert testimony is permissible only if the crime itself is gang-related, and that the State failed to explain how expert testimony would assist the jury in understanding the reason for the witnesses\u2019 recantations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In <em>Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 485-86, 32 A.3d 2 the Court of Appeals outlined the applicable standard of review as to the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Maryland Rules 5-702 through 5-706 govern expert testimony. Specifically, [Maryland] Rule 5-702 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">In <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977), this Court articulated the standard of review for the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal. It is well settled, however, that the trial court\u2019s determination is reviewable on appeal, and may be reversed if founded on an error of law or some serious mistake, or if the trial court has clearly abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 372 A.2d at 1074-75 (quotation marks and citations omitted). A reviewing court may find an abuse of discretion where the prejudice of the admitted testimony outweighs its probative value. <em>See State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 641, 552 A.2d 896, 901 (1989). Prejudice that would \u201coutweigh probative value involves more than mere damage to the opponent\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State v.

State, </em>361 Md. 580, 591-92, 762 A.2d 125 (2000), the Court of Appeals discussed the concept of relevance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">Relevance is a relational concept. Accordingly, an item of evidence can be relevant only when, through proper analysis and reasoning, it is related logically to a matter at issue in the case, <em>i.e., </em>one that is properly provable in the case. In order to find that such a relationship exists, the trial court must be satisfied that the proffered item of evidence is, on its face or otherwise, what the proponent claims that item to be, and, if so, that its admission increase or decreases the probability of the existence of a material fact. Moreover, the relevancy determination is not made in isolation. Instead, the test of relevance is whether, in conjunction with all other relevant evidence, the evidence tends to make the proposition asserted more or less probable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">(Citations omitted).

State, </em>412 Md. 593, 615, 989 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>A.2d 232 (2010), the Court discussed the balancing test provided in Maryland Rule 5-403 and the concept of prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Q\">[T]he fact that evidence prejudices one party or the other, in the sense that it hurts his or her case, is not the undesirable prejudice referred to in [Maryland] Rule 5-403. Evidence may be unfairly prejudicial if it might influence the jury to disregard the evidence or lack of evidence regarding the particular crime with which he is being charged. The more probative the evidence is of the crime charged, the less likely it is that the evidence will be unfairly prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">It has been said that [probative value is outweighed by the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice when the evidence produces such an emotional response that logic cannot overcome prejudice or sympathy needlessly injected into the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aah\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">(1) Maryland Case Law-Gangs</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Maryland appellate courts have reviewed the admission of gang-related evidence under circumstances in which the evidence was relevant to establish motive or identity, and where the offense was found to be \u201cgang-related.\u201d In <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 664, 666, 923 A.2d 952, <em>cert. denied, </em>401 Md. 173, 931 A.2d 1095 (2007), this Court held that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting gang-related evidence, including expert testimony, as \u201cthe evidence was highly probative in establishing motive and was not unduly prejudicial under the circumstances.\u201d In <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 651-52, 923 A.2d 952, \u201c[t]he State presented evidence that Ayala and his two accomplices were members of \u2018MS-13,\u2019 a violent Latino gang.

Detective Porter opined that Ayala was a member of MS-13, and that Ayala, in a fight against a member of a rival gang, \u201ccould not just sit by and do nothing\u201d or else he \u201cwould have been disciplined[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 923 A.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">With Judge Arrie W.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">(1) Gang Evidence in Witnesses\u2019 Pretrial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Returning to the case at hand, we begin by addressing the question of whether the circuit court properly admitted portions of the pretrial statements by Lockwood and Falcon concerning the BGF-namely, that Bam and appellant were members of the BGF and that appellant committed the murder at Barn\u2019s behest. We see no abuse of discretion on the circuit court\u2019s part in admitting the evidence. This was fact evidence demonstrating that the crime was motivated by gang affiliations. In his pretrial statement, Lockwood stated that appellant was part of the BGF. In his pretrial statement, Falcon told detectives that Bam was the \u201chead owner for real guy,\u201d or boss, and that appellant was \u201ca hit man for real\u201d for Bam. Falcon told detectives that he overheard Bam say in reference to appellant, \u201cthat\u2019s my boy, straight G[uer]rilla.\u201d Falcon explained that \u201cGuerrilla\u201d meant \u201cbeing in a gang. BGF, Black G[uer]rilla Family.\u201d When asked by Detective Min whether Bam and appellant were members of the BGF, Falcon responded \u201c[y]es.\u201d At trial, Johnson testified, without objection, that appellant said that someone owed Bam money and that Bam had instructed appellant to kill the person. Lockwood\u2019s and Falcon\u2019s pretrial statements, coupled with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Johnson\u2019s testimony, constituted highly probative fact evidence establishing a motive for the offense-that Bam and appellant were BGF members, and that Bam had instructed appellant to commit the offense. As such, the evidence was clearly admissible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We find no merit in the contention that the danger of unfair prejudice attendant to the pretrial statements of Lockwood and Falcon regarding the BGF substantially outweighed the probative value of the testimony. Before trial, concerning Lockwood and Falcon\u2019s pretrial statements, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of the gang-related evidence, as he did not \u201creally think that the [BGF] had anything to do with this shooting.\u201d As explained above, the fact evidence provided by witnesses established the motive for the Shooting\u2014that Bam, a gang leader or boss, directed appellant, a gang member described as a \u201chit man[,]\u201d to murder a person who owed the boss money\u2014and, as such, demonstrated that the offense was \u201cgang-related.\u201d Accordingly, the fact evidence was highly probative. Under the circumstances, we are satisfied that the probative value of the fact evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We perceive no abuse of discretion in the admission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>gang-related information in the pretrial statements of Falcon and Lockwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">(2) Gang Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"Aox\">(a) Motive</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Having determined the existence of admissible fact evidence showing that the crime was related to appellant\u2019s gang membership, we address the admissibility of gang expert testimony. As we stated in <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 663, 923 A.2d 952, \u201c[g]ang evidence is admissible despite the prejudice that attaches if it is relevant and particularly if it is crucial in establishing motive.\u201d (Citation omitted). Although the testimony in the instant case was not that the crime occurred as a result of rival gang conflict, this case presents circumstances no different than those in <em>Ayala, </em>in that the offense was motivated by gang affiliations. The evidence established that appellant, a member of a gang, committed the crime at the direction of a gang boss because the victim owed the gang boss money. As such, the gang expert\u2019s testimony directly explained the motive for appellant\u2019s participation in the offense. Accordingly, the circuit court properly admitted Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony describing the history and structure of the gang, as the crime was \u201cgang-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">(b) Recantation</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">After careful review of the circumstances of this case and relevant case law, we conclude Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony, in addition to its relevance as to motive, was admissible to explain the witnesses\u2019 in-court recantation of the statements previously given to law enforcement authorities. We know that Maryland appellate courts have determined that expert testimony is admissible upon a showing that the crime is \u201cgang-related\u201d or under the exceptions to \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence set forth in Maryland Rule 5-404(b). As Maryland case law does not directly address whether expert testimony is admissible to explain the reasons witnesses re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>cant, at trial, information given to law enforcement officers, we turn to the persuasive case law from California and Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The case before us is similar to <em>Gonzalez, Tolliver, </em>and <em>Dixon </em>in that, in each case, witnesses repudiated pretrial identifications and statements at trial and, in each case, law enforcement officers testified as experts about gangs in which the defendants were members to explain the recantations. <em>Gonzalez, </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 653-54, 657; <em>Tolliver, </em>282 Ill.Dec. 900, 807 N.E.2d at 530-34; <em>Dixon, </em>317 Ill.Dec. 788, 882 N.E.2d at 670, 677-78. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d. at 657, the Supreme Court of California held that the expert\u2019s testimony was relevant to assist the jury in determining which version of the witnesses\u2019 testimony was credible\u2014the initial eyewitness identification and statements identifying the defendant as the shooter, or the later repudiations of those identifications and statements. The Supreme Court of California specifically stated that \u201c[ejvidence that a witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness and is therefore admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Tolliver, </em>282 Ill.Dec. 900, 807 N.E.2d at 542, the Appellate Court of Illinois found that gang-related evidence was \u201crelevant and admissible to show why several witnesses recanted their grand jury testimony against defendant, a member of the Gangster Disciples.\u201d In <em>Dixon, </em>317 Ill.Dec. 788, 882 N.E.2d at 681, the Appellate Court of Illinois held that gang-related evidence was probative, and therefore relevant, \u201cif it explains a witness\u2019s motive to lie about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the offense.\u201d (Citation omitted). As such, the Court determined, in <em>Dixon, </em>that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting gang-related evidence to explain why the witnesses recanted and had a \u201cchange of heart at trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Applying the principles set forth in <em>Gutierrez, </em>concerning the admission of expert testimony where an offense is gang-related, and the authorities above, we hold that expert testimony about the history, hierarchy, and common practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of a street gang is admissible where: (1) the evidence establishes that a witness has previously given information to law enforcement officers incriminating the defendant and the witness recants the information at trial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) the reason for the recantation is related to appellant\u2019s membership in, or affiliation with, a gang, and (3) the probative value of the expert testimony is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Similar to the discussion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gutierrez </em>as to the admission of expert testimony where the offense is gang-related, the critical requirement for the admission of the gang expert testimony where a witness recants is evidence showing that the recantation is related to appellant\u2019s involvement with a gang, <em>ie. </em>\u201cgang-related.\u201d Consistent with the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Gutierrez, </em>we conclude that proof of such a link \u201copen[s] the door for expert testimony\u201d regarding gang information. 423 Md. at 497, 32 A.3d 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We are satisfied that under the standard set forth in <em>Gutierrez </em>and described above, the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony to explain the witnesses\u2019 in-court recantations. It is undisputed that the witnesses recanted at <em>trial\u2014ie. </em>renounced statements previously given to law enforcement officers. At trial, Lockwood testified that he could not recall his conversation on March 5, 2009, with law enforcement officers. After the State played an audio recording of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>conversation in which Lockwood identified appellant as the shooter, Lockwood testified that he did not actually see appellant shoot or \u201cdo anything.\u201d Lockwood insisted that he gave the statement to law enforcement officers because he was in a fight with appellant, and Bam told him that he wanted appellant off the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Likewise, Falcon recanted at trial, testifying that he lied to law enforcement officers when he told them that appellant admitted to committing the murder. After a recording of Falcon\u2019s interview was played at trial, he denied knowing that appellant admitted to the crime and reiterated that he lied to law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The evidence satisfies the requirement that the recantation be related to appellant\u2019s gang involvement. The pretrial statements of two fact witnesses\u2014Lockwood and Falcon\u2014 demonstrated that at least two of the recanting witnesses knew appellant to be a member of the BGF and feared him. In his March 5, 2009, interview, Lockwood told detectives that appellant\u2014whom he saw shoot the victim\u2014is a member of the BGF, and that there would be \u201csafety issues\u201d if he went to jail because he is not a member of the BGF. At the time of the interview, Lockwood was in custody for failure to appear, and was incarcerated prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In his March 4, 2009, interview with detectives, Falcon stated that he heard Bam refer to appellant as \u201cstraight G[uer]rilla,\u201d which he explained meant \u201c[l]ike being in a gang. BGF, Black G[uer]rilla Family.\u201d Falcon also told detectives that appellant was \u201clike a hit man\u201d for Bam and that appellant always carries a gun. Detective Min testified that he spoke with Falcon about testifying, and that Falcon said \u201chis life would be in danger if he does [testify] and said he wasn\u2019t, he was not going to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">All four of the State\u2019s fact witnesses-Lockwood, Sparrow, Falcon, and Johnson\u2014expressed fear to Detective Min during their interviews. Appellant has visible gang-related tattoos up and down each arm, and the tattoos clearly identify appellant, who was known to and seen by the witnesses, as a member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a gang. Indeed, the purpose of such tattoos is to identify appellant as a member of the BGF. As such, in addition to Lockwood\u2019s and Falcon\u2019s specific mentions of appellant\u2019s gang affiliation and their fear, it is a reasonable inference that all of the witnesses\u2019 fear and subsequent recantations at trial resulted from appellant\u2019s gang affiliation coupled with either directly seeing appellant shoot the victim or hearing appellant admit to shooting the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Appellant maintains that, even if admission of the gang-related evidence was relevant to show why witnesses recanted, \u201cthe State was still required to show that these witnesses not only knew that [appellant] was in a gang, but that it was for this reason they testified differently at trial.\u201d The evidence in the case satisfies this condition and was sufficient to open the door for gang expert testimony. Given that the witnesses who, prior to trial, either identified appellant as the shooter or stated that appellant admitted to being the shooter, all recanted the statements at trial or gave conflicting testimony, and at least two had direct knowledge of appellant\u2019s gang affiliation and expressed fear, the State adequately demonstrated that the witnesses knew appellant was in a gang and that it was for this reason they recanted at trial. Under the facts of this case, and in light of the well-reasoned analyses in <em>Gutierrez, Gonzalez, Tolliver, and Dixon, </em>we conclude that the circuit court properly determined that gang-related evidence, namely the expert testimony of Sergeant Workley, was relevant, at a minimum, to explain why appellant would act at the direction of a gang leader and why Lockwood and Falcon recanted previously given statements at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>(3) The Danger of Unfair Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Although the fact evidence in this case, considered in total, was sufficient to \u201copen the door for expert testimony,\u201d as in <em>Gutierrez, </em>we must next determine whether the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 423 Md. at 497-98, 32 A.3d 2. At trial, appellant did not specifically object or argue that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony explaining why the witnesses recanted. Notably, when arguing during Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony that the gang-related evidence was prejudicial, appellant\u2019s counsel simply stated: \u201cIt poisons the well for the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel failed to provide any further explanation. At the end of the bench conference on the issue, the circuit court stated that appellant\u2019s counsel objected to Sergeant Workley \u201cbeing called. You objected to his expertise ____ [and y]ou objected to the relevance of it.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel was notably silent, <em>ie. </em>appellant\u2019s counsel did not state that the objection was also on the ground of the danger of unfair prejudice of the testimony. Following the Court of Appeals\u2019s instruction in <em>Gutierrez, </em>however\u2014that the issue of the danger of unfair prejudice be examined\u2014we address the matter. As this Court and the Court of Appeals expressed in <em>Ayala </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>respectively, we are mindful of the dangers and potential prejudice of the admission of gang-related evidence, and shall review the evidence carefully in assessing the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">As to the probative value, in this case, we conclude that the probative value of the testimony was high. The identity of the shooter was contested. The identification of appellant as a member of the BGF who followed the directions of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>gang member furnished information about the identity of the shooter and the motive for the shooting. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was not duplicative of the fact witnesses\u2019 testimony, and was highly probative in identifying appellant as a member of the BGF, explaining the history and structure of the gang, and, thereby, explaining why appellant would commit a crime at Barn\u2019s\u2014a gang boss\u2019s\u2014direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony was necessary given the circumstances of the trial\u2014three witnesses recanted pretrial statements identifying appellant as the shooter in court and the fourth witness gave conflicting testimony. The sheer number of fact witnesses who recanted\u2014three out of four\u2014 Lockwood, Falcon and Sparrow\u2014as well as the contradictory testimony provided by the fourth fact witness\u2014Johnson, increased the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony. Two witnesses specifically identified appellant as a member of the BGF, and that gang membership was a basis or source of the witnesses\u2019 fear. Sergeant Workley\u2019s expert testimony directly explained the turnabout of the two witnesses and inferentially explained the turnabout of all of the witnesses who saw or heard appellant admit to shooting the victim. In sum, Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was material to the issues of identity and motive and to providing an explanation for the witnesses\u2019 recantations, and, as such, was highly probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was limited to: (1) discussing the history and structure of the BGF, (2) stating that the Division of Corrections classified appellant as a member of BGF and opining that appellant is a member of the BGF, and (3) reviewing photographs of appellant\u2019s tattoos. Although it is clear from the testimony that the gang is violent and the witnesses feared retaliation from it, notably, Sergeant Workley did not offer an opinion as to whether appellant actually intimidated or pressured the witnesses into recanting. Sergeant Workley did not describe or offer an opinion as to appellant\u2019s role in the gang, <em>ie. </em>whether appellant was a leader or played some other role. Sergeant Workley also did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>not testify as to specific acts of violence or crimes attributable to appellant or the BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">At oral argument, contending that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony, appellant pointed to two specific items of evidence as highly prejudicial: (1) testimony concerning the Division of Corrections\u2019s classification of appellant as a member of the BGF; and (2) admission into evidence of photographs of appellant\u2019s upper torso with gang tattoos. We shall briefly address each item, as well as Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony regarding the history and structure of the BGF and his opinion that appellant is a member of the BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">(a) Testimony Concerning the Division of Corrections\u2019s Classification of Appellant and Opinion that Appellant is a Member of the BGF</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The evidence concerning the Division of Corrections\u2019s classification of appellant as a member of the BGF consisted solely of testimony by Sergeant Workley, given without objection. During Detective Min\u2019s testimony, the State moved to introduce into evidence State\u2019s Exhibit No. 36, a certified copy of the Division of Corrections record identifying appellant as a member of the BGF, accompanied by a letter appellant wrote and signed \u201cBGF 4 life[,] Guerrilla in bleed out!!\u201d The circuit court sustained appellant\u2019s objection to introduction of the exhibit, and State\u2019s Exhibit No. 36 was not admitted into evidence. The trial exhibit log and exhibit itself indicate that the exhibit was simply marked for identification. Later, during Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony, the State asked Sergeant Workley whether the Division of Corrections listed appellant as a member of the BGF, and Sergeant Workley simply responded, \u201c[y]es, they have.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to the question or response. When asked, Sergeant Workley also testified that, in his opinion, appellant is a member of the BGF.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony on either point. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Division of Corrections record and classification was limited to stating that appellant is classified as a gang member. The details of appellant\u2019s past criminal record-including any specific crimes for which he was convicted or dates or periods of incarceration-were not disclosed. Indeed, as the State pointed out at oral argument, if anything, Sergeant Workley\u2019s response confirming that the Division of Corrections classifies appellant as a member of the BGF was cumulative. Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object specifically to Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony on the point demonstrates the minimal prejudice attached to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Sergeant Workley\u2019s opinion that appellant is a BGF member corroborated testimony given by Lockwood and Falcon that appellant was a member of the gang, a highly probative fact that was not conceded by appellant. As the jury had already heard testimony from other witnesses that appellant was a gang member, Sergeant Workley\u2019s confirmation of that fact was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">(b) Testimony Concerning Appellant\u2019s Tattoos</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As to the photographs of appellant\u2019s upper torso depicting tattoos that Sergeant Workley opined were gang-related, at oral argument, appellant contended that the photographs lacked probative value because his torso was not visible unless unclothed and that admission of photographs was prejudicial. We disagree. Many of appellant\u2019s gang-related tattoos were on his arms\u2014specifically, his forearms and biceps. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s gang-related tattoos, as seen in the photographs, was highly probative in confirming that appellant identified himself as a gang member, a fact that was not conceded by appellant at trial. Sergeant Workley testified that a tattoo on appellant\u2019s chest, specifically the left pectoral muscle, depicted appellant\u2019s \u201cstreet name\u201d of \u201cSixx 9,\u201d demonstrating that appellant self-identified as \u201c69,\u201d the person who the State\u2019s witnesses said was responsible for the shooting. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cSixx 9\u201d tattooed on appellant\u2019s torso was directly relevant to the issue of identity as, in their pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>statements, Lockwood, Sparrow, and Falcon identified \u201c69\u201d as the shooter. Sergeant Workley testified that tattoos on appellant\u2019s right and left forearms, depicting the words \u201cBaltimore\u201d and \u201cFranklin\u201d showed that this was the area in which appellant did \u201cbusiness.\u201d The offense occurred in the 2500 block of West Baltimore Street. For these reasons, the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony concerning the nature of appellant\u2019s tattoos was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">(c) Testimony Concerning the History and Structure of the BGF</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">As to Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony concerning the general history and structure of the BGF, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in permitting the testimony as the probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. At trial, Sergeant Workley testified that the BGF is a prominent prison gang'in Maryland that controls most of the jails within the State, as well as the narcotic trade inside of the jails. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was highly probative in explaining Lockwood\u2019s recantation. During Lockwood\u2019s interview with law enforcement officers, Lockwood told detectives that the BGF is in the jails and that, as he was not a member of the gang, there would be \u201csafety issues\u201d if he went to jail. At trial, Detective Min testified that, at the time Lockwood gave the interview, Lockwood was under arrest pursuant to an open warrant for failure to appear for a drug charge, and that Lockwood was sent to Central Booking immediately after the interview as a result of the open warrant. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony assisted the jury with understanding why Lockwood, who was facing imminent incarceration, would be afraid to give testimony implicating appellant as the shooter in a murder case, and explained the reason for Lockwood\u2019s recantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">As to Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony that the BGF controlled the drug trade within the jails, as the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Gutierrez, </em>when assessing expert testimony regarding the violent nature of a gang, \u201cwe do not see how [appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>lant] was unfairly prejudiced by this piece of evidence!.]\u201d <em>Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 499, 32 A.3d 2. The testimony concerning the BGF\u2019s presence in \u201cthe jails\u201d was highly probative in explaining Lockwood\u2019s recantation. The brief mention by Sergeant Workley that the BGF controlled the drug trade within the jails was not unfairly prejudicial as Sergeant Workley did not elaborate on the point or provide an opinion that appellant was involved with the drug trade within the jails.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">As to the structure and organization of the BGF, Sergeant Workley testified that the BGF is structured and run like a business, and that the gang ranks its members. This testimony was highly probative in corroborating earlier testimony from Falcon and Johnson, in which the witnesses described appellant as a \u201chit man\u201d who took direction from Bam, a gang boss, and who was ordered by Bam to shoot the victim. Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony clarified that the position of \u201chit man\u201d exists within the gang, and explained why appellant, a gang member, would act at the behest of a gang boss\u2014 namely, that in the BGF, there is a leader, a rank structure, and rules that must be followed or else \u201cthere\u2019s consequences!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">(d) Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In this case, given that fact evidence established that appellant committed the offense at the instruction of another gang member, two of the witnesses indicated appellant was a member of the gang, and the number of recanting and contradictory witnesses was high, the probative value of Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was heightened \u201csuch that it was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 498, 32 A.3d 2. Although appellant contends that the jury did not need expert testimony to \u201cunderstand that it is reasonable for a citizen to fear a gang member!,]\u201d Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was crucial in describing the history, structure, and practices of the gang\u2014the BGF\u2014and thereby explaining why appellant would act at a gang leader\u2019s request and explaining the basis for the witnesses\u2019 fear. The danger of unfair prejudice was lessened by the expert not offering an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>opinion on appellant\u2019s role in the gang, or crimes attributable to him or the gang. For all of the reasons above, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court in admitting Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u201cCSI-Type\u201d <em>Voir Dire </em>Question</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion by asking a \u201cCSI-type\u201d question during <em>voir dire. </em>Appellant argues that the question \u201cserve[d] no purpose other than to undermine [his] right to a fair trial.\u201d Appellant acknowledges that his counsel failed to object to the <em>voir dire </em>question, but urges this Court to exercise plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The State responds that plain error review is inappropriate in this case. Alternatively, the State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in posing a \u201cCSI-type\u201d question during <em>voir dire. </em>The State argues that the question was not unduly suggestive of appellant\u2019s guilt and was a \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d inquiry into whether a juror \u201cwould set an artificial standard\u201d for evaluation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">It is well settled that a trial court\u2019s rulings as to <em>voir dire </em>are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 396-97, 906 A.2d 374 (2006).

To that end, the trial judge should focus questions upon \u201cissues particular to the defendant\u2019s case so that biases directly related to the crime, the witnesses, or the defendant may be uncovered.\u201d On appellate review, because the trial judge has had the opportunity to hear and observe the prospective jurors, we pay substantial deference to the judge\u2019s conclusions, unless they are the product of a \u201cvoir dire that is cursory, rushed, and unduly limited.\u201d We review the trial judge\u2019s rulings on the record of the voir dire process as a whole to determine whether the trial judge abused his or her discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 396, 906 A.2d 374 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>Charles and Drake v.

First, there must be an error or defect\u2014some sort of [deviation from a legal rule\u2014that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant. Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error\u2014discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

State, </em>90 Md.App. 254, 264, 600 A.2d 1142 (1992) (quoting <em>Sine v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 628, 632, 394 A.2d 1206 (1978)). Because it is so extraordinary, \u201cthe \u2018plain error doctrine\u2019 1) always has been, 2) still is, and 3) will continue to be a rare, rare phenomenon.\u201d <em>Morris and Everett, </em>153 Md.App. at 507, 837 A.2d 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In this case, as a threshold matter, it is undisputed that the matter is not preserved for review.

The <em>voir dire </em>question with which appellant takes issue is a content-neutral inquiry into the standard with which jurors would review evidence. As such, there is no support for a conclusion that there was any error or deviation from a legal rule that had not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned-the first prong under <em>Rich, </em>415 Md. at 578, 3 A.3d 1210. In this case, the circuit court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXo\">The jurors will be called upon to consider all of the evidence that is presented no matter who it is presented by.

In other words, you say well, she didn\u2019t present this or he didn\u2019t present that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The circuit court asked a reasonable question regarding scientific <em>evidence\u2014i.e., </em>whether the jury would require trace evidence to accept positions presented by one of the parties. There was no error, plain or otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Demonstrating further appellant\u2019s failure to satisfy the conditions necessary for plain error review is that, to the extent appellant alleges the circuit court abused its discretion in asking the <em>voir dire </em>question, there is no contention that the error was clear or obvious. A review of the record shows that appellant\u2019s counsel not only failed to object to the <em>voir dire </em>question at any point, but counsel also accepted the impaneled jury without objection or qualification. The failure to object supports the conclusion that appellant failed to satisfy the second prong of plain error review under Rich\u2014that the alleged legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Jailhouse Telephone Call</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred by admitting into evidence a telephone call he made from the Baltimore City Detention Center to an unidentified woman inquiring into the whereabouts of Lockwood. Appellant argues that the content of the telephone call was irrelevant, ambiguous, and lacking in probative value, and therefore inadmissible at trial. Appellant asserts that as the substance of the telephone call was ambiguous, the call \u201cmade it no more or less probable\u201d that appellant was attempting to find Lockwood to intimidate him rather than to discuss some other matter with Lockwood. Appellant maintains that the telephone call was not evidence of consciousness of guilt, and lacked probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the call because the call was probative of \u201cwhether Lockwood\u2019s stated fear of [appellant] was reasonable[.]\u201d The State argues that even if the purpose of the call was susceptible to more than one interpretation, \u201c[a]ny ambiguity in the purpose of the call went to its weight not its admissibility.\u201d The State maintains that any complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>that the probative value of the jailhouse telephone call was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice is not an issue preserved for appellate review, as the issue was not raised in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (2011), the Court of Appeals outlined the applicable standard of review for admissibility of evidence as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 17 A.3d 676 (2011), we explained the standards by which we review the admission, or exclusion, of evidence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">It is frequently stated that the issue of whether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court, and that the abuse of discretion standard of review is applicable to the trial court\u2019s determination of relevancy. Maryland Rule 5-402, however, makes it clear that the trial court does not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.... [T]he de novo standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not of consequence to the determination of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\"><em>Ruffin, </em>418 Md. at 619-620, 17 A.3d at 691. Thus, we must consider first, whether the evidence is legally relevant, and, if relevant, then whether the evidence is inadmissible because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or other countervailing concerns as outlined in Maryland Rule 5-403. During the first consideration, we test for legal error, while the second consideration requires review of the trial judge\u2019s discretionary weighing and is thus tested for abuse of that discretion. <em>See J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Com\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300, n. 18 (2002) (\u201cAlthough at first glance such a determination may appear to be a legal conclusion, at its core it is based on a trial judge\u2019s independent weighing of the probative value of the evidence against its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>harmful effects. As such, it is subject to the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">(Some citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>855 Md. 528, 541, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999), the Court of Appeals discussed which issues are preserved for appellate review when specific grounds are offered for an objection, stating: \u201cIt is well-settled that when specific grounds are given at trial for an objection, the party objecting will be held to those grounds and ordinarily waives any grounds not specified that are later raised on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In this case, the State offered the recorded jailhouse call into evidence, arguing that the call was relevant because it demonstrated that appellant sought to contact Lockwood to influence him into changing his statement to detectives or to prevent him from testifying. With certainty, the telephone call made on October 5, 2009, by appellant to Lockwood\u2019s girlfriend searching for Lockwood tended to make the State\u2019s theory that appellant sought to influence Lockwood into changing his account more probable than it would have been without the recording. The existence of the telephone call established a critical link\u2014that appellant attempted to locate Lockwood prior to trial. Under Maryland Rule 5-401,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the phone call was relevant to the proceedings at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">As to the State\u2019s contention that any issue as to the danger of unfair prejudice is not preserved for review, we agree. At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel objected when the State sought to play the recorded telephone call for the jury. The circuit court asked for the basis of the objection, and appellant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to object based, you know, based on what\u2019s the relevance of that tape to this proceeding.\u201d As such, it is evident that appellant\u2019s counsel offered a specific ground for his objection\u2014relevance\u2014to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>playing of the telephone call recording and did not offer any other or additional reasons for the objection. Accordingly, we need not address whether the probative value of the recording was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice as appellant has failed to preserve the issue. <em>See Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 528, 735 A.2d 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Nonetheless, we conclude that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the recording of the call. The call contained no inflammatory or prejudicial information. The circuit court observed, in denying appellant\u2019s motion to exclude the call prior to trial, that the call was \u201copen to the interpretation the State\u2019s presenting or it\u2019s open to the interpretation that means absolutely nothing. That\u2019s the art of arguing what the evidence is[.]\u201d Thus, appellant had the opportunity at trial to argue that the call was innocuous despite the State\u2019s interpretation. As such, we perceive no merit in the contention that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

According to appellant, \u201cArtie\u201d is a nickname for Lockwood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. At trial, six of the State\u2019s witnesses testified contrary to their prior grand jury testimony and their prior statements; many testified that law enforcement officers threatened them into providing the prior testimony and statements implicating and identifying the defendant as the shooter. <em>Tolliver, </em>282 Ill.Dec. 900, 807 N.E.2d at 531-34. The State introduced the grand jury testimony and prior statements of the six witnesses as substantive evidence. <em>Id., </em>282 Ill.Dec. 900, 807 N.E.2d at 534.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\">. At oral argument, although appellant agreed that Maryland case law does not specifically define what \"gang-related\" or \"gang-motivated\" means, appellant contended that the crime was not gang-related or gang-motivated, but rather \"drug-related.\" Upon review of <em>Ayala </em>and <em>Gutierrez, </em>we conclude that the circumstances of gang-related or gang-motivated crimes are not confined or limited to the circumstances found in those cases. In <em>Ayala, </em>the defendant killed the victim, believing him to be a member of a rival gang. 174 Md.App. at 651-52, 923 A.2d 952. In <em>Gutierrez, </em>the defendant killed the victim for insulting his gang. 423 Md. at 482, 32 A.3d 2. As evident, the circumstances in the two cases are different, although, at the heart of each case, gang membership provided the motive for the killings. In <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md. App. at 664, 923 A.2d 952, we stated \u201cwe establish no bright-line rule as to the admissibility of gang evidence in Maryland!.]\" In this case, the circumstances\u2014a gang member killing someone who owed the gang boss money at the behest of the gang boss\u2014are appropriately considered \"gang-related\u201d or \"gang-motivated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. A mere inconsistency or discrepancy between the witness\u2019s testimony in court and information previously given is not sufficient to open the door for gang expert testimony. The witness must renounce or withdraw the information previously given to law enforcement officers. According to Black's Law Dictionary, \"recant\u201d means \"[t]o withdraw or renounce (prior statements or testimony) formally or publically[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1295 (8th ed.2004). In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 691-92, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006), we quoted the Black's Law Dictionary definition of \u201crecant\u201d and explained that \"[i]f the renunciation occurs formally in a courtroom, there is no doubt about the fact that a renunciation actually took place. It only remains to determine 1) the truth of the renunciation; and 2) its legal significance, if true. That is why we use the term of art 'recantation' to refer to that type of in-court renunciation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. At oral argument, appellant argued that <em>Gonzalez </em>is distinguishable because, in that case, the gang expert witness testified specifically that witnesses recanted due to fear of the gang. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>the gang expert witness testified that it was \"bad\u201d to be someone who assisted law enforcement as a witness or informant, and that such people are often intimidated not to testify. 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 653-54. The expert further testified that he often has to provide security and accompany the witnesses to court, and that, in one case, a witness was murdered by his own gang. <em>Id., </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 657. Although it is correct that the facts of <em>Gonzalez </em>are different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>those in this case, in that Sergeant Workley did not describe instances of intimidation by the gang, Sergeant Workley\u2019s testimony was nonetheless relevant to explain the basis for the witnesses\u2019 fear by describing the structure and workings of the gang. We observe that Sergeant Workley's testimony was less prejudicial than the expert's in <em>Gonzalez, </em>a case in which the expert specifically testified that the gang intimidates witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\">. To the extent that appellant's membership in a gang may be viewed as \"other crimes\u201d evidence, we are satisfied that the evidence regarding appellant\u2019s BGF gang membership met the requirements for admission under Maryland Rule 5-404(b)-the evidence met at least one of the special exceptions for admissibility and was established by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>Solomon v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 331, 338-39, 646 A.2d 1064 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 90, 651 A.2d 855 (1995) (Pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-404(b), the trial court must determine \"whether the evidence fits within a legitimate exception\u201d and \u201cneeds to be persuaded, by the clear and convincing standard, that the alleged crime did, indeed, take place before [the trial court] allows evidence of it to come into evidence.\u201d). In this case, the evidence was relevant to identity and motive. Appellant\u2019s membership in the gang was established by clear and convincing evidence\u2014via the testimony of people who knew him and by the tattoos he displayed. And as discussed above, the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 31 A.3d 922 (2011) is misplaced. In <em>Stabb, </em>423 Md. at 456-57, 31 A.3d 922 the Court of Appeals reviewed the \u201cpropriety of an 'anti-CSI effect,\u2019 or 'no duty,' jury instruction, given before closing arguments in a criminal trial, that instructed the jury there is \u2018no legal requirement that the State utilize any specific investigative technique or scientific test to prove its case.\u2019 \u201d The Court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by preemptively giving the jury instruction before closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 31 A.3d 922. The Court observed that, \"[i]n closing, although defense counsel commented on the lack of physical evidence, the overwhelming majority of her argument focused on the State\u2019s reliance on a single child witness, conflicting statements of the State\u2019s other witnesses, motive ... to influence [the child\u2019s] statement, [defendant\u2019s] alibi, and possibility of an alternative assailant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 31 A.3d 922. In contrast, in this case, we are presented with a unobjected to <em>voir dire </em>question asked of potential jurors, which did not suggest that a lack of scientific evidence could not be considered or that one result was favored over the other. Indeed, in this case, in asking the question, the circuit court stated: \u201cThe jurors will be called upon to consider all of the evidence that is presented no matter who it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>presented by. No matter what the person, the party is urging you to consider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">.
