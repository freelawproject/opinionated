Count One:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u201cThe said defendant, on or about the 9th day of December, 1952 at and in the said County of Fresno, State of California, did act as an agent in the purchasing of farm products, from Randall Lutze, to-wit: turkeys; without first obtaining an agent\u2019s license as provided by Section 1263 of Agricultural Code of State of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Count Two is couched in exactly the same language except the alleged offense involves a different party at a different date.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Appellant contends :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">1. That there is no competent evidence showing that at the time of the alleged offenses defendant was an agent as that term is employed in section 1263 of the Agricultural Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">2. That it was error for the trial court to receive in evidence the extrajudicial statements of the defendant, both oral and written, for the purpose of establishing his status as an agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">We will consider the last point first.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">The law in regard to the admissibility of extrajudicial statements or admissions of an alleged agent is accurately stated by appellant in his opening brief.  Agency cannot be established by such offered evidence. Quoting from the case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Mountain Park Co., </em>92 Cal.App. 258 [267 P. 914], the court said in the case of <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>United Theatres, </em>106 Cal.App.2d 471, 472 at 477 [235 P.2d 261]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">\u201c \u2018. . . That the witness Lloyd might have been placed upon the witness stand and asked as to all the facts tending to show his authorization to act as an agent for the defendant is really what is supported by the rule just stated, and not what he may have told somebody in relation thereto. This action being between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the witness Lloyd could have testified directly as to his agency by stating whatever there was, if anything, tending to show his appointment or authorization to act as agent, but to put a witness on the stand to testify to what she had heard Mr. Lloyd state or what representations he had made was an entirely different matter and not in anywise supported by the authorities cited, but absolutely contrary thereto. \u2019 \u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The court going on to say: \u201cAs hereinbefore pointed out, the agency of Lytle cannot be proved in this manner . .</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>That the statements or admissions are made in writing does not alter the rule. <em>(Champlin Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Gasoline Products Co., </em>29 F.2d 331 at 336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Even though the admission be admissible as part of the <em>res gestae, </em>it would not serve to establish the fact of agency. <em>(Stouffer-Bowman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>18 Wn.2d 416 [139 P.2d 717 at 722]);</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">\u201cIn <em>Ennis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>171 Wash. 126, 18 P.2d 1, 2, we stated: \u2018We are committed to the rule that the mere declarations of an alleged agent, made out of court, are not competent testimony to establish the fact of his agency; that where there is no evidence from which the fact of agency may be inferred, the declarations of the agent as to facts tending to establish the agency, even when made as a part of the res gestae, are inadmissible. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">This ease was tried by the respondent upon the theory that the defendant Lambe was the agent of one Ralph Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">\u201cMr. Evans : The testimony he is about to give will indicate motive, scheme and design on the part of the Defendant, Frank Lambe, in the purchase of Turkeys pursuant to him acting as an agent for one Ralph Smith.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 34, lines 7 to 10, inclusive.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">\u201cMb. Evans : ... We are trying Mr. Lambe for acting as an agent for Mr. Smith.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 47, lines 14 and 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">For an agent to exist, there must be a principal. We have searched the record in vain to find any competent evidence to establish a principal for the defendant, whether it be Mr. Smith or someone else, except by the extrajudicial statements of the defendant and some hearsay testimony which was permitted to come in over defendant\u2019s persistent objections. The court was apparently of the opinion that the written statements of the defendant (People\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 2), solely by reason of the fact that they were in writing, took such offered evidence out of the rule above quoted and were admissible for the purpose of making out a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">\u201cThe Court: There is a definite distinction between the conversation and a writing, in this particular act that you are talking about can\u2019t be proved by the extrajudicial statements.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 8, lines 23 to 25, inclusive.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">\u201cThe Court : Yes. Well, the Court already ruled that there is prima facie evidence that because of this exhibit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Ralph Smith sold . . . let\u2019s see. Ralph Smith purchased birds from Lutze. There is a written statement to that effect. As long as there is a prima facie showing has been made, I can\u2019t see where your objection is good.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 17, lines 21 to 26, inclusive.)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The court, however, received the evidence subject to motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">\u201cThe Court.- In order to continue this trial without too much interruption the court will take judicial notice of the Jaw as to admissions made by a party setting up an agency, and I will allow the testimony in evidence subject to a motion to strike in the event that the law reads that a written statement is also considered as a statement under this particular law which would exclude such evidence in court. So with that in mind we will continue on this particular case.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 18, lines 15 to 22, inclusive.)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Defendant\u2019s several motions to strike such testimony apparently were never ruled upon and the evidence remains in the record. The objections were good and the motions to strike should have been granted.  The error is prejudicial to the defendant and requires a reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">A further question has been raised by appellant which we believe deserves comment. He contends that the transactions complained of fall within the exception of section 1262 of the Agricultural Code of the State of California. This section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">\u201cSec. 1262. Exemptions from chapter. This chapter does not apply to or include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-9\">\u201c(b) (Processors.) Any person or exchange buying, receiving, or otherwise handling farm products as a processor, as that term is defined in Chapter 9, Division 6, of this code.\u201d Respondent showed that Mr. Smith, the alleged principal, was, in fact, a processor. Mr. Kachadorian, a District Supervisor, Bureau of Marketing Enforcement, Department of Agriculture of the State of California, called as a witness for the People, testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-10\">\u201cQ. Mr. Smith is a processor? A. Mr. Smith is an individual, he is licensed as a processor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-11\">\u201cQ. I see. And this Mr. Leusehner he is a processor too? A. He is licensed as a processor too also, that is Yosemite Creek Company is licensed as a processor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>\u201cQ. Yosemite Creek Company is licensed as a processor, that is what their business is as far as you know, is that right ? A. Yes.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 43, lines 13 to 20, inclusive.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Mr. Smith, called as a witness by the defense although he had been subpoenaed by the People and not called by the People, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">\u201cQ. And what is your business or occupation ? A. Rancher, processor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">\u201cQ. And by processor you mean a licensed processor under the Agricultural Code of the State of California ? A. Yes, poultry.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 45, lines 12 to 16, inclusive.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">And the witness, Randall Lutze, one of the alleged victims called as a witness for the People, testified' as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">\u201cThe Witness : He is a processor sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">\u201cMb. Quinlisk: Q. Mr. Smith is the processor ? A. Sure.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 21, lines 24. and 25, inclusive.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Harry Collett, the other alleged victim, called as a witness for the People, testified as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-13\">\u201cQ. Now on this document, Mr. Collett that you have identified here, the names appearing on the top thereof, to your knowledge they are all processors of turkeys? A. Yes, sir. I was up to the plant there afterward, and seen the plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-14\">\u201cQ. They take the birds in and they\u2014\u2014 A. Kill them and dress them and oven-ready them and put them in boxes and quick freeze them, pack them and ship them.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, page 30, lines 19 to 26, inclusive.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">The record also discloses that some of the poultry involved, particularly that of Mr. Collett, was, in fact, ultimately handled by parties other than the defendant. Appellant was prevented from eliciting such facts from the witness, Lutze.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">It will be borne in mind that the defendant is charged under section 1263, which is a part of chapter 6 of division 6 of the Agricultural Code, and that being charged as an agent, he necessarily is charged with having acted as an agent of a \u201ccommission merchant, dealer, broker or cash buyer.\u201d Such is the definition given under section 1263, subdivision (b), and section 1261, subdivision (i) , of the AgTicultural Code. It would, therefore, appear that any evidence received and appearing in the record relative to whether or not the transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>concerned processing would be material only to show that the transactions fell within the above exception of section 1262 and could not be treated as proof of another possible offense with which the defendant was not charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">With the objectionable evidence removed from the record, there does not appear to be sufficient evidence remaining therein to support the judgment. It is, therefore, the order of this court that the judgment of conviction of the defendant be, and the same is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Shepard, P. J., and Conley, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
