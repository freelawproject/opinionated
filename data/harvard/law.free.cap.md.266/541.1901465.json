We have concluded that the lower court acted correctly and we will affirm its order of October 21, 1971, overruling the Demurrer and its decree of January 20, 1972, declaring the Mechanics\u2019 Lien void and requiring Continental to pay the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The appellees, Morris and Sylvia Sugarman, Jerome B. and Thelma (a/k/a Toby) Monfred and 140 Village Partnership, a limited partnership, (the owners) purchased two farms in Carroll County, consolidated the farms into one tract and on part of the consolidated tract erected the 140 Village Center (the Center). On March 23, 1970, Continental entered into a written contract with the Center whereby Continental was to furnish \u201cmaterial and/or labor as listed in accordance with drawings and specification pages enumerated for the sum of .....................\u201d No amount was inserted in the blank indicated. The contract then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cDrawings: 1. Jeans Fabrics 2. Ames Dept. 3. Sentry Drugs 4. Peterson Candy 5. Three Small Stores (North Section)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">The blank after the printed words: \u201cSpecification Pages: ..................\u201d was not filled in; the name of the architect was inserted after the printed word \u201cArchitect\u201d; and opposite the printed words \u201cShop Paint\u201d the words \u201cOne Coat Red Oxide\u201d were inserted.

All invoices must be paid in full, except where construction retainer is withheld, in 30 days. No construction retainer in excess of 10% will be allowed. Upon customer\u2019s failure to make payments in accordance with terms of this or other contracts it is understood that we may refuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>shipments or suspend performance hereunder except on receipt of satisfactory security.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Continental furnished labor and materials for the erection of the shopping center but apparently because of a dispute between Continental and the owners, Continental was not paid for the labor and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On June 10, 1971, Continental filed a Notice of Intent to File a Mechanics\u2019 Lien in the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Records of Carroll County. The notice recited that it was the intention of Continental to claim a lien on \u201cthe improvements and tract of land lying in the County of Carroll\u201d and described by metes and bounds as set forth in the notice. The description was for both parcels making up the consolidated tract. The claim was for \u201cthe sum of $92,470.75, with interest from December 11, 1970\u201d and was stated to be the amount which was \u201cdue and owing to claimant for steel, materials and labor, furnished and performed in that certain improvement of said land described above and generally described as the Route 140 Shopping Center.\u201d The names of the owners were then set forth and the notice continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cThat the date of the first item of Claimant\u2019s contribution to the improvement was March 23, 1970, and the date of the last item thereof, December 11, 1970; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">It will be observed that no other details are given and there is no mention in the notice of the contract of March 23, 1970, nor was a copy of the contract attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The following day, June 11, 1971, Continental filed a Mechanics\u2019 Lien among the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Records of Carroll County. It recited that Continental claims a Mechanics\u2019 Lien against the owners \u201cin a certain parcel of land together with improvements thereon\u201d and then the metes and bounds description which appeared in the notice is set forth. The Mechanics\u2019 Lien then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201cSaid Lien is in the amount of NINETY-TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS ($92,470.75) with interest from December 11, 1970, the date of last work, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">\u201cThe Lien and claim are based upon the furnishing of steel and other materials and labor supplied for its erection all of which was fully furnished and delivered for the improvement and construction to the above premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">It will be noted that, like the notice, no other details are given and there is no reference to the contract of March 23, 1970, nor was a copy of the contract attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On August 24, 1971, the owners filed in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, in Equity, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 63, \u00a7 28 and Maryland Rule BG75, a Petition to require Continental to prove the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien or have it declared void. The Petition recited that the petitioners were owners of the consolidated tract (giving the recordation references to the two deeds by which the owners acquired the consolidated tract); that Continental had filed on June 10, 1971, a \u201cNotice of Intent to File Mechanics\u2019 Lien,\u201d giving its recordation reference and attaching a copy as Exhibit No. 1; that on June 11, 1971, Continental had filed a Mechanics\u2019 Lien for $92,470.75, with interest from December 11, 1970, giving its recordation reference and attaching a copy as Exhibit No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Paragraph 4 of the Petition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201c4. Petitioners deny the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The prayers for relief were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201ca. Respondent, pursuant to Section 28 of Article 63 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and Rule BG75 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, prove the validity of the lien aforesaid or have it declared void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">\u201cb. Respondent, pursuant to Rule 370b4 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>372e, be required to verify its answer to this Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cc. Petitioner be granted such further relief as the nature of their cause requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">To this Petition, Continental filed a combined Demurrer and Answer pursuant to Rule 371. The ground of the Demurrer was the failure of the petitioners to state the reasons why they deny the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien. The Answer admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Petition, denied the allegations of paragraph 4 and alleged that the Mechanics\u2019 Lien was valid in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Judge Weant overruled the Demurrer on October 21, 1971, after hearing argument and considering the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties. He was of the opinion that Art. 63, \u00a7 28 and Rule BG75 did not require the owners to set forth any reasons for their denial of the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien, they having the absolute right to compel the claimant to prove the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien and the burden being on the claimant to establish its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Later, after taking testimony and hearing argument, the lower court filed an opinion and decree on January 20, 1972, declaring the Mechanics\u2019 Lien to be void and requiring Continental to pay the costs. The lower court was of the opinion that the Mechanics\u2019 Lien failed to comply with the second and third requirements set forth in Art. 63, \u00a7 19 by stating \u201cthe nature or kind of work or the kind and amount of materials furnished and the time when the materials were furnished or the work done\u201d and also \u201cthe locality of the building and the number and size of the stories of the same, or such other matters of description as may be necessary to identify the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">In our opinion the lower court properly overruled the Demurrer to the Petition to compel the claimant, Continental, to prove the validity of its Mechanics\u2019 Lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>or have it declared void. Art. 63, \u00a7 28 and Rule BG75 provide that during the two year period from the date of recordation when the Mechanics\u2019 Lien is effective, the owner of the property, against which the lien is effective, may bring a proceeding in Equity to <em>compel the claimant </em>to prove the validity of the lien or have it declared void. The burden of establishing the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien is thus placed on the claimant and no requirement is imposed upon the owner to state why the owner believes the Mechanics\u2019 Lien to be invalid. The owner, therefore, in order to allege a prima facie cause of action under the Statute and the Rule, need only deny the validity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien and require the claimant to prove its validity, as was done in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As we have indicated, the contract of March 23, 1970, between the parties was not a lump sum contract. The space in the contract for a sum certain or lump sum was not filled in. The various items of structural steel, bar joists and their erection and the cost of roof decking, when added together, amount to $102,566 and were stated to be Continental\u2019s \u201ccosts.\u201d There was also a provision to amend the \u201ccontract figure\u201d at the rate of $400 a ton for structural steel and $275 a ton for bar joists when the shop drawings were modified in accordance with the new canopy layout drawing by the architect. The amount claimed in the Mechanics\u2019 Lien was $92,470.75, but nothing appeared in the Mechanics\u2019 Lien in regard to how this figure was calculated. No particulars were given in regard to the nature of the materials furnished or the time of furnishing them or in regard to the work performed or the time of its performance, other than the statement that the last day of work was December 11, 1970. The contract of March 23, 1970, was not attached or filed as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">If the contract of March 23, 1970, had been for a sum certain for all of the work done and materials furnished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>then the claimant would only be required to set forth the contract lump sum price under the decision of our predecessors in <em>Gunther v. Bennett, </em>72 Md. 384, 19 A. 1048 (1890) inasmuch as \u201cunder the contract itself, no amount has been fixed, either for the work or materials separately.\u201d (72 Md. at 388-389, 19 A. at 1049.) This not being such a contract, however, the prior decisions of this Court indicate, as do the provisions of Art. 63, \u00a7 19, that the particulars in regard to the nature of the work done and materials furnished, as well as when the work was done and the materials were furnished, must be set forth in the Mechanics\u2019 Lien. <em>Dugan v. Howard, </em>130 Md. 114, 118, 99 A. 966, 968 (1917) ; <em>Rust v. Chisolm, </em>57 Md. 376 (1882). Judge Stockbridge, for the Court, in <em>Dugan </em>indicated that the object of the statutory requirement \u201c \u2018. . . is to enable the owner or purchaser, and other lien creditors, to trace out the truth of the claim and guard against fraud and imposition.\u2019 \u201d (130 Md. at 118-119, 99 A. at 968). <em>See Welch v. Humphrey, </em>200 Md. 410, 90 A. 2d 686 (1952) for an informative review of the history of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien law in Maryland by Judge Delaplaine, for the Court. <em>Cf. Mimsco Steel Corp. v. Holloway Concrete Construction Co., </em>261 Md. 137, 274 A. 2d 90 (1971) and <em>United States Tile &amp; Marble Co., Inc. v. B &amp; M Welding &amp; Iron Works, Inc., </em>254 Md. 81, 253 A. 2d 838 (1969) in regard to a similar requirement for notices of intent to file a Mechanics\u2019 Lien under Art. 63, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">It is clear to us that Continental has not met its burden of proving the second requirement set out in Art. 63, \u00a7 19 and its Mechanics\u2019 Lien was invalid for this reason as the lower court properly held.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The lower court was also of the opinion that the claimant, Continental, had failed to describe sufficiently the locality of the buildings and the number and size of their stories as set forth in the third requirement of Art. 63, \u00a7 19. It may well be that the lower court\u2019s opinion in this regard is <em>sound; </em>but in view of the invalidity of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien for failure to comply with the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>requirement of Art. 63, \u00a7 19, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\n<em>Order of October 21, 1971, and decree of January 20, 1972, affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
