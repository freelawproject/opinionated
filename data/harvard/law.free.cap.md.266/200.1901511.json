Smith and Digges, JJ., dissent and Digges, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which Smith, J., concurs at page 212 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The principal question presented to us in this appeal is whether the appellant, Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Hardware), was required to provide personal injury and property damage insurance coverage for the appellees, Lillie E. Springmann, and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>minor son, Steven A. Springmann (added to the policy of Mrs. Springmann as a named insured), and to provide a defense for the minor in an action arising out of an automobile accident involving the minor on September 17, 1968, the insurance policy having been cancelled by Hardware on March 3, 1968, with notice to Mrs. Springmann, but without having given notice of such cancellation to the Department of Motor Vehicles, Hardware having filed a JR-11 Financial Responsibility Insurance Certificate with the Department prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The answer to this question involves the construction and interpretation of various sections of Article 66\u00bd of the Code (1957) with particular reference to the repeal by the General Assembly by Chapter 691 of the Laws of 1968, effective July 1, 1968, of subsections (d) and (e) of Art. <em>66\u00bd, </em>\u00a7 93, which made the filing of a JR-11 form no longer mandatory for a minor to drive a motor vehicle upon the Maryland highways. The facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The insurance policy involved was duly issued by Hardware and on July 22, 1966, Hardware filed the JR-11 form with the Department, certifying that the minor Steven was insured under his mother\u2019s policy. The policy was cancelled by Hardware on March 3, 1968. Notice of the cancellation was duly given to Mrs. Springmann and was received by her. No notice, however, was given by Hardware to the Department of the cancellation. Steven was involved in a motor accident on September 17, 1968; but Hardware was not notified that the accident had occurred until August 11, 1969 (some 11 months later), when the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board demanded that Hardware complete an investigation of the accident and defend the tort action which had been instituted against the Springmanns. This request not having been acceded to by Hardware, the Springmanns, on March 15, 1971, instituted a declaratory judgment action at law in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Hardware and Winston Fowlkes (the plaintiff in the tort action), seeking declarations that (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>coverage for any liability which they might incur in connection with the accident be afforded them under the policy and the JR-11 form; (2) Hardware be obliged to furnish counsel to defend the tort action; (3) a counsel fee be awarded to plaintiffs for legal services rendered in connection with the declaratory judgment action and the tort case; and, (4) for other relief. The lower court (Robert B. Mathias, J.) granted summary judgment for the Springmanns and by an order of October 14, 1971, declared, in effect, that inasmuch as Hardware did not comply with the requirements of Art. 66\u00bd, \u00a7 142 in regard to cancellation of the policy, the JR-11 form was in effect at the time of the occurrence of the accident so that Hardware must provide the Springmanns with insurance coverage and a defense. The lower court also awarded counsel for the Springmanns a counsel fee of $200.00 rather than the $1,675.00 fee requested by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We have concluded that as a result of the amendatory legislation, Hardware was not required to provide the Springmanns with coverage and a defense and, accordingly, we will reverse the order of October 14, 1971. In view of this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary for us to decide the questions regarding the awarding of a counsel fee and its amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We now turn to a consideration of the applicable statutory provisions in order to ascertain the legislative intent. To discover this intent, we must consider the relevant legislation as a whole and seek to reconcile all of those statutory provisions. As Judge Delaplaine stated for the Court in <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 131-32, 48 A. 2d 754, 762 (1946) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[S]tatutes which are not inconsistent with one another, and which relate to the same subject-matter, are in <em>pari materia </em>and should be construed together so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their general object and scope, although they contain no reference to one another and were passed at different times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The general purpose of the legislation and the effectuation of that purpose are important considerations in ascertaining the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">As Judge (later Chief Judge) Marbury aptly stated in <em>Barnes v. State, </em>186 Md. 287, 291, 47 A. 2d 50, 52 (1946), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 U. S. 754, 67 S. Ct. 95, 91 L.

Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or taken to affect in any way any person who, prior to June 1, 1954, has secured an instruction permit or operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license under the provisions of subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereinabove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201c(e) <em>Proof to remain in effect until licensee becomes twenty-one. </em>\u2014 The proof of financial responsibility required by this section shall remain continuous and in effect until such minor licensee shall become twenty-one (21) years of age.

Self-insurers may be a person in whose name more than 25 motor vehicles are registered and who obtains a self-insurance certificate from the Department. There are also provisions for persons operating taxicabs other than under a permit of the Public Service Commission. The certificate of self-insurance may be issued by the Department when it is satisfied that the applicant \u201cis possessed and will continue to be possessed of ability to pay judgments against such person * * It is also provided that the Department may upon reasonable grounds cancel a certificate of self-insurance and the failure to pay a judgment within 30 days after it becomes final shall constitute a reasonable ground for such cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00a7 142, <em>Notice required before cancellation or annulment, </em>which was principally relied upon by the lower court, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cWhen any form of proof of financial respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>sibility has been certified to the Department or the Public Service Commission as the case may be, such proof shall not be cancelled or annulled by any party in interest except upon not less than thirty (30) days\u2019 notice to the Department or the Public Service Commission as the case may be, except that a motor vehicle liability insurance policy subsequently procured and certified shall, on the effective date of the insurance afforded by such policy, terminate the insurance previously certified with respect to any motor vehicle designated in both certificates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">It will be observed that \u00a7 142 provides for a statutory requirement that certifying insurers must serve notice upon the Department that they intend to, or are in fact, cancelling a policy of insurance which has been certified as <em>\u201cproof of financial responsibility.\u201d </em>The 30-day period is provided to enable the Department to make an appropriate response to the cancellation. \u00a7 142 is consistent with and furthers the general purpose of the financial responsibility statutes to protect an innocent public from sustaining losses resulting from a motor vehicle accident caused by the negligence of other persons. This section is designed to complete the control of the Department for seeing to it that certain categories of drivers and certain types of motor vehicles maintain the degree of financial responsibility required by the motor vehicle law. \u00a7 142 does not by its terms and was not intended by the General Assembly to encompass <em>every </em>situation in which the Department would have been made aware of the status of the financial responsibility of every motor vehicle driven in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">As we have indicated, the requirement to prove financial responsibility only attaches to drivers of motor vehicles which fall within a specified category, as, for example, those involved in an unresolved accident, those convicted of certain traffic offenses, those owning a vehicle used for hire or rent, and, between June 1,1954, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>July 1, 1968, to minors seeking to obtain a license to operate motor vehicles. Not all operators or owners of motor vehicles, however, are required to submit proof of financial responsibility. For example, when the owner of a motor vehicle seeks to register his vehicle in Maryland, he is only obligated to pay an uninsured motorist fee or to state that he has insurance meeting the minimum requirement of the Department; there is no requirement for certification, nor are all certificates rescinded by notice. For example, under the provisions of \u00a7 142, itself, a subsequent certification relieves the insurer of the original certification of the duty to notify the Department and by the provisions of \u00a7 93 (e), the certification automatically terminated when the minor became 21 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The purpose of \u00a7 142 was to provide notice of cancellation of policies insuring the members of the class specifically <em>required </em>to establish proof of financial responsibility so that the Department would be in a position to effectuate a suspension of tags, registration and driver\u2019s license, where necessary, in order to remove the specified person or vehicle from the use of the Maryland highways. When the Legislature repealed the requirement of proof of financial responsibility as applicable to a particular class of drivers or owners, the purpose of \u00a7 142 was no longer applicable. This was done so far as minors were concerned by the repeal of subsections (d) and (e) of the Acts of 1968, Ch. 691 so that after July 1, 1968, when that Act became effective, minors were no longer in the category of drivers required to furnish proof of financial responsibility and hence that class was no longer within the purpose of \u00a7 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The Springmanns correctly point out that prior to July 1, 1968, minors were required to file proof of financial responsibility and that the provisions of \u00a7 142 then applied to the JR-11 form filed by Hardware on July 22, 1966; and we have so held. <em>Peninsula Insurance Co. v. Houser, </em>248 Md. 714, 238 A. 2d 95 (1968) and <em>Erie Insurance Exchange v. Gosnell, </em>246 Md. 724, 230 A. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>467 (1967). When this requirement was abolished by the General Assembly, however, the provisions of \u00a7 142 thereafter no longer applied; and Hardware, having cancelled its policy with Mrs. Springmann prior to the accident, was under no obligation to supply coverage and defend the tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In <em>Erie, supra, </em>the case arose prior to the repeal of subsections (d) and (e) of \u00a7 93. We held that although the policy provided for a 20-day cancellation period, which was given by the insurer to both the insured and the Department, the insurer was required to supply coverage and defend under the policy for an accident which occurred during the thirty-day period, regardless of the 20-day period set forth in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In the opinion in <em>Erie, </em>it was stated that the JR-11 form was filed in \u201caccordance with Sections 131, 135 and 93 (c) \u201d; but we do not understand that this language was intended to exclude its filing under \u00a7 93 (d) and (e) also. Indeed, an examination of the record in <em>Erie </em>\u2014 which was decided on an order sustaining a demurrer to a declaration, as particularized \u2014 indicates that the JR-11 form was filed pursuant to <em>all </em>of the provisions of \u00a7 93. In the endorsement by the insurance carrier in <em>Erie </em>for \u201cDrive Other Car Coverage, Statutory Coverage for Named Minors (Maryland),\u201d which was in the particulars furnished and thus a part of the declaration for purposes of the demurrer, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cIt is agreed that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cSuch insurance as is afforded by the policy for Bodily Injury Liability and Property Damage Liability applies to the operation of any automobile by the minor named below <em>in accordance with the provisions of Section 92 of Article 66y% of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1951 Edition), as amended, </em>subject to the following provisions : [listing six conditions not relevant here]\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Section 92 of Art. 66\u00bd of the 1951 Code is now \u00a7 93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of Art. 66\u00bd of the 1957 Code (1971 Repl. Vol.) with subsections (a), (b) and (c) before the additions of subsections (d) and (e) by amendment by the Act of 1954, Ch. 75, effective June 1, 1954. The language \u201cas amended,\u201d appearing in the endorsement filed subsequent to June 1, 1954, obviously indicated that the filing was pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) added <em>by amendment </em>as well as pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c). The reference in the opinion to \u00a7 98 (c), as we have stated, was not intended to exclude subsections (d) and (e) particularly in view of the provisions of the endorsement itself indicating that the endorsement was filed <em>pursuant to the entire section. </em>In any event, the reference to \u00a7 93 (c) was not a holding, but, at best, a mere dictum. In short, we do not consider the <em>holding </em>in <em>Erie </em>to be inconsistent with our holding in the present case. There is, in our opinion, no departure from the doctrine of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In the instant case, in considering the relevant statutory provisions as a whole and applying the general purpose of those provisions, we are of the opinion that when the General Assembly removed the <em>requirement </em>for filing proof of financial responsibility for use of the Maryland roads by minors, thereafter an insurer was not required to give the 30-day notice provided for in \u00a7 142, the reason and public policy behind the giving of such a notice having been removed and obliterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>Order of October 14, 1971, reversed and case remanded for the entry of an order making a declaration in accordance with this opinion, the appellees to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Digges, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">I find myself in divergence from the majority. In this case the appellee, Lillie E. Springmann, individually and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>as mother and next friend of Steven A. Springmann, initiated this litigation in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. She asked the court to declare that Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Company, appellant, was required to provide automobile insurance coverage and a legal defense for her minor son who, while operating a car, collided with a motorcycle driven by Winston Fowlkes. Both parties are in total harmony about the factual pattern \u2014 the dissonance arises in interpreting the effect that legislative action has on these particular facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">It is first necessary to elucidate certain sections of Article 66V2 as that article existed in the Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl. Vol. and its 1969 Cum. Supp.) prior to re-enactment in 1970, specifically \u00a7\u00a793 and 142. Between 1954 and 1968, \u00a7 93 was comprised of five subsections (a through e) which dealt with the application of a minor for a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license. Subsections (a), (b) and (c) were originally enacted in 1943 and have remained intact even to the present time, though subjected to some minor alterations over the years. (Ch. 1007, \u00a7 85 of the Laws of Maryland 1943, codified in the 1951 Code as Art. <em>66\u00bd, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 92 (a), (b) and (c) and changed in the 1957 Code to \u00a7\u00a7 93 (a), (b) and (c).) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 93 (a) it was required that a parent, guardian or, in their absence, a responsible person, sign a minor\u2019s application before he could be issued a license. Section 93 (b) provided that any negligence by the minor while driving an automobile would be imputed to this signatory unless the \u201cminor deposits or there is deposited upon his behalf <em>proof of financial responsibility\u201d </em>with the Department of Motor Vehicles as permitted by section 93 (c). (Emphasis added.) If the option allowed by (c) was utilized then whoever furnished such proof could do so by having an insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>company insure the minor and certify to the Department of Motor Vehicles proof of financial responsibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This would be accomplished by having the company file a JR-11 form \u2014 a \u201cMaryland Minor\u2019s Financial Responsibility Insurance Certificate\u201d \u2014 with the Department. It should be emphasized that (c) did not make filing such proof obligatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In 1954, the Legislature expanded \u00a7 98 by enacting subsections (d) and (e). (Ch. 75 of the Laws of Maryland, codified originally as \u00a7\u00a7 92 (d) and (e) in the 1951 Code.) These two additional subsections then made verification of financial responsibility mandatory before any minor could be licensed to operate a motor vehicle in Maryland. Section 93 (d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\"><em>\u201cCompliance with proof of financial responsibility as required by </em>\u00a7 <em>122 of this article. </em>\u2014 On and after June 1, 1954, the application of any person under the age of twenty-one (21) years for an instruction permit or operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license shall be accompanied by such proof of financial responsibility as is required under the provisions of \u00a7 122 of this article. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or taken to affect in any way any person who, prior to June 1, 1954, has secured an instruction permit or operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license under the provisions of subsections (a), (b) and (c) herein-above.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It was stipulated in \u00a7 93 (e) that such proof would re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>main in effect until the minor became twenty-one years old and if he should fail to maintain the verification of financial responsibility during his minority \u201cthen the Department shall have the right to suspend such license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">Effective July 1, 1968, the Legislature repealed \u00a7\u00a793 (d) and (e) (Ch. 691 of the Laws of Maryland) so that it was no longer mandatory for a minor to prove financial responsibility before becoming a licensed operator of a motor vehicle. The General Assembly also gave serious consideration to rescinding \u00a7\u00a793 (b) and (c), but such action was not in fact taken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, subsequent to June 30, 1968, the JR-11 form could still be filed voluntarily as proof of financial responsibility so as to insulate the signatory under \u00a7 93 (a) from imputed liability in the event the minor was negligent in driving a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">At the same legislative session of 1943 in which \u00a7\u00a793 (a), (b) and (c) were passed, \u00a7 142 was also enacted (Ch. 1007, \u00a7 123, codified in the 1951 Code as \u00a7 138 and changed to \u00a7 142 in the 1957 Code) and still remains in force.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\"><em>\u201cWhen any form of proof of financial responsibility has been certified to the Department </em>or the Public Service Commission as the case may be, such proof shall not be cancelled or annulled by any party in interest except upon not less than thirty (30) days\u2019 notice to the Department or the Public Service Commission as the case may be, except that a motor vehicle liability insurance policy subsequently procured and certified shall, on the effective date of the insurance afforded by such policy, terminate the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>previously certified with respect to any motor vehicle designated in both certificates.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Having set forth the background and purpose of these laws the paramount task now is to evaluate their effect in terms of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On July 22, 1966, the appellant certified to the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles, on a JR-11 form, that Steven Springmann was insured under his mother\u2019s policy. In March 1968, this policy was cancelled but the insurer, through a clerical oversight, failed to notify the Motor Vehicle Department of the cancellation. On September 17, 1968, Steven was involved in the accident. Appellant was not apprised of this until August 11, 1969 (11 months later), when the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board demanded that Hardware Mutual complete an investigation of the collision and defend the tort action instituted against the Springmanns. When that entreaty was ignored appellee initiated this proceeding for declaratory relief. Judge Mathias granted the Springmanns\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that since Hardware Mutual did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 142 it must provide the appellees with insurance coverage and a defense. From that ruling this appeal results.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The insurance company concedes, as it must, that if Steven\u2019s accident had occurred prior to July 1, 1968 (the repeal date of \u00a7\u00a7 93 (d) and (e)), it would have had to provide insurance coverage and a legal defense since it did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 142 by giving the Department 30 days\u2019 notice that the policy had been cancelled. <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Gosnell, </em>246 Md. 724, 230 A. 2d 467 (1967) ; <em>Peninsula Insurance v. Houser, </em>248 Md. 714, 238 A. 2d 95 (1968). However, Hardware Mutual claims, and the majority agrees, that the necessity of notifying the Department concerning cancellation in order to avoid continuing liability was no longer required after June 30, 1968 because the Legislature re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>pealed \u00a7 93 (d). The majority attempts to buttress its precarious position on the assumption that the JR-11 was only filed pursuant to that now discarded section. But clearly such is not the case. The JR-11 was used before the enactment of \u00a7 93 (d) and has survived that law\u2019s expiration. On its face that form, as currently utilized, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-3\">\u201cIn the event of cancelation or non-renewal of such policy notice of such cancelation or non-renewal will be filed with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such cancelation or non-renewal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">It is true that filing proof of financial responsibility is no longer mandatory but the repeal of subsection (d) did not sound the death knell for the JR-11. It has the same purpose today as it had prior to 1954. While there is no statutory compulsion requiring that proof of financial responsibility be filed, once it is, \u00a7 142 explicitly makes it a prerequisite that 30 days\u2019 notice be given in order to effectuate the cancellation of <em>\u201cany form of proof of financial responsibility\u201d </em>which <em>\u201chas been certified to the Department.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This section by its unequivocal language does not purport as the majority suggests that its application is constrained to only those circumstances where the filing of proof of financial responsibility is required. In interpreting this very same section (142) and its relation to \u00a7 93 (c) Judge Oppenheimer, speaking for the Court in <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Gosnell, supra, </em>stated at p. 732:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and free of ambiguity, and has definite and sensible meaning, it is conclusively presumed to be the meaning of the Legislature; in ascertaining the legislative intent, all parts of the Act are to be considered together. We hold that Section 142 means, clearly and unambiguously, that <em>when a policy of insurance has been offered as proof of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>financial responsibility, with an endorsement specifically covering the liability of minors attached, that policy, including the endorsement as a part thereof, shall not be cancelled or annulled except upon not less than 30 days\u2019 notice.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted. Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In <em>Erie </em>the Court was faced with a strikingly similar problem where \u201c[i]n accordance with <em>Section ... 93 (c), </em>the insurer filed a Certificate of Financial Responsibility (form JR-11) with the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 727. The policy provided that the company \u201ccould cancel it by mailing written notice to the insured not less than twenty days prior to the effective date of cancellation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728. A cancellation notice was sent to both the insured and the Department and on the day after the policy, by its provisions, terminated but within the 30 day period provided by \u00a7 142, the insured had an accident. It was held there that the policy was in effect, regardless of the 20 day clause, until the 30 day period had run. In <em>Erie, </em>though \u00a7 93 (d) had not then been repealed, this Court specifically stated that <em>the JR-11 was filed in accordance with </em>\u00a7 <em>93 (c), </em>the non-obligatory provision, and held that compliance with \u00a7 142 was nonetheless mandatory. It would seem, based on the well established doctrine of stare decisis, that the same result is compelled in this case. However, somewhat surprisingly, Judge Barnes, for the majority of the Court, has abandoned this hitherto inviolable doctrine in a tenuous attempt to minimize the scope of <em>Erie.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cthe JR-11 form was filed in \u2018accordance with Sections 131, 135 and 93 (c) \u2019; but we do not understand that this language was intended to exclude its filing under \u00a7 93 (d) and (e) also. Indeed, an examination of the record in <em>Erie . . . indicates </em>that the JR-11 form was filed pursuant to <em>all </em>of the provisions of \u00a7 93.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The lucid language of <em>Erie, </em>as expressed for the Court by Judge Oppenheimer, does not preclude a finding that the JR-11 was filed not only to satisfy \u00a7 93 (c), but also in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 93 (d) and (e). However, this concession is of no significance because it does not follow that as a consequence, notice of cancellation is unnecessary under \u00a7 93 (c). If anything, the logical conclusion should be that if the JR-11 was filed pursuant to either \u00a7 93 (c), (d), or both, as long as any of these statutory provisions remain effective, notification is still necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The majority has not come to grips with the holding in <em>Erie. </em>Either that case applies or else it must be overruled; but in my opinion it is simply untenable for the majority to ignore the very explicit thrust of that case by concluding <em>Erie </em>and the majority opinion in the present appeal are consistent. <em>Erie, </em>without any hedging, clearly holds that \u00a7 142 requires notice of cancellation for a JR-11 filed pursuant to \u00a7 93 (c). I find it difficult to understand how this result can be reconciled with the majority\u2019s conclusion here that once \u00a7\u00a7 93 (d) and (e) have been repealed notice of cancellation is no longer required for a JR-11 filed under \u00a7 93 (c). The majority in its opinion simply has not addressed itself to the fact that the clear and unequivocal language of <em>Erie </em>made cancellation of a JR-11 form, filed \u201c[i]n accordance with Section ... 93 (c),\u201d mandatory. And, it is my feeling, they do not now have the license to conclude that its mention is of no consequence, but rather a gratuity. It seems a strange result indeed to hold that specific ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>erence to \u00a7 93 (c) is \u201cmere dictum\u201d, while silence or at best the inferential mention of \u00a7\u00a7 93 (d) and (e) is binding. The majority should face up to the task of either overruling <em>Erie </em>or abiding by it; but under no circumstances should its force be ignored. The conclusion in the present case should be that once proof is filed, be it by necessity or volition, \u00a7 142 comes into effect since it clearly encompasses \u201cany form of proof.\u201d Though optional, \u00a7 93 (c) provides protection not only to the insured but also to the public whose interest is served when a driver demonstrates proof of financial responsibility. I therefore would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I am authorized to state that Judge Smith concurs in the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-5\">.
