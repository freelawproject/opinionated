Marzullo, Jr. (Marzullo), owner of, and the sole witness for, the appellee, testified that early in September, 1970, Donald N. Embinder (Embinder) came to his place of business, stated \u201che was representing Mr. Parker,\u201d and ordered the printing of certain campaign literature on behalf of appellant\u2019s candidacy. In the course of conversation, it was also revealed by Embinder that he was campaign manager for appellant. Additional orders of a similar nature appear to have been placed by Embinder on three succeeding occasions. Appellant personally called at appellee\u2019s establishment on two occasions to inspect proofs in connection with separate or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ders, and was also present at his campaign headquarters on two occasions when appellee picked up an order and made a delivery, respectively. Marzullo testified that he rendered his bill to \u201cRepublican party \u2014 Parker for Congress\u201d pursuant to Embinder\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Embinder, who was the only witness called to testify for appellant, acknowledged that he had placed the orders for which payment was sought, and that he did so in his capacity as \u201cCampaign Manager of Parker for Congress,\u201d his appointment, as such, having been made by appellant. Indeed, the testimony, as this summary undoubtedly suggests, was sparse and virtually free of dispute in its material aspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Sitting as the trier of fact, Judge Maguire found \u201cthat Donald N. Embinder was not only the Campaign Manager for Peter Parker for Congress, but also acted as his agent.\u201d He found, moreover, that Embinder had authority from appellant to engage appellee for the printing work; that Parker was a disclosed principal; and that \u201cthe campaign was for Peter P. Parker only as a candidate for Congress and not the Republican Party as a legal entity.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Two contentions are advanced on appeal: (1) that under Maryland Code (1957,1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 33 \u00a7 26-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Fair Election Practices), appellant is not personally liable for printing expenses as appellee must \u201clook to the appellant\u2019s treasurer\u201d for payment; and (2) the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to support its finding that \u201cappellant authorized Donald N. Embinder to contract liability for the appellant personally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In contending that he is insulated from individual lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>bility by the Election Code, appellant relies upon three sections included in the \u201cFair Election Practices\u201d subtitle: Art. 33 \u00a7\u00a7 26-5 (b), 26-6 and 26-8 (b). In relevant part, they provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201c\u00a7 26-5 (b). Each candidate . . . shall designate a campaign depository or depositories and all funds and contributions in furtherance of a candidacy . . . shall after receipt thereof be deposited by the treasurer ... in the designated campaign depository .... No candidate, campaign treasurer . . . shall pay any expense on behalf of a candidate . . . except by check from such designated depository.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201c\u00a7 26-6. Contributions and Expenditures Must Pass Through Treasurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">All contributions . . . received or disbursed by any candidate . . . shall be paid over to and made to pass through the hands of the treasurer and shall be disbursed by him; and it shall be unlawful and a violation of this article for any candidate ... to make any expenditure . . . for any purposes until the money ... so disbursed or expended shall have passed through the hands of the treasurer. &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201c\u00a7 26-8 (b). Expenses.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">Any person who is a candidate for nomination for public office or a candidate for public or party office may pay his own personal expenses for filing fees, telegrams, telephoning, travel and board. The payment of such personal expenses shall not be subject to the limitation provided in subsection, (c) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">From these statutory provisions, appellant fashions the argument that the Election Code was designed to extend beyond the regulation of campaign practices and sought to concentrate liability for campaign expenses in the treasurer, an argument which, if successful, is hardly calculated to foster the recruitment of future campaign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>treasurers. With admirable consistency, appellant urges that \u201c[h]ad appellant himself ordered the printing, he would have been acting as an agent of the treasurer.\u201d Thus, he argues that the Election Code proscribes personal liability for printing expenses even if the candidate incurs the debt himself. This argument is predicated upon what he sees as the public policy of this State expressed in \u00a7 26-8 (b). In so contending, he quotes the first sentence of Subsection (b), but overlooks the second sentence, both of which have been quoted above. Furthermore, the complete subsection must be read together with relevant portions of the remaining subsections of 26-8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if we are to observe the fundamental rule that all parts and sections of a statute must be read and considered together in arriving at the true intention of the Legislature since they form part of a general system or scheme, <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 257, 170 A. 2d 212 (1961) ; <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner of Baltimore City, </em>211 Md. 357, 361, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956) ; <em>State v. Petrushansky, </em>183 Md. 67, 71, 36 A. 2d 533 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">When Subsection (b) is read in its entirety and is taken together with the remaining subsections of 26-8, the legislative intent is unmistakably clear that personal contributions by a candidate to his own campaign are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>limited to the applicable sum specified in Subsection (c) ($10,000.00 for Congressional candidates), but such personal contributions are not subject to the limitations of (c) if they are for any of the categories enumerated in (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In sum, the public policy argued for by appellant cannot be ascribed to 26-8 or any of its subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Nor is there any merit to appellant\u2019s contention that it was the legislative intent, as particularly expressed in 26-5 (b) and 26-6, that, in effect, the candidate would no longer be the principal, but, if anything, would become the agent of his treasurer. There is nothing in the language of the statute which lends itself to this argument. What the legislature intended by the \u201cFair Election Practices Law,\u201d as it had with its precursor, \u201cThe Corrupt Practices Act,\u201d as those subtitle names suggest, was the regulation and control of campaign financing and to insure a system of centralized responsibility for campaign funds and expenditures. Pettengill, <em>Regulation of Campaign Finance </em>\u2014 The <em>Maryland Experience, </em>19 Md. L. Rev. 91 (1959). The legislative intent being clearly adverse to appellant\u2019s contention, we think apposite the following statement by Judge Singley, for this Court, in <em>Maryland National Bank v. Comptroller, </em>264 Md. 536, 287 A. 2d 291 (1972) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\u201cThe principles of statutory construction here involved are too familiar to require more than a brief reference. If there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the words used in the statute, there is no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislature, <em>Maryland Medical Service v. Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 477-78, 209 A. 2d 582 (1965) <em>; Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 136, 141 A. 2d 734 (1958). If the legislative intent is expressed in clear and unambiguous language, this will be given effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>by the Court, <em>Schmeizl v. Schmeizl, </em>186 Md. 371, 375, 46 A. 2d 619 (1946).\u201d 264 Md. at 541.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding that he authorized Embinder to contract individual liability, it is apparent that appellant overlooks Rule 886, in compliance with which we may not \u201cset aside [on the judgment] on the evidence unless clearly erroneous [.]\u201d Furthermore, due regard \u201cmust be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">There was testimony before Judge Maguire to the effect that Embinder represented himself as appellee\u2019s campaign manager and as his representative; that he placed an order for printed materials which, as with the succeeding orders, a reasonable man in appellee\u2019s position would conclude had a single purpose, the election of appellant to Congress. He could also have found that of the four orders placed with appellee by Embinder, the proofs in two instances were personally approved by appellant at appellee\u2019s place of business; and that on the third and fourth occasions, appellant was present when appellee called for one order and delivered the other; and that at no time during the entire course of dealings, did appellant or anyone else in his coterie say or do anything to put appellee on notice that he could not look to appellant \u2014 the principal in the undertaking \u2014 for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">A reading of the trial court findings in context suggests that the court bottomed its decision that Embinder acted as appellant\u2019s agent on the doctrine of apparent authority, the principles of which have been frequently enunciated by us. Succinctly stated, apparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>his behalf by the person purporting to act for him. <em>F. W. Berens, Inc. v. Fidelity Mutual, </em>257 Md. 168, 180, 262 A. 2d 556 (1970) ; <em>Reserve Ins. Co. v. Duckett, </em>240 Md. 591, 600, 214 A. 2d 754 (1965) ; <em>Penowa Coal Sales Co. v. Gibbs &amp; Co., </em>199 Md. 114, 119, 85 A. 2d 464 (1952). See Restatement (Second) <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 27 (1958). In the recent case of <em>Wailes and Edwards, Inc. v. Bock, </em>265 Md. 274, 289 A. 2d 297 (1972), Chief Judge Hammond, following our prior decisions on the doctrine of apparent authority and its interaction with that of agency by estoppel, said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">\u201c \u2018On the question of apparent authority, it was said in <em>Lister v. Allen, </em>31 Md. 543 [1869], quoting <em>Story, Agency, </em>sec. 443, that \u2018the responsibility of the principal to third persons is not confined to cases where the contract has been actually made under his express or implied authority. It extends further and binds the principal in all cases where the agent is acting within the scope of his usual employment, or is held out to the public, or to the other party, as having competent authority, although, in fact, he has, in the particular instance, exceeded or violated his instructions, and acted without authority. For in all such cases, where one of two innocent persons is to suffer, he ought to suffer who misled the other into the contract, by holding out the agent as competent to act, and as enjoying his confidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\u201cAs the last sentence indicates, a permissible finding of apparent authority often is based on elements of estoppel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">\u201c \u2018Like apparent authority [estoppel] is based on the idea that one should be bound by what he manifests irrespective of fault; but it operates only to compensate for loss to those relying upon the words and not to create rights in the speaker. It follows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>therefore, that one basing his claim upon the rules of estoppel must show not merely reliance, which is required when the claim is based upon apparent authority, but also such a change of position that it would be unjust for the speaker to deny the truth of his words.\u2019 Restatement, <em>Agency 2d </em>\u00a7 8, p. 33.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u201cSee also <em>Reserve Insurance Co. v. Duckett, </em>240 Md. 591, [214 A. 2d 754 (1965)] and <em>F. W. Berens, Inc. v. Fidelity Mutual, </em>257 Md. 168, 178-180, [262 A. 2d 556 (1970)]. In <em>Garfinkel v. Schwartzman, </em>253 Md. 710, 721-722, [254 A. 2d 667 (1969),] the Court quoted with approval Restatement, <em>Agency 2d </em>\u00a7 8B (\u2018Estoppel \u2014Change of Position\u2019) Comment c (\u2018Estoppel by Silence\u2019) :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201c \u2018In many situations one may be deprived of a right of action, be subject to an action, or even lose his property by failing to reveal the truth if he knows that another is acting or will act under a misapprehension. * * * There may even be liability based \u00f3n a failure to speak, as where one knows that another is purporting or has purported to contract as his agent or to receive money on a forged instrument, and fails to reveal the facts. * * * In some situations in which silence is maintained, authority * * *, or ratification * * * results, and, if so, liability can be based upon ordinary agency principles.

Steuart Petroleum, </em>244 Md. 459, 466-469, [224 A. 2d 295 (1966),] <em>Goldman v.

Onley, </em>194 Md. 43, [69 A. 2d 903 (1949).]\u201d 265 Md. at 277-79.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Whether our decision rests on apparent authority or agency by estoppel, the application of those principles to the facts we have recited \u2014 bearing in mind that appellant made little effort to contradict them \u2014 is, at the very least, sufficient to persuade us that Judge Maguire\u2019s decision was not clearly erroneous.
