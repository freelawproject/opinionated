Vol.), Art. 95B, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), should control our resolution of a situation both antic and novel. We think it should control.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Early in 1964 the appellee (Bower), an Oxon Hill plumbing contractor, bought a new twin-screw Chris-Craft \u201cRoamer\u201d cruiser from the Kentmorr Marina in Stevensville. Its steel hull was 36 feet long; it was powered by gasoline engines. He could not remember the purchase price but he thought it was \u201cless than $20,000.\u201d In April 1966 Bower sold the boat to Harris for $17,000. He said its condition was \u201clike new\u201d; that he had used it for only \u201c26 hours for the time [he] had it.\u201d The appellant said \u201che (Harris) had the bottom painted and he had an awning made to enclose the back of the boat (the Barbara K), and he had a new electric toilet put in the head. ... He kept it up to date.\u201d Asked how much time he spent on the Barbara K, she said \u201c [h] e would be gone during Friday evening and [he] would come back Monday and . . . [she thought] most of his time was spent polishing it, looking after it.\u201d Although she was \u201cnot too crazy about boats\u201d she did go with him \u201con several occasions.\u201d She described its 1969 condition as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cperfect. ... In fact [she said] it could have been better than when Jack [Harris] got it because of the repairs he put on it.\u201d John S. Harris testified that in May 1969, just before his father\u2019s death, the \u201cboat was in perfect shape. It was like new. ... He [Harris] took exceptional care of the boat, spent a lot of money putting things on it and taking care of it. . . . He spent a lot of time cleaning it, maintaining it.\u201d He thought his father got more enjoyment out of taking care of the boat \u201cthan actually using it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The appellant testified that after her husband\u2019s death in June 1969 a neighbor named Carter, who \u201cwas just as crazy about the boat as Jack [Harris] was . . . [worked] on it every weekend, or every other weekend, just to make sure the boat was all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Irving Yochelson, Esq., appellant\u2019s counsel both here and below, testified that after Harris died he had a \u201cnumber of conversations\u201d with Wilfred M. Dyer, Jr., who said he was Bower\u2019s attorney. In his letter of 16 September 1969 to Dyer he told him \u201c[t]here is just no way in which the note can be paid at this time.\u201d He quoted John, Jr., as having said \u201cthe boat is in excellent condition, ... [a substantial sum having] recently been spent on it.\u201d He asked if Bower \u201cwould be willing to accept the return of the boat in exchange for the cancellation of the note\u201d and the payment of the interest. Dyer \u201cphoned [him] and said he no longer represented Bower.\u201d Bower denied that Dyer had been his attorney but he said he had been shown the letter from Yochelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In February 1970 Charles Sollers went to Solomon\u2019s Island to inspect the Barbara K. He owns and operates a marina at Edgewater. He buys, sells and repairs boats and engines. He testified that in his opinion the boat, when he examined it, \u201cwould bring about $13,900 in the open market.\u201d His qualifications were not controverted, nor was his appraisal challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The entire purchase price ($17,000) was evidenced by the promissory note of Harris and the appellant dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>22 April 1966 and payable two years thereafter. The note was secured by a chattel mortgage on the boat signed by both Harris and the appellant. It is conceded to be a UCC Security Agreement. While Harris never reduced the principal of the note, he did pay interest in July 1967 and August 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In mid-October 1969 Bower sued to reduce the note to judgment. Two months later a summary judgment in the amount of $19,762.50, $1,976.25 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was entered against the appellant and her husband\u2019s estate. That the estate is insolvent is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Bower recounted his efforts to find a buyer for the boat. He said he \u201ctalked to every physical person . . . [he] could think of who would be interested . . ., all boat dealers . . . [he] knew of\u201d and he <em>thought </em>he put <em>one </em>advertisement in the Washington Star. He said his efforts in this regard brought forth but three offers. Since later we shall have more to say about them, they appear below verbatim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cJANUARY 4th 1970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">MR.

FLORIST /s/ Helen L. Sharper Secretary\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Bower could not recall but we think it likely he sent the three letters (or copies thereof) to the appellant and her attorney during the last week in February. Yochelson said that is when he received them and on 11 March he wrote to Bower as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201cI attempted without success to reach you by phone in connection with the copies of the offers you have received for the sale of the boat owned by Jack Harris. Certainly, we cannot consent to the acceptance of any such offer. According to the best information I can obtain, the boat should be worth in the range of $12,000.00 to $15,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Despite the unconditional tenor of the Sharper letter Bower testified he held the $4,500 check \u201cuntil after they [Sharper] had a chance to look at . . . [the boat].\u201d He did not know how long he kept the check \u2014 three or four weeks was his guess \u2014 but when \u201cthey said there was too much work to be done on it . . . [and that they] didn\u2019t want it\u201d he returned the check. It seems reasonable to suppose that Bower\u2019s guess in respect of the date the check was returned was wide of the mark because on 1 May 1970 his attorney filed a praecipe entering a credit of $4,500 upon the judgment against the appellant. He testified he directed the entry of the credit because he \u201cthought he had it sold at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">According to the records of the Boating Division of the Department of Chesapeake Bay Affairs (DCBA), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Bower \u201crepossessed\u201d the boat on 30 March 1970. He recited in the \u201cReport: Repossession of Vessel\u201d that \u201c[because of non-payment [he] took it back.\u201d A Certif\u00edcate of Title was issued to him on 9 April 1970. It seems that sometime thereafter Bower had the boat moved from Solomon\u2019s Island to the Fort Washington Marina; later he had it moved to the Oxon Hill Marina. In January of 1971 he filed with DCBA an application for the renewal of the registration. In the block \u201cOwner write signature below\u201d he signed his name. At trial he admitted he had been the owner since April 1970. Nonetheless, Bower insisted he had the boat titled in his name so he could \u201csell it and give people a clear title.\u201d Oddly enough there is little, if any, credible evidence of any effort on his part to sell the boat after he had obtained title and possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Bower testified that he had not yet paid the bill ($1,800) from the Oxon Hill Marina. The bill was not introduced in evidence nor have we found in the record anything to suggest how much of it was for storage ($45 to $60 per month), how much for repairs or how much for maintenance. This aspect of the situation is further obscured by Bower\u2019s testimony that he repossessed the boat \u201cso . . . [he] could put it back in condition to sell it and when . . . [he] found out what it cost . . . [he] stopped.\u201d At trial he testified he thought he could \u201csell it for scrap iron, scrap steel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The appellant filed her bill of complaint for an accounting, damages and other relief in March 1971. The case came on for trial before the chancellor, Bowie, J., on 15 September 1971. On 13 October he filed his opinion and decree, the relevant parts of which follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">\u201cThere is conflicting testimony as to the present value of the boat, but whatever its value, it apparently no longer equals the amount of the judgment (less the credit entered by praecipe May 1, 1970, in Law No. 42,061) which now is in the amount of $17,238.75 plus costs. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>it is not reasonable to expect the defendant to retain the boat in complete satisfaction of the obligation. Maryland Annotated Code, Art. 95B, \u00a7 9-505(2) (Repl. Vol. 1964). This is one of his options under the Uniform Commercial Code. His other alternative is to dispose of the boat according to \u00a7 9-504, in a commercially reasonable manner and to apply the proceeds as provided therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">\u201cAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, the relief prayed in the plaintiffs Bill of Complaint is denied and the case is determined based on the entire record in these proceedings, and it is this 13th day of October, 1971, by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED, that the aforesaid boat (described as a 1964 Chris-Craft Roamer (steel hull) Cruiser, Mfg. Hull No. RXD36032OR, Maryland No. 3758H) be sold at a Judicial Sale, pursuant to Maryland Rules, Subtitle BR, within 30 days from date of this Decree; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">\u201cDECREED, that the proceeds of said Sale be applied according to Maryland Code Annotated, Art. 95B, \u00a7 9-504(1) (Repl. Vol. 1964) ; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">\u201cDECREED, that if said proceeds are less than the amount of $17,238.75, the provisions of \u00a7 9-504(2) as to deficiency will control; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">\u201cDECREED, that Robert E. Ammons, Esq., and David H. Gwynn, Esq. are hereby appointed Trustees for such Sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">On 5 January 1972 Judge Bowie filed a supplementary opinion and order finding as a fact that the credit of $4,500 \u201cwas filed by counsel prematurely, inasmuch as the sale, upon which the credit was based, never took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>place.\u201d The judgment against the appellant was thereupon increased to $21,738.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Appellant invokes \u00a7 9-505(2) of the UCC in support of her contention that Bower has accepted and retains possession of the boat in satisfaction of the obligation. The pertinent parts of \u00a7 9-505(2) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201cIn any other case involving consumer goods or any other collateral a secured party in possession may, after default, propose to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Written notice of such proposal shall be sent to the debtor .... If the debtor . . . objects in writing within thirty days from the receipt of the notification . . . the secured party must dispose of the collateral under \u00a7 9-504. In the absence of such \u25a0written notification the secured party may retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debtor\u2019s obligation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Bower did not \u201cpropose [either orally or in writing] to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation.\u201d Some courts, it is true, seem to have held that a written proposal may not be absolutely essential, especially where the secured party conducts himself in a manner so unfair or so unreasonable as to amount to a retention of the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. <em>Brownstein v. Fiberonics Industries, Inc., </em>110 N. J. Super. 43, 264 A. 2d 262 (1970) ; <em>Bradford v. Lindsey Chevrolet Co., Inc., </em>117 Ga. App. 781, 161 S.E.2d 904 (1968) ; <em>Northern Financial Corp. v. Chatwood Coffee Shop, Inc., </em>4 UCCRS 674 (N. Y. Sup. 1967) ; <em>Gathright v. Russell, </em>383 S.W.2d 441 (Civ. App. Tex. 1964). Bower could hardly have considered it to be in his interest to do so. It must be assumed that he rejected Yochelson\u2019s proposal and it seems clear to us that he anticipated the recovery from the appellant of the full amount of the judgment. The estate of Harris is insolvent but it is fair to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>assume that appellant is not judgment-proof. While we think Bower has come perilously close to painting himself into a corner in this regard we are unwilling, in these circumstances, to hold that what he has done extinguishes the entire debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Appellant is on much firmer ground in contending that, in respect of his possession of the boat, Bower has not acted in a commercially reasonable manner. Sec. 1-102(1) of the UCC requires it to be \u201cliberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.\u201d Sec. 1-203 imposes an obligation of good faith in the performance and enforcement of every contract or duty within the UCC. Sec. 9-504(3) requires that \u201cevery aspect of the disposition [of collateral] including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable.\u201d Sec. 9-507 (2), in pertinent part, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\u201cThe fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the secured party either sells the collateral in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property sold he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. <em>The principles stated in the two preceding sentences with respect to sales also apply as may be appropriate to other types of dispositions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">What follows is an excerpt from paragraph 6 of the \u201cOfficial Comment\u201d under \u00a7 9-504:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201cSee Section 9-507 (2). Under that provision a secured party who without proceeding under Section 9-505(2) held collateral a long time without disposing of it, thus running up large storage charges against the debtor, where no reason existed for not making a prompt sale, might well be found not to have acted in a \u2018commercially reasonable\u2019 manner. See also Section 1-203 on the general obligation of good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">While the text of the UCC does not deal, <em>in ipsissimis verbis, </em>with the odd situation here presented we think any reasonable interpretation of the meaning of the italicized sentence in the excerpt from \u00a7 9-507 (2), <em>supra, </em>will point the way to a proper appraisal of Bower\u2019s conduct, especially when considered in the light of the Official Comment, <em>supra. </em>We find support for our approach to a resolution of the question in the recently decided <em>Dynalectron Corp. v. Jack Richards Aircraft Co., </em>337 F. Supp. 659 (W. D. Okl. 1972). The chattel there involved was a Super-Constellation aircraft. The Lease Agreement was found to be a Security Agreement as defined by UCC. The principal question was whether the plaintiff, after repossessing the aircraft, proceeded in a commercially reasonable manner in selling it. As pointed out by the district judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201c. . . The Plaintiff did not advertise the aircraft for sale in any of the customary trade journals or publications. Plaintiff did not show the aircraft or do any work on the same to make it attractive for showing and sale. Plaintiff waited only 28 days after repossession and 8 days after termination of the lease to sell the aircraft. Plaintiff sold the aircraft to Defendant\u2019s sub-lessee and the entity from which Plaintiff secured possession of the aircraft. Plaintiff contacted only one of five or six operators who were in operations in which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>type of aircraft was being utilized. Plaintiff contacted only one aircraft broker and did not place the aircraft with him for sale. All other contacts by Plaintiff were within its own organization. Plaintiff\u2019s agent in charge of the sale testified that he did not advertise the plane because he did not want to get involved with a broker\u2019s commission; that Plaintiff\u2019s Finance Committee reviewed the matter and instructed him to get rid of the aircraft. . . . Defendants offered testimony that. . . the aircraft involved herein was not grounded when repossessed and sold but had a Certificate of Airworthiness and was capable of being flown. Defendants also produced evidence that it would cost only approximately $300 per month to maintain the aircraft pending timely efforts to properly sell the same which amount would have covered the cost of ground insurance, airport parking fees and engine run-up expense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In the case at bar the boat was not sold but it is clear that Bower did not advertise it for sale in any of the customary yachting publications such as \u201cYachting\u201d or \u201cMotor Boating.\u201d He did not place it with a yacht broker. Anyone knowledgeable in this field would surely have predicted that a single advertisement in the Washington' Star would be unproductive, as indeed it turned out to be. The \u201coffers\u201d of Baumann, Callow and Sharper have a curiously improbable air. The appellant caused a subpoena to be issued for Baumann\u2019s attendance at the trial but the deputy\u2019s return was \u201cNon est \u2014 moved out of the area\u201d and his letter does not strike us as the approach a yachtsman or a would-be yachtsman would make. Callow was at least an acquaintance of \u201cDear Donald\u201d and what he meant by offering to \u201cpay the cost of transportation\u201d is something of an enigma. Callow was returned \u201cSummoned\u201d but he did not appear. Bower does not appear to -have made any effort to procure the testimony of either of the \u201ctwo (2) Cris Craft boat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>dealers\u201d mentioned in Sharper\u2019s letter. Although the letter suggests Bower could have accepted the offer merely by cashing the check one might well doubt he ever intended to sell at that price.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In <em>Dynalectron, supra, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cIn the circumstances of this case, the Court finds and concludes the Plaintiff did not sell the aircraft in a commercially reasonable manner. Plaintiff did not advertise or otherwise make normal and reasonable contacts within the industry to dispose of the aircraft. Rather, the Court believes that Plaintiff merely took the quick and easy way out by selling the aircraft to the same people who had been using it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201cAs the Court finds that the sale of the aircraft by the Plaintiff was not accomplished in a commercially reasonable manner, the Plaintiff is not entitled to a deficiency judgment against either Defendant. 4 Anderson Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-504:28 states, \u2018The creditor is not entitled to a deficiency judgment unless the sale of the collateral was conducted in a manner which was commercially reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We have been unable to hazard a guess as to what Bower may have had in mind during the period April 1970 to September 1971, a period embracing two full boating seasons. Most chattels depreciate at a fairly constant rate but it is well known that yachts like the Barbara K, if not carefully and constantly maintained, depreciate at a ruinously progressive rate. Bower permitted this to happen and this seems to us to be not only not commercially reasonable but to be also utterly lacking in common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The uncontroverted evidence seems to support the notion that the boat had a fair market value of $13,900 when he took title and possession. What it was worth at the time of trial we can only guess, since the chan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>cellor made no finding, but it seems safe to assume it was worth a great deal less. The shrinkage in value must be attributed to Bower\u2019s conduct which we are persuaded to categorize as not commercially reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We think the chancellor could very well find that the appellant is entitled to a credit of $13,900. We shall remand the case for his further consideration in this regard. A claim is made that the chancellor neglected to allow a credit for the $1,042.12 interest payment made by Harris in August 1968. It seems to us that in this regard the record is not at all clear. Upon remand the precise figure can be calculated by the chancellor. It is hardly necessary to observe that after a proper credit is accomplished Bower, having become the record owner of the Barbara K, may make whatever disposition of it suits his fancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\n<em>Decree of 13 October 1971 and 5 January 1972 reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">\n<em>Case remanded for further consideration and for the passage of a decree conformable with the views expressed in this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">\n<em>Costs above and below to be paid by the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">.
