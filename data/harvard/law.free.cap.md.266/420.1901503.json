The operation was being supervised by Willard N. Lave (Lave), a vice president of the contractor, Charles A. Gareis, Inc. (Gareis). The crane, owned by Arundel Crane Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Corp. (Arundel), had been leased to Gareis. It had been manufactured by Koehring Company (Koehring) and it had been sold to Arundel by L. B. Smith, Inc. (Smith). Elmer C. Bierman, an ironworker and an employee of Gareis, was inside the hopper. Something gave way causing the hopper to drop from the boom of the crane. Bier-man was tumbled about sustaining injuries for which he claimed and received workmen\u2019s compensation. The appellant (Penn National) which had issued a workmen\u2019s compensation policy to Gareis has paid and is paying the compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In March 1969 Bierman \u201cindividually and to the use of\u201d Penn National sued Arundel for negligently \u201cproviding a crane which was not capable of handling the weight of the hopper\u201d and which was otherwise defective. Arundel promptly impleaded Koehring, Smith and Lave, and Bierman thereupon amended his declaration to include them as parties defendant. Lave then called upon Penn National to defend him under a comprehensive liability policy it had issued to Gareis. In June 1970 Penn National, having refused both coverage and defense, filed its amended bill for a declaratory decree asking the court to construe the policy and to determine whether \u201cLave is an insured under the policy\u201d and \u201cwhether coverage would be excluded under the personal injury claim of\u201d Bierman.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The statement of facts (edited) which follows was agreed to by all of the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">1. On June 27, 1967, Bierman, an employee of Gareis, sustained an accidental injury arising out of and during the course of his employment with Gareis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">2. On June 27, 1967, Gareis had in force and effect a Workmen\u2019s Compensation policy issued by Penn National.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">3. As a result of the accident, Bierman received Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits from Gareis, through its Workmen\u2019s Compensation policy issued by Penn National.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>4. There is presently pending in the Baltimore City Court a suit by Bierman to his own use and to the use of Penn National against Smith, Arundel, Koehring and Lave for damages arising out of the accident of June 27, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">5. On June 27, 1967 Gareis also had in force and effect Comprehensive Liability Policy No. CL4 24 32 issued by Penn National.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">6. Lave is an executive officer of the named insured, Gareis, and qualifies as an insured under the policy issued to Gareis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The case came on for trial in June 1971 before Perrott, J., without a jury. In December Judge Perrott filed an order declaring that the policy afforded coverage to Lave \u201cto the extent of the monetary limits therein set forth\u201d in respect of Bierman\u2019s suit for damages. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The provisions of the policy with which we shall be concerned are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cInsuring Agreements\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cCoverage B \u2014 Bodily Injury Liability \u2014 Except Automobile.

Severability of Interests. The term \u2018the insured\u2019 is used severally and not collectively, but the inclusion herein of more than one insured shall not operate to increase the limits of the company\u2019s liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Penn National argues here as it did below that, since \u201c[t]he unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and also includes under . . . [Coverage B] any executive officer,\u201d subsections (f) and (h) of the \u201cExclusions\u201d preclude liability. Lave contends (as do Arundel, Koehring and Smith) that the \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clause requires a finding that the exclusions are to be applied only against the insured for whom coverage is sought. Because Bierman was not an employee of Lave (nor was Lave under obligation to pay workmen\u2019s compensation benefits) at the time of the accident, he (Lave) argues that Penn National must defend him. Since we seem never to have considered this question before, a review of the decisions of other courts will serve to inform our decision. The cases present a diversity of opinion. We find persuasive, however, the decisions of those courts which, in similar circumstances, have afforded coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">In undertaking the construction of contracts of insurance we must, if we can, ascertain the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the parties from the policy as a whole. We do not follow the rule applied in many jurisdictions that, absent ambiguity, the policy is to be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>H. R. Weissberg Corp. v. N. Y. Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>260 Md. 417, 426 (1971) ; <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 720 (1970) ; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496 (1967) ; <em>Ebert v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Md. 602, 610-11 (1959). Here neither party asserts ambiguity and, indeed, Judge Perrott did not think the words \u201cthe insured\u201d were susceptible of different meanings. We are of like mind. It is necessary, therefore, to view the policy in its entirety if the intention of the parties is to be ascertained. It seems to us that the \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clause must govern here if it is to have any real effect. To hold otherwise, we think, would result in a failure to construe the policy as a whole and, indeed, to do so would be to run counter to what seems to be the clear trend of the weight of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Prior to 1955 insurance policies did not contain \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clauses. Exclusions similar to subsections (f) and (h), <em>supra, </em>were prevalent, however, and courts were frequently called upon to decide who was the insured for purposes of the exclusion. Even absent the \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clause, the decisions are by no means uniform. <em>Compare, e.g., Ginder v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., </em>49 F. Supp. 745 (E. D. Pa. 1942), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>135 F. 2d 215 (3d Cir. 1943), <em>and Kaifer v. Georgia Cas. Co., </em>67 F. 2d 309 (9th Cir. 1953), both affording coverage, <em>with Standard Sur. &amp; Cas. Co. of N. Y. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>281 App. Div. 446, 119 N.Y.S.2d 795 (1953), denying coverage. Some policies, either originally or as a result of an unfavorable court decision, contained language denying coverage under such circumstances. These clauses usually were held sufficient to protect the insurer. <em>See, e.g., Malisfski v. Indem. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>135 F. 2d 910 (4th Cir. 1943). The cases will be found in 50 A.L.R.2d 78, 97-104 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The advent of the \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clauses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>in 1955 served only to compound the difficulty courts were experiencing in deciding who was the insured under various provisions of comprehensive liability policies. As might be expected two positions evolved. <em>General Aviation Supply Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>181 F. Supp. 380 (E. D. Mo. 1960), <em>aff\u2019d </em>283 F. 2d 590 (8th Cir. 1960), cited and to a large extent relied upon by Lave, took the position that where a policy of insurance contains a \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clause such as the one in the case at bar, \u201cthe exclusion within the policy as to employees of the insured should be limited and confined to the employees of the employer who commits the tort or seeks protection.\u201d 181 F. Supp. at 384. Citing <em>Kaifer v. Georgia Cas. Co., supra, </em>the court felt that in setting forth exclusions the insurer should be specific and clear in its designations as to who is excluded. District Judge Weber went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201cThe logical theory for the employee exclusion is to prevent employees of the tort feasor from suing his employer for injuries received thru his employer\u2019s negligence. A reason for this is that employees are usually covered by workmen\u2019s compensation and can recover from the employer, with or without negligence. When negligence is committed by other than his employer, the logic for the exclusion disappears. If the insurer wishes to further exclude its liability, it could clearly so state in its contract and its failure to do so should be strictly construed. Especially is this true when the policy contains a severability clause, for there it can be implied that the insurer is actually recognizing a separate obligation to others, distinct and apart from the obligation it owes to the named insured.\u201d 181 F. Supp. at 384.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>General Aviation, supra, </em>has been cited or relied upon by numerous courts reaching the same result. <em>See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Indemnity Ins. Co. of North </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>America, </em>318 F. 2d 714 (4th Cir. 1963) ; <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. McCormick, </em>286 Ala. 531, 243 So. 2d 367 (1970) ; <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schuitema, </em>183 So. 2d 571 (Fla. App. 1966), <em>aff\u2019d </em>193 So. 2d 435 (Fla. 1967) ; <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co. v. Statesman Ins. Co., </em>274 N.E.2d 419 (Ind. 1971) ; <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Iowa Nat\u2019l Mut. Ins. Co., </em>186 Neb. 115, 181 N.W.2d 247 (1970), for a few of the more recent cases. There are also several articles that support the position which was taken in <em>General </em>Aviation: Brown and Risjord, <em>Loading and Unloading: The Conflict Between Fortuitous Adversaries, </em>29 Ins. Coun. J. 197 (1962) ; Risjord and Austin, <em>Who is \u201cThe Insured?\u201d, </em>24 U. of Kansas City L. Rev. 65 (1955) ; Risjord and Austin, <em>\u201cWho is \u2018The Insured\u2019 \u201d Revisited, </em>28 Ins. Coun. J. 100 (1961). In Gowan, <em>Provisions of Automobile and Liability Contracts, </em>30 Ins. Coun. J. 96, 100 (1963), the author takes the following position in respect of \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u201cAll standard policies provide that the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes certain other persons or organizations called \u2018additional insureds.\u2019 However, the underwriters never intended that each time the single word \u2018insured\u2019 was encountered in the policy, it should be construed collectively as though it meant all possible insureds. To clarify this provision, in 1955 a new \u2018Condition\u2019 was inserted in the standard policies with respect to \u2018Severability of Interests.\u2019 The new Garage policy and subsequent policies including the Family Automobile Policy now provide that the insurance afforded \u2018applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought.\u2019 But, of course, it is not intended that the policy limits will be extended just because of the inclusion of several additional insureds in the grant of coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">While a few of the cases cited thus far may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>decided, at least to some extent, in a climate where insurance contracts are strictly construed against the insurer, it is by no means clear that a different climate would have changed the results. Indeed, as we have pointed out, most courts now interpret \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clauses as expressing an acknowledgment on the part of insurance companies that the term \u201cinsured\u201d does not always mean <em>any </em>insured who could claim coverage under the policy but only the insured claiming coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Some courts, however, have adopted the converse position that \u201c[t]he clear and unambiguous terms of the policy\u201d lead to a conclusion that \u201cno employee of the named insured engaged in the insured\u2019s business can recover on the named insured\u2019s policy against anyone included as an additional insured.\u201d <em>Transport Ins. Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of Texas, </em>161 Tex. 98, 101-2, 337 S.W.2d 284, 290 (1960). The reasoning found in <em>Transport, </em>relied upon by the appellant in the lower court, has been accepted by several courts. <em>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Imperial Cas. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>168 So. 2d 688 (Fla. App. 1964). This decision has been questioned, however, if not overruled, by the Supreme Court of Florida. <em>See Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schuitema, </em>193 So. 2d 435 (Fla. 1967). In <em>\u201cWho is \u2018The Insured\u2019\u201d Revisited, supra, </em>the authors discussed <em>Transport </em>somewhat less than enthusiastically :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cThe last (hopefully) of the new \u2018no coverage\u2019 cases is the one which purported to follow Judge Brown. This was a declaratory judgment proceeding brought by an oil company against the automobile insurer of a truck to establish coverage for the oil company under the automobile policy for injury to the truck driver from an explosion at the loading docks of the oil company. The Court of Civil Appeals held that there was coverage for the oil company for injury to the employee of the named insured, espe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>dally because of the severability of interests provision in th\u00e9 automobile policy, distinguished <em>American Fidelity v. St. Paul-Mercury </em>as \u2018written without the application of the severability of interest clause,\u2019 and cited our second \u2018visit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that notwithstanding the severability of interests clause, the \u2018weight of authority is that if the injured party is the employee of any person who is insured under the policy, the employee exclusion is applicable although the injured may not have been an employee of the person committing the tort\u2019 and, presumably, claiming coverage. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion likewise cited our second \u2018visit\u2019 but pointed out that the cases cited in that article had been \u2018ably distinguished\u2019 by Judge Brown in <em>American Fidelity v. St. Paul-Mercury. </em>The Supreme Court went on to cite the cases which it felt supported its view, cited no cases to the contrary, and, while heavily relying, for Texas, upon Judge Brown\u2019s views in <em>American Fidelity v. St. Paul-Mercury </em>(which, as may be recalled, Judge Brown expressly limited to Alabama), failed to mention Judge Brown\u2019s later decision to the contrary pertaining to Louisiana.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 106, 107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Transport </em>finally met its doom in <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. v. American Gen. Ins. Co., </em>455 S.W.2d 714 (Tex. 1970), wherein it was expressly overruled. Justice McGee wrote for the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201cOur decision in Transport Insurance Co. v. Standard Oil Co. of Texas, supra, failed to give proper emphasis to the \u2018severability of interests\u2019 clause. This fact, accompanied by many subsequent decisions specifically interpreting this clause, lead us to a different result. It was based on prior decisions involving policies that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>did not contain the severability of interests clause. The Fifth Circuit, which wrote the opinion in American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co., supra, upon which this Court relied, has on three subsequent occasions indicated that the presence of the severability of interests provision in the case would have led the court to reach a different result. . . . <em>Transport </em>is overruled.\u201d 455 S.W.2d at 719-20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We think it would serve little purpose to discuss each of the cases Penn National has cited in support of its contention. It suffices to say that we have read them all and that we are not persuaded. Some of them are clearly inapposite; the rest do not project, in our opinion, the more reasonable interpretation of the type of \u201cSeverability of Interests\u201d clause involved in the case at bar. Obviously these provisions were inserted into insurance policies for some purpose. To reach the conclusion Penn National asks us to reach would make the clause useless. This we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
