The action was upon a judgment recovered in a French court at Paris in the Republic of France by the firm of Charles Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co., all whose members were French citizens, against Hilton and Libbey, trading as copartners as aforesaid, and citizens of the United States and of the State of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">The complaint alleged that in 1886, and since, during the time of all the transactions included in the judgment sued on, Hilton and Libbey, as successors to Alexander T. Stewart and Libbey, under the firm of A. T. Stewart <em>&amp; </em>Co., carried on a general Business as merchants in the cities of New York and Paris and elsewhere, and maintained a regular store and place of .business at Paris; that during the same time Charles Fortin &amp; Co. carried on the manufacture and sale of gloves at Paris, and the two firms had there large dealings in that business, and controversies arose in the adjustment of accounts between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">The complaint further alleged that between March 1,1879, and December 1, 1882, five suits were brought'by Fortin <em>&amp;

as modified by the judgment of the appellate court, still remain in full force and effect; \u201c that the said courts respectively had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the controversies so submitted to them, and of tile parties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>said defendants having intervened, by their attorneys and counsel, and applied for affirmative relief in both courts; that the plaintiffs have hitherto been unable to collect the said judgments or any part thereof, by reason of the absence of \u25a0the said defendants, they having given up their business in Paris prior to the recovery of the said judgment on appeal, and having left no property within the jurisdiction of the Eepublic of France, out of which the said judgments might be made;

but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>they were the owners of property situated in that country, which would by the law of France have been liable to seizure if they did not appear in that tribunal; and that they unwillingly, and solely for the purpose of protecting that property, authorized and caused an agent to appear for them in those proceedings;. and that the suits brought by them against Fortin &amp; Co. were brought for the same purpose, and in order to make a proper defence, and to establish counter claims arising out of the transactions between the parties, and to compel the production and inspection of Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s books; and that they sought no other affirmative relief in that tribunal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">The answer further alleged that pending that litigation the defendants discovered gross frauds in the accounts of Fortin &amp;

in that Charles Fortin was permitted to make, and did make, statements not under oath, containing many falsehoods; in that the privilege of cross-examination of Fortin and other persons who made statements before the arbitrator wras denied to the defendants; and in that extracts from printed newspapers,' the knowledge of which was not brought home to the defendants, and letters and other communications in writing between Fortin &amp; Co. and third persons, to which the defendants were neither privy nor party, were received by the arbitrator; that without such improper evidence the judgment would not. have been obtained ; and that the arbitrator was deceived and misled by the false and fraudulent accounts introduced by Fortin &amp; Co., and by the hearsay testimony given without the solemnity of. an oath and without cross-examination, and by the fraudulent suppression of the books and papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">The answer further alleged that Fortin <em>&amp; Co. </em>made up their statements and accounts falsely and fraudulently, and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>intent to deceive the defendants and the arbitrator and the \u2022said courts of France, and those courts were deceived and misled thereby; that, owing to the fraudulent suppression of the books and papers of Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co., upon the trial, and the false statements of Fortin regarding matters involved in the controversy, the arbitrator and the courts of France \u201c were deceived and misled in regard to the merits of the controversies pending before them and \u25a0\u2022wrongfully decided against said Stewart &amp; Co. as hereinbefore stated ; that said judgment hereinbefore mentioned is fraudulent, and based upon false and fraudulent accounts and statements, and is erroneous, in fact and in law, and is void; that the trial hereinbefore mentioned was not conducted according to the usages and practice of the common law, and the allegations and proofs given by said Fortin &amp; Co., upon which said judgment is founded, would not be competent or admissible in any court or tribunal of the United States in any suit between the same parties involving the same subject-matter; and it is contrary to natural justice and public policy that the said judgment should be enforced against a citizen of the United States ; and that, if there had been a full and fair trial upon the merits of the controversies so pending before said tribunals, no judgment would have been obtained against said Stewart &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">\u201c Defendants, further answering, allege that it is contrary to natural justice, that the judgment hereinbefore mentioned should be enforced without an examination of the. merits thereof; that by the laws of the Republic of France, to wit, article 181 [121] of the Royal Ordinance of June 15, 1629, it is provided, namely: \u2018 Judgments rendered, contracts or obligations recognized, in foreign kingdoms and sovereignties, for any cause whatever, shall give rise to no lien or execution in our kingdom. Thus the contracts shall stand for simple promises, and notwithstanding such judgments our subjects against whom they have been rendered may contest their rights anew before our own judges.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">\u201c And it is. further provided by the laws of France, by article 546 of the Code de Procedure Civile, as follows: \u2018 judgments rendered by foreign tribunals shall be capable of execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tion in France, only in the manner and in the cases set forth by articles 2123 and 2128 of the Civil Code.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajf\">\u201cAnd it is further provided by the laws of France, by article 2128 [2123] of the Code de Procedure Civile [Civil-Code], \u2018 A lien cannot, in like manner, arise from judgments rendered in any foreign country, save only as they have been declared in force by a French tribunal, without prejudice, however, to provisions to the. contrary, contained in public laws and treaties; \u2019 [and by article 2128 of that code, \u2018 Contracts entered into in a foreign country cannot give a lien upon property in France, if there are no provisions contrary to this principle in public laws or in treaties.\u2019]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">\u201c That the construction given to said statutes by the judicial tribunals of France is such that no comity is displayed toward the judgments of tribunals of foreign countries against the citizens of France, when sued upon in said courts of France, and the merits of the controversies upon which the said judgments are based are examined anew, unless a treaty to-the contrary effect exists between the said Republic of France and the country in which such judgment is obtained.; that no treaty exists between the said Republic of France and the United States, by the terms or effect of which the judgments of either country are prevented from being examined anew upon the merits, when sued upon in the courts of the country other than that in which it is obtained; that the tribunals of the Republic of France give no force and effect, within the jurisdiction of the said country, to the duly \"rendered judgments of the courts of competent jurisdiction of the United States against citizens of France after proper personal service of the process of said courts is made thereon in this country.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">The answer further set up, by way of counter claim, and in detail, various matters arising out of the dealings between the parties; and alleged that none of the plaintiffs had since 1881 been residents of the State of New York, or within the jurisdiction of that State, but the defendants were and always had-been residents of that State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The answer concluded by demanding that the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>complaint be dismissed, and that the defendants have judgment against them upon the counter claims, amounting to $102,942.91.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">The plaintiffs filed a replication to so much of the answer as made counter claims, denying its allegations, and setting up in bar thereof the judgment sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">The defendants, on June 22, 1888, filed a bill in equity against the plaintiffs, setting .forth the same matters as in their answer to the action at law, and praying for a discovery, and for an injunction against the prosecution of the action. To that bill a plea was filed, setting up the French judgments; and upon a hearing the bill was dismissed. 42 Fed. Rep. 249. From the decree dismissing the bill an appeal was taken, which was the second case now before this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">The action at law afterwards came on for trial by a jury; and the plaintiffs put in the records of the proceedings and judgments in the French courts; and evidence that the jurisdiction of those courts was as alleged in the complaint, and that the practice followed and the method of examining the . witnesses were according to the French law; and also proved the title of Guyot as liquidator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">It was admitted by both parties that, for several years prior to 1876, the firm of Alexander T. Stewart &amp; Co., composed of Stewart and Libbey, conducted their business as merchants in the city of New York, with branches in other cities of America and Europe; that both partners were citizens and .residents of the city and State of New York during the entire period mentioned in the complaint; and that in April, 1876, Stewart died, and Hilton and Libbey formed a partnership to continue the business under the same firm name, and became the owners of all the property and rights of the old firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">The defendants made numerous offers of evidence in support of all the specific allegations of fact in their answer, including the allegations as to the law and comity of France. The plaintiffs, in their brief filed in this court, admitted that most of these offers \u201c Were offers to prove matters in support of the defences and counter claims set up by the defendants in the cases tried before the French courts, and which or most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>of which would have been relevant and competent if the plaintiffs in error are not concluded by the result of- those litigations, and have now the right to try those issues, either on the ground that the French judgments are only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the correctness of those judgments, or on the ground that the case is within the exception of a judgment obtained by fraud.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQZ\">The defendants, in order to show that they should not be concluded by having appeared and litigated in the suits brought against them by the plaintiff in the French courts, offered to prove that they were residents and citizens of the State of New York, and neither of them had been, within four years prior to the commencement of those suits, domiciled or resident within the jurisdiction of those courts; that they had a purchasing agent and a storehouse in Paris, but only as a means or facility to aid in the transaction of their principal business, which was in New York, and they were never otherwise engaged in business in France; that neither of them owed allegiance to France, but they were the owners of property there, which would, according to the laws of France, have been liable to seizure if they had not appeared to answer in those suits; that they unwillingly, and solely for the purpose of protecting their property within the jurisdiction of. the French tribunal, authorized an agent to appear, and he did appear in the proceedings before it; and that their motion to compel an inspection of the plaintiffs\u2019 books, as well as the suits brought by the defendants in France, were necessary by way of defence or counter claim to the suits there brought by the plaintiffs against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">Among the matters which the defendants alleged, and offered to prove, in order to show that the French judgments were procured by fraud, were that Fortin &amp; Co., with intent to deceive and defraud the defendants, and the arbitrator and the courts of France, entered in their books, and presented to the defendants, and to the French courts, accounts, bearing upon the transactions in controversy, which were false and fraudulent, and contained excessive and fraudulent charges against the defendants, in various particulars specified; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>defendants made due application to the Tribunal of Commerce to. compel Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co. to allow their account books and letter books to be inspected by the defendants, and the application was opposed by Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co., and denied by .the tribunal; that the discovery and inspection of those books were necessary to determine the truth of the controversies between the parties; that, before the Tribunal of Commerce, Charles Fortin was permitted to and did give in evidence statements not under oath, relating to the merits of the controversies there pending; and falsely represented that a certain written contract, made in 1873, between Stewart &amp; Co. and Fortin &amp; Co., concerning their dealings, was not intended By the parties to be operative according to its terms; and, in support of that false representation, made statements as to admissions by Stewart in a private conversation with him; and that the defendants could not deny those statements, because Stewart was dead, and they were not protected from the effect of Fortin\u2019s statements by the privilege of cross-examining him under path; and that the French judgments were based upon false and fraudulent accounts presented and statements made by Fortin <em>&amp; </em>Co. before the Tribunal of Commerce during the trial before it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">The records of the judgments of the French courts, put in evidence by the plaintiffs, showed that all the matters now. relied on to show fraud were contested in and considered by those courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiffs objected to all the evidence offered by the defendants, on the grounds that the matters offered to be proved were irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent; that, in respect to them, the defendants were concluded by the judgment sued on and given in evidence; and that none of those matters, if proved, would be a defence to this action upon that judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">The court declined to admit any of the evidence so offered by the defendants, and directed a verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $277,775.44, being the amount of the French judgment and interest. The defendants, having duly excepted to the rulings and direction of the court, sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The writ of error in the action at law and the appeal in the suit in equity were argued together in this court January 19, 22, and 23,1894 \u2022 and, by direction of the court, were reargued in April, \u00cd894, before a full bench.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-5\"><em>Mr. James C. Carter </em>and <em>Mr. Elihu Boot </em>for plaintiffs in error and appellants. <em>Mr. Horace Bussell </em>was on their briefs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">There is .scarcely any doctrine of the law which, so far as respects formal and exact statement, is in a more unreduced and uncertain condition than that which relates to the question what force and effect should be given by the courts of one nation to the judgments rendered by the courts of another nation. Yery numerous decisions have been had, especially in England, relating to this question in the various forms in which it has arisen; but if we should undertake to learn from the opinions of the courts in these cases what principles had been decided, we should find ourselves in utter confusion. On some occasions judges have said that the judgments of foreign tribunals should be treated as being as conclusive as those of our own; on others, that they are at most but <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and are subject to examination generally to ascertain whether justice has been done in them or not; and on others, that whether they are open to examination or not depends upon the circumstances under which they were pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">In the learned notes -to the <em>Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case, </em>in Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, a very minute reference is made to the various decisions in England and in this country, and some attempt made to group and classify them; but the reader will scarcely gain any assistance from them, and will, after perusal, feel certain of one thing only, viz.: that the subject is involved in great confusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-8\">The natural and obvious method of doing justice between two contending parties is to examine their allegations, to ascertain the facts respecting the matter in dispute, and to declare the law arising upon these facts. Aside from reasons of policy, this is the only course which should be pursued. It would be quite irrelevant for one of the parties to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201c This same process has once been pursued before, and the result then reached ought to preclude further inquiry.\u201d To this answer it. would be quite sufficient to reply th\u00e1t if justice had been done before, it could be again, and if it had. not been done, it ought to be done now. But it would be an intolerable burden and expense, both to the public and to the parties, if the courts of the same country could be continually vexed with trials of the same controversy. <em>\u201c Interest reipublieoe ut sit finis litium.\u201d </em>It is necessary that some limitation should be imposed; and the conclusion of state policy in this country and in England has been that the parties should be allowed one full and fair opportunity to try their grievances, and one alone. This is sufficient to prevent attempts at the private redress of injuries. Hence, the general rule applicable to domestic judgments, that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive between the same parties upon the same question in another court, whether as a plea, a bar, or as evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">In reaching this conclusion, some concession is perhaps made from strict and absolute justice in favor of convenience. But justice nevertheless is, as it always must be, the overruling consideration; and the doctrine would never have been adopted unless the conclusion had been thought to be a safe one, that the judgment in the first and only trial allowed would be, in the vast majority of cases, a sound and righteous one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">This doctrine has been established among us in view of the fact that rules and safeguards have been adopted which, if followed, will make the judgment one which- may be enforced without further inquiry. It rests upon two principal considerations : (1) That there is a reasonably safe assurance that the former judgment, reached only after the employment of precautions carefully devised for the elimination of error, is just and right; .and (2) that the maxim <em>\u201cinterest reipubUcee ut sit finis </em>litium,\u201d which deems it a satisfaction of the duty of government to furnish remedial justice, if one fair opportunity has been given, has been duly considered. Both of these considerations are wanting m the case of foreign judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Except in the case of England and some of her colonies, where the national standards of justice, and also the methods of procedure, very much resemble our own, we can have no full assurance that a just conclusion has been reached. In many, perhaps most, other instances, there are substantial differences in the general conceptions of justice, manifested sometimes by peculiar local laws, and sometimes by peculiar doctrines of general jurisprudence, and sometimes by both. And, generally, the methods deemed essential by us to the working out of a just conclusion are not enforced. Jury trials, exclusion of improper evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, etc., are matters to which comparatively little attention is given. And if we may believe what has often been alleged upon good authority, in many countries there is a scandalous amount of partiality, favor and even bribery, in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">The maxim, \u201c <em>interest reipublicee ut sit finis litium,\u201d </em>applies to our own nation only. It is no part of our policy to restrict litigation in the world generally. In the case where a foreign judgment is set up as conclusive, we have not as yet afforded the one fair opportunity to litigate the question upon its original merits, which it is the duty of governments to furnish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">The suggestion that the comity of nations requires conclusive force to be given to foreign judgments, inasmuch as otherwise they will not give like force to our judgments, is wholly insufficient. This comity does, indeed, have a place in this branch of the law, but by no means the force thus suggested. We can never allow the assumption that Morocco, or T\u00farkey, or Eussia, or even Germany, Italy, or France has methods of judicial administration equal to our own, so as to justify ourselves in making a tacit agreement that we will enforce their judgments, if they will ours.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMN\">Our courts cannot show a comity toward England which they would deny to Eussia. If a reciprocity in the treatment of judicial proceedings should be thought desirable, it can be safely brought about by treaty alone, where it may be yielded or withheld at' pleasure. We shall-consider this more at length later.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>If, therefore, foreign judgments are in any case to be held conclusive with us, it must be for other reasons than those upon which we hold domestic judgments conclusive. It cannot be said that foreign judgments are ever so conclusive that no inquiry into them can be allowed; but there are many cases in which they may be justly held substantially conclusive. The common characteristic of all of them is that the obligation of the State to ascertain, declare, and enforce justice according to its own conceptions of justice does not in such cases exist, or is greatly diminished in force; and that it is wiser, safer, and better to adopt and enforce the judgment of the foreign State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-4\">A careful examination of all the cases warrants us in assuming that the question whether a foreign judgment is conclusive, so as to preclude inquiry into the original merits of the controversy, depends upon the circumstances under which it was rendered; and that it is not thus conclusive where the State is under its ordinary obligation to the party demanding such inquiry to give him at least one full and fair opportunity of having his cause adjudicated upon its original merits. It is well settled that wherever a domestic judgment is interposed as a bar to an original investigation, it must appear that such judgment was the result of a proceeding so instituted and prosecuted as to show that the party sought to be precluded from original inquiry did have, in the suit in which the judgment was rendered, this full and fair opportunity. The American courts never can have any such complete assurance that the party against whom a foreign judgment has been rendered did have a full and fair opportunity for an adjudication of his cause, according to our conceptions of justice; and consequently, if, in any case, a foreign judgment is held conclusive, it must be because there is not, in the particular case, any such obligation on the part of the State to that party to afford him even one such full and fair opportunity to have his cause adjudicated according to its conceptions of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">Indeed, the general doctrine, as stated in most cases in the courts of the United States, goes much further than any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the necessities of the present controversy require; and perhaps further than would be allowed in a precise statement of its extent. It declares that foreign judgments are <em>prima, facie </em>evidence only. Only two cases are cited to the contrary. <em>Lazier </em>v. Westcott, 26 N. Y. 146; and <em>New York, Lake Erie &amp; Western Railroad </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>21 Blatchford, 400. In the first case the only question before the appellate court was whether the record was receivable in evidence notwithstanding the technical objections. The court held it .was; but the learned Judge (Davies) who gave the opinion, then proceeded to argue a question not raised, namely, whether foreign judgments were conclusive, and held that they were. This opinion is unimportant. The second was a case of precisely the same character. 'The judgment was in no respect impeached. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">A review of the English cases will show that the doctrine in England never has been, and is not now, inconsistent with the rule herein maintained; but that, on ihe contrary, the question whether a foreign judgment should be held conclusive depends upon the circumstances under which it was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">First, as to the cases decided before a.d. 1800. <em>Isquiredo </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>1 Doug. 6 (n.). This is cited as a decision by Lord Hardwicke, that foreign judgments, when an action is brought upon them, are merely <em>prima facie </em>evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\"><em>Gage </em>v. <em>Bulkeley, </em>3 Atk. 215. On a plea of a foreign sentence in a Commissionary Court in France relating to th.e same matters for which a bill was brought in England, Lord Hardwicke said: \u201c It must be overruled, for it is the most proper' case to stand for an answer, with liberty to except, that I ever met with.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\"><em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>(1768), 1 Doug. 5 (n.); more fully in Morison\u2019s Dec. 4542 (House of Lords). Mrs. Fraser, of Scotland, succeeded to an estate in Jamaica, and, being under age, her tutors appointed Sinclair to manage it. The estate was sold in 1763, and Sinclair procured a judgment in the Supreme Court of Jamaica for a balance due him upon an .account cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>rent, and then brought suit' in Scotland on the Jamaica judgment. The defendant prayed that plaintiff should produce the vouchers of the debts claimed, in order to introduce a fair count. The Lord Ordinary ordered the vouchers to be produced. The plaintiff appealed to the Lords of Sessions, who sustained the Lord Ordinary; upon an appeal to the House of Lords they held that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Jamaica ought to be received as evidence <em>prima facie </em>of the debt, and that it lay upon the defendant to impeach the justice thereof, or to show the same to have been irregularly or unduly obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-4\">The decision went only upon the question of evidence and the burden of proof. Morison so treats it. In his head note he epitomizes the decision as follows: \u201c Found that a foreign decree bearing to have been <em>in foro </em>contentio, had not the effect of <em>res judicata </em>in Scotland, but entitled the party claiming under it to plead that the <em>onus probandi </em>rested on his opponent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">This decision is an authority for the claim that the merits of . a foreign judgment may be attacked. The Scotch courts did not give it the effect of even <em>prima facie </em>evidence. In this, held they were in error, but in this alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>Willes, 36 (n.), Lord Mansfield, in speaking of the judgment of the Hundred Court (a domestic tribunal), said: \u201cBesides, it is not a judgment of a court of record, but like a foreign judgment, and not conclusive evidence of the debt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter </em>(1778), 1 Doug. 1, was an action of debt brought in Middlesex County, England, upon a judgment of the Supreme Court of Jamaica. The question was whether <em>nil debet </em>or <em>nul tiel record </em>was the proper plea. Lord Mansfield held that the former was the proper plea, and said :' \u201c Foreign judgments are a ground of action everywhere, but they are examinable. He recollected a case of a decree on the chancery side in one of the courts of great sessions of Wales, from which th\u00e9re was an appeal to the House of Lords, and the decree affirmed there, and Lord Hardwicke thought himself entitled to examine into the justice of the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the House of Lords, because the original decree was in the court of \"Wales, whose decisions were clearly liable to be examined. He also mentioned a case on th\u00e9 mortmain acts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">In this decision Justices \"Willes, Ashurst, and Buller, all concurred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\"><em>Galbraith </em>v. <em>Neville </em>(a.d. 1789), 1 Doug. 6 (n.); <em>S. C. </em>5 East, 475-9 (n.): This was an action of debt on a judgment recovered in the Supreme Court of Jamaica. Th\u00e9re whs a verdict for the plaintiff. An order to show cause was made why there should not be a new trial. The reporters are in conflict as to, the decision made upon the return of this order. Douglas has it, that there was a new trial granted. East says \u2014 in a note o\u00fc 5 Ehst, 475 \u2014 \u201c It is there [Douglas 5 and 6J stated that the rule for, a new trial \u25a0 . ... was absolute. But, according to my note of the case, it stood over from Easter 29 to Michaelmas 31 Geo. 3 for the court to advise upon it, when Lord Kenyon, C. J., said that the court had considered.the matter, and were all of opinion that no new. trial ought to be granted. He added that, without entering into the question how far a foreign judgment was impeachable, it was at all events clear that it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt; and they were of opinion that no evidence had been adduced to impeach this; and, therefore, discharged the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">It is apparent from these reports that if East was correct, as he .probably was, in point of fact the judgment had been attacked on its merits, and the court finally determined to discuss the weight of evidence; and, upon this proposition it came to the conclusion that the weight of the impeaching evidence was not sufficient to overthrow the presumption in favor of the judgment. In this case Justice Buller said, and his opinion, only is quoted, because if the report is correct in East, the court took a position side by side with him instead of with Lord Kenyon. He says: \u201c The doctrine which was laid down in <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>has always been considered as the true line ever since; namely, that the foreign judgment shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and conclusive till it be impeached by the other party. -. I have often heard Lord Mansfield repeat what was said by Lord Hardwicke in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>case alluded to from Wales, and the ground of his Lordship\u2019s opinion, was this: when you call for my assistance to carry into effect the'decision of some- other tribunal, you shall not have it, if it appears that you are -wrong, and it was upon that account that he said he would examine into the propriety of the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">' \u201c As .to actions of this sort, see how far the court could go, if what was said in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter </em>were departed from; it was there held that a foreign judgment was only, to be taken to be right, <em>prima </em>faoie, that is, we will allow the same force to a foreign judgment that we do to those of .our courts not of record; but if the matter were carried further we should give them more credit; we should give them equal force with the courts of record here; now a foreign judgment has never been considered as a record.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-6\">The next case in order is <em>Messin </em>v. Massareene, 4 T. R. 493 (1791). The plaintiff having obtained a judgment against the defendant in the Ch\u00e1telet of Paris, brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>in King\u2019s Bench upon that judgment. Judgment was allowed to go by default. Walton, counsel of plaintiff, obtained a rule or order to show cause why it should not be referred to a master to see what was due for principal and interest without executing a writ of inquiry. It was contended that there was no instance in which such course had .been taken. Kenyon, C. J., said: \u201cThis is an attempt to carry the rule, further than has yet been done, and as there is no instance of the kind I am not disposed to make a precedent.\u201d Buller, J., said: \u201cThough debt will,lie here on a foreign judgment, the defendant may go into consideration of it.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">The judgment involved in the <em>Duchess of Kingston's case </em>was a; domestic judgment, and not that of a foreign court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIqU\">This brings us to the close of the century with the following result: We have Hardwicke, Mansfield, Ashurst, Buller, and Willes holding that a foreign judgment was examinable upon the merits. There were <em>dicta </em>by Lord\" Kenyon t\u00a9 the contrary, but overruled by,his court, if East is correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">In no case do any of the judges combat the position, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>if it appears that there has not been a fair trial upon the merits the judgment has no force as \u00bf bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">Since 1800 we have the following cases, which appear to have been relied upon below: <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>3 Hare, 100; <em>Godard </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>L. R. 6 Q. B. 139; <em>Schibsby </em>v. Westenholtz, L. R. 6 Q. B. 155; <em>Rousillon </em>v. <em>Rousillon, </em>14 Ch.

On the contrary, a further search would have disclosed cases which rejected it. <em>De Cosse Brissac </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>6 H. <em>&amp; </em>N. 301, is the only case which appears to fully sustain the conclusiveness of a foreign judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-7\">The cases in which it has been determined in England that the foreign judgment under consideration in them was conclusive happen to have been of a character in which there was no very good reason for allowing the judgment to be impeached; but the courts in pronouncing their decisions, have sometimes announced a doctrine much broader than the case before them; and, instead of saying that the foreign judgments, <em>in the particular cases they were considering, </em>were not open to impeachment, declared generally that such judgments were conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-8\">In declaring this large conclusion there has sometimes been an attempt to formulate a principle, or principles, which would sustain the doctrine in the eye of reason; and two principles have been laid down as sufficient to justify the broad determination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-9\">The first was originated by a judge of high authority, Hr. Baron Parke, in the case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Smyth, </em>9 M. &amp; W. 810, that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction over the defendant imposes a duty or obligation on the defendant to pay the sum for which judgment is given which the courts in England are bound to enforce. This was the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>maihly relied upon in the court below by the counsel for the plaintiff in that court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">The other ground upon which the doctrine has been supported in the English cases is rather one of policy, namely, that the courts of that country should not engage in the work of retrying cases which have once been tried in a foreign country, for the reason that their judgments would not prob.ably be any more agreeable to right and justice than the foreign judgment; which is the view which the learned judge in the court below preferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\">But an excellent opportunity was afforded to some English judges in 1882 to test the soundness of these principles, and the Court of King\u2019s Bench immediately and utterly broke away from them. <em>Abouloff </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>10 Q. B. D. 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">This action was brought on a Russian judgment rendered in an action where<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff charged that the defendant had property in his possession which he refused to restore, and asked that its restoration on payment of its value by the defendant be. compelled; and where the court decided in favor of the plaintiff and adjudged the defendant to pay' the value of the goods. The defendant sought to impeach this judgment by a -separate defence which alleged that it was obtained by the gross fraud of the plaintiff in representing to the court that the goods were in the defendant\u2019s possession, whereas they were at all times in the plaintiff\u2019s possession, as he well knew. To this defence a demurrer was interposed, and the argument was on this demurrer. It was not pretended that the Russian- court had not full jurisdiction, or that a Russian judginent was not as conclusive as any other foreign judgment, or that the defendant in Russia was in any manner so deceived or imposed upon that he had not had a perfectly full and fair opportunity to defend himself, or that any artifice was employed by which the court was in any manner disabled or impeded in the discharge of its function of determining the truth. It was the simple case of the bringing of an action by a plaintiff who knew he had no good cause of action- and supporting it \"by the falsehood of himself and witnesses, one or both. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The entire breaking down in this case of the rule, not founded upon the adjudications, but upon the dicta, of English cases, as well as of the erroneous principle upon which that rule had been said to rest, namely, that a foreign judgment created an obligation, is a pro.of of the falsity of the doctrine. In the presence of the fact, which the demurrer seemed to present, that the Russian judgment could not be enforced without committing a palpable wrong, the court determined not to enforce it. The mistake made was in not. perceiving that the doctrine had been too largely stated, and that the true way of meeting the case was by limiting the doctrine to its just proportions, and making a discrimination between the cases where a foreign judgment should properly be held conclusive, and those where it should not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">This case was followed by <em>Vadala </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>25 Q. B. D. 310, in which the court, referring to <em>Abouloff </em>v. Oppenheimer, said: \u201cI. cannot fritter away that judgment, and I cannot read the judgments without seeing that they amount to this: that if the fraud upon the foreign court consists in. the fact that the plaintiff has induced that court by fraud to come to a wrong conclusion you can reopen the whole case, even although you will have in this court to go into the very facts which were investigated, and which were in issue in the foreign court. The technical objection that the issue is the same is technically answered by the technical reply that the issue is not the same, because in this court you have to consider whether the foreign court has been imposed upon. That, to my mind, .is only meeting technical argument by a technical answer, and I do not attach much importance to it; but, in that case, the court faced the difficulty that you could not give effect to the defence without retrying the merits. The fraud practised on the court, or alleged to have been practised on the court, was the misleading of the court by evidence known by the plaintiff to be false. That was the whole fraud. The question of fact, whether what the plaintiff had said in the court- below was or was not false, was the very qu\u00e9stion of fact that had been adjudicated on in the foreign court; and, notwithstanding that was so, when the court came to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>aider how the two rules, to which I have alluded, could be worked together, they said: \u2018Well, if that foreign judgment was obtained fraudulently, and if it is necessary, in order to prove that fraud, to retry the merits, you are entitled to do so according to-the law of this country.\u2019 I cannot read that case'in any other way. Lord Coleridge uses language which I do not think is capable of being misunderstood. .In order to understand the judgment it is well to look at the argument for the defence \u2014 an argument conducted by Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Cohen, and an argument which I understand to have been accepted by the court: \u2018 Even if the Russian courts had inquired into the existence of the fraud and had been induced by fabricated evidence to come to a wrong conclusion, the circumstances under which the judgments were given could be investigated in an English court.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\">Thus it is plain that, in the light of the above decisions, no one can say that the present doctrine of the English courts is that a foreign judgment is necessarily conclusive, even where there was full jurisdiction, and a full opportunity for trial of the very point upon which the judgment is assailed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">The leading decisions of the state and federal courts will be found reported in the following cases, and are not in conflict with our contentions: <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>9 Mass. 462; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>11 Cush. 8; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Pick. 232; <em>Buttrick </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>8 Mass. 273; <em>McKim </em>v. <em>Odom, </em>3 Fairf. 12 Maine 94; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>3 J.

And this denial extends to all cases whatsoever as against French citizens. If the alleged conclusiveness- of foreign judgments is placed upon grounds of comity, how can the doctrine apply to the judgments of the courts of a nation which absolutely refuses reciprocity ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">This is not the case. where our courts are called upon to. enforce a statute, as in <em>The Scotland, </em>105 U. S. 24, 33.; but where they are to declare what the law of comity is and' requires. If a legislature passes a law the judicial tribunals are bound to execute it, even in favor of the citizens of a nation which has no similar law. A legislature may dispense, if it chooses, with the benefit of reciprocity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">The literal meaning, of the word \u201c comity \u201d is \u201c courtesy \u201d \u2014 a disposition to accommodate but the' word is seldom employed, in juridical discussions, in that sense. No court is at liberty to deny or to refuse a claim made before it, according as mere courtesy or a disposition- to accommodate \" shall require. What comity requires is as much required in courts of justice as anything else; and the inquiry, therefore, what comity is, is only another mode of inquiring what the law is in respect to the force which the laws, judicial proceedings /or other acts done in one State ought to have in another State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-7\">Says Chief Justice Taney in <em>Bank of Augusta </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>13 Pet. 519, 589, \u201c It is needless to enumerate here the instances in which, by the general practice of civilized countries, the laws of the one will, by the comity of nations, be recognized and executed in another, where the rights of individuals are concerned. The cases of contracts made in a foreign countiy are familiar examples; and courts of justice have always expounded and executed them, according to the law of the place in which they were made ; provided that law was not repugnant to the laws or policy of their own country. The .comity thus extended to other nations is no impeachment of sovereignty. It is the voluntary act of the nation by which it is offered; and is inadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>to' its interests. But it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals and to produce a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to which they belong, that courts of justice have continually acted upon it as a part of the voluntary law of nations. It is truly said in Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws (p. 37), that \u2018 in the silence of any positive rule affirming or denying, or restraining the operation of foreign laws, courts of justice presume the tacit adoption of them by their own government, unless they are repugnant to its policy or prejudicial to its interests. It is not the comity of the courts, but the comity of the nation which is administered and ascertained in the same way and guided by the same reasoning by which all other principles of municipal law are asbertained and guided.\u2019 \u201d \u2018</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">Our main contention, as already argued, is that it was the duty of the United States, and of each of the Spates, to furnish to their citizens one fair and full opportunity of establishing their claims by a trial upon the original merits; that a foreign judgment could not be made the occasion for denying this right, unless it could be said that it was certain that, such judgment was as effective as our own in securing justice to the litigants ; and that with our notions of the essential merits \\of our own judicial procedure it was impossible to assent to the view that the procedure of foreign nations, indiscriminately) was as well calculated to secure justice as our own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">If we are right in this contention, it follows that the question of comity has'nothing to do with this case'; because, the giving effect here to the law of France which makes her own judgments conclusive there, would be prejudicial to our own policy add to the rights and interests of our own citizens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">Assuming that our contention is correct, that foreign judgments are, in general, not conclusive, but may be so under some circumstances, there is nothing in the circumstances of the present case making this particular judgment conclusive upon the defendants therein. In no just sense could the appearance of Stewart <em>&amp; </em>Co. in the French suit be deemed to be a voluntary one, so as to charge them with the responsibility of the litigation. If they had conceived that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>could carry on the dry goods business in France also as well as in America, that they could cater to the wants of- the French as well as French merchants, and thereby make money, and had, in pursuance of such a. view, gone abroad and established a mercantile storehouse there, and offered to sell goods to the people of Paris, and thus to come in competition with other merchants of Paris; in other words, to do in France just the same thing that Frenchmen \u00e1re doing, then, indeed, a very different case would be presented. They would then be doing something not required by any of the necessities of a New -York business. The French themselves have drawn this distinction with great clearness by refusing general access to their courts as suitors to all foreigners wffo are not actually domiciled in France.

Can they do so without! endangering the stability of their entire structure ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">Reciprocal comity is the only ground upon which any civilized nation in the world, aside from England and the United States, gives or ever has given conclusive effect to foreign judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">14. Foelix, a French author of high authority, in his Trait\u00e9 du Droit International Priv\u00e9, gives an exhaustive review of the laws and usages .of all civilized nations in respect of the effect given to foreign judgments. It appears, that aside from England and the United States, there are but two views followed. France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Sweden and Norway, and some minor countries which derive their laws from France, such as Belgium, the canton of Geneva, Greece and Hayti, give no effect whatever to a foreign judgment as <em>res judimta.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">On the other hand, all the other countries of Europe, including Germany, Austria, Prussia, Denmark and a multitude of smaller States, have adopted the principle of reciprocity, and give the effect of <em>res judicata </em>to the judgments of other States which give a similar effect to their judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The principle has been adopted and enforced alike by the decisions of the courts under the common law of Germany, and by the statutes of the other nations mentioned, but no nation whatever gives such effect to any foreign judgment except upon the express ground of reciprocal treatment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-4\">.The grounds upon which the German courts proceed are well illustrated by the reasons which this author recites as given by the court of Cologne, in Rhenish Prussia, in deciding that a native who has been defeated before a foreign tribunal can try anew his rights before \u201chis <em>natural </em>judges, called upon to. give execution to the foreign judgment.\u201d The principal reasons stated are, in substance: \u201c That a new examination into the merits of the cause can alone assure to the subject that protection to which he has a right, and that foreign judgments ought not to receive their execution in Rhenish Prussia except as Prussian judgments receive equally their execution in the country where the judgment the execution of which is in question was rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">Many of the countries mentioned have express statutes embodying this reciprocal principle, and in all the others the author says \u201cthe jurisprudence and the opinion of authors have sanctioned the same principle.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">\u25a0 The French theory is well stated in decisions of the courts of Nimes and Bordeaux. They say: \u201c It is considered that it is a principle of the public law of France . . . that the right of the tribunals of the Kingdom to order or refuse the execution of foreign judgments draws with it that of verifying the correctness of the judgment in matters of fact as in matters of law: . . . that the party brought before the tribunals to have a judgment rendered in a foreign country put into execution against him has the right to defend himself by all the means of the law, both as to form and as to the merits, and in the same manner as if the judgment did not exist.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">The entire weight of European authority, aside from Great Britain, therefore, is that no State should ever enforce against one of its own citizens the judgment of another State except upon the ground of reciprocal advantage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>It is to be observed that every decision in the United States upon which the defendants in error rely as illustrating what they claim to be a tendency towards .a new rule, relates to an English or a Canadian judgment; that is, a judgment of. a country which does, in fact, profess to give the effect of- <em>res judicata </em>to our judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">In <em>Lazier </em>v. <em>Wescott, </em>26 N. Y. 146, the judgment sued upon was recovered in Canada. In <em>Dunston </em>v. Higgins, 138 N. Y. 70, the judgment sued on was rendered by the High Court of Justice of England, Queen\u2019s Bench Division. In <em>Baker </em>v. Palmer, 83 Illinois, 568, the judgment sued on was Canadian. In <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>in the Superior Court of Connecticut, decided January. 4, 1894, the judgment sued on was English.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">The fact that England and Canada- do .give effect to our judgments, added to the fact that they proceed according to the course of the common'law and dispense the same kind of justice in the same way as our own tribunals, may be supposed to have influenced the minds of the courts before whom these judgments were brought. Two at least of those courts (in the latest case in' New York, and in the Illinois case) put their judgments upon the express ground of comity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">The Michigan case was a clear case of a voluntary appearance, the defendant having apparently gone to Canada for the express purpose of uniting with plaintiff to invoke the jurisdiction of the Canadian court, which could not otherwise have attached either to him or to his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-8\">The Connecticut case was decided by a single judge of a subordinate state court within the Second Circuit, and may be regarded as following rather than adding to, the decision of the Circuit Court of that circuit now under review..</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-9\">The general expression of judicial opinion in this country in recent years has included this question of reciprocity as an important element in determining the treatment to be given to foreign judgments.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-10\">Judge Woodbury, in <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>1 Wood. <em>&amp; </em>Min. 172 (see also 2 Ware, 236), says: <em>\u201c </em>When offered and considered, elsewhere than in their own jurisdiction they (foreign judgments) are <em>ex comitate </em>treated with respect according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>nature of the judgment and the character of the tribunal which rendered it and the reciprocal mode, if any, in which that government treats our judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anu\">Judge Woodruff, in <em>De Brimont </em>v. <em>Penniman, </em>10 Blatchford, 436, says: \u201c The principle upon which foreign judgments receive any recognition in our courts is one of comity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">Judge Coxe says, in <em>New York, Lake Erie &amp;c. Railroad </em>v. <em>McHenry, </em>21 Blatchford, 400: \u201c The rule as to foreign judgments rests upon considerations of comity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">Mr. Justice Cooley, in <em>McEwen </em>v. <em>Limmer, </em>American Law Register, speaking of the force and effect due Canadian judgments, says: \u201cWe should certainly never have assurance to demand from them more than we would freely and voluntarily concede to them. True comity is equality. We should demand nothing more and concede nothing less.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">In the foregoing reference to the American authorities relied' upon by the defendants in error we have omitted as having no real bearing upon the question the case of <em>Silver Lake Bank </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>5 Ohio, 544, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the judgment of a Justice of the Peace in Pennsylvania was within the meaning of the constitutional provision, requiring full faith and credit to be given to th\u00e9 judgments of other States, and was entitled to receive effect as <em>res judicata; </em>and the case of <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>48 Arkansas, 50, in which a judgment of a Justice of the Peace in Tennessee received a similar effect; and the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jamison, </em>15 La. Ann. 35, in which a plaintiff, who had himself brought suit against a defendant in the island of Jamaica, where both parties were domiciled, and obtained a judgment, was held not entitled to sue. again here on the original demand which he had by his own act caused to be merged in the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-8\">It may fairly be said that in America, as well as in Europe, the general weight of opinion and of practice tends to the result that if foreign judgments are to receive any effect at all as <em>res judicata, </em>that effect should be limited to judgments rendered by the courts of a country which gives similar effect to- the judgments of that country in which the proceeding is brought.

The French courts having jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties, their judgments are conclusive to the same extent as domestic judgments, unless impeached for want of jurisdiction or for fraud in procuring the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\">The modern rule both in England and this country, overruling the earlier decisions which made a foreign judgment <em>prima facie </em>evidence only of a debt, is that a foreign judgment <em>in personam </em>is conclusive as to the existence \u2022 of the debt established thereby, provided the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties; and such judgment can be impeached only for fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">It having been contended by the plaintiffs in error upon the first argument of this case that the law is not settled in favor of the conclusiveness of foreign judgments we-submit a statement of the English cases from the earliest times to the present day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\"><em>Wier\u2019s case, </em>1 Kolle\u2019s Abr. 530, is the earliest case. The plaintiff, a native of Friesland, attempted to enforce in England, by execution, a judgment obtained in Friesland against the defendant, an Englishman. The court said: \u201c It is by the law of nations that the justice of one nation will be an aid to the justice of another nation, and the one execute the judgment of the other; and the law of England takes notice of this law and the Judge of Admiralty is the proper magistrate for this purpose, for he [sits] solely for the execution of the civil law in this realm.\u201d The Court bf King\u2019s Bench, on <em>habeas corpus, </em>refused to release the defendant, who was taken in execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-9\">In <em>Cottington\u2019s case, </em>2 Swanston, 326, n. where the validity of a sentence of divorce by the Archbishop .of Turin was involved, <em>Wier\u2019s case </em>was approved, the court saying: \u201cIn <em>Wytred\u2019s</em> <em>[Wier\u2019s] case, </em>5 Jac., a judgment given in Holland for debt was executed here by the Admiralty of England upon the person who fled from execution there, and this was allowed upon a <em>habeas corpus </em>in B.

The defendant, alleged that there were no customs due to the Duke after seven years, and that there had been a reference of all differences to arbitrators, before whom the matter of the customs was not insisted upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\">But the court said: \u201c Let the plaintiff receive back so much of the money brought into court as may be adequate to- the sum paid on the sentence for custom, the justice whereof is- not examinable here.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-6\">In <em>Dupleix </em>v. <em>De Roven, </em>2 Vernon, 543 (1705), the plaintiff filed a bill for discovery of assets and satisfaction of a judgment debt obtained in France against the defendant, an administrator. The court said: \u201c Although the plaintiff obtained a judgment or sentence in France, yet here the debt must be considered as a debt by simple contract. The plaintiff can maintain no action here, but an <em>widebitatus assumpsit </em>or an <em>insum\u00fcl computasset, </em>so that the statute of limitations is pleadable in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-7\">In <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Jemino </em>(cited as Jamereau, Jamineau, and <em>Jemineau) </em>(1726), 2 Stra. 733; <em>S.

Ab. 476, a suit had bean brought at Leghorn against the plaintiff as the acceptor of a bill of exchange drawn there, and the judges of the court being of the opinion that the acceptance was not valid by the law of the country, so adjudged. Both parties after-wards happening to come to England, the plaintiff in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>suit at Leghorn brought his action here, but the defendant in that suit brought his bill in chancery for an injunction, and Lord Chancellor King held that \u201c the court at Leghorn having a general and proper jurisdiction of the cause, their judgment was binding and conclusive with the court here,\u201d and granted a perpetual injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">In <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1734), Cas. temp., Hardwicke, 85, the. plaintiff brought an action on the case against the defendant as owner of a ship for his failure to deliver Portuguese gold, which defendant undertook to carry from Portugal to, London, and there deliver to plaintiff. On the trial a special verdict was found, which determined among other things that' it was unlawful according to the laws of Portugal to export, gold. The counsel for defendant contended that if the courts of England held the particular determination of courts abroad to be conclusive in England, they should have more regard for the general laws of the foreign country declaring anything an unlawful trade, and not give any countenance to actions brought upon illicit commerce, citing the case <em>of-Burrows </em>v. <em>Jamineau. </em>Lord Hardwicke on this point said: \u201c The reason gone upon by King, Lord Chancellor, in the case of <em>Burrows </em>v. Jamineau, was certainly right, and where any court, whether foreign or domestic, that has the proper jurisdiction of the cases makes a determination, it is conclusive to all other courts.\u201d He then criticised the decision of the chancellor, on the ground that the party could have set up the defence in the suit at law, and that on that ground the bill should have been dismissed. He then refers to the case of Cottington\u2019s appeal in the time of Charles II. as supporting the same conclusion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">In <em>Otway </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>2 Stra. 1090 (1737), in the King\u2019s Bench, it was held that debt does not lie in Ireland on an English judgment. The case is more fully reported in a note to4B. &amp; C. 414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">In <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Bulkeley, </em>3 Atk. 215 (1744). This was a plea of a foreign sentence in a Commissary Court in France relating' to the same matters, for which the bill was brought here. Lord Hardwicke said: \u201c It must be overruled, for it is the most proper case to stand for an answer with liberty to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>cept that I ever met with; and the more so as it is the sentence in a commissary court only, which is \u00f3f a political nature, in order to determine disputes which might arise in relation to French actions.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-4\">This case is referred to by Lord Chancellor Camden in <em>Bayley </em>v. Edwards, 3 Swanston, 703 (1792), as \u201cgoing a great way to show the true effect of foreign sentences in this country.\u201d Yet it seems only to rule that a defence of a foreign judgment should be taken by answer and not by plea, and it is evident that Lord Hardwicke doubted whether the court was a competent court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">In <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Garvan, </em>1 Ves. Sen. 157 (1748), before Lord Hardwicke, an infant, a ward of the court, having in France intermarried with the son, of her guardian at that time, the husband petitioned for a decree for cohabitation with his wife, who was kept from him by her mother, who had lately been appointed her guardian. Lord Hardwicke: \u201c Where- a marriage is in fact had, or in a contract <em>in praesenti </em>or in a suit for' restitution of conjugal rights, a sentence in the Ecclesiastical Court, (unless there be collusion which will overturn, the whole,) will be conclusive and bind all; but not if given in a collateral suit, as for a criminal action, for it will only bind the rights of the marriage in the three cases above. This was in a criminal court in the Ch\u00e1telet in Paris, and it is strange if they have no other jurisdiction in France for marriage than a criminal court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">Lord Hardwicke seems to have doubted in this case also whether the court could be considered as a competent court whose judgment would be conclusive and held binding in England.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">Up to this time in the reported decisions, while the courts refused to give to the record of a foreign judgment the full effect of a record of the superior courts of Westminster, there seems to' have been no diversity in the opinions of the judges that a foreign judgment.of a competent court having jurisdiction over the party and the subject matter was to be held binding and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">The case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>(1771), reported in 1 Doug. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>5, note, appears to be the earliest case containing a dictum to the effect that a foreign judgment is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a debt. The actual question there involved was not to what extent a foreign judgment could be reexamined on the merits, but whether it could be made the basis of an action without proof of the original consideration. It is entirely consistent with the decision, and with anything said by the judges, that the court might have held that where the parties to a foreign suit had both been within the jurisdiction, and the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and the cause was tried on its merits, it would have been held binding upon the parties although the defendant offered to try it over again.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atj\">This idea is suggested by Lord Campbell, in his opinion in the case of <em>Bank of Australasia v. Nias, </em>16 Q. B. 717 (1851); and the suggestion is supported by the very words of the declaration of the House of Lords, above cited, that it lies upon .the defendant to impeach the justice thereof, or to show the same to have been irregularly or unduly obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-6\">The case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>was followed in 1775 by. the case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Witten, </em>Lofft, 154; in which it was determined that although the original cause is not considered as merged in a foreign judgment the foreign judgment could be sued on alone in <em>assumpsit, </em>as implying a promise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\"><em>The Duchess of Kingston\u2019s case, </em>11 Hargrave\u2019s St. Trials, 198, hardly touches upon this controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter </em>(1778), 1 Doug. 1, was debt on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Jamaica. The pleas were <em>nil debet </em>and <em>nul tiel record. </em>The real question in the case was whether <em>debt </em>would lie on a foreign judgment. On the plea of <em>nil debet </em>the plaintiff took issue and a verdict was found for him. On the plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>the plaintiff replied that there was such a record and made- profer\u00ed of what purported to be a record of the court in Jamaica. The decision, in which all the judges of the King\u2019s Bench concurred, was that debt would lie upon a foreign judgment because it was for a sum certain. The <em>dicta o\u00ed </em>Lord Mansfield in this case seem to have been substantially the basis for the notion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>afterwards prevailed, that a foreign judgment was <em>only prima facie </em>evidence of a debt, even to the extent of authorizing in all cases a retrial of the merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-4\">The case of <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1782), Willes, 36, note, also turns upon a question of pleading. It contains a dictum by Lord Mansfield that the judgment of a court not of record in \u201cEngland, \u2018like a-foreign judgment,\u2019 is not conclusive evidence of the debt.\u201d But neither in the case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. Fraser, or <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>or <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Cook </em>was the question involved of.what effect is to be given to a judgment of a foreign court or of an inferior court of England, having jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Galbraith </em>v. <em>Neville </em>(1789), 1 Doug. 6, note, Lord Kenyon reviews and dissents from- the conclusions of Lord Mansfield as reported in the case of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter. </em>He says: \u201c I cannot help entertaining, serious doubts concerning the doctrine laid down in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter </em>that foreign judgments are not binding upon the parties here.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-6\">It is true that. Mr. Justice Buller dissents from these views and insists that the result of the authorities, is, that a foreign judgment has no more credit than is given to every species of written agreement: that is, that' it should be considered as good till it is impeached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">In a note on this case, 5 East, 475, it is said that the case stood over from the Easter Term, 29th, to Mich. Term, 31st George III., for the court to advise upon it, when Lord Kenyon said that the court had considered the matter and were of opinion that no new.trial ought to be granted. He added that. without entering into the question how far a foreign judgment was impeachable it was at all events clear that it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and they were of opinion that no evidence had been, adduced to impeach this, and therefore discharged the rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq1m\">In <em>Messin </em>v. <em>Massareene </em>(1791), 4 T. R. 493, the plaintiff having obtained a judgment against the defendant in the Ch\u00e1telet of Paris, brought an action of <em>assumpsit </em>in England on that judgment, in which the defendant suffered judgment to go by default. A motion to refer it to the Master to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>pute the amount due and for final judgment without executing a writ of enquiry was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">In <em>Bayley </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1793), 3 Swanston, 703, before the Privy Council, the point being whether a suit pending in Jamaica could be pleaded in abatement of a suit in England, Lord Camden said: \u201cAs to the inconvenience, considering the difficulties of administering justice between parties occasionally living under the separate jurisdiction, I think the parties ought to be amenable to every court possible, . . . and we must then\u2019endeavor to correct the mischiefs of these double suits as much as we can, by allowing in each country the benefit of all the other proceedings in the other part of the King\u2019s dominions.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1795), <em>2 </em>H. Bl. 402, the question before the court being to whom money collected under a judgment recovered in Pennsylvania belonged, and not at all involving the question of the effect of the judgment as binding upon the parties or otherwise, Chief Justice Eyre said: \u201c It is in one way only that the sentence or judgment of the court of a foreign state is examinable in our courts, and that is when the party who claims the benefit of it applies to our courts to enforce it. When it is thus voluntarily submitted to our jurisdiction, we treat it not as obligatory to the extent to which it would be obligatory, perhaps, in the country in which it was pronounced, nor as obligatory, to the extent to which, by our law, sentences and judgments are obligatory, not as conclusive, but as matter m <em>pais, </em>as consideration <em>prima faeie </em>sufficient to raise a promise. We examine it as we do all other considerations or promises, and for that purpose we receive evidence of what the law of the foreign state is, and whether -the judgment is warranted by that law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-8\">In <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Rucker </em>(1807), 1 Campbell, 63, which was <em>assumpsit </em>on a judgment of a court in the island of Tobago, where the objection was that the judgment was obtained by default, the defendant never having been resident in the island, and the only service of the declaration made by the nailing a copy of the same on the court-house door in accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>anee with the alleged law of the island, Lord Ellenborough, in answer to the suggestion that the presumption was in favor of a foreign judgment as well as of a' judgment obtained in one of the courts of England, said: \u201c That may be so if the judgment appears on the face of it consistent with reason and justice; but it is contrary to the-first principles of reason and justice that either in civil or criminal proceedings a man should be condemned before he is heard.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">In the same case on a motion for a new trial, 9 East, 192, an affidavit having been produced showing a law of the colony that in case of a defendant absent from the island, the declaration could be so served, Lord Ellenborough said: \u201c There is no foundation for this motion, even upon the terms of the law disclosed in the affidavit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AylW\">In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Odber </em>(1809), 11 East, 118, the plaintiff sued upon a balance due upon a foreign judgment and also upon the original cause of action in <em>assumpsit. </em>The judgment was the judgment of the province of Lower Canada. The court in directing the judgment ordered a stay of proceedings by execution for six months, in order to enable the defendant to prove-a counterclaim, if he had any. The six months had elapsed before the commencement of this action, and no proceedings had been taken by the defendant for the proof of his counterclaim in the foreign court.

The case was covenant on a bond by the defendant and one D. B., conditioned to indemnify the plaintiff against the debt of the copartnership which had existed between the three. The breach alleged was that certain creditors of the firm had recovered judgment against the defendants in the island .of Grenada for their claim, which plaintiff had been obliged to satisfy on execution in Grenada. On the trial the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>proposed to show that the proceedings in the court of Grenada were erroneous, inasmuch as the account was incorrectly stated. His Lordship, however, ruled that the defendant' could not go into that question, inasmuch as the foreign court being a court of competent jurisdiction, what was done in it must, for the purpose of this action, be taken to be rightly done and the plaintiff had a verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">A motion for a new trial, made on the ground that the proceedings in the foreign court were not\u2019 conclusive evidence, that it was <em>grima facie </em>only, and the defendant might impeach the justice of it, was denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">In <em>Cavan </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1816), 1 Starkie, 525, the judgment of a Jamaica court, whereby the balance due from the defendant to the plaintiffs had been attached and sequestered at the suit of a creditor, was offered in evidence as a bar.

The bill was filed, representing in effect that an action had been brought by the defendant in Antigua, and that a judgment had been recovered, and that afterwards an action was commenced in the Common Pleas in England upon that judgment against the plaintiff in this suit in equity, and the object of the bill was to obtain a discovery and a commission to examine witnesses in Antigua.

The trial was before Lord Tenterden, O. J. The record showed that the action was between the plaintiff and one McCarthy, defendant\u2019s testator, at present residing at the Cape of Good Hope, cited at the domicil of the substitute of the King\u2019s Attorney General in the tribunals and courts of this colony, defendant, and the Paymaster General of Her Majesty\u2019s forces also defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-5\">It also appeared by the minute of the court that the defendants in the suit had been cited to answer touching a fire which was alleged to have broken out in the paymaster\u2019s office and consumed a house and other property of the plaintiff, and damages were claimed in accordance with the law of the colony. Defendant\u2019s testator having made default, a second citation issued and the defendant did not appear. The tribunal then went on and determined the case in favor of the plaintiff. It was objected that the judgment was invalid by the law of the colony itself, there being no allegation of negligence. Also that it appeared by the judgment that McCarthy was absent from the colony at the time of the proceedings against him, and it was claimed that it was contrary to justice that a man should be condemned unheard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-6\">Lord Tenterden, C. J., said, that the island belonged to England, but the French law prevailed there. To' the point that negligence was essential by that law, he said: \u201c The law of France being the law of the colony, the French court was much more competent to decide questions arising upon that law'than we can be. We ought to see very plainly that that court has decided against the French law before we say that their judgment is erroneous upon such ground. . . . Another objection, and not an unimportant one, was that the testator, when the proceedings were instituted against him, was absent from the island, and it was urged that it was contrary to the principles of natural justice that any one should be condemned unheard and in his absence. Proof, however, was given that by law of the colony, in the case of a person formerly resident in the island absenting himself and not leaving any attorney upon whom process in the suit might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>served, the procurator general or his deputy was bound to take care of the interests of such absent party.. . ...

The plaintiff thereupon brought this bill in England against the next of kin for an accounting concerning not only the same matters that had been passed upon in the colonial court, but other matters which might have been litigated in that suit, and alleged irregularities and errors in the proceedings in that court, and asked that the next of kin be restrained by injunction from proceeding with their action. The defendants demurred to the bill for want of equity. Vice-Chancellor Wigram held that the suit in Newfoundland was between the same parties as those in the present suit; that most of the matters concerning which an accounting was prayed for had been passed upon in that suit, and as to the remainder they were such as might have been litigated in. it, and were therefore <em>res judicata </em>also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\"><em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1843), 6 Q.

One of the points raised on the appeal was whether a foreign decree in equity could be enforced, the objection being that a decree for payment of money by a court of equity is not a declaration that the plaintiff has any legal right to the money, but-only that upon certain views peculiar to the court the payment ought to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The Court, per Lord Denman, C.

He claimed that the circumstances under which the judgment was obtained were contrary to natural justice. But it appeared that the defendant was a shareholder in a certain company in France; that by the law of France it was necessary for the defendant to elect a domicil in France if he resided abroad, at which the directors of the company might notify him of all proceedings relative to the company or him self as a shareholder; that by the law of France all legal proceedings affecting any party having his real domicil out of the kingdom, left for him at such elected domicil, were as valid as if left at his real domicil; that the defendant made election of domicil at Paris, and gave notice thereof to the plaintiff; and the plaintiff caused the summons to be left at the elected domicil in Paris. .

Neither do the courts of this country sit to rehear causes which have been tried abroad.

To avoid confusion in indicating the parties, it will be convenient first to take the case at law of <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>Guyot.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">International law, in its widest and most comprehensive sense \u2014 including not only questions of right between nations, governed by what has been appropriately called the law of nations; but also questions, arising. under what is usually called private international law, or the conflict of laws, and concerning the rights of persons within the territory' and dominion of one nation, by reason of acts, private or public, done within the dominions of another nation \u2014 is part of our law, and must b\u00e9 ascertained and administered by the cpurts of justice, as often as such questions are presented in litigation between man and man, duly submitted to their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The most certain guide, no doubt, for the decision of such questions is a treaty or.a statute of this country. But when, as is the case here, there is no written law upon the subject, the duty still rests upon the judicial tribunals of ascertaining and declaring what the law is, whenever it becomes necessary to do so, in order to determine the rights of parties to suits regularly brought before them. In doing this, the courts must obtain such aid ag they can from judicial decisions, from the works of jurists and commentators, and from the acts and usages of civilized nations. <em>Fremont </em>v. <em>United States, 17 </em>How. 542, 557; <em>The Scotia, </em>14 Wall. 170, <em>188; Respublica </em>v. <em>De Longchamps, </em>1 Dall. 111, 116; <em>Moultrie </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>23 N. Y. 394, 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">No law has any effect, of its own force, beyond the limits of the sovereignty from which its authority is derived. The extent to which the law of * one nation, as put in force within its territory, whether by executive order, by legislative act, or by judicial decree, shall be allowed to operate within the dominion of another nation, depends upon what our greatest jurists have been content to call \u201cthe comity of nations.\u201d Although the phrase has. been often criticised, no satisfactory substitute has been suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u201c Comity,\u201d in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>obligation, on the one. hand, now of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is ijhe recognition which one nation' allows within its territory <em>t\u00edo </em>the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation/having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, treating of the question in what department of the government of any State, in the absence of any clear declaration of the sovereign will, resides the authority to determine how far the laws of a foreign State shall have effect, and observing that this differs in different States, according to the organization of the departments of the government of each, says: \u201cIn England and America, the courts of justice have hitherto exercised the same authority in the most ample manner: and the legislatures have in no instance (it is believed) in either country interfered to provide any positive regulations. The common law of both countries has been expanded to meet the exigencies of the times as they have arisen; and so far as the practic\u00f3 of nations, or <em>the Jus gentium privatum, </em>has been supposed to furnish any general principle, it has been followed out.\u201d Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Afterwards, speaking of the difficulty of applying the positive rules laid down by the Continental jurists, he says that \u201cthere is indeed great truth\u201d in these remarks of Mr. Justice Porter, speaking for the Supreme Court of Louisiana: \u201c They have attempted to go too far, to define and fix that which cannot, in the nature of things, be defined and fixed. They seem to have forgotten that they wrote on a question which touched the comity of nations, and that that comity is, and ever must be, <em>uncertain; </em>that it must necessarily depend on a variety of circumstances which cannot be reduced to any certain rule; that no nation will suffer the laws of another to interfere with her own to the injury of her citizens; that whether they do or not must depend oh the condition of the country in which the foreign law is sought to be enforced, the particular nature of her legislation, her policy, and the char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>acter of her institutions; that in the conflict of laws it must often' be a matter of doubt which should prevail; and that, whenever a doubt does exist, the court, which decides, will prefer the laws of its own country to that of the stranger.\u201d Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 28; <em>Saul </em>v. <em>His </em>Creditors, (1827) 5 Martin (N. S.) 569, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Again: Mr. Justice Story says: \u201c It has been thought by some jurists that the term <em>comity </em>is not sufficiently expressive of the obligation of nations to give effect to foreign laws when they are not prejudicial to their own rights and interests. And it has been suggested that the doctrine rests on a deeper foundation ; that it is not so much~a matter of comity or courtesy, as a matter of paramount moral duty. Now, assuming that such a moral duty does exist, it is clearly one of imperfect obligation, like that of beneficence, humanity and charity. Every nation must be the final judge for itself, not only of the nature and extent of the duty, but of the occasions on which its exercise may be justly demanded.\u201d And', after further discussion of the matter, he concludes : \u201c There is then not only no impropriety in the use of the phrase comity of nations,\u2019 but it is the most appropriate phrase to express the true foundation and extent of the obligation of the laws of one nation within the territories of another.\u201d Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 33-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Chief Justice Taney, likewise, speaking for this court while Mr. Justice Story was a' member of it, and largely adopting his words, said : It is needless to enumerate here the instances in which, by the general practice of civilized countries, the laws of the one will, by the comity of nations, be recognized and executed in another, wThere the rights of individuals are concerned.\u201d \u201cThe comity thus extended to other nations is no impeachment of sovereignty. It is the voluntary act of the nation by which it is offered, and is inadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial to its interests. But it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals, and to' produce a friendly intercourse between the sovereign-ties to which they belong, that courts of justice have continually acted upon it, as a part of the voluntary law of nations.\u201d \u201c It is not the comity of the courts, but the comity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of the nation, which is administered and ascertained in the same way, and guided by the same reasoning, by which all bther principles of municipal law are ascertained and guided.\u201d <em>Bank of Augusta </em>v. Earle, (1839) 13 Pet. 519, 589; Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"AAF\">Mr. Wheaton says: \u201c All the effect, which foreign laws can havfe in the territory of a State, depends absolutely on the \u00e9xpress or tacit consent of that State.\u201d \u201cThe express consent of a State, to the application' of foreign laws within its territory, is given by acts passed by its legislative authority, or by treaties concluded with other States. Its tacit consent is manifested by the decisions of its judicial and administrative authorities, as well as by- the writings of its publicists. There is no obligation, recognized by legislators, public authorities, and publicists, to regard foreign laws; but their application is admitted, only from considerations of utility and the mutual convenience of States \u2014 <em>ex comitate, ob reciprocam utiHtatem.\u201d </em>Wheaton\u2019s International Law, (8th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 78, 79. \u201c No sovereign is bound, unless by special compact, to execute within his dominions a judgment rendered by the tribunals of another State; and if execution be sought by suit upon the judgment, or otherwise, the tribunal in which the suit is brought, or from which execution is sought, is, on principle, at liberty to examine into the merits of such judgment, and to give effect to it or not, as may be found just and equitable. The general comity, utility and convenience of nations have, however, established a usage among most civilized States, by which the final judgments of foreign courts of competent jurisdiction are reciprocally carried into execution, under certain regulations and restrictions, which differ in different countries.\u2019-\u2019 \u00a7 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Chancellor Kent says: \u201c The effect to be given to foreign judgments is altogether a matter of comity, in cases where it is not regulated by treaty.\u201d 2 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In order to appreciate the weight of the various authorities cited at the bar, it is important to distinguish.different kinds of judgments. ' Every foreign judgment, of whatever nature, in order to be entitled to any effect, must have' been rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>by a court having jurisdiction of the cause, and upon regular proceedings and due notice. In alluding to different kinds of judgments, therefore, such jurisdiction, proceedings and notice will be assumed. It will also be assumed that they are untainted.by fraud, the effect of which will be considered later.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">A judgment <em>in </em>rem, adjudicating the title to a ship or other movable property within the custody of the court, is treated as valid everywhere. .As said by Chief' Justice Marshall: \u201cThe sentence of a competent court, proceeding <em>in </em>rem, is \u25a0conclusive with respect to the thing itself, and operates as -an. absolute change of the property. By such sentence, the right of the former owner is lost, and a complete title given to the person who claims under the decree. No court of coordinate jurisdiction can examine the sentence. The question, therefore, respecting its conformity to general or municipal law can never arise, for no coordinate tribunal is capable of making the inquiry.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. Armroyd, 7 Cranch, 423, 432. The most common illustrations of this are decrees of courts of admiralty and prize, which proceed upon principles of international law. <em>Croudson </em>v. Leonard, 4 Cranch, 434; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Armroyd, </em>above cited; <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Dale, 1 </em>Johns. Cas. 16. But the same rule applies to judgments <em>in rem </em>under municipal law. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Guestier, </em>4 Cranch, 293; <em>Ennis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>14 How. 400, 430; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins.

Ch. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u2022 A judgment affecting the status of persons, such as a decree confirming or dissolving a marriage, is recognized as valid in every country; unless contrary to the policy of its own law. <em>Cottington\u2019s case, </em>2 Swanston, 326; <em>Roach </em>v. <em>Garvan, </em>1 Ves. Sen. 157; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Farnie, </em>8 App. Cas. 43; <em>Cheely </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>110 U. S. 701. It was of a foreign sentence of divorce, that Lord Chancellor Nottingham, in the House of Lords, in 1688, in <em>Gottington\u2019s case, </em>above cited, said : \u201c It is against the law of nations not to give credit to the judgments and sentences of foreign countries, till they be reversed by the law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and according to the form, of those countries wherein they were given. For what right hath one kingdom to reverse the judgment of another? And how can we refuse to let a sentence take place till it be reversed? And what confusion would follow in Christendom, if they should serve us so abroad, and give no credit to our sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Other judgments, not strictly <em>in rem, </em>under which a person has been compelled to pay money, are so far conclusive that the justice of the payment cannot be impeached in another country, so as to compel him to pay it again. For instance, a judgment in foreign attachment is conclusive, as between the parties, of the right to the property or money attached. Story on Conflict of Laws, (2d ed.) \u00a7 592 <em>a. </em>And if, on the dissolution of a partnership, one partner promises to indemnify the other against the debts of the partnership, a judgment for such a debt, under which the latter has been compelled to pay it, is conclusive evidence of the debt in a suit by him to recover the amount upon the promise of indemnity. It' was of such a judgment, and in such a suit, that Lord Nottingham said: \u201c Let the plaintiff receive back so much of the money brought into court as may be adequate to the sum paid on the sentence for custom, the justice whereof is not examinable here.\u201d <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Canham, </em>(1689) 2 Swanston, 325; <em>S.

The acceptor, accordingly, having received advices that the drawer had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>before the acceptances, brought a suit at Leghorn against the last indorsees, to be discharged of his acceptances, paid the money into court and obtained a sentence there, by which the acceptances were vacated as against those indorsees anti all the indorsers and negotiators of the bills, and the money deposited was returned to him. Being afterwards sued at law in England by subsequent holders of the bills, he applied to-the Court of Chancery and obtained \u00e1 perpetual injunction. Lord Chancellor King, as reported'by Strange, \u201cwas clearly of opinion that this cause was to be determined according to the local laws of the place where the bill was negotiated; and the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the bill having been vacated and declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction, he thought that sentence was conclusive and bound the Court of Chancery here;\u201d as reported in Yiner, that \u201cthe court at Leghorn had jurisdiction of the thing, and of the persons; \u201d and, as reported by Mosely, that, though \u201c the last indorsees had the sole property of the bills, and were therefore made the only parties to the suit at Leghorn, yet the sentence made the acceptance void against the now defendants and all others.\u201d It is doubtful, at the least, whether-such a sentence was entitled to the effect given to it by Lord Chancellor King. See <em>Novelli </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>2 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. 757; <em>Castrique </em>v. <em>Imrie, </em>L. R. 4 H. L. 414, 435; 2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas.

Its right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>do so was recognized by the Court of King\u2019s Bench in 1607 in a case of <em>habeas corpus, </em>cited by the plaintiffs, and reported as follows: \u201c If a man of Frizeland sues an Englishman in Friz\u00e9land before the Governor there, and there recovers against him a certain sum ; upon which the Englishman, not having sufficient to satisfy it, comes into England, upon which the Governor sends his letters missive into England, <em>omnes magistratus infra regnum Anglice rogans, </em>to make execution of the said judgment. The Judge of the Admiralty may execute this judgment by imprisonment of the party, and he shall not be delivered by the common law ; for this is by the law of nations, that the justice of one nation should be aiding to the justice of another nation, and for one to execute the 'judgment of the other; and the law of England takes notice of this law, and the Judge of the Admiralty is the proper magistrate for this purpose; for he only hath the execution of the civil law within the realm. Pasch. 5 Jac. B. R., <em>Weir\u2019s case, </em>resolved upon an <em>habeas corpus, </em>and remanded.\u201d 1 Rol. Ab. 530, pl. 12; 6 Vin. Ab. 512, pl. 12. But the only question there raised or decided was of the power of the English Court of Admiralty, and not of the conclusiveness of the foreign sentence; and in later, times the mode of enforcing a foreign decree in admiralty is by a new libel. See <em>The City of Mecca, </em>5 P. D. 28, and 6 P. D. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">. The extraterritorial effect of judgments <em>in personam, </em>at -law or in equity, may differ, according to the parties to the cause. . A judgment of that kind between two citizens or residents of the country, .and thereby subject to the jurisdiction, in which it is rendered, may be held conclusive as between them everywhere. So, if a foreigner invokes the jurisdiction by bringing an action against a citizen, both may be held bound by a judgment in favor of either. And if a citizen sues a foreigner, and judgment is rendered in favor of the latter, both may be held equally bound. <em>Ricardo </em>v. <em>Garcias, </em>12 Cl. &amp; Fin. 368; <em>The Griefswald, </em>Swabey, 430, 435; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>8 C.

The plaintiff can maintain no action here, but an <em>indebitatus, assumpsit </em>or an <em>insimul computassent; </em>so that the statute of limitations\u2019 is pleadable in this case.\u201d 2 Vernon, 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Several opinions of Lord Hardwicke define and illustrate the effect of foreign judgments, when sued on or pleaded in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In <em>Otway </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>(1736) in the King\u2019s Bench, Lord Hardwicke treated it as worthy of consideration, \u201c what credit is to be given by one court to the courts of another nation, proceeding both by the same rules of law,\u201d and said, \u201c It is very desirable, in such case, that the judgment given in one kingdom should be considered as <em>res judicata </em>in another.\u201d. But it was held that debt would not lie in Ireland upon an English judgment, because \u201cIreland must be considered as a provincial kingdom, part of the dominions of the Crown of England, but. no part of the realm,\u201d and an action of debt on a judgment was local. 4 B. &amp; C. 414-416, note; <em>S.

Neville, (1789) 1 Doug. 6, note, Mr. Justice Buller said: \u201cI have often heard Lord Mansfield repeat what was said by Lord Hardwicke in the case alluded to from Wales; and the ground of his lordship\u2019s opinion was this: when you call for my assistance to carry into effect the. decision of some other tribunal, you shall not have it, if it appears that you are in the wrong; and it was on that account, that he said, he would examine into the propriety of the decree.\u201d The case before Lord Hardwicke, mentioned by Lord Mansfield, would appear (notwithstanding the doubt of its authenticity expressed by Lord Kenyon in <em>Galbraith </em>v. <em>Neville) </em>to have been a suit to recover a legacy, briefly reported, with references to Lord Hardwicke\u2019s note book, and to the original record, as <em>Morgan </em>v. Morgan, (1737-8) West. Ch. 181, 597; <em>S. C. </em>1 Atk. 53, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In <em>Gage </em>v. Bulkeley, (1744) briefly reported in.3 Atk. 215, cited by the plaintiffs, a plea of a foreign sentence in a commissary court in France was overruled by Lord Hardwicke, saying, \u201c It is the most proper case to stand for an answer, with liberty to except, that I ever met with.\u201d His reasons are fully stated in two other reports of the case. According 'to one of them, at the opening of the argument he said: \u201c Can a sentence or judgment pronounced by a foreign jurisdiction be pleaded in this kingdom to a demand for the same thing in any court of justice here? I always thought it could not, because every sentence, having its authority from the sovereign in whose dominions it is given, cannot bind the jurisdiction of foreign courts, who own not the same authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>and have a different sovereign, and are only bound by judicial sentence given under the same sovereign power by which they themselves act.\u201d \u201c But though a foreign sentence cannot be used by way of plea in the courts here, yet it may be taken advantage of in the way of evidence.\u201d \u201cYou cannot in this kingdom maintain debt upon judgment obtained for money in a foreign jurisdiction; but you may an assumpsit in nature of debt upon a simple contract, and give the judgment in evidence, and have a verdict. So that the distinction seems to be, where such foreign sentence is used as a plea to bind the courts here as a judgment, and when it is made use of in evidence as binding the justice of the case only.\u201d And after-wards, in giving his decision, he said: \u201c The first question is, Whether the subject-matter of the plea is good ? The second is, Whether it is well pleaded? The first question depends upon this, Whether the sentence or judgment of a foreign court can be used by way of plea in a court of justice in England ? And no authority, either at law or in equity, has been produced to shew that it may be pleaded : and therefore I shall be very cautious how I establish such a precedent.\u201d \u201c It is true, such sentence is an evidence, which may affect the right of this demand, when the cause comes to be heard; but if it is no plea in a court of law to bind their jurisdiction, I do not see why it should be so here.\u201d Ridgeway temp. Hardw. 263, 264, 270, 273. A similar report of his judgment is in 2 Ves. Sen. (Belt\u2019s Supplt.) 409, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Roach </em>v. Garvan, (1748) where an infant ward of the Court of Chancery had been married in France by her guardian to his son before a French court, and the son \u201c petitioned for a decree for cohabitation with his wife, and to have some money out of the bank,\u201d Lord Hardwicke said, as to the validity of the marriage: \u201c It has been argued to be valid from being established by the sentence of a court in France, having proper jurisdiction. And it is true, that if so, it is conclusive, whether in a foreign court or not, from the law of nations in such cases; otherwise the rights of mankind would be very precarious and uncertain. But the question is, whether this is a proper sentence, in a proper cause, and between proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>parties? Of which it is impossible to judge, without looking farther into the proceedings; this being rather the execution of the. sentence, than the sentence itself.\u201d And after observing upon the competency of the French tribunal, and pointing out that restitution of conjugal rights was within the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court, and not of the Court of Chancery, he added, \u201c Much less will I order any money out of the bank to be given him.\u201d 1 Ves. Sen. 157, 159. He thus clearly recognized the difference between admitting the effect of a foreign judgment as adjudicating the status of persons, and executing a foreign judgment by enforcing a claim for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">These decisions of Lord Hardwicke demonstrate that in his-opinion, whenever the question was of giving effect to a foreign judgment.for money, in a suit in.England between the parties, it did not have .the. weight of a domestic judgment, and could not be considered as a bar, or as conclusive, but only as evidence of the' samo weight as a simple contract, and the propriety and justice of the judgment might be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"AKg\">In <em>Sinclair </em>v. Fraser, (1771) the appellaht, having as' attorney in Jamaica made large advances for his constituent in Scotland, and having been superseded in.office, brought an action before the Supreme Court of Jamaica, and, after appearance, obtained judgment against him; and afterwards brought an action against him in Scotland upon that judgment. The Court of Session determinad that'the plaintiff was bound to prove before it the ground, nature and extent of the demand on which the judgment in Jamaica was obtained; and therefore gave judgment against him. But the House of Lords, (in which, as remarked by one reporter, Lord Mansfield was then the presiding spirit, acting in concert with, or for the Lord Chancellor, in disposing of the Scotch appeals,) \u201c ordered and declared that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Jamaica ought to be received as evidence <em>prima facie </em>of the debt; and that it lies upon the defendant to impeach the. justice thereof, or to show the same to have been irregularly obtained; \u201d and therefore reversed the judgment of the Court of Session. 2 Paton, ix, 253; <em>S.

Witten, (1773) a declaration in assumpsit, in an action in England upon a judgment recovered in the Mayor\u2019s Court of Calcutta in Bengal, without showing the cause of action there, was held good on demurrer. Lord Mansfield considered the case perfectly clear. Mr. Justice Aston, according to one report, said, <em>\u201c </em>The declaration is sufficient ; we are not to suppose it an unlawful debt; \u201d and, according to another report, \u201c They admitted the assumpsit by their demurrer. When an action comes properly before any court, it must be determined by the laws which govern the country in which the action accrued.\u201d And Mr. Justice Ashurst said: \u201cI have often known assumpsit brought on judgments in foreign courts; the judgment is a sufficient consideration to support the implied promise.\u201d Lofft, 154; <em>S. C. nom. Crawford </em>v. <em>Whittal, </em>1 Doug. 4, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Walker </em>v. Witter, (1778) an action .of debt was brought in England upon a judgment recovered in Jamaica. The defendant pleaded <em>nil deb\u00e9t, </em>and <em>nul tiel record. </em>Judgment was given for the plaintiff, Lord Mansfield saying: \u201c The plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>was improper. Though the plaintiffs had called the judgment a record, yet by the additional words in the declaration, it was clear they did not mean that sort of record to which implicit faith is given by the courts of .Westminster Hall. They had not misled the. court nor the defendant, for they spoke of it as a record of a court in Jamaica. The question was brought to a narrow point; for it was admitted on the park of the defend\u00e1nt, that <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>would have lain; and on the part of the plaintiffs, that the judgment Avas <em>only prima facie </em>evidence of the debt. That being so, the judgment Avas not a specialty, but the debt only a simple contract debt; for assumpsit will not lie on a specialty. The difficulty in the case had arisen from not fixing accurately Avhat a court of record is in the eye of the law. That description is confined properly to certain courts in England, and their judgments cannot be controverted. Foreign courts, and courts in England not of record, have not that privilege, nor the courts in Wales, etc.- But the doctrine in the case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>was unquestionable. Foreign judgments are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>a ground of action everywhere, but they are examinable.\u201d Justices Will'es, Ashurst and Buller concurred, the two latter saying that wherever <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>.will lie, debt will also lie. 1 Doug. 1, 5, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>(1782) again, in an action of debt upon \u00e1 judgment of an inferior English court, not a court of record, Lord Mansfield said that it was \u201c like a foreign judgment, and not conclusive evidence of the debt.\u201d Willes, 36, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Galbraith </em>v. <em>Neville, </em>(1789) upon a motion for a new trial after verdict for the plaintiff, in an action of debt on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, Lord Kenyon expressed <em>\u201c </em>very serious doubts concerning the doctrine laid down in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>that foreign judgments are not. binding on the parties.here.\u201d But Mr. Justice Buller said: \u201cThe doctrine which was laid down in <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser </em>has always been considered as the true line ever since; namely, that the foreign judgment shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and conclusive till it be impeached by the other party.\u201d \u201c As to actions of .this sort, see how far the court could go, if what was said in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter </em>were departed from. It was there held, that the foreign judgment was only to be taken to be right <em>prima facie ; </em>that is, we will allow the same force to a foreign judgment, that we do to those of our own courts' not of record. But, if the matter were carried farther, we should give them more credit; we should give them equal force with those of courts of record here. Novf a foreign judgment has never been considered as a record. It cannot be declared on as such, and a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>in such a case, is a mere 'nullity. How then can it have the same obligatory force? In short, the result is this ; that it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the justice of the demand in an action of assumpsit, having no more credit than is given to' every species of written agreement, <em>viz. </em>that it shall be considered as good till it is impeached.\u201d 1 Doug. 6, note.- And the court afterwards unanimously refused the new trial, because, \u201c without entering into the question how far a foreign judgment was impeachable, it was at all events clear that it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt; and they were of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that no evidence had been adduced to impeach this.\u201d 5 East, 475, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In <em>Messin </em>v. <em>Massareene, </em>(1791) the plaintiff, having obtained a judgment against the defendants in a French court, brought an action of assumpsit upon it in England, and, the defendants having suffered a default, moved for \u00e1 reference to a master, and for a final judgment on his report, without executing a writ of inquiry. The motion was denied, Lord Kenyon saying,This is an attempt to carry the rule farther than has yet been done, and as there is no instance of the kind I am not disposed to make a precedent for it; \u201d and Mr. Justice Buller saying, \u201c Though debt will lie here on a foreign judgment, the defendant may go into the consideration of it.\u201d 4 T. R. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Bayley </em>v. Edwards, (1792) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, upon appeal from Jamaica, held that a suit in equity pending in England was not a good plea in bar to a subsequent bill in Jamaica for the same matter ; and Lord Camden said: \u201c In <em>Gage </em>v. Bulkeley,\u201d (evidently referring to the full report in Eidgeway, above quoted, which had been cited by counsel,) \u201cLord Ilardwicke\u2019s reasons go a great way to show the true effect of foreign sentences in this country. And all the cases show that foreign sentences are not conclusive bars here, but only evidence of the demand.\u201d 3 Swanston, 703, 708, 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>(1795) the House of Lords, in accordance with the opinion of the majority of the judges consulted, and against that of Chief Justice Eyre, decided that a creditor of an English bankrupt, who had obtained payment of his debt by foreign attachment in Pennsylvania, was liable to an action for the money by the assignees in bankruptcy in England. But it was agreed, on all hands, that the judgment in Pennsylvania and payment under it were conclusive as between the garnishee and the plaintiff in that suit. And the distinction between the effect of a foreign judgment which vests title, and of one which only declares that a certain sum of,money is due, was clearly stated by Chief Justice Eyre, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201c This judgment against the garnishee in the court of Pennsylvania was recovered properly or improperly. If, notwithstanding the bankruptcy, the debt remained liable to an attachment according to the laws of that country, the judgment was proper; if, according to the laws of that country, the property in the debt was divested out of the bankrupt debtor, and vested in his assignees, the judgment was improper. But this was a question to be decided, in the cause instituted in Pennsylvania, by the courts of that country and not by us. We cannot examine their judgment, and if we could, we have not the means of doing it in this case. It is not stated upon this record, nor can we take notice, what the law of Pennsylvania is upon this subject. If we had the means, Ave could not examine a judgment of a court in a foreign State, brought before us in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201c It is in one way only, that the sentence or judgment of a court of a foreign state is examinable in our courts, and that is, Avhen.the party who claims the benefit of it applies to o\u00far courts to enforce it. When it is thus voluntarily submitted to our jurisdiction, we treat it, not as obligatory to the extent to which it would be obligatory, perhaps, in the country in which it was pronounced, \"nor as obligatory to the extent to which, by our law, sentences and judgments are obligatory, not as conclusive, but as matter <em>in pais, </em>as consideration <em>prima facie </em>sufficient to raise a promise. We examine it as we do all other considerations or promises, and for that purpose we receive evidence of what the law of the foreign State is, and whether the judgment is \u2022 Avarranted by that law.\u201d 2 H. Bl. 402, 409, 410. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>(1802) Lord Chancellor Eldon said : \u201cNatural law requires the court\u00e1 of this country to give credit to those of another for the inclination and power to do justice; -but not, if that presumption is proved to be ill founded in that transaction,'which is the subject of it; and if it appears in evidence, that persons suing under similar circumstances neither had met, nor could meet, with justice, that fact cannot be immaterial as an answer to the presumption.\u201d 6 Ves. 714, 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Under Lord Ellenborough, the distinction between a suit on a foreign judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, and a suit to recover money which the plaintiff had been compelled to pay under a judgment abroad, was clearly maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>Buchanan </em>v. Rucker, (1807) in assumpsit upon a judgment rendered in the island of Tobago, the defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and prevailed, because it appeared that he was not a resident of the island, and was neither personally .served with process nor came in to defend, and the'only notice was, according to the practice of the court, by nailing up a copy of the declaration at the court-house door. It was argued that \u201c the presumption was in favor of a foreign judgment, as well as of a judgment obtainedin one of the courts of this country.\u201d To which Lord Ellenborough. answered: \u201c That may be so, if the judgment appears, on the face of 'it, consistent with reason and justice ; but it is contrary to the first' principles of reason and justice, that, either in civil or criminal proceedings, a man should be condemned before he is heard.\u201d \u201cThere might be such glaring injustice on .the face of a foreign judgment, or it might have a vice rendering it so ludicrous, that, it could not raise an assumpsit, and, if submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of this country, could not be enforced.\u201d 1 Camp. 63, 66, 67. A motion for a new trial was denied. 9 East, 192. And see <em>Sadler </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>(1808) 1 Camp. 253, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Odber, </em>(1809) in assumpsit upon a judgment' obtained in Canada, with other counts on the original debt, Lord Ellenborough-and Justices Grose, Le Blanc and Bayle} agreed that a foreign judgment was not to be considered.' as having the same force as a domestic judgment, but only that of a simple contract between the parties, and did not merge the original cause of action, but was only evidence of the debt, and therefore assumpsit would lie, either upon the judgment, or upon the original cause of action. 11 East, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In <em>Tarleton </em>v. <em>Tarleton, </em>(1815) on the other hand, the action was brought upon a covenant of indemnity in an agreement \u2022for dissolution of a partnership, to recover a sum which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>plaintiff had been compelled to pay under a decision in a suit between- the parties in the island of Grenada. Such was the case, of which Lord Ellenborough, affirming his own ruling at the trial, said: \u201c I thought that I did not sit at <em>nisi prius to </em>try a writ of error in this case upon the proceedings in the court abroad. The defendant had notice of the proceedings, and should have appeared and made his defence. The plaintiff, by this neglect, has been obliged to pay the money in order to avoid a sequestration.\u201d The distinction was clearly brought out by Mr. -Justice Bayley, ,who said : <em>\u201c </em>As between the parties to the suit, the justice of it might be again litigated ; but as against a stranger it cannot.\u201d 4 M. <em>&amp; </em>S. 20, 22, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>(1825) Chief Justice Abbott (after-wards Lord Tenterden) and his associates, upon the authority of <em>Otway </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>above cited, held that, even since the Act of Union of 39 &amp; 40 Geo. Ill, c. 67, assumpsit would lie in England upon a judgment recovered in Ireland, because such a judgment could not be considered a specialty debt in England. 4 B. <em>&amp; C. </em>411; <em>S.

They demonstrate that by that law, as generally understood, and' as declared by Hardwicke, Mansfield, Buffer, Camden, Eyre and Ellenborough, and doubted by Kenyon only, a judgment recovered in a foreign country for a sum of money, when sued upon in. England, was only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the demand, and subject to be examined and impeached. The law of England, since it has become to us a foreign country, will be considered afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The law upon this subject, as understood in the United States, at the time of their separation from the mother country, was clearly set forth by Chief Justice Parsons, speaking for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in 1813, and by Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, published in 1833. Both those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>eminent jurists declared that by the law of England the general rule was that foreign judgments were only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the matter which they purported to decide; and that by the common law, before the American Revolution, all the courts of the several Colonies and States were deemed foreign to each other, and consequently judgments rendered by any one of them were considered as foreign judgments, and their merits reexaminable in another Colony, not only as to the jurisdiction of the court which pronounced them, but also as to the merits of the controversy, to the extent to which they were understood to be reexaminable in England. And they noted that, in order to remove that inconvenience, statutes had been passed in Massachusetts, and in some of the other Colonies, by which judgments rendered by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a neighboring Colony could not be impeached. <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>9 Mass. 462, 464, 465; Mass.

But it is to be remarked, that in such a case, the judgment is no more conclusive as to the right it establishes, than as to the fact it decides.\u201d 4 Cranch, 434, 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u25a0 In <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>(1813) in which it was established that, by virtue of the.

If it be a record, conclusive between the parties, it cannot be denied but by the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record; and when Congress gave the effect of a record to the judgment, it gave all the collateral consequences.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Were the construction contended for by the plaintiff in error to prevail, that judgments of the state courts ought to be considered <em>prima facie </em>evidence only, this clause in the Constitution would be utterly unimportant' and illusory.

Now it was most reasonable, on general principles of comity and justice, that, among States and their citizens united as ours are, judgments rendered in one should bind citizens of other States, where' defendants had been served with process, or voluntarily made defence. As these judgments, however, were only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and subject to be inquired into by plea, when sued on in another State, Congress saw proper, to remedy the evil, and to provide that such inquiry and double defence should not be allowed. To this extent, it is declared in the case of <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>Congress has gone in altering the old rule.\u201d 11 How. 165, 175, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In <em>Christmas </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>(1866) in which this court decided that, because of the Constitution and laws Of the United States, a judgment of a court of one State of the Union, when .sued upon in a court of another, could not be shown to have been procured by fraud, Mr. Justice Clifford, in delivering the opinion, after stating that, under the rules of the common law, a domestic judgment, rendered in a court of competent jurisdiction, could not be collaterally impeached or called in question, said: \u201c Common law rules placed foreign judgments upon a different footing, and those rules remain, as a general remark; unchanged to the present time. Under these rules, a foreign judgment was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the debt, and it was open to examination, not only to show that the court in which it was rendered had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, but also to show that the judgment was fraudulently obtained.\u201d 5 Wall. 290, 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>Bischoff </em>v. <em>Wethered, </em>(1869) in an action on an English judgment rendered without notice to the defendant, other, than. by service on him in this country, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Bradley, held that the proceeding in England \u201cwas wholly without jurisdiction of the person, and whatever validity it may have in England, by virtue of statute law, against property of the defendant there situate, it can have no validity here, even of <em>&amp; prima facie </em>character.\u201d 9 Wall. 812, 814;\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>In <em>Hanley </em>v.

S. 265, 292, it was said that judgments recovered in one State of the Union, when proved in the courts of another, differed from judgments recovered in a foreign country in no other respect than in not being reexaminable on their merits, nor impeachable for fraud in obtaining them, if rendered by a court having jurisdiction of .the cause and of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">But neither in those cases, nor in any other, has this court hitherto been called upon to determine how far foreign judgments may be reexamined upon their merits, or be impeached for fraud in obtaining them.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In. the courts of the several States, it was long recognized and assumed, as undoubted and indisputable, that by our law, as by the law of England, foreign judgments for debts were-not conclusive, but onl <em>y prima facie </em>evidence of the matter adjudged. Some of the cases are collected in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In the leading case of <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>above cited, Chief Justice Parsons said : \u201c A foreign judgment may be produced here by a party to it, either to justify himself by .the execution of that judgment in the country in which it was rendered, or to obtain the execution of it from our courts.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>If the foreign court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the cause, yet the courts here will not execute the judgment, without first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>allowing an inquiry into its merits. The judgment of a foreign court, therefore, is by our laws considered only as presumptive evidence of a debt, or <em>asprima facie </em>evidence of a sufficient consideration of a promise, where such .court had jurisdiction of the cause; and if an action of debt be sued on any such judgment, <em>nil debet </em>is the general issue; or, if it be made the consideration of a promise, the general issue is <em>non assumpsit </em>On these issues, the defendant may impeach the justice of the judgment, by evidence relative to that point. On these issues, the defendant may also, by proper evidence, prove that the judgment was rendered by a foreign court, which had no jurisdiction; and if his evidence be sufficient for this purpose, he has no occasion to impeach the justice of the judgment.\u201d 9 Mass. 463, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In a less known case, decided in 1815, but not published until 1879, the reasons for this view were forcibly stated by Chief Justice Jeremiah Smith, speaking for the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cThe respect which is due to judgments, sentences and decrees of courts in- a foreign State, by the law of nations, seems to be the same which is due to those of our own courts. Hence the decree of an admiralty court abroad is equally conclusive with decrees of our admiralty courts. Indeed, both courts proceed by the same rule, are governed by the same law \u2014 the maritime law of nations: Coll. Jurid. 100; which is the universal law of nations, except where treaties alter it.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u201c The same comity is not extended to judgments or decrees which may be founded on the municipal laws of the State in which they are pronounced, Independent States do not choose to adopt such decisions without examination. These laws and regulations may be unjust, partial to citizens, and against foreigners; they may operate injustice to our citizens, whom we are bound to protect; they may be, and the decisions of courts founded on them, just cause of complaint against the supreme power of the State where rendered. To adopt them is not merely saying that the courts, have decided correctly on the law, but it is approbating the law itself. Wherever, then, the court may have proceeded on municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>law, the rule is,, that the judgments are not conclusive evidence o\u00ed debt; but <em>prima facie </em>evidence only. The proceedings have not the conclusive quality which is annexed to the records or proceedings of our own courts, where we approve both of the rule and of the judges who interpret and apply it. A foreign judgment may be impeached; defendant may show that it is unjust, or that it was irregularly or unduly obtained. Doug. 5, note.\u201d <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>Smith (N. H.) 396, 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">From this review of the authorities, it clearly appears that, at the time of the separation of this country from England,, 'the general rule was fully established that foreign judgments <em>in personam </em>were <em>pri/ma facie </em>evidence only, and not conclusive of the merits of the controversy between the parties. But the extent and 'limits of the application of that rule do not appear to have been much discussed, or defined with any approach to exactness, in England or America, until the matter was taken up by Chancellor Kent and by Mr. Justice Story.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Taylor </em>v. Bryden, (1811) an action of assumpsit, brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, on a judgment obtained\" in the State of Maryland against the defendant as indorser of a bill of exchange, and which was treated as a foreign judgment, so far as concerned its effect in New \u2019 York, (the decision of this court to the contrary in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>7 Cranch, 481, not having yet been made,) Chief Justice Kent' said : \u201c The judgment in Maryland is presumptive evidence of a just demand; and it was incumbent upon the defendant, if he would obstruct the execution of the judgment here, to show, by positive proof, that it was irregularly or unduly obtained.\u201d \u201c To try over again, as of course, every matter of fact which had been duly decided by a competent tribunal, would be disregarding the comity which we justly owe to the courts of other States, and would be carrying the doctrine of reexamination to an oppressive extent. It would be. the same as granting a new trial in every case, and upon every question of fact. Suppose a recovery in another State, or in any foreign court, in an action for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tort, as for an assault and battery, false imprisonment, slander, etc., and the defendant was duly summoned and appeared, and made his defence, and the trial was conducted orderly and properly, according to the rules of a civilized- jurisprudence, is every such case to be tried again here on the merits ? I much- doubt whether the rule can ever go to this length. The general language of the books is that the defendant must impeach the judgment by showing affirmatively that it was unjust \u2022 by being irregularly or unfairly procured.\u201d But the case was decided upon the ground that the defendant had done no more than raise a doubt of the correctness of the judgment sued on. 8 Johns. 173, 177, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Chancellor Kent, afterwards, treating of the siame- subject' in the first edition of his Commentaries, (1827) put the right to impeach a foreign judgment somewhat more broadly, saying: \u201cNo sovereign is obliged to execute, within his domini\u00f3n, a sentence rendered out of it; and if execution be sought by a suit upon the judgment, or otherwise; he is at liberty, in his courts of justice) to examine into the merits of .such judgment [for the. effect to be given to foreign judgments is altogether\u2019 a matter of comity, in cases where it is not regulated by treaty]. In the former case, [of a suit to enforce a foreign judgment,] the rule is, that the foreign judgment is to be received, in the first instance, as <em>prima, facie </em>evidence of the debt; and it lies on the defendant to impeach the justice of it, or t\u00f3 show that it was irregularly and unduly obtained. This-was the principle declared and settled by the House of Lords, in 1771, in the case of <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>upon an appeal from the Court of Session in Scotland.\u201d In the second edition, (1832) he inserted the passages above printed in brackets ; and in a note to the fourth edition, (1840) after citing recent conflicting opinions in Great Britain, and referring to Mr. Justice Story\u2019s reasoning in his Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws,-\u00a7 607, in favor of the conclusivehess of foreign judgments, he added, \u201c and that is certainly the more convenient and the safest rule, and the most consistent with sound principle, except in cases in which the court which pronounced the judgment has not due jurisdiction of the case,- or of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>defendant, or the proceeding was in fraud, or founded in palpable mistake or irregularity, or bad by the law of the <em>rei judicatm; </em>and in all such cases the justice of the judgment ought to be impeached.\u201d 2 Kent Com. (1st ed.) 102; (later eds.) 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, first published in 1834, after reviewing many English authorities, said, \u201cThe present inclination of the English courts seems to be to sustain the conclusiveness of foreign judgments \u201d \u2014 to which, in the second edition in 1841, he added, \u201calthough certainly there yet remains no inconsiderable diversity of opinion among the learned judges of the different tribunals.\u201d \u00a7 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">He then proceeded to state his own view of the subject, on principle, saying: \u201c It is, indeed, very difficult to perceive what could be done, if a different doctrine were maintainable to the full extent of opening all the evidence and merits of the cause anew on a suit upon the foreign judgment. Some of the witnesses' may be since dead; some of the vouchers may be lost or destroyed. The merits, of the cause, as formerly before the court upon the whole evidence, may have been decidedly in favor of the judgment; upon a partial possession of the original evidence, they may now appear otherwise. Suppose a case purely sounding in damages, such as an action for an assault, for slander, for conversion of property, for a malicious prosecution, or for a criminal conversation; is the defendant to be at liberty to retry the whole merits, and to make out, if he can, a new case upon new evidence ? Or is the court to review the former decision, like a court of appeal, upon the old evidence ? In a case of covenant, or. of debt or of a breach of contract, are all the circumstances to be reexamined anew ? If they are, by what laws and rules of evidence and principles of justice is the validity of the original judgment to be tried? Is the court to open the judgment, and to proceed <em>ex mquo et bono f </em>Or is it to administer strict law, and stand to the doctrines of the local administration of justice ? Is it to act upon the rules of evidence acknowledged in its own jurisprudence, or upon those of the foreign jurisprudence ? These and many more questions might be put to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>show the intrinsic difficulties of the subject. Indeed, the rule that the judgment is to <em>he prima facie </em>evidence for the plaintiff would be a mere delusion, if- the defendant \u2022 might still question it by opening all or any of thp original merits on his side; for under such circumstances it would be equivalent to granting a new trial. It is easy to understand that the defendant may be at liberty to impeach the original justice of the judgment' by showing that the court had no jurisdiction, or that he never had any .notice of the suit; or that it was procured by fraud; or that upon its face it is founded in mistake ; or that it is irregular and bad by the local <em>lavr,fori rei judi- </em>. <em>catee. </em>To such an extent the doctrine is intelligible and practicable. \u25a0 Beyond this, the right to impugn the judgment is in legal effect the right to retry the merits of the original cause at large, and to put the defendant upon proving those merits.\u201d \u00a7 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">He then observed: \u201c The general. doctrine maintained in the American courts in relation to foreign judgments certainly is that they <em>are prima facie </em>evidence, but that they are impeachable. But how far and to what extent this doctrine is to be carried does not seem to be definitely settled. It has been declared that the jurisdiction of the court, and its power over the parties' and the things in controversy, may be inquired into; and that the judgment may be impeached for fraud. Beyond this no definite lines have as yet been drawn.\u201d \u00a7 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">After stating the effect of the Constitution of the United States, and referring to the opinions of some foreign jurists, and to the law of France, which allows the merits of \u2018foreign judgments to be examined, Mr. Justice Story concluded his treatment of the subject as follows: <em>\u201c </em>It is difficult to ascertain what the prevailing rule is in regard to foreign judgments in some of the other nations of continental Europe; whether they are deemed conclusive evidence, or only <em>prima facie </em>evidence. Holland seems at all times, upon the general principle of reciprocity, to have given great weight to foreign judgments, and in many cases, if not in all cases, to have given to them a weight equal to that given to domestic judgments, wherever the like rule of reciprocity with regard to Dutch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>judgments has been adopted by the foreign country whose judgment is brought under review. This is certainly a very reasonable rule, and may perhaps hereafter work itself firmly into the structure of international jurisprudence.\u201d \u00a7 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Neptune Ins. Co., </em>(1839) in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, Mr. Justice Story said: \u201cIf a civilized nation seeks to have the sentences of its own courts held of any validity elsewhere, they ought to have a just regard to the rights and usages of other civilized nations, and the principles of public and national law in the administration of justice.\u201d 3 Sumner, 600, 608, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>(1845) in an action of assumpsit upon a promissory note, brought in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maine, the defendant pleaded a former judgment in the Province of New Brunswick in his favor in an action there brought by the plaintiff; the plaintiff replied that the note was withdrawn from that suit, by consent of parties and leave of the court, before verdict and judgment; and the defendant demurred to the replication. Judge Ware, in overruling the demurrer, said': \u201cWhatever difference of opinion there may be as to the binding force of foreign judgments, all agree that they are not entitled to the same authority as the judgments of domestic courts of general jurisdiction. They are but evidence of what they purport to decide, and liable to be controlled by counter evidence, and do not, like domestic judgments, import absolute verity and remain incontrovertible and conclusive until reversed.\u201d And \u2022 he added that, if the question stood entirely clear from authority, he should be of opinion that the plaintiff could not be allowed to deny the validity of the proceedings of a court whose authority he had invoked. 2 Ware, 236, 239, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">. At a. subsequent trial of that case before a jury, (1846) 1 Woodb. &amp; Min. 172, the defendant proved the judgment in New Brunswick. The plaintiff then offered to prove the facts stated in his replication, and that any entry on the record of the judgment in New Brunswick concerning this note was therefore by mistake or inadvertence. This evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>excluded, and a verdict taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court. Mr. Justice Woodbury, in granting a new trial, delivered a thoughtful and discriminating opinion upon the effect of foreign judgments, from which the following passages are taken:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u201c They do, like domestic ones, operate conclusively, <em>exproprio vigore, </em>within the governments in which they are rendered, but not elsewhere. When offered and considered elsewhere, they are, <em>ex comitate, </em>treated with respect, according to the nature of the judgment, and the character of the tribunal which rendered it, and the reciprocal mode, if any, in which that government treats our judgments, and according to the party offering it, whether having sought or assented to it voluntarily or not, so as to give it in some degree the force of a contract, and hence to be respected elsewhere by analogy according to the <em>lex loci contractus. </em>With these views, I would go to the whole extent of the cases decided by Lord Mansfield and Buller; and where the foreign judgment is not <em>in rem, </em>as it is in admiralty? having the subject-matter before the court, and acting on that rather than the parties, I would consider it only <em>prima facie </em>evidence as between the parties to it.\u201d p. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cBy returning to that rule,-we are enabled to give parties, at times, most needed and most substantial relief, such as in judgments abroad against them without notice, or without a hearing On the merits, or by accident or mistake of facts, as here, or on rules of evidence and rules of law they never assented to, being foreigners and their contracts made elsewhere, but happening to be travelling through a foreign jurisdiction, and being compelled <em>in imvitum </em>to litigate there.\u201d p. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">\u201cNor would I permit the <em>prima facie </em>force of the foreign judgment to go far, if the court was one of a barbarous or semi-barbarous government, and acting on no established principles of civilized jurisprudence, and not resorted to willingly by both parties, or both not inhabitants and citizens of the country. Nor can much comity be asked for the judgments of another nation, which, like France, pays no respect to those of other countries \u2014 except, as before remarked, on the principle of the parties belonging there, or assenting to a trial there.\u201d p. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201c On the other hand, by considering a .judgment abroad as only <em>prima facie </em>valid, I would not allow the plaintiff abroad, who had sought it there, to avoid it, unless for accident or mistake, as here. Because, in other respects, having been sought there by him voluntarily, it does not lie in his mouth to complain 'of it. Nor would I in any case permit the whole merits of the judgment recovered abroad to be put in evidence as a matter of course; but <em>being prima faoie </em>correct, the party impugning it, and desiring a hearing of its merits, must .show first, specifically, some objection to the judgment\u2019s reaching the merits, and tending to prove they had not been acted on; or [as ?] by showing there was no jurisdiction in the court, or no notice, or some accident or mistake, or fraud, which prevented a full defence, and has entered into the judgment; or that the court either did not decide at all on the merits, or was a tribunal not acting in conformity to any set of legal principles, and was not willingly recognized by the party as suitable for adjudicating on the merits. After matters like these are proved, I can see no danger, but rather great safety in the administration of justice, in permitting, to every party before us, at least one fair opportunity to have the merits of his case fully considered, and bne fair adjudication upon them, before he is estopped forever.\u201d p. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>De Brimont </em>v. Penniman, (1873) in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, Judge Woodruff said : <em>\u201c </em>The principle on which' foreign judgments receive any recognition from our courts is one. of comity. It does not require, but rather forbids it; where such a recognition works a direct violation of the policy of our laws, and does violence to what we deem the rights of our citizens.\u201d And he declined- to maintain an action against a citizen of the United States (whose daughter had been married in France to a French citizen) upon a decree of a French court requiring the defendant, then resident in France and duly served with process there, to pay an annuity to his son-in-law. 10 Blatchford, 436, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Mr. Justice Story and- Chancellor Kent, as appears by the passages above quoted from their commenta\u00edies, .concurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the opinion that, in a suit upon a foreign judgment, the whole merits of the case could not, as matter of course, be reexamined anew; but that the defendant was at liberty to impeach the judgment, not only by showing that the court had no jurisdiction of the case, or of the defendant, but also by showing that it was procured by fraud, or was founded on clear mistake or irregularity, or was bad by the law of the place where it was rendered. Stoi\u2019y\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 607; 2 Kent Com. (6th ed.) 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The word \u201c mistake \u201d was evidently used by Story and Kent, in this connection, not in its wider meaning of error in judgment, whether upon the law or upon the facts; but in the stricter sense of misapprehension or oversight, and as equivalent to what, in <em>Burnham </em>v. Webster, before cited, Mr. Justice Woodbury spoke of as \u201csome objection to the judgment\u2019s reaching- the merits, and tending to prove that they had not been acted on; \u201d \u201c some accident or mistake,\u201d or \u201c that the court did not decide at all on the merits.\u201d 1 Woodb. <em>&amp; </em>Min. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The suggestion that a foreign judgment might be impeached for error in law of the country in which it was rendered is hardly consistent with the statement of Chief Justice Marshall, when, speaking of the disposition of this court to adopt the construction given to the laws of a State by its own courts, he said: \u201c This course is founded on the principle, supposed to be-universally recognized, that the judicial department of every government, where such department exists, is the appropriate organ for construing the legislative acts of that government. Thus, no court in the universe, which professed to be governed by principle, would, we presume, undertake to say, that the courts of Great Britain, or of France, or of any other nation, had misunderstood their own statutes, and therefore erect itself into a tribunal which should correct such misunderstanding. We receive the construction given by the courts of the nation as the true sense of the law, and feel ourselves no more at liberty to depart from that construction, than to depart from the words of the statute.\u201d <em>Elmendorf </em>v. Taylor, (1825) 10 Wheat. 152, 159, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In recent times, foreign judgments rendered within- the do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>minions of the English Crown, and under the law of England, after a. trial on the merits, and no want of jurisdiction, and no fraud or mistake, being shown or offered to be shown, have been treated as conclusive by the highest courts of New York, Maine and Illinois. <em>Lazier </em>v. <em>Wescott, </em>(1862) 26 N.

In two early cases in Ohio, it was said that foreign judgments were conclu-. sive, unless shown to have been obtained by fraud. <em>Silver Lake Bank </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>(1832) 5 Ohio, 545, 547; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>(1837) 8 Ohio, 108, 110.

In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jamison, </em>(1860) 15 La. Ann. 35, the decision was only that, by virtue of the statutes of Louisiana, a foreign judgment merged the original cause of action as against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The result of the modern decisions in England, after much diversity, not to say vacillation of opinion, does not greatly differ (so far as concerns the aspects in which the English courts have been called upon to consider the subject) from the conclusions of Chancellor Kent and of Justices Story and Woodbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">At one time, it Avas held that, in an action brought in England upon a judgment obtained by the plaintiff in a foreign country, the judgment must be assumed to be according to the law of that country, unless the contrary was clearly proved \u2014 manifestly implying that proof on that point was competent. <em>Becquet </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>(1831) 2 B. &amp; Ad. 951, 957; <em>Alivon </em>v. <em>Furnival, </em>(1834) 1 Cr., M. &amp; R. 277, 293; <em>S.

In <em>Bank of Australasia </em>v. <em>Nias, </em>(1851) in an action upon an Australian judgment, pleas that the original promises were not made, and that those promises, if made, were obtained by fraud, were held bad on demurrer. Lord Campbell, in delivering judgment, referred to Story on the Conflict of Laws, and adopted substantially his course of reasoning in \u00a7 607, above quoted, with regard to foreign judgments. But he distinctly put the decision upon the ground that the defendant might have appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and thus have procured a review of the colonial judgment. And he took<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>the precaution to say: \u201cHow far it would be permitted to a defendant to impeach the competency, or the integrity, of a foreign court from which there was no appeal, it is unnecessary here 'to inquire.\u201d 16 Q. B. 717, 734-737.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The English courts, however, have sinee treated that decision as establishing that a judgment of any competent foreign court could not, in an action upon it, be questioned, either because that court had mistaken its own law, or because it had come to an erroneous conclusion upon the facts. <em>De Cosse Brissac </em>v. <em>Rathbone, </em>(1861) 6 H. <em>&amp; </em>N. 301; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Pilking</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>ton, </em>(1862) 2 B. &amp; S. 11, 41, 42; <em>Vanquelin </em>v. <em>Bouard, </em>(1863) 15 C.

In <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Ralli, </em>(1876) a judgment <em>in rem, </em>rendered by a French court of competent jurisdiction, was held to be re\u00e9xaminable upon the merits, solely because it was admitted by the parties, in the special case upon which the cause was submitted to the English court, to be manifestly erroneous in regard to the law of France. 1 C.

In delivering judgment upon demurrer, he said: <em>\u201c </em>The State of Louisiana may deal as it pleases with foreign law; but if it asks courts of this country to respect its law, it must be on a footing of paying a like respect to ours. Any comity between the courts of two nations holding such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>opposite. doctrines as to the authority of the <em>lex loci </em>is impossible. While the courts of Louisiana refuse to recognize a title acquired here which is valid according to our law, and hand over to their own citizens property so acquired, they cannot at'the same time expect us to defer to a rule of their law which we are no more bound to respect than a; law that any title of foreigners should be disregarded in favor of citizens of Louisiana. The answer to such a demand must be, that a country which pays so little regard to our laws, as to set aside a paramount title acquired here, must not expect at our hands any greater regard for the competing title so acquired by the citizens of that country.\u201d 1 Johns. &amp; Hem. 28, 29. And upon motion for a decree, he elaborated the same view, beginning by saying, \u201cWhether this judgment does so err or not against the recognized principl\u00e9s of. what has been commonly called the comity of nations, by refusing to regard the law of the country where the title to the ship was acquired, is one of the points which I have to consider; \u201d and concluding that it was \u201c so contrary to law, and to what is required by the comity of nations,\u201d that he must disregard it. 1 Hem. &amp; Mil. 222-247. See also <em>Liverpool Co. </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>(1867) L. R. 4 Eq. 62, 68, and (1868) L. R. 3 Ch. 479, 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Pilkington, </em>(1862) Chief Justice Cockburn treated it as an open question whether a judgment recovered in New York for a debt could be impeached on the ground that the record showed that the foreign court ought to .have decided the case according to English law, and had either disregarded the comity of nations by refusing to apply the English law, or erred in its view of English law. 2B. &amp; S. 11, 42. In <em>Castrique </em>v. <em>Imrie, </em>(1870) the French judgment which was adjudged not to be impeachable for error in law, French or English, was, as the House of Lords construed it, a judgment <em>in rem, </em>und9r which the ship to which the plaintiff in England claimed title had been sold. L. R. 4 H. L. 414. In <em>Godard </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>(1870) shortly afterwards, in which the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held that a judgment <em>in personam, </em>of a French court could not be impeached because it had put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>a construction erroneous, according to English law; upon an English contract, the decision was put by Justices Blackburn and Mellor upon the ground that it did not appear that the foreign court had \u201cknowingly and perversely disregarded the \u2022rights given by the English law; \u201d and by Justice Hannen, solely upon the ground that the defendant did not appear to have brought the English law to the knowledge of the foreign court. L. R. 6 Q. B. 139, 149, 154. In <em>Messina </em>v. <em>Petrococchino, </em>(1872) Sir Robert Phillimore, delivering judgment, in the Privy Council, said\u201c A foreign judgment of a competent court may indeed be impeached, if it carries on the face of it a manifest error.\u201d L. R. 4 P. C. 144, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The result of the English decisions, therefore, would seem to be that a foreign judgment <em>in personam </em>may be impeached for a manifest and wilful disregard of the law of England.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Lord Abinger, Baron Parke and Baron Alderson were wont to say that the judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction for a sum certain created a duty or legal obligation to pay that sum; or, in Baron Parke\u2019s words, that the principle on which the judgments of foreign and colonial courts are supported and enforced was, \u201c that where a court of competent jurisdiction has adjudicated a certain sum to be due from one person to another, a legal obligation arises to pay that sum, on which an action of debt to enforce the judgment may be maintained.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Smyth, </em>(1842) 9 M. &amp; <em>W. </em>810, 818, 819; <em>Williams </em>v. Jones, (1845) 13 M. <em>&amp; W. </em>628, 633, 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">But this was said in explaining why, by the technical rules of pleading, an action of assumpsit, or of debt, would lie upon a foreign judgment; and had no reference to the question how far such a judgment was conclusive of the matter adjudged. At common law, an action of debt would lie on a debt appearing by a record, or by any other specialty, such as a contract under seal; and would also lie for a definite sum of monqy due by simple contract. Assumpsit would not li\u00e9 upon a record or other specialty; but would lie upon any other contract, whether expressed by the party, or implied by law. In an action upon a record, or upon- a contract under seal, a lawful consideration was- conclusively presumed to exist, and could not be denied-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>but in an action, whether in debt or in assumpsit, upon a simple contract, express or implied, the consideration was open to inquiry. A foreign judgment was not considered, like a judgment of a domestic court of record, as a record or specialty. The form of action, therefore, upon a foreign judgment was not in debt, grounded upon a record or a specialty; but was either in debt, as for a definite sum of money due by simple contract, or in assumpsit upon such a contract. A foreign judgment, being a security of no higher nature than the original cause of action, did not merge that cause of action. The plaintiff might sue, either on the judgment, or on the original cause of action ; and in either form of suit the foreign judgment was only evidence of a liability equivalent to a simple' contract, and was therefore liable to be controlled by such competent evidence as the nature of the case admitted.. See cases already cited, especially <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>1 Doug. 1; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 H.

Blackburn, indeed, in determining how far a foreign judgment could be impeached, either for error in law, ,or for want of jurisdiction, expressed the opinion that the effect of such a judgment did not depend upon wha,t he termed \u201c that which is loosely called \u2018 comity,\u2019 \u201d but upon the saying of Baron.Parke, above quoted ; and consequently \u201c that anything which negatives the existence of that legal obligation, or excuses the defendant from the performance of it, must form a good defence to the action.\u201d <em>Godard </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>(1870) L. R. 6 Q. B. 139, 148, 149; <em>Schibsby </em>v. <em>Westenholz, </em>(1870) L. R. 6 Q. B. 155, 159. And his example has been followed by some other English judges. Fry, J., in <em>Rousillon </em>v. <em>Rousillon, </em>(1880) 14 Ch. D. 351, 370; North, J., in <em>Nouvion </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>(1887) 35 Ch. D. 704, 714, 715; Cotton and Lindley, B. JJ., in <em>Nouvion </em>v. Freeman, (1887) 37 Ch. D. 244, 250, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>,But the theory that a foreign judgment imposes or creates a duty or obligation is a remnant of the ancient fiction, assumed by Blackstone, saying that \u201c upon showing the judgment once obtained, still in full force, arid yet unsatisfied, the law immediately implies that by the original contract of society the defendant hath contracted a debt, and is bound to pay it.\u201d 3 Bl. Com. 160. That fiction, which embraced judgments upon default, or for torts, cannot convert a transaction wanting the assent of parties into one which necessarily implies it. <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>109 U. S. 285, 288. While the theory in question may help to explain rules of pleading which originated while the fiction was believed in, it is hardly a sufficient guide at the present day in dealing with questions of international law, public or private, and of the comity of our own country, and of foreign nations. It might be safer to adopt the maxim, applied to foreign judgments by Chief Justice Weston, speaking for the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, <em>judicium redditv/r in </em>invitum, or, as given by Lord Coke, <em>in prmsumptione legis judieium redditur in invitum.

He could hardly have contemplated erecting a rule of local procedure into a canon of private internationl law, and a substitute for \u201c the comity of nations,\u201d on which, in an earlier case, he hail himself relied as the ground for enforcing in England a right created by a law of a foreign country. <em>Alivon </em>v. <em>Furnival, </em>1 Cr., M. <em>&amp; </em>R. 277, 296; <em>S.

B. D. 295, 300, 305. In <em>Hawhsford </em>v. <em>Giffard, </em>(1886) in the Privy Council, on appeal from the Eoyal Court of Jersey, Lord Herschell said: \u201cThis action is brought upon an English judgment, which, until a judgment was obtained in Jersey, was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that country no more than evidence of a debt.\u201d 12 App. Cas. 122, 126. In <em>Nouvion </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>in the House of Lords, (1889) Lord Herschell, while he referred to the reliance placed by counsel on the saying of Baron Parke, did not treat a foreign judgment as creating or imposing a new obligation, but only as declaring and establishing that a debt or obligation existed. His words were: \u201c The principle upon which I think our enforcement of foreign judgments must proceed is this: that in a court of competent jurisdiction, where according to its established procedure the whole merit's of the case were open, at all events, to the parties, however much they may have failed to take advantage of them, or may have waived any of their rights, a final adjudication has been given that a debt or obligation exists, which cannot thereafter in that court be 'disputed, and can only be questioned in an appeal to \u00e1 higher tribunal. In such a case it may well be said that, giving credit to the courts of another country, we are prepared to take the fact that such adjudication has been made as establishing the existence of the debt or obligation.\u201d And Lord Bram well. said: \u201cHow can it be said that there is a legal obligation on the part of a man to pay a debt, who has a right to say, \u2018 I owe none, and no judgment has established against me that I do?\u2019 I cannot see.\u201d The foreign judgment in that case was allowed no force, for want of finally establishing the existence-of a debt. 15 App. Cas. 1, 9, 10, 14</p>\n<p id=\"ABs\">In view of all the authorities upon the subject, and of the trend of judicial opinion in this country and in England, following the lead of Kent and Story, we are satisfied that, where there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction, conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between' the citizens of its own country and those, of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in procuring the judgment, or any other special reason the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the merits of the case should not, in an action brought in this country upon the judgment, be tried afresh, as ot\u00ed a new trial or an appeal, upon the mere assertion of the party that the judgment was erroneous in law or in fact. The defendants, therefore, cannot be permitted, upon that general ground, to contest the validity or the effect of the judgment sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">But they have sought to impeach that judgment upon several other grounds, which require separate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">It is objected that the appearance and litigation of the defendants in the French tribunals were not voluntary, but by legal compulsion, and therefore that the French courts never acquired such jurisdiction over the defendants, that they should be held bound by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Upon the question what should be considered such a voluntary appearance, as to amount to a submission to the. jurisdiction of a foreign court, there has been some difference of opinion in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u2022 In <em>General Steam Navigation Co. </em>v. Guillou, (1843) in an action at law to recover damages to the plaintiff\u2019s ship by a collision with the defendant\u2019s ship through the negligence of the master and crew of the latter, the defendant pleaded a judgment by which a French court, in a suit brought by him, and after the plaintiffs had been cited, had appeared, and had asserted fault on this defendant\u2019s part, had adjudged that it was the ship of these plaintiffs, and not that of this defendant, which was in fault. It was not shown or suggested that the ship of these plaintiffs was in the custody or possession of the French court. Yet Baron Parke, delivering a considered judgment of the Court of Exchequer, (Lord Abinger and Barons Alderson and Bolfe concurring,) expressed a decided opinion that the pleas were bad in substance, for these reasons: \u201c They do not state that the plaintiffs were French subjects, or resident, or even present in France when the suit began, so as to be bound by reason of allegiance, or domicil, or temporary presence, by a decision of a French court; and they did not select the tribunal and sue as plaintiffs; in any of which cases the determination might, have possibly bound them.

The defendants, although they were not citizens or residents of France, but were citizens and residents of the State of New York, and their principal place of business was in the city of New York, yet had a storehouse and an agent in Paris, and were accustomed to purchase large quantities of goods there, although they did not make sales in France. Under such circumstances, evidence that their sole object in appearing and carrying on the litigation in the French courts was to prevent property, in their storehouse at Paris, -belonging -to them, and within the jurisdiction, but not in the custody, of those courts, from being taken in satisfaction of any judgment that might be recovered against them, would not, according to our law, show that those courts did not acquire jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It is next objected that in those courts one of the plaintiffs was permitted to testify not under oath, and was not subjected to cross-examination by the opposite party, and that the defendants were, therefore, deprived of safeguards which are by our law considered essential to secure honesty and to detect fraud in a witness ; and also that documents and papers were admitted in evidence, with which the defendants had no con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>nection, and which would not be admissible under our own system of jurisprudence. But it having been shown by the plaintiffs, and hardly denied by the defendants, that the practice followed and the method of examining witnesses were according to the laws of France, we are'not prepared to hold that the fact that the procedure in these respects differed from that of our own courts is, of itself, a sufficient ground for impeaching the foreign judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">. It is also contended that a part of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is affected by one of the contracts between the parties having been made in violation of the revenue laws of the United States, requiring goods to be invoiced at their actual market value. Eev. Stat. \u00a7 2854. It may be assumed that, as the courts of a country will not enforce contracts made abroad in evasion or fraud of its own laws, so they will not enforce a foreign judgment upon such a contract. <em>Armstrong </em>v.

But as this point does not affect the whole claim in this case, it is sufficient, for present purposes, to say that there does not appear to have been any distinct offer.to prove that the invoice value of any of the goods sold by the plaintiffs to the defendants was agreed between them to be, or was, in fact, lower than the actual market value of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">It must, however, always be kept.in mind that it is the paramount duty of the court, before which any suit is brought, to see to it that the parties have had a fair and impartial trial, before a final decision is rendered against either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">When an actipn is brought in a court of this country, by a citizen of a foreign country against one of our own citizens, to recover a sum of money adjudged by a court of that country to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff, and the. foreign judgment appears to have been rendered by a competent court; having jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties, and upon due allegations and proofs, and opportunity to defend against\u2019 them,- and its-proceedings are according to the course of a civilized jurisprudence, and are stated in a clear and formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>record, the judgment is <em>prima facie </em>evidence, at least, of the truth of the matter adjudged; and it should be held conclusive upon the merits tried in the foreign court, unless some special ground is shown for impeaching the judgment, as by showing that it was affepted by fraud or prejudice, or that, by the principles of international law, and by the comity of our own country, it should not be given full credit and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">. -There is no doubt that both in this country, as appears by .the authorities already cited, and. in England, a foreign judgment may be impeached for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">-Shortly before the Declaration of Independence, the House of Lords, upon the trial of the Duchess of Kingston for bigamy, put to the judges the question whether \u2014 assuming a sentence of the ecclesiastical court against a marriage, in a suit for jactitation of marriage, to be conclusive evidence so as to prevent..the counsel for the Crown from proving the marriage upon an indictment for polygamy \u25a0\u2014 <em>\u201c </em>the counsel for the. Crown may be admitted to avoid the effect of such sentence, by proving the same to have been obtained by fraud or collusion.\u201d Chief Justice De Grey, delivering the opinion of the judges, which was adopted by the House of Lords, answering this question in the affirmative, said: \u201c But if it was a direct and decisive sentence upon the point, and, as it stands, .to be admitted as conclusive evidence upon .the court, and not to be impeached from within; yet, like all other acts of the highest judicial authority, it is impeachable from without; although it is not permitted to show that the court was mistaken, it may be shown that they were misled. Fraud is an intrinsic collateral act; which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of courts of justice. Lord Coke says, it avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical .or temporal.\u201d 20 Howell\u2019s State Trials, 537, 543, note; <em>S. C. </em>in 2 Smith\u2019s Lead.

And in one English case, where a ship had been sold under a foreign judgment, the like restriction upon impeaching that judgment for fraud was suggested ; but the decision was finally put upon the ground that the judicial sale passed the title to the ship. <em>Cammell </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>(1858-60) 3 H. &amp; N. 617, 646; 5 H. &amp; N. 728, 729, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">But it is now established in England, by well considered and strongly reasoned decisions of the Court of Appeal, that foreign judgments may be impeached, if procured by false and fraudulent representations and testimony of the plaintiff, even if the same question of fraud was presented to and decided by the foreign court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In <em>Abouloff </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>(1882) the plaintiff had recovered a judgment at Tiflis in Bussia, ordering the defendants to return certain goods or to pay their value. The defendants appealed to a higher Bussian court, which confirmed the judgment, and ordered the defendants to pay, besides the sum awarded below, an additional sum for costs and expenses. In an action in .the English High Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Justice upon those judgments, the defendants pleaded that they were obtained by the gross fraud of the plaintiff, in fraudulently representing to the Russian courts that the goods in question were not in her possession wh.en the suit was commenced, and when the judgment was given, and during the whole time the suit was pending; and. by fraudulently concealing from those courts the fact that those goods, as the fact was, and as she well knew, were in her actual .possession. A demurrer to this plea was overruled, and judgment entered for the defendants. And that judgment was affirmed in the Court of Appeal by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, Lord Justice Baggallay and Lord Justice Brett, all of whom delivered concurring opinions, the grounds of which sufficiently appear in the opinion delivered by Lord Justice Brett (since Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls), who said: \u201c With regard to an action brought upon a foreign judgment, the whole doctrine as to fraud is English, and is to be applied in an action purely English. I am prepared to hold, according to the judgment of the House of Lords adopting the proposition laid down by De Grey, C. J., that if the judgment upon which the action is brought was procured from the foreign court by the successful fraud of the party who is seeking to enforce it, the action in the English court will not lie. This proposition is absolute and without any limitation, and, as the Lord Chief Justice has pointed out, is founded on the doctrine that no party in an English court shall be able to take advantage of his own wrongful act, or, as it may be stated in other language, that no obligation can be enforced in. an English court of justice which has been procured by the fraud of the person relying upon it as an obligation.\u201d \u201c I will assume that in the suit, in the Russian courts the plaintiff\u2019s fraud was alleged by the defendants, and that they gave evidence in support of the charge. I will assume even that the defendants gave the very same evidence which they propose to adduce in this action ; nevertheless the defendants will not be debarred at the trial of this action from making the same charge of fraud and from adducing the same, evidence in support of it; and if the High Court of Justice is satisfied that the allegations of the defendants are true, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that the fraud, was committed, the defendants will be entitled to succeed in the present action. It has been contended that the same issue ought not to be tried in an English court which was tried in the Russian courts ; but I agree that the question whether the Russian courts' were deceived never could be an issue in the action tried before them.\u201d \u201c In the present case, we have had to consider the question fully; and, according to the best opinion which I can form, fraud committed by a party to a suit, for the purpose of deceiving a foreign court, is \u00e1 defence to an action in. this country, founded upon the judgment of that foreign court. It seems to me that if we were to accede to the argument for the plaintiff, the result would be that a plausible deceiver would succeed, whereas a deceiver who is not plausible would fail. I cannot think that plausible \u2022fraud ought to be upheld in any court of justice in England. I accept the whole doctrine, without any limitation, that whenever a foreign judgment has been obtained by the fraud of the party relying upon it, it cannot be maintained in the courts of this country; and further, that nothing ought tp persuade an English court to enforce a judgment against one party, which has been obtained by the fraud of the other party to the suit in the foreign court.\u201d 10 Q. B. D. 295, 305-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The same view was affirmed and acted on in the same court by Lords Justices Lindley and Bowen in <em>Vadala </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>(1890) 25 Q. B. D. 310, 317-320, and by Lord Esher and. Lord Justice Lopes in <em>Crozat </em>v. <em>Brogden, </em>(1894) 2 Q. B. 30, 34, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In the case at bar, the defendants offered to prove, in much detail, that the plaintiffs presented to the French court of first instance and to the arbitrator appointed by that court, and upon .whose report its judgment was largely based, false and fraudulent statements and accounts against the defendants, by which the arbitrator and the French' courts were, deceived and misled, and their judgments were based upon such false and fraudulent statements and accounts. This offer, if satisfactorily proved, would, according to the decisions of the English Court of Appeal in <em>Abouloff </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, Vadala </em>v. <em>Lawes, </em>and <em>Vrozat </em>v. <em>Brogden, </em>above cited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>be a sufficient ground for impeaching the foreign judgment, and examining into the merits of the original claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">But whether those decisions can be followed in regard to foreign judgments, consistently with our own decisions as to impeaching domestic judgments for fraud, it is unnecessary in this case to determine, because .there is a distinct and independent ground upon which we are satisfied that the comity of our nation does not require us to give conclusive effect to the judgments of the courts of France; and that ground is, the want of reciprocity, on the part of France, as to the effect to be given to the judgments of this and other foreign countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In France, the Boyal Ordinance of June 15, 1629, art. 121, provided as follows: \u201cJudgments rendered, contracts or obligations recognized, in foreign kingdoms and sovereignties, for any cause whatever, shall have no lien or execution in our kingdom. Thus the contracts shall stand for simple promises; and, notwithstanding the judgments, our subjects against whom.they have been rendered may contest\u25a0 their rights anew before our judges.\u201d Touillier, Droit Civil, lib. 3, tit. 3, c. 6, sect. 3, no. <em>11.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">By the .French Code of Civil Procedure, art. 546, \u201c Judgments rendered by foreign tribunals, and acts acknowledged before foreign officers, shall not be capable of execution in France, except in the manner and in the cases provided by articles 2*123 and 2128 of the Civil Code,\u201d which are as follows: By article 2123, \u201c A lien cannot . arise from judgments rendered in a foreign country, except so far as they have been declared executory by a French tribunal; without prejudice to provisions to the contrary which may exist in public laws, and treaties.\u201d By article 2128, \u201c Contracts entered into in a foreign country cannot give a lien upon property in France, if there are no provisions contrary to this principle in public laws or in treaties.\u201d Touillier, <em>ub. sup. </em>no. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The defendants, in their answer, cited the above provisions of the statutes of France, and alleged, and at the trial offered to prove, that', by the construction given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>these statutes by the judicial tribunals of France, when the. judgments of tribunals of foreign countries against the citizens of France are sued upon in.the\u2019 courts of France, the merits of the controversies upon which those judgments are based are examined anew, unless a treaty to the contrary effect exists between the Eepublic of France and the country in which such judgment is obtained, (which is not the case between the Eepublic of France and the- United States,) ^and that the tribunals of the Eepublic of France give no force and effect, within the jurisdiction of that country, to the judgments duly rendered by courts of competent jurisdiction of the United States against citizens of France after proper personal service of the process of those courts has been made thereon in this country. We are of opinion that this evidence should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In <em>Odwin </em>v.

As this is a matter of positive law and internal policy in each State, no opinion need be given; besides, it is a mere question of comity, and perhaps it might be neither politic nor prudent, in two such great States, to give indiscriminate effect to the judgment of each other\u2019s tribunals, however .the practice might be proper or convenient in federal States, or those under the same sovereign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">It was that statement, which appears to have called forth the observations of Mr. Justice Story, already cited: \u201cHolland seems at all times, upon the general principle of reciprocity, to have given great weight to foreign judgments, and in many cases, if not in all cases, to have given to them a weight equal to that given to domestic judgments, wherever the like rule of reciprocity with regard to Dutch judgments has been adopted by the foreign country whose judgment is brought under review.

Upon Parker\u2019s application to nullify the proceeding, the Royal Court of Paris, reversing the judgment of a lower court, set aside that order, assigning these reasons: \u201c Considering that judgments rendered by foreign courts have neither effect nor authority in France; that this rule is doubtless more particularly appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>cable in favor of Frenchmen, to whom the King and his officers owe a special protection; but that the principle is absolute, and may be invoked by all persons without distinction, being founded on the independence of States; that the Ordinance of 1629, in the beginning of its article 121, lays down the principle in its generality, when it says that judgments rendered in foreign kingdoms and sovereignties, for any cause whatever, shall have no execution in the Kingdom of France; and that the Civil Code, art. 2123, gives to this principle the same latitude; when it declares that a lien cannot result from judgments rendered in a foreign country, except so far as they have been declared executory by a French tribunal \u2014 which is not a matter of mere form, like the granting in past times of a <em>pareatis </em>from one- department to another for judgments rendered within the kingdom; but which assumes, on the part of the French tribunals, a cognizance of the cause, and a full examination of the justice of the judgment presented for execution, as reason demands, and this has always been practised in France, according to the testimony of our ancient authorities; that there may result from this an inconvenience, where the debtor, as is asserted to have happened in the present case, removes his property and his person to France, while keeping his domicil in his native country; that it is for the creditor to be watchful, but that no consideration can impair a principle on which rests the sovereignty of governments, and which, whatever be the case, must preserve its whole force.\u201d The court therefore adjudged that, before the tribunal of first instance, Holker should state the grounds of his action, to be contested by Parker, and to be determined by the court upon cognizance of the whole cause. That judgment was confirmed, upon deliberate consideration, by the Court of Cassation, for the reasons that the Ordinance of 1629 enacted, in absolute terms and without exception, that foreign judgments should not have execution in France; that it was-only by the Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure that the French tribunals had been authorized to declare them executory; that therefore the Ordinance of 1629 had no application; that the articles of the Codes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>referred to, did not authorize the courts to declare judgments, rendered in a foreign country, executory in France without examination; that such an authorization would be as contrary to the institution of the courts, as would be the award or the refusal of execution arbitrarily and at will; would impeach the right of sovereignty of the French government, and was not- in the intention of the legislature; and that the Codes made no distinction between different judgments rend\u00e9red in a foreign country, and permitted the judges .to declare them all executory ; and therefore those judgments, whether against a Frenchman or- against a foreigner, were subject td examination on the merits. <em>Holker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>Merlin, Questions de Droit, Jugement, \u00a7 14, no. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Thex Court of Cassation has ever since constantly affirmed the same view. Moreau, no. 106, note, citing many decisions; Clunet, 1882, p. 166. In Clunet, 1894, p. -913, note, it is said to be \u201csettled by judicial <em>decisions </em>\u2014 il est' <em>de jurisprudence </em>\u2014 that the French courts are bound', in the absence of special diplomatic treaties, to proceed to the revision on the whole merits \u2014 <em>aufond </em>\u2014 of foreign judgments, execution of which is demanded of them,\u201d citing, among other cases, a decision of the Court of Cassation on February 2, 1892, by which it was expressly held to result from the articles of the Codes, above cited, \u201c that judgments rendered, in favor of a foreigner against a Frenchman, by a foreign court, are subject, when execution of them is demanded in France, to the revision of the French tribunals, which have the right and the duty to examine them, both as to the form, and as to the merits.\u201d Sirey, 1892, 1, 201;</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In Belgium, the Code of Civil Procedure of 1876 provides that if a treaty bn the basis of reciprocity be in existence between Belgium and the country in which the foreign judgment has been given, the examination of the judgment in the Belgian courts shall .bear only upon the questions whether it \u201c contains nothing contrary to public order, to the principles of the Belgian public order;\u201d whether, by the law of the country in which it was rendered, it has the force of <em>res judicata; </em>whether the copy is duly authenticated; whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>defendant\u2019s rights have been duly respected; and whether the foreign court is not the only competent court, by reason of the nationality of the plaintiff. Where, as-is the case between Belgium and France, there is no such treaty, the Belgian Court of Cassation holds that the foreign judgment may be reexamined upon the merits. Constant, 111, 116; Moreau, no. 189; Clunet, 1887, p. 217; 1888, p. 837; Piggott, 139. And in a very recent case, the Civil Tribunal of Brussels held that, \u201c considering that the right of revision is an emanation of the right of sovereignty ;' that it proceeds from the imperium, and that, as such, it is within the domain of public law; that from that principle it manifestly follows that, if the legislature does not recognize executory force in foreign judgments where there exists no' treaty upon the basis of reciprocity, it cannot belong to the parties to substitute their will for that of the legislature, by arrogating to themselves the power of delegating to the foreign judge a portion of sovereignty.\u201d Clunet, 1891, pp. 164, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In Holland, the effect given to foreign judgments has always depended ..upon reciprocity, but whether by reason of Dutch ordinances only, or of general principles of jurisprudence, does not clearly appear. <em>Odwin </em>v.

In Sweden, the principle of reciprocity has prevailed from very ancient times; the courts give no effect to foreign judgments, unless upon that principle; and it is doubtful whether they will even then, unless reciprocity is secured by treaty with the country in which the judgment was rendered.

The Reichsgericht, or Imperial Court, in a case reported in full in Piggott, has held that an English judgment cannot be executed in Germany, because, the court said, the German courts, by the Code, when they execute foreign judgments at all, are \u201cbound to the unqualified recognition of the legal validity of the judgments of foreign courts,\u201d and \u201c it is, therefore, an essential requirement of reciprocity, that the law of the foreign State should recognize in an equal degree the legal validity of the judgments of German courts, which are to be enforced by its courts; and that an examination of their legality, both as regards the material justice of the decision as to matters of fact or law, and with respect to matters of procedure, should neither be required as a condition of their execution, by the court <em>ex officio, </em>nor be allowed by the admission of pleas which might lead to it.\u201d Piggott, 470, 471.

As to foreign judgments, there is no federal law? each canton having its own law upon the subject. But in the German cantons, and in some of the other cantons, foreign judgments are executed according to the rule of reciprocity only. Constant, 193-204; Piggott, 505-516; Clunet, 1887, p. 762; Westlake, <em>ub. sup. </em>The law upon this subject has been clearly stated by Brocher, President of the Court of Cassation of Geneva, and professor of law in the university there. In his Nouveau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Traite de Droit International Priv\u00e9, (1876) \u00a7 174, treating of the question whether <em>\u201c </em>it might not be convenient that States should execute, without reviewing their - merits, judgments' rendered on the- territory of each of them respectively,\u201d he says: \u201cIt would, certainly, be advantageous for the parties interested to avoid the delays, the conflicts, the differences of opinion, and the expenses, resulting from the necessity of obtaining a new judgment in each locality where they should seek execution. There might thence' arise, for each sovereignty, a juridical or moral obligation to lend a strong hand to foreign judgments. But would not such an advantage be counterbalanced, and often surpassed, by the dangers that might arise from that mode of proceeding? There is here, we believe, a question of reciprocal appreciation and confidence. One must, at the outset, inquire whether .the administration of the foreign judiciary, whose judgments it is sought to execute without verifying their merits,' presents sufficient guaranties. If the propriety of such an execution be admitted, there is' ground for making it the object of diplomatic treaties. That form alone can guarantee the realization of a proper reciprocity; it furnishes, moreover, to each State the means of acting upon the judicial organization and procedure of other States.\u201d In an article in the Journal, after a review of the Swiss decisions, he recognizes and asserts that \u201c it comes within the competency of each canton to do what seems to it proper in such matters.\u201d Clunet, 1879, pp. 88, 94. And in a later treatise, he says: \u201cWe cannot admit that the recognition of a State'as sovereign ought necessarily to have as \u00e1 consequence the obligation of respecting and executing the judicial decisions rendered by its tribunals; in strict right, the authority of such acts does not extend beyond the frontier. Each sovereignty possesses in particular,- and more or less in private, the territory subject to its power. No other can exercise there an act of its authority. This territorial independence finds itself, in principle, directly included in the very act by which one nation recognizes a foreign State as sovereign; but there cannot result therefrom a promise to adopt, and to cause to be executed upon the national territory, judgments rendered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the officials of the foreign State, whoever they may be. That would be an abdication of its own sovereignty; and would bind it in such sort as to make it an accomplice in acts often injurious, and in some cases even criminal. Such obligations suppose a reciprocal confidence; they are not undertaken, moreover, except upon certain conditions, and by means of a system of regulations intended to prevent or to lessen the dangers which might result from them.\u201d 3 Cours de Droit International Priv\u00e9, (1885) 126, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In Russia, by the Code of 1864, \u201c the judgments of foreign tribunals shall be rendered executory according to the rules established.by reciprocal treaties and conventions,\u201d and, where no rules have been established by such treaties, are to be \u201c put in execution in the Empire, only after authorization granted by the courts of the Empire; \u201d and, <em>\u201c </em>in deciding upon demands of this kind, the courts do not examine into the foundation of the dispute adjudged by the foreign tribunals, but decide only whether the judgment does not contain dispositions which are contrary to the public order, or which are not permitted by the laws of the Empire.\u201d Constant, 183-185. Yet a chamber of the Senate of St. Petersburg, sitting as a Court of Cassation, and the highest judicial tribunal of the Empire in civil matters, has declined to execute a French judgment, upon the grounds that, by the' settled law of Russia, \u201c it is a principle in the Russian Empire that only the decisions of the authorities to whom jurisdiction has been delegated by the sovereign power have legal value by themselves and of full right;\u201d and that \u201c in all questions of international law, reciprocity must be observed and maintained as a ftmdamental principle.\u201d <em>Adam </em>v. <em>Schipoff, </em>Clunet, 1884, pp. 45, 46, 134. And Professor Englemann, of the Russian University of Dorpat, in an able essay, explaining that and other Russian decisions, takes the following view of' them: \u201c The execution of a treaty is not -the only proof of reciprocity.\u201d \u201cIt is necessary to commit the ascertainment of the existence of reciprocity to the judicial tribunals, for the same reasons for which there is conferred upon them the right to settle all questions incident to the cause to be adjudged. The existence of reciprocity be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tween two States ought to be proved in the same manner as all the positive facts of the case.\u201d \u201c It is true that the principle of reciprocit}' is a principle, not of right, but of policy ; yet the basis of the principle of all regular and real policy is also the fundamental principle of right, and the point of departure of all legal order \u2014 the <em>suum cuique. </em>This last principle comprehends right, reciprocity, utility; and reciprocity is. the application of right to policy.\u201d \u201c Let this principle be applied wherever there is the least guaranty, or even a probability of reciprocity, and the cognizance of this question be committed to the judicial tribunals, and one will arrive at important results, which, on their side, will touch the desired end, international accord. But, for this, it is indispensable that the application of this principle should be entrusted to judicial tribunals, accustomed to decide affairs according to right, and not to administrative authorities, which look above all to utility, and are accustomed to be moved by political reasons, intentions, and even passions.\u201d Clunet, 1884, pp. 120-122. But it would seem that no foreign judgment will be executed in Russia, unless reciprocity is secured by treaty. Clunet, 1884, pp. 46, 113, 139, 140, 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In Poland, the provisions of the Russian Code are in force; atid the Court of Appeal of Warsaw has decided that, where there is no treaty, the judgments of a foreign country cannot be executed, because, \u201cin admitting a contrary conclusion, there would be impugned one of the cardinal principles of international relations, namely, the principle of reciprocity, according to which each State recognizes juridical rights and relations, originating or established in another country, only in the measure in which the latter, in its turn, does not disregard the rights and relations existing in the former.\u201d Clunet, 1884, pp. 494, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In Roumania, it is provided by code that \u201cjudicial decisions rendered in foreign countries cannot be ex\u00e9cuted in Roumania, except in the same manner in which Roumanian judgments are executed in the country in question,, and provided they are \u25a0 declared executory .by competent Roumanian judges; \u201d and this article seems to be held to require, legislative reciprocity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Moreau, no. 219; Clunet, 1879, p. 351; 1885, p. 537; 1891, p. 452; Piggott, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In Bulgaria, by a resolution of the Supreme Court, in 1881, \u201c the Bulgarian judges should, as a general rule, abstain from entering upon the merits of the foreign judgment; they ought only to inquire whether the judgment submitted to them does not contain dispositions contrary to the public order, and to the Bulgarian laws.\u201d Constant, 129, 130; Clunet, 1886, p. 570.

When nothing appears, either for or against, as to the authority of the. judgments of our courts in the foreign country, one should not put an obstacle to the fulfilment, in our country, of judgments emanating from other, nations, especially when the question is of a country which, by its historic origin, its language, its literature, and by almost the identity of its customs, its usages, and its social institutions, has so great a connection with our own \u2014 which obliges us to maintain with it the most intimate relations of friendship and courtesy.\u201d And he pointed out that Mexico, by its code, had adopted reciprocity as a fundamental prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ciple.

In the great majority of the countries on the continent of Europe \u2014 in Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, in many cantons of Switzerland, in Russia and Poland, in Roumania, in Austria and Hungary, (perhaps in Italy,) and in Spain \u2014 as well as in Egypt, in Mexico, and in a great part of South America, the judgment rendered in a foreign country is allowed the same effect only as the courts of that country allow to the judgments of the country in which the judgment in question is sought to be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The prediction of Mr. .Justice Story (in \u00a7 618 of his Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, already cited,) has thus been fulfilled, and the rule of reciprocity has worked itself firmly into the structure of international jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The reasonable, if not the necessary, conclusion appears to us to be that judgments rendered in France, or in any other foreign country, by the laws of which our own judgments are reviewable upon the merits, are not entitled to full credit and conclusive effect when sued upon in this country, but are <em>prima facie </em>evidence only of the justice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u25a0 In holding such a judgment, for want of reciprocity, not to be conclusive evidence of the merits of the claim, we do not proceed upon any. theory of retaliation upon one person by reason of injustice done to another <em>- </em>but upon the broad ground that international law is founded upon mutuality and reciprocity, and that by the principles of international law recognized in most civilized nations, and by the comity of our own country, which it is our judicial duty to know and to declare, the judgment is not entitled to be considered conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">By our law, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, a foreign judgment was considered as <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and not conclusive. There is no statute of the United States, and no treaty of the United States with France, or with any other nation, which has changed that law, or has made any provision upon the subject. It is not to be supposed that, if any statute or treaty had been or should be made, it would recognize as conclusive the judgments of any country, which did not give like effect to our own judgments. In the absence of statute or treaty, it appears to us equally unwarrantable to assume that the comity of the United States requires anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">If we should hold this judgment to be conclusive, we should allow it an effect to which, supposing the defendants\u2019 offers to be sustained by actual proof, it would, in the absence of a special treaty,- be entitled in hardly any other country in Christendom, except the country in which it was rendered. If the judgment had been rendered in this country, or in any other outside of the jurisdiction of France, the French courts would not have executed or enforced it, except after examining into its merits. The very judgment now sued on would be held inconclusive in almost any other country than France. In England, and in the Colonies subject to the law of England, the fraud alleged in its. procurement would be a sufficient ground for disregarding it. In the courts of nearly every other nation, it would be subject to reexamination, either merely because it was a foreign judgment, or because judgments of that nation would be reexam in able in the courts of France.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>For these reasons, in the action at law, the</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<em>Judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to set aside the verdict and to order a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">For the same reasons, in the suit in equity between these parties, the foreign judgment is not a bar, and, therefore, the</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Decree dismissing the bill is </em>reversed, <em>the plea adjudged bad, cmd the cause remanded to the Circuit Court for'further, proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b261-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brewer, and Mr. Justice Jackson, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Plaintiffs .brought their action on a judgment recovered by them against the defendants in the courts of France, which courts had jurisdiction over person and subject-matter, and in respect of which judgment no fraud was alleged, except in particulars contested in and considered by the French courts. The. question is whether under these circumstances, and in the absence of a treaty or act of Congress; the judgment is reSxaminable upon the merits. This question I regard as one to be.determined by the ordinary and settled rule in respect of allowing a party, who has had an opportunity to prove his case in a competent court, to retry it on the merits, and it seems to me that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>applicable to domestic judgments should be applied to foreign judgments as well, and rests on. the same general ground of public policy that there should be an end of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">This application of the doctrine is in accordance with 6ur. own jurisprudence, and it is not necessary that we should hold it to be required by some rule of international law. The fundamental principle concerning judgments is that disputes are finally determined by them, and lam unable to perceive why a judgment <em>in personam </em>which is not open to question on the ground of want of jurisdiction, either intrinsically or over the parties, or of fraud, or on any other recognized ground of impeachment, should not be held <em>inter partes, </em>though recovered abroad, conclusive on the merits,</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Judgments are executory while unpaid, but in this country execution is not given upon a foreign judgment as such, it being enforced through a new judgment obtained in an action brought for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The principle that requires litigation to be treated as terminated by final judgment properly rendered, is as applicable to a judgment proceeded oh in such an action, as to any other, and forbids the. allowance to the judgment debtor of a retrial of the original cause of action, as of right, in disregard of the obligation to pay arising on the judgment and of the rights acquired by the judgment creditor thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">That any other conclusion is inadmissible is forcibly illustrated by the case in hand. Plaintiffs in error were trading copartners in Paris as well as in New York, and had a place of business in Paris at the time of these transactions and of the commencement of the suit against them in Prance. The subjects of the suit were commercial transactions, having their origin, and partly performed, in Prance under a contract there made, and alleged to be modified by the dealings of the parties there; and one of the claims against them was for goods sold to them there. They appeared generally in the case, without protest, and by counterclaims relating to the same general course of business, a part of them only connected with the claims against them, became actors in the suit and submitted to the courts their own claims for affirmative relief, as well as the claims against them. The courts were competent and they took the chances of a decision in their favor. As traders in Prance they were under the protection of its laws and were bound by its laws, its commercial usages and its rules of procedure. The fact that they were Americans and the opposite parties were citizens of Prance is immaterial, and there is no suggestion on the record that those courts proceeded on any other ground than that all litigants, whatever their nationality, were entitled to equal justice therein. If plaintiffs in error had succeeded in their cross suit and recovered judgment against defendants in error, and had -sued them here on that judgment, defendants' in error would not have been permitted to say that the judgment in Prance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>not conclusive against them. As it was, defendants in error recovered, and I think plaintiffs in error are not entitled to try their fortune anew before the courts of this country on the same matters voluntarily submitted by them to the decision of the foreign tribunal. <em>We </em>are dealing with the judgment of a court of a civilized country, whose laws and system of justice recognize the general rules in respect to property and. rights between man and man prevailing among all civilized peoples. Obviously the last persons who should be heard to. complain are those who identified themselves with the business of that country, knowing that all their transactions there would be subject to the local laws and modes of doing business. The French courts appear to have acted \u201cjudicially, honestly, and with the intention to arrive at the right conclusion ; \u201d and a result thus reached ought not to .be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The following view of the rule in England was expressed, by Lord Herschell in <em>Nouvion </em>v. Freeman, L. R. 15 App. Cas. 1, 9, quoted in the principal opinion: \u201c The principle upon which I think our enforcement of foreign judgments must proceed is this: that in a court of competent jurisdiction, where according to its established procedure the whole merits of the case were open, at all events, to the parties, however much they may have failed to take\" advantage of them, or may have waived any of their rights, a final adjudication has been given that a debt or obligation exists which cannot thereafter in that court be disputed, and can only be questioned in an appeal to a higher tribunal. In such a case it may well be said that giving credit to the courts of another country we are prepared to take the fact that such adjudication has been made as establishing the existence of the debt or obligation.\u201d But in that connection the observations made by Mr. Justice Blackburn in <em>Godard </em>v. Gray, L. R. 6 Q. B. 139, 148, and often referred to with approval, may usefully again be quoted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201c It is not an admitted principle of the- law of nations that a state is bound to enforce within its territories the judgments of a foreign tribunal. Several of the continental nations (including France) do not enforce the judgments of other coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tries, unless where there are reciprocal- treaties to that effect. But in England and in those states which are governed by the common law, such judgments are enforced, not by virtue of any treaty, nor'by virtue of any statute, but upon a principle very well stated by Parke, B., in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>13 M. &amp; W. at p. 633 : \u2018 Where a court of competent jurisdiction had adjudicated a certain sum to be due from one person to another, a legal obligation arises to pay that sum, on which an action of debt to enforce the judgment may be maintained. It is in this way that the judgments of foreign and colonial courts are supported and enforced.\u2019 And taking this as the principle, it seems to follow that anything which negatives, the existence of that legal obligation, or excuses the defendant from the performance of it, must form -a good defence to the action. It must be open, therefore, to the defendant to show that the court which pronounced the judgment had not jurisdiction to pronounce it, either because they exceeded the jurisdiction \u2022given to them by the foreign law, or because he, the defendant, was not subject to that jurisdiction; and so far the foreign judgment must be examinable. Probably the defendant may shew that the judgment was obtained by the fraud of the' plaintiff, for that would shew that the defendant was excused from the performance of an obligation thus obtained; and it may be that where the foreign court has knowingly and perversely disregarded the rights given to an English subject by English law, that forms a valid excuse for disregarding the obligation thus imposed on him; but we prefer to imitate the caution of the present Lord Chancellor in <em>Castrique </em>v. <em>Imrie, </em>L. R. 4 H. L. at p. 445, and to leave those questions to be decided when they arise, only observing in the present case, as in that -\u2018 the whole of the facts appear to have been inquired into by the French courts; judicially, honestly, and with the intention to arrive at the right conclusion, and having heard ' the facts as stated before them, they came to a conclusion which justified' them in France in deciding as they did decide.\u2019 . -. . Indeed, it is difficult to understand how the common course of pleading is consistent with any notion that the judgment was only evidence. If that were so, every count on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>foreign judgment must be demurrable. on. that \u25a0 ground. The mode of pleading shews that the judgment was considered, not as <em>merely prima facie </em>evidence of that cause of action for which the judgment was given, but as in itself giving rise, at least <em>prima facie, </em>to a legal obligation to obey that judgment and pay the sum adjudged. This may seem a technical mode of dealing with the question; but in truth it goes to the root of the matter. For if the judgment were merely considered as evidence of the original cause of action, it must be open to meet it by any counter evidence negativing the existence of that original cause of action. If, on the other hand; there is a <em>prima facie </em>obligation to obey the judgment of a tribunal having jurisdiction over the party and the cause, and to pay the sum decreed, the question would be, whether it was open to the unsuccessful party to try the cause over again in a court, not sitting as a court of appeal from that which gave the judgment. It is quite clear that this could not be done where the action is brought, on the judgment of an English tribunal; and, on principle, it seems.the same rule should apply, where it is brought on that of a foreign tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In any aspect, it is difficult to see why rights acquired under foreign judgments do not belong to the category of private rights acquired under foreign laws. Now the rule is universal in this country that private rights acquired under the laws of foreign states will be respected and enforced in our courts unless contrary to the policy or prejudicial'to the interests of the state where this is sought to be done; and although the source of this rule may have been the comity characterizing the intercourse between nations, it prevails to-day'by its own strength, and the right to the application of the law to which the particular transaction is subject is a juridical right.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">And, without going into the refinements of the publicists on the subject, it appears to me that that law finds authoritative expression in the judgments of courts of competent jurisdiction over parties and subject-matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">It is held by the majority of the court that defendants cannot be permitted to contest the validity and effect \u00f3f this judgment on the general ground that it was erroneous in law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>or in fact; and the special grounds relied on are <em>seriaUm </em>rejected. In respect\u2019 of the last of these, that of fraud, it is said that it is unnecessary in this case to decide whether certain decisions cited in regard to impeaching foreign judgments for fraud could be followed consistently with our own decisions as to impeaching domestic judgments' for that reason, \u201c because th\u00e9re is a distinct and independent ground upon which we are satisfied that the comity of our nation does not require us to give conclusive effect to the judgments of the courts of France, and that ground is the want of reciprocity on the part of France as to the effect to be given to the judgments of this and other foreign countries.\u201d And the conclusion is announced to be \u201c that judgments rendered in France or in any other foreign country, by the laws of which our own judgments are reviewable upon the merits, are not entitled to full credit and conclusive effect when sued upon in this country, but \u00e1re <em>prima facie </em>evidence only of the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d In other words, that although no special ground exists for impeaching the original justice of a judgment, such as want of jurisdiction or fraud, the right to retry the merits of the original cause at large, defendant being put upon proving those .merits, should be accorded in every suit on judgments recovered in countries where our own judgments are not given full effect, on that ground merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">I cannot yield my assent to the proposition that because by legislation and judicial decision in France that effect is not there given to judgments recovered in this country which, according to our jurisprudence, we think should\" be.given to judgments wherever recovered, (subject, of course, to the recognized exceptions,) therefore we should pursue the same line of conduct'as respects the judgments of French tribunals. The application of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not rest in discretion ; and it is for the government, and not for its courts, to adopt the principle of retorsion, if deemed under any circumstances desirable or necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As the court expressly abstains from deciding whether the judgment is impeachable on the ground of fraud, I refrain from any observations on that branch of the case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Me.
