Congress neither intended nor legislated for such an outcome.

The narrow vote by a bare majority of our Court's active judges to decline\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      review might lead a reader to infer that these judges concur in the panel majority's holding and reasoning, despite all the arguments presented in the dissent. That\n     would be a big mistake. Because of our Circuit's so-called \"tradition\" of declining\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      review, the fact that six members of our Court voted to decline review does not mean that they were convinced that the panel majority is correct.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Ricci v.

Nor does it follow that these six judges deemed the matter unimportant or unexceptional.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Landell v.

Once the mandate issues in this case, the district court must commence its review of how New York \"determined the amounts it pays\" to those receiving foster care maintenance payments, and \"how it has quantified the costs of the specific expenses listed in Section 675(4),\"\n      <em>\n       Poole\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520963\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/69/\">\n       922 F.3d at 82\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , so as to decide whether to approve or reject the State's foster care rates (again, as applied to a subset of its foster care parents and providers). In its petition for rehearing, New York warns that such review will unjustifiably inject federal courts into the \"complex, judgment-laden process\" by which New York, like other States, determines when and how to cover costs for particular children in foster care.

Tradition shouldn't prevent this Court from reviewing an issue of such consequence.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-23\">\n      As set forth above, the panel majority made a mistake in interpreting this Spending Clause statute to impose a mandatory spending obligation on States, enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The full Court also errs in declining\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      review, but perhaps with less excuse. The panel majority simply made a mistake. To the extent that this\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      vote comes down to nothing more than an ostensible tradition, the full Court, with eyes open, has refused to afford New York State, the\n      <em>\n       amici\n      </em>\n      , and the foster care children within our jurisdiction the consideration they deserve.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the order denying rehearing en banc:\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-25\">\n      I respectfully join in Judge Livingston's opinion. The dissenters having failed to persuade a majority of the active judges to rehear this appeal, our concerns necessarily now rest in the hands of our highest court. I write separately, and in my name alone, for the sole purpose of re-stating some earlier observations regarding aspects of the\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      practice of the Second Circuit.\n      <em>\n       See generally\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       United States v. Taylor\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307904\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/254/#p255\">\n       752 F.3d 254\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 255-57 (2d Cir. 2014) (Cabranes,\n      <em>\n       J\n      </em>\n      ., dissenting from order denying rehearing\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      ).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      As I observed on that earlier occasion, an observer can draw only one firm conclusion from our decision not to rehear this case before the full court of active judges-namely, that the opinion dissenting from the denial of\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      review\n     (here, by Judge Livingston) is, by definition, an expression of the view of the five subscribing judges that the panel's resolution of this case presents legal issues of exceptional importance.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-27\">\n      By contrast, the order denying rehearing without elaboration may, or may not, reflect the substantive views of the particular judges in the six-judge majority voting against rehearing.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      In light of how judges in the Second Circuit have historically exercised their discretion, the decision not to convene the\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      court does not necessarily mean that a case either lacks significance or was correctly decided. Indeed, the contrary may be true. The story of our vaunted\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      \"traditions\" is fully described in my dissent from the denial of rehearing in\n      <em>\n       Taylor\n      </em>\n      . Suffice it to say that this tradition is a sometime thing, and some who invoke it have no difficulty abandoning it when convenient.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      All one can know for certain about a vote like this one is that six active circuit judges did not wish to rehear this case-perhaps because of a general aversion to\n      <em>\n       en banc\n      </em>\n      rehearings, perhaps out of confidence that the Supreme Court will solve our problem, or perhaps because doing so would signal their investment in \"collegiality\"-while the five other active circuit judges strongly believed that the panel opinion presented multiple legal errors of exceptional importance warranting correction.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
