The panel majority holds that the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (the \"CWA\" or the \"Act\"), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20670\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670</extracted-citation> <em>et seq.</em> , creates a privately enforceable right under <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation> by which some foster care parents and providers may sue States for costs related to childrearing.

Congress simply did not create an individual right to foster care maintenance payments enforceable pursuant to \u00a7 1983 in the \"Definitions\" section of this Spending Clause legislation. <em>See</em> <em>Midwest Foster Care &amp; Adoption Ass'n v. Kincade</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555887\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/1190/#p1197\">712 F.3d 1190</extracted-citation>, 1197 (8th Cir. 2013) (\"[F]inding an enforceable right solely within a purely definitional section is antithetical to requiring unambiguous congressional intent.\"). In deciding to the contrary, the panel majority misconstrues the Act and ignores decades of Supreme Court precedent, choosing instead to resurrect the Court's long-abandoned \"<em>ancien regime</em> \" of readily implied causes of action. <em>Alexander v.

Because the majority's decision is wrong, will dissipate scarce foster care dollars, and will impose litigation burdens in this Circuit that far outweigh the additional work required for <em>en banc</em> review, I dissent from the denial of rehearing <em>en banc</em> .</p><p id=\"p-12\">The CWA, enacted almost 40 years ago, offers fiscal incentives to participating States \"to encourage a more active and systematic monitoring of children in the foster care system.\" <em>Vermont Dep't of Soc. &amp; Rehab.

As the dissent from the panel majority's decision lays out more fully, by incentivizing appropriate foster care <em>arrangements</em> , the CWA does not in some way <em>sub silentio</em> grant a subset of New York foster parents and providers a privately enforceable right under <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation> to recover \"foster care maintenance payments.\" <em>See</em> <em>Poole</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520963\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/69/\">922 F.3d at 85-101</extracted-citation> (Livingston, <em>J</em> ., dissenting). The panel majority makes two fundamental mistakes in concluding to the contrary.</p><p id=\"p-13\">As to the first mistake: the CWA provides partial reimbursement to participating States of \"foster care maintenance payments\" made by these States on behalf of eligible children, if the States otherwise satisfy the requirements of the Act. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20671\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671</extracted-citation>, 675. But the panel majority concludes that by providing that States \"shall make\" foster care maintenance payments, <em><extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20671\">id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 672(a)(1), the CWA <em>also</em> imposes a minimum foster care spending obligation on recipient States, requiring the States to cover the entire cost of a slew of items listed as reimbursable in \u00a7 675(4)(A), despite the fact that the States do not even <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"59\" href=\"#p59\" id=\"p59\">*59</a>receive full federal reimbursement for those items. Put differently, the panel majority determines that the partial federal support system supplied by the CWA imposes a categorical foster care <em>spending requirement</em> on all recipient States, notwithstanding any limits their legislatures may have placed on these expenditures. This is not a reasonable interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 672 and 675. These provisions are instead best read as identifying certain categories of State payments that are <em>eligible</em> for partial federal <em>reimbursement</em> , but leaving to the discretion of the States which payments to make in the first instance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See</em> <em>Poole</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520963\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/69/\">922 F.3d at 86-92</extracted-citation> (Livingston, <em>J.</em> , dissenting). State authorities direct their own foster care programs-not federal courts.</p><p id=\"p-14\">But even if \u00a7\u00a7 672 and 675 <em>do</em> impose a spending obligation on the States (and they do not), the panel majority errs a second time in concluding that the CWA also confers on a subset of New York caregivers a <em>right</em> , enforceable under \u00a7 1983, to a monetary amount that \"cover[s] the cost of\" these \"foster care maintenance payments.\" <em>Poole</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520963\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/69/\">922 F.3d at 77</extracted-citation>. As the panel majority is well aware, the Supreme Court has \"rejected the notion\" that its precedent \"permit[s] anything short of an <em>unambiguously</em> conferred right to support a cause of action brought under \u00a7 1983.\" <em>Gonzaga Univ. v.

And the Court has reminded us that the dangers of implying enforceable rights are particularly acute with regard to Spending Clause legislation, which is \"much in the nature of a contract.\" <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v.

Its decision threatens to waste foster care resources, arbitrarily divert scarce dollars from some children to others, and push federal courts into a \"traditional area of state concern.\" <em>Moore v.

Congress neither intended nor legislated for such an outcome. Our <em>en banc</em> Court should not countenance it.</p><p id=\"p-21\">One final word is in order. The narrow vote by a bare majority of our Court's active judges to decline <em>en banc</em> review might lead a reader to infer that these judges concur in the panel majority's holding and reasoning, despite all the arguments presented in the dissent. That <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"62\" href=\"#p62\" id=\"p62\">*62</a>would be a big mistake. Because of our Circuit's so-called \"tradition\" of declining <em>en banc</em> review, the fact that six members of our Court voted to decline review does not mean that they were convinced that the panel majority is correct. <em>See</em> <em>Ricci v. DeStefano</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054765\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/88/#p89\">530 F.3d 88</extracted-citation>, 89 (2d Cir. 2008) (Katzmann, <em>J.</em> , concurring in the denial of <em>rehearing en banc</em> ) (highlighting the Circuit's supposed \"longstanding tradition of general deference to panel adjudication-a tradition which holds whether or not the judges of the Court agree with the panel's disposition of the matter before it\"). Nor does it follow that these six judges deemed the matter unimportant or unexceptional. <em>See</em> <em>Landell v. Sorrell</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095665\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/159/#p167\">406 F.3d 159</extracted-citation>, 167 (2d Cir. 2005) (Sack &amp; Katzmann, <em>JJ</em> ., concurring in the denial of rehearing <em>en banc</em> ) (suggesting that <em>en banc</em> review \"only forestall[s] resolution of issues destined ... for the Supreme Court\"). <em>But see</em> <em>Ricci</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054765\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/88/#p89\">530 F.3d at 92</extracted-citation> (Jacobs, <em>J.</em> , dissenting from the denial of rehearing <em>en banc</em> ) (\"If issues are important enough to warrant Supreme Court review, they are important enough for our full Court to consider and decide on the merits.\").</p><p id=\"p-22\">Our so-called <em>en banc</em> \"tradition,\" however, is not a license to disregard the substantial consequences that will accompany this Court's mistaken judgments. Once the mandate issues in this case, the district court must commence its review of how New York \"determined the amounts it pays\" to those receiving foster care maintenance payments, and \"how it has quantified the costs of the specific expenses listed in Section 675(4),\" <em>Poole</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520963\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/69/\">922 F.3d at 82</extracted-citation>, so as to decide whether to approve or reject the State's foster care rates (again, as applied to a subset of its foster care parents and providers). In its petition for rehearing, New York warns that such review will unjustifiably inject federal courts into the \"complex, judgment-laden process\" by which New York, like other States, determines when and how to cover costs for particular children in foster care. Petition for Rehearing at 20. Resources may-and likely will-be squandered in litigation destined to produce \"multiple, inconsistent\" results. <em>Id.</em> at 3. Tradition shouldn't prevent this Court from reviewing an issue of such consequence.</p><p id=\"p-23\">As set forth above, the panel majority made a mistake in interpreting this Spending Clause statute to impose a mandatory spending obligation on States, enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The full Court also errs in declining <em>en banc</em> review, but perhaps with less excuse. The panel majority simply made a mistake. To the extent that this <em>en banc</em> vote comes down to nothing more than an ostensible tradition, the full Court, with eyes open, has refused to afford New York State, the <em>amici</em> , and the foster care children within our jurisdiction the consideration they deserve.</p><p id=\"p-24\">Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the order denying rehearing en banc:</p><p id=\"p-25\">I respectfully join in Judge Livingston's opinion. The dissenters having failed to persuade a majority of the active judges to rehear this appeal, our concerns necessarily now rest in the hands of our highest court. I write separately, and in my name alone, for the sole purpose of re-stating some earlier observations regarding aspects of the <em>en banc</em> practice of the Second Circuit. <em>See generally</em> <em>United States v. Taylor</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307904\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/254/#p255\">752 F.3d 254</extracted-citation>, 255-57 (2d Cir. 2014) (Cabranes, <em>J</em> ., dissenting from order denying rehearing <em>en banc</em> ).</p><p id=\"p-26\">As I observed on that earlier occasion, an observer can draw only one firm conclusion from our decision not to rehear this case before the full court of active judges-namely, that the opinion dissenting from the denial of <em>en banc</em> review <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"63\" href=\"#p63\" id=\"p63\">*63</a>(here, by Judge Livingston) is, by definition, an expression of the view of the five subscribing judges that the panel's resolution of this case presents legal issues of exceptional importance.</p><p id=\"p-27\">By contrast, the order denying rehearing without elaboration may, or may not, reflect the substantive views of the particular judges in the six-judge majority voting against rehearing.</p><p id=\"p-28\">In light of how judges in the Second Circuit have historically exercised their discretion, the decision not to convene the <em>en banc</em> court does not necessarily mean that a case either lacks significance or was correctly decided. Indeed, the contrary may be true. The story of our vaunted <em>en banc</em> \"traditions\" is fully described in my dissent from the denial of rehearing in <em>Taylor</em> . Suffice it to say that this tradition is a sometime thing, and some who invoke it have no difficulty abandoning it when convenient.</p><p id=\"p-29\">All one can know for certain about a vote like this one is that six active circuit judges did not wish to rehear this case-perhaps because of a general aversion to <em>en banc</em> rehearings, perhaps out of confidence that the Supreme Court will solve our problem, or perhaps because doing so would signal their investment in \"collegiality\"-while the five other active circuit judges strongly believed that the panel opinion presented multiple legal errors of exceptional importance warranting correction.</p><p id=\"p-32\"><em>Compare</em> <em>New York State Citizens' Coalition for Children v.

L. No. 110-351,<extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%203949\">122 Stat. 3949</extracted-citation> (2008) (current version at <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20675\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675</extracted-citation>(4)(A) ). But HHS did not interpret this amendment as <em>requiring</em> States to pay for such travel: \"As with any cost enumerated in the definition of foster care maintenance payments,\" it said, \"the [State] agency may decide which of the costs to include in the child's foster care maintenance payment.\" U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., Program Instruction No. ACYF-CB-Pl-10-11 at 20, http://perma.cc/9LX9-C76D; <em>see also</em> U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., Child Welfare Policy Manual \u00a7 8.3B.1(9) (2018) (noting that Boy Scout dues qualify as \"incidentals\" and are therefore \"<em>reimbursable</em> \" under the CWA (emphasis added)).</p><p id=\"p-37\">By contrast, the CWA unambiguously confers a private right of action to prevent States from making foster-care placement decisions on the basis of race, color, or national origin. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20671\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671</extracted-citation>(a)(18), 674(d)(3)(A) (\"Any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of section 671(a)(18) [prohibiting racial discrimination in foster care or adoption denials] of this title by a State or other entity may bring an action seeking relief from the State or other entity in any United States district court.\"). The absence of such rights-creating language in the foster care maintenance payment provisions at issue here strongly suggests that the omission was intentional. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Olmsted v. Pruco Life Ins. Co. of N.J.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509904\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/429/#p433\">283 F.3d 429</extracted-citation>, 433 (2d Cir. 2002).</p><p id=\"p-38\">And the Supreme Court has warned against reading <em>Blessing</em> to thwart the Court's repeated directive that nothing less than an <em>unambiguously conferred right</em> is enforceable pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>See</em> <em>Gonzaga</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">536 U.S. at 282-83</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">122 S.Ct. 2268</extracted-citation> (\"Some language in our opinions might be read to suggest that something less than an unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by \u00a7 1983. <em>Blessing</em> , for example, set forth three 'factors' to guide judicial inquiry into whether or not a statute confers a right. ... We now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under \u00a7 1983.\").</p><p id=\"p-39\">As already noted, the CWA provides partial federal reimbursement of a State's foster care expenditures, but only with regard to the \u00a7 675(4)(A) items and only for <em>some</em> children-those who \"would have otherwise qualified for assistance under the now-defunct Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.\" <em>Midwest Foster Care</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555887\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/1190/#p1197\">712 F.3d at 1194</extracted-citation>.

The panel majority's conclusion that the CWA imposes a spending mandate on States, enforceable pursuant to \u00a7 1983, will thus not only confer on district courts a rate-setting obligation pursuant to a statute that provides no guidance for this task, but also have the likely effect, as New York argues, of arbitrarily \"forc[ing] New York to decrease its payments for the costs and children who do not meet federal eligibility requirements.\" <em>Id.</em> at 15.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
