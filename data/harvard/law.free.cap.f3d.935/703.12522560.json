We also consider the effective date of regulations that (1) a district court vacated before their original effective date; (2) an appellate court upheld, reversing the district court; and (3) the agency then decided not to enforce until a date after the original effective date. We agree with the district court that the County of Los Angeles is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity but disagree as to the effective date of the regulations, which we hold is the original effective date of January 1, 2015. We thus affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   California's In-Home Supportive Services program (\"IHSS program\" or \"the program\") provides in-home supportive services to eligible low-income elderly, blind, or disabled persons. Homecare providers help recipients with daily activities like housework, meal preparation, and personal care. The program serves hundreds of thousands of recipients. In the County of Los Angeles alone there are about 170,000 homecare providers and more than 200,000 recipients. California implements the program through regulations promulgated by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS), and the program is administered in part by California counties. Plaintiffs are current or former Los Angeles IHSS homecare providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State and its counties share responsibility for implementing and running the IHSS program. The CDSS ensures that \"in-home supportive services [are] provided in a uniform manner in every county,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012301\">\n    Cal.

Plaintiffs claim that although they receive paychecks from the State, the County is responsible for a \"share\" of their wages.

The district court noted that the Supreme Court has long refused to grant Eleventh Amendment immunity to counties and that the Court has already held that California counties are not arms of the State. The district court then assumed\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a county could be an arm of the State under the five-factor test that we set out in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

The district court found that only one of the five factors favored the County, and thus it held that the County enjoyed no Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court then \"reject[ed] Plaintiffs' efforts to enforce the FLSA companionship exemption regulations retroactively to January 1, 2015.\" Instead, it held \"that the putative collective period extends from November 12, 2015, through January 31, 2016,\" and not before. The court said that although the\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   decision applied retroactively, that decision was merely that the DOL could amend the FLSA and that those amendments were not arbitrary and capricious. This, the district court held, differed from \"the retroactive application of the amended regulations themselves.\" The district court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The rule of law announced by the D.C. Circuit is given retroactive effect by allowing DOL to reinstate those regulations without having to begin a new rule-making process. That is not the same\n   thing as reinstating an earlier and judicially vacated effective date and retroactively creating liability for violations of the reinstated regulations as if the District Court's vacation of the regulations had never occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court also found it \"compelling\" that both the D.C. Circuit and the DOL \"intended\" that the regulation become effective \"no earlier than November 12, 2015.\" As evidence of this intent, the district court pointed to the DOL's decision not to enforce the new regulations before that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the district court found that its holding was consistent \"with the general rule that a private right of action should ordinarily not exist when the applicable rule could not be enforced by the relevant enforcement agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The County filed an interlocutory appeal as to the denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity. The district court granted Plaintiffs' motion to certify for interlocutory appeal the district court's holding that the putative collective period began on November 12, 2015, and we granted Plaintiffs' request to appeal that holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review de novo the denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n   <em>\n    Cal. ex rel.

First,\n   <em>\n    Alden v. Maine\n   </em>\n   : \"The second important limit to the principle of sovereign immunity is that it bars suits against States but not lesser entities. The immunity does not extend to suits prosecuted against a municipal corporation or other governmental entity which is not an arm of the State.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248280\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/706/#p756\">\n    527 U.S. 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248280\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/706/#p756\">\n    119 S.Ct. 2240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248280\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/706/#p756\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). This sentence means one of two things: either (1) that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to municipal corporations because they are not arms of the state or (2) that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to a municipal corporation unless it is acting, in a particular circumstance, as an arm of the state.\n   <em>\n    Alden\n   </em>\n   in turn cites\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Although these passages seem to support Plaintiffs' argument that counties never enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity, it is not for us to clarify\n   <em>\n    Chatham\n   </em>\n   's apparently contrary statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Chatham\n   </em>\n   Court ultimately found it dispositive that the County there had conceded below that it had no Eleventh Amendment immunity and that the question on which certiorari was granted assumed that conclusion.

Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   commented not\n   only on the retroactivity of the Supreme Court's reversal but also on the effective date of the regulations, holding that the intervening vacatur did not alter the original effective date of the pricing rules.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753140\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/733/#p738\">\n    199 F.3d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   guide our analysis here. The D.C. Circuit's holding that the DOL had the authority to promulgate the new rule and that the rule was reasonable applies retroactively. As in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the regulations apply as of the original effective date. To hold otherwise could encourage dilatory appellate litigation. If an erroneously vacated rule or regulation were not effective until sometime after the mandate issued in a later appeal, then a party might drag out the appellate process to avoid compliance for as long as possible. Put differently, an erroneous vacatur cannot postpone a rule's effective date until an appellate court corrects the error sometime in the future. And, as the Fourth Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , in a case like this everyone knows that the lower court decision might be reversed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State and its counties knew from October 13, 2013, when the DOL first announced its final rule, that January 1, 2015 was the rule's effective date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060%2C454\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. at 60,454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State and its counties had a full fifteen months to comply with the final rule-indeed the State initially said that it would comply with the original effective date, but it changed course after the\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   court vacated the rule. That decision may have been reasonable, but it created a monetary risk, as the State and its counties were well aware that an appellate court might uphold the regulations on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The district court held that to apply the\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   decision retroactively would be to \"reinstate[ ] an earlier and judicially vacated effective date and retroactively creat[e] liability for violations of the reinstated regulations as if the District Court's vacation of the regulations had never occurred.\" That is exactly correct. And although the district court found that to be unfair, it would be equally unfair to hold that a putative collective of homecare providers is not entitled to nearly a year's worth of overtime wages just because a single district court issued an erroneous decision that another court reversed on appeal. The State gambled that\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   would be affirmed. The effect of that gamble might be unfair to the County, but the County must seek any recourse from the State. It is not fair for the homecare providers to bear the financial consequences of the State's calculated risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The DOL's decision not to enforce a new rule does not obviate private rights of action.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   According to the County, the DOL's choice against enforcing the rule until November 12, 2015 eliminated the availability of private rights of action until that date because a private right of action cannot precede an agency's enforcement of a rule or regulation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"An agency's informal assurance that\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   will not pursue enforcement cannot preclude a citizen's suit to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Envtl.

Circuit and DOL \"intended\" that the regulation become effective \"no earlier than November 12, 2015\" is tenuous and, in any event, irrelevant. First, the D.C. Circuit said nothing at all on the issue. Second, there is nothing in the several statements of the DOL, which the district court relied on, that suggest that it intended its discretionary enforcement choices to preclude private enforcement.
