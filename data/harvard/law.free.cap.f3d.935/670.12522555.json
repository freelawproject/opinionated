One of Harris's prior cases was dismissed because, after concluding that he failed to state a federal claim, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims.

After Harris attempted to voluntarily dismiss Dr. Bick, the district court found that the allegations against the remaining defendants failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim, and \"in the absence of a cognizable federal claim, the court [declined] to exercise supplemental\n   jurisdiction over [Harris's] state contract and debtor-creditor claims.\" On appeal, we affirmed the district court's dismissal on the Eighth Amendment claims and its decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Harris v.

Harris named defendants E. Titus, J. Choy, G. Phelps, J. Karuzas, and C. Carter. The district court dismissed one defendant, Carter, because the United States Marshal was unable to serve him despite attempts at two workplaces. The court also dismissed three defendants, Titus, Choy, and Phelps, because, as court-appointed psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors at the parole hearings, they were protected by quasi-judicial immunity. The district court granted defendant Karuzas's motion for judgment on the pleadings for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The question before us is whether these two suits,\n   <em>\n    Bick\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , qualify as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We interpret \u00a7 1915(g) de novo.\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Bick\n   </em>\n   was due to the district court's refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims after dismissal of his Eighth Amendment claim, and thus this case does not qualify as a strike.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree. Dismissal based on a district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not an enumerated ground under \u00a7 1915(g). As then-Judge Kavanaugh explained, \"[w]hen a district court has declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims, the court has not dismissed the state-law claims for failure to state a claim, nor has the court dismissed the state-law claims as frivolous or malicious.\"\n   <em>\n    Fourstar v.

Cir. 2017). Because the language of \u00a7 1915(g) is plain and unambiguous, a dismissal on a ground other than frivolousness, maliciousness, or failure to state a claim will not qualify as a strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266868\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1147/#p1152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266868\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1147/#p1152\">\n    at 1151-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues that policy considerations counsel in favor of counting\n   <em>\n    Bick\n   </em>\n   as a strike. Otherwise, Defendant urges, a prisoner can easily \"strike-proof\" a meritless lawsuit by adding state-law claims, knowing that federal courts are unlikely to expend limited resources to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over such claims in the absence of a cognizable federal claim. Of course, courts are free to reach state-law claims and dismiss them on an enumerated strike ground. But even if the policy concerns are warranted, we must still strictly construe the plain language of the statute. \"It is not a judge's job to add to or otherwise re-mold statutory text to try to meet a statute's perceived policy objectives. Instead, we must apply the statute as written.\"\n   <em>\n    Fourstar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266868\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1147/#p1152\">\n    875 F.3d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We follow the D.C. Circuit and hold that a dismissal due to the district court's decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims does not qualify the case as a strike under the PLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Neither a Dismissal Due to a Failure to Serve Nor a Dismissal Based on Quasi-Judicial Immunity Qualifies as a Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Harris argues that\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not qualify as a strike. The district court dismissed one defendant, Carter, because the United States Marshal was unable to serve him despite multiple attempts at two workplaces. A dismissal due to a failure to serve is plainly not a dismissal on the ground that the suit was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim. It is therefore not a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). Defendant resists a plain reading\n   of the statute and argues that a dismissal of one defendant for failure to serve should not prevent a case from qualifying as a strike where other claims were dismissed for frivolousness or failure to state a claim. But we evaluate the \"case as a whole\" and dismissal of even one claim for an unenumerated reason saves the entire case from counting as a strike.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , 833 F.3d at 1057. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not qualify as a strike because one defendant was dismissed for failure to serve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   does not qualify as a strike for an additional, independent reason. The district court dismissed the remaining defendants because it found them entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. Defendant argues that quasi-judicial immunity falls within the enumerated strike ground of failure to state a claim. We have not addressed this issue, but the Eighth Circuit has rejected a similar argument, holding that \"[d]ismissals based on immunity are not among the types of dismissals listed as strikes in section 1915(g).\"\n   <em>\n    Castillo-Alvarez v. Krukow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265856\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1219/#p1220\">\n    768 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1220 (8th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The language and structure of the PLRA make clear that immunity-based dismissals generally do not fall within \u00a7 1915(g). Section 1915 sets out the IFP application procedures and rules regarding payment of court fees in subsections (a) through (d). Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2), regardless of the filing fee payment, \"the court shall [sua sponte] dismiss the case at any time\" if the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (i) is frivolous or malicious;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief,\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Yet the strike provision, subsection (g), which follows subsection (e), omits the immunity language as a ground for a strike. \"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Russello v.

For example, in \u00a7 1915A, Congress implemented a screening procedure for civil claims made by incarcerated plaintiffs against \"a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). When listing the grounds for dismissal while screening a complaint, Congress included the three enumerated strike grounds and then added \"or [ ] seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), mirroring the language in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) discussed above. Congress intended for the screening procedure to address immunity because it expressly listed immunity after frivolousness, maliciousness, and failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c) (stating that the court may dismiss a case regarding prison conditions or in which administrative remedies have not been exhausted if it is \"frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\n   <em>\n    or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief\n   </em>\n   \" in subsections 1997e(c)(1) and (2) (emphasis added)). In sum, Congress' omission of immunity-based dismissal from the strike provision in \u00a7 1915(g) evidences its\n   intent generally not to include this dismissal ground as a strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To be sure, there are rare cases where an affirmative defense, such as immunity, may be so clear on the face of the complaint that dismissal may qualify as a strike for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El-Shaddai\n   </em>\n   , 833 F.3d at 1044 (recognizing the rarity of such dismissals and declining to find a strike when the affirmative defense of administrative exhaustion was not clear on the face of the complaint);\n   <em>\n    Albino v.

And here, that is decidedly not the case. The district court moved beyond the\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   complaint not only to consider the defendants' roles, titles, and actions, but to grapple with the legal analysis entitling the defendants to quasi-judicial immunity. Because the court dismissed Harris's\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   complaint on immunity grounds rather than the grounds that it was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   is not a strike under \u00a7 1915(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The \"denial of [IFP] status effectively, if not physically, denies many indigent prisoners access to the courts.\" Simone Schonenberger,\n   <em>\n    Access Denied: The Prison Litigation Reform Act\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Ky.%20L.J.%20457\">\n    86 Ky.

Unless an incarcerated litigant has accrued three strikes on grounds plainly enumerated in \u00a7 1915(g), she is entitled to IFP status. Dismissals for supplemental jurisdiction, failure to serve, and quasi-judicial immunity are not grounds giving rise to strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) of the PLRA.
