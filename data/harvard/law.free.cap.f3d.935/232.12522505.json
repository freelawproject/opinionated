On the basis of his prior conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court applied an effective six-level enhancement to Norman's sentence under\n   United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Norman appeals the denial of his motion to suppress and the imposition of the enhancement. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We relate the facts relevant to the suppression motion in the light most favorable to the Government, the prevailing party before the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bullette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276878\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/261/#p265\">\n    854 F.3d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (4th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 7, 2016, officers with the United States Marshals Fugitive Task Force and the local sheriff's office received information that Norman, wanted on an outstanding warrant for violating the terms of his supervised release, could be found in a black Camry on Archer Road in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Arriving on the scene, the officers approached the vehicle, removed Norman, and placed him under arrest pursuant to the outstanding warrant. They then searched Norman and found a large amount of cash and a cell phone in his pockets. The officers also removed and searched the sole passenger in the vehicle, Princess Harrison; they found a baggie in her hair, which she admitted contained cocaine residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When officers placed the cash seized from Norman's person on the driver's side seat of the Camry, they saw additional cash on the car's floorboard. The officers later ascertained that the total amount of cash recovered from Norman's person and the floorboard was $1,244. The officers also observed a small tied-up quarter baggie sitting behind the gear stick on the center console of the vehicle. One officer testified that, based on the baggie's distinctive appearance and his seventeen years of experience with narcotics investigations, he believed the baggie contained contraband. The baggie's contents later tested positive for heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After arresting Norman and Harrison and observing the cash and baggie in plain view, the officers conducted an extensive search of the vehicle. They subsequently located packages containing cocaine and \"molly\" (a street term for powdered ecstasy) under a bag on the floor of the back seat and a firearm under the driver's side seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 13, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Norman on three counts: (1) possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2), and 924(e) (\"Count 1\"); (2) possession with intent to distribute a quantity of heroin and cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (\"Count 2\"); and (3) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A) (\"Count 3\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case proceeded to a bench trial. After the close of the Government's case, Norman moved to suppress the drugs and firearm recovered from the Camry as fruits of an illegal search. The district court denied his motion, and later found Norman guilty on all three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following Norman's conviction, the district court asked the United States Probation Office to prepare a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"). For Count 1, the Probation Office calculated a base offense level of 20. This included an effective six-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), on the basis that a prior conviction for \"Conspiracy to [Possess with Intent to Distribute] Cocaine and Cocaine Base\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   constituted a \"controlled substance offense.\" With an additional two-level enhancement for a stolen firearm and a criminal history category of VI, Norman's resulting Guidelines range was 84 to 105 months' imprisonment. Counts 1 and 2 were consolidated pursuant\n   to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). Because Count 3 required a mandatory 60-month consecutive term of imprisonment, Norman's effective Guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(a) was 144 to 165 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At his sentencing hearing on March 27, 2018, Norman's sole objection was to the criminal history points associated with a 2005 conviction in state court. The court overruled that objection. The district court then sentenced Norman to 156 months of imprisonment, consisting of 96 months for Counts 1 and 2 and 60 consecutive months for Count 3, followed by a five-year term of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Norman first challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the fruits of the warrantless search of the Camry. We review the court's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Bullette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276878\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/261/#p265\">\n    854 F.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court denied Norman's motion on the basis of two exceptions to the warrant requirement, finding both that the search was \"incident to an arrest\" and that the officers \"had probable cause to search because ... there was in plain view evidence of drugs in the car.\" On appeal, the Government primarily maintains that the warrantless search was valid as a search incident to the arrest of Princess Harrison. Although Norman raises a host of arguments challenging the applicability of several exceptions to the warrant requirement, he offers no rebuttal to this argument and so has abandoned any challenge to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Even if that were not so, we would agree with the Government that the officers' search of the Camry was a valid search incident to the arrest of Harrison. Police may conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle \"incident to a lawful arrest when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

After finding a bag of white powder in Harrison's hair - which she admitted to the arresting officer was cocaine - and observing a suspicious baggie and a large amount of cash in plain view, the officers had a \"reasonable basis\" to believe they might find additional drugs in the Camry in which Harrison, an arrestee, was a passenger.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p343\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p343\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton v.

The second requires us to determine whether the conviction at issue constitutes a conviction of that generic offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do this by comparing the elements of the generic offense to the elements of the defendant's offense of conviction. If the offense of conviction criminalizes conduct broader than that encompassed by the generic offense, then the conviction does not categorically qualify under the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chacon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039499\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/250/#p254\">\n    533 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254-55 (4th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, the district court applied a base offense level of 20 on the basis of Norman's 2008 conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This increased Norman's base offense level from 14 to 20. Taken with the two-level enhancement for a stolen firearm, application of the controlled substance offense enhancement raised Norman's Guidelines range from 46-57 months to 84-105 months. Norman concedes that actual possession of cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute qualifies as a controlled substance offense. But he contends that because the definition of \"conspiracy\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is broader than the definition of the generic crime of conspiracy, his conspiracy conviction does not qualify as a \"controlled substance offense\" under the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A straightforward application of controlling precedent compels us to agree. Because the Guidelines do not define \"conspiracy\" under \u00a7 4B1.2, the term is defined by reference to the \"generic, contemporary meaning\" of the crime.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    495 U.S. at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on the fact that thirty-six states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands \"define conspiracy to require an overt act,\" we have expressly held that \"an overt act is an element of the generic definition of conspiracy\" as incorporated into \u00a7 4B1.2.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, \u00a7 846 criminalizes a broader range of conduct than that covered by generic conspiracy, and Norman's conviction under \u00a7 846 cannot support the six-level enhancement he received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nevertheless, it offers several arguments as to why we should diverge from this established rule here. None are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government first asserts that the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2 somehow demonstrates that the Sentencing Commission intended to treat any relevant conspiracy crime as a controlled substance offense, regardless of whether it requires an overt act. Recall that the commentary states that \"aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting\" to commit a controlled substance offense meet the requirements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). But the commentary does not define those enumerated offenses for the purpose of determining whether a\n   <em>\n    given\n   </em>\n   \"aiding and abetting, conspiring, or attempting\" conviction qualifies as a controlled substance offense. As we have explained, it is well settled that when the Guidelines simply name a type of offense without specifically defining it, nomenclature alone does not control; rather, we use the categorical approach to compare a potential predicate offense with the generic definition of the specified offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516310\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/300/#p308\">\n    885 F.3d at 307-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying categorical approach to define \"conspiring\" under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) to require an overt act);\n   <em>\n    Dozier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277314\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/180/#p182\">\n    848 F.3d at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying categorical approach to define \"attempting\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nor, contrary to the Government's suggestion, does\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But we rejected precisely this argument in\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   .

The defendants in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   raised a host of challenges to their convictions and sentences on appeal, none of\n   which are relevant here. On cross-appeal, however, the Government argued that the district court incorrectly held that it had no authority to find facts as to when a specific defendant's \u00a7 846 conspiracy started, for the purposes of determining which prior felony convictions were recent enough to serve as predicates\n   <em>\n    in that defendant's case\n   </em>\n   . In reply, the defendants argued that the district court had no such authority and challenged the applicability of the career offender enhancement\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the Sentencing Commission \"exceeded its statutory mandate in including drug conspiracy offenses in the definition of controlled substance offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844388\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/876/#p888\">\n    32 F.3d at 888-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the course of reaching these holdings, the court remarked in passing that \"conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ ] would clearly qualify as a career offender offense under the Guidelines provisions and commentaries.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , the government cross-appealed to challenge the district court's failure to categorize as a career offender, under Guidelines section 4B1.1, a defendant convicted of a \u00a7 846 conspiracy offense. The\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   decision recognized that, in order to designate a defendant as a Guidelines career offender, the government must establish, in relevant part, that \"the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is ... a controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844388\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/876/#p888\">\n    32 F.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 ).

That is,\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   addressed and answered three questions relevant to the defendant's career offender status: (1) the question of whether, as argued by the government, the district court had incorrectly concluded that it lacked authority to render a factual finding essential to categorizing the defendant as a career offender; (2) the question of whether, as argued by the defendant, the Sentencing Commission had exceeded its statutory mandate by including conspiracy in the definition of a controlled substance offense; and (3) the threshold question of whether a \u00a7 846 conspiracy is even a controlled substance offense at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Understandably, the\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   decision first decided the threshold question, i.e., whether a \u00a7 846 conspiracy constitutes a controlled substance offense within the meaning of Guidelines section 4B1.1. In so doing,\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   reviewed the pertinent section 4B1.2 definition and concluded that the defendant's \"instant offense of conviction - conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - would clearly qualify as a career offender offense under the Guidelines provisions and commentaries.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844388\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/876/#p888\">\n    32 F.3d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Significantly, we limited the\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   remand to the factual issue of when the instant \u00a7 846 offense began, instructing that \"[i]f the court determines that conspiratorial activities began on or before [the critical date], then it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   find [the defendant] to be a career offender.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844388\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/876/#p888\">\n    32 F.3d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). By imposing that limitation, the panel underscored that\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   had definitively decided that a \u00a7 846 conspiracy qualifies as a controlled substance offense, obviating any further debate or consideration of the question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In these circumstances, it is incorrect for today's panel majority to dismiss as a \"passing observation\" or mere \"dictum\"\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that a \u00a7 846 conspiracy is a controlled substance offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   240-41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pittston Co. v.
