Police arrested and questioned Daya Singh (\"Singh\") and Tasvir Singh (\"Tasvir\"), but both men denied any knowledge of the shooting. During this interrogation, Tasvir began to argue with the officers, threatening to \"file a case\" against them to \"see that [their] uniforms [were] removed.\" The officers retaliated: they beat Tasvir and, eventually, removed him from the police station. Singh never saw him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After five days of detention, Singh's father bribed the officers and secured his son's release. Meanwhile, Tasvir's father hired two lawyers to find his own son. Singh told the lawyers that he saw Tasvir argue with the officers before they took him away from the station. They recorded Singh's statement and sent it to \"higher officials\" in the Indian government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Singh soon faced reprisals: Punjabi officers arrested him and forced him to recant his statement to Tasvir's lawyers. To that end, two local officers ordered Singh to sign, suspiciously enough, a couple of blank sheets of paper. One of the officers said to the other: \"teach him a good lesson so that he should learn what is the consequence of going against the police and say[ing] something against the police.\" The\n   officers then ordered Singh to undress, slapped and punched him, kicked him in the chest, beat the soles of his feet with a stick, and urinated on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, two senior police officers arrived to interview Singh. Before Singh met with them, a local officer instructed him about \"how to speak before the senior officers,\" warning Singh: \"if you don't help the police, then you ... will also disappear, like Tasvir Singh forever.\" Singh then met with the two senior officers, along with one of the local officers. The senior officers had the two papers that Singh had signed the day before, but such papers now had \"something written on [them].\" Singh then recanted the statement he gave to Tasvir's lawyers. He told the senior officers that he \"had never seen [Tasvir] in the cell\" and that Tasvir \"was a mentally weak person\" that would leave home for days. As Singh later testified to the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), he gave \"all these statements ... to save [his] life ... on the instructions of the police.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Singh was released, but his family and friends arranged for him to leave India. He entered the United States without inspection in November 2007, and he filed affirmative applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") in February 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") filed a Notice to Appear and initiated removal proceedings against Singh. Singh conceded his removability, but he renewed his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the IJ, Singh sought to establish \"refugee\" status by showing past persecution on account of an imputed political opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). He argued that the Punjabi officers persecuted him because he spoke out \"against police\" and \"against corruption.\" The IJ therefore evaluated his claim under the Board of Immigration Appeal's (\"BIA\") precedential decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of N-M-\n   </em>\n   , which sets forth a three-factor standard to determine whether retaliation for \"opposition to official corruption (or 'whistleblowing')\" constitutes persecution on account of a political opinion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20526\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (BIA 2011). Under that decision, the IJ considers: (1) \"whether and to what extent the alien engaged in activities that could be perceived as expressions of anticorruption beliefs,\" (2) \"any direct or circumstantial evidence that the alleged persecutor was motivated by the alien's perceived or actual anticorruption beliefs,\" and (3) \"evidence regarding the pervasiveness of government corruption, as well as whether there are direct ties between the corrupt elements and higher level officials.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20526\">\n    at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Singh's case, the IJ found that he failed to satisfy each of these factors. First, he found that Singh's statement to Tasvir's lawyers could not reasonably be construed as \"reflecting anticorruption beliefs,\" since Singh never \"escalate[d] the situation to higher authorities\" or \"ma[de] his knowledge public.\" Second, he found that Singh's persecutors \"act[ed] out of personal revenge\" and not \"with any particular concern about Singh's political beliefs.\" Finally, the IJ found that Singh's actions \"threatened to expose [only] the corrupt acts of\n   <em>\n    rogue officials\n   </em>\n   ,\" not a \"scheme of corruption entrenched in the ruling party.\" Because the IJ concluded that Singh's mistreatment was not \"on account of\" his \"imputed or actual anticorruption beliefs,\" he denied Singh's application for asylum. The IJ also denied Singh's application for withholding of removal, reasoning that Singh's claim necessarily failed because the standard of proof for withholding\n   of removal is more stringent than the standard for asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On administrative appeal, the BIA \"adopt[ed] and affirm[ed]\" the IJ's decision in all respects. Like the IJ, the BIA concluded that Singh \"did not establish a claim based on an actual or imputed anti-corruption political opinion (or 'whistleblowing').\" The BIA dismissed Singh's appeal, and he now petitions this court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Singh first asks us to hold that the BIA erred in dismissing his appeal of the IJ's denial of his application for asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Singh begins with a broad challenge to the BIA's precedential decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of N-M-\n   </em>\n   , arguing that it misconstrues the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") that govern asylum claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(i). As discussed, such decision establishes a three-factor standard to determine whether \"whistleblowers\" can demonstrate persecution on account of a political opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of N-M-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20526\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

Singh claims that the agency's use of these factors saddles a \"nebulous class of applicants\" with a \"uniquely onerous evidentiary burden.\" Singh asks us to hold that\n   <em>\n    Matter of N-M-\n   </em>\n   is an unreasonable interpretation of the INA, and therefore that the IJ's and BIA's reliance on such decision was legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We decline Singh's invitation.

The BIA concluded-based on the IJ's factual findings-that Singh's statement to Tasvir's lawyers \"could not reasonably be construed as an expression of anticorruption beliefs,\" as he never \"report[ed] the corruption\" to higher officials or sought to \"make his knowledge public.\" Given Singh's failure to take concrete steps to expose corruption, the BIA could reasonably conclude that Singh never formed a bona fide political opinion about corruption in the ranks of the Punjabi police. Instead, the officers likely thought that Singh's actions manifested an apolitical desire to help Tasvir-not general anti-corruption sentiments. And even assuming that Singh might have formed (or that the officers\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   he formed) some political opinion, the BIA concluded that the record supported the IJ's finding that the officers' motivations had nothing to do with such opinion. In the BIA's view, the officers acted out of \"personal revenge\" because his statement \"implicat[ed] them in [Tasvir's] disappearance\" and \"expose[d] their misdeeds.\" From the officers' perspective, in other words, Singh's political views were irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Singh responds that \"direct evidence\" demonstrates that the officers targeted him for his \"anti-police views.\" Specifically, Singh notes that the officers accused him of \"going against the police and say[ing] something against the police.\" But in context, this statement is at best ambiguous; it could perhaps suggest that the officers imputed to Singh certain political views,\n   but it could just as easily indicate general displeasure with the inconvenience caused by Singh's testimony. We do not think that the officers' isolated, equivocal statements\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   a conclusion contrary to the BIA's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Milian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064394\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/1026/#p1031\">\n    755 F.3d at 1032-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding the BIA's decision despite a \"single statement\" in the record that arguably contradicted its decision).

He claims that the BIA failed to follow\n   <em>\n    Barajas-Romero v.

Because the BIA adopted the IJ's finding of\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   nexus between the harm to Singh and the alleged protected ground, neither the result nor the BIA's basic reasoning would change. Accordingly, remand to the BIA \"would be an idle and useless formality,\" and we will not \"convert judicial review of agency action into a ping-pong game.\"\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.
