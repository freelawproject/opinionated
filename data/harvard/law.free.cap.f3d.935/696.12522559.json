In this case we address, as a matter of first impression in our Circuit, whether personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtors in the district of registration is required for such registration of a judgment. We hold that it is not, because neither \u00a7 1963 nor due process imposes such a personal jurisdiction requirement. We therefore reverse the order and judgment of the district court, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2002, Plaintiffs-Appellants Fidelity National Financial, Inc., and Fidelity Express Network, Inc. (collectively, \"Fidelity\"), obtained a multimillion dollar civil fraud judgment (the \"California Judgment\") against Defendants-Appellees the Friedmans and Meshkatais (collectively, \"Defendants\") in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. This judgment became final on May 15, 2003, after this Court dismissed Defendants' appeal from the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While Defendants' appeal in the original case was pending, Fidelity registered the California Judgment in the District of Arizona pursuant to the federal registration statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 2007, Fidelity attempted to renew the Arizona judgment. However, on March 2, 2012, the District Court of Arizona ruled that Fidelity's 2007 renewal or re-registration of the Arizona registered judgment were void as untimely, because the judgment had already expired under Arizona's five-year statute of limitations for the enforcement of judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unable to enforce the Arizona registered judgment or re-register the original California Judgment in Arizona, Fidelity came up with a creative alternative. Fidelity registered the California Judgment in the Western District of Washington (the \"Washington Judgment\") Fidelity then registered the newly-obtained Washington Judgment in the District of Arizona (the \"Second Arizona Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several months later, Defendants moved the Arizona District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) to vacate the newly-registered Second Arizona Judgment as void, arguing that \u00a7 1963 did not allow successive registration of federal judgments. That is, Defendants argued that registering the California Judgment in Washington did not create a new Washington judgment that could then be registered in Arizona under \u00a7 1963. Defendants also argued that, in any case, the Washington Judgment was invalid for lack of personal jurisdiction over Defendants. The Arizona district court granted Defendants' motion and vacated the Second Arizona Judgment, holding that \u00a7 1963 did not allow successive registration of judgments-in other words, that only an original judgment, such as the California Judgment in this case, may be registered in another district under \u00a7 1963.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fid.

It then reasoned that because we suggested in\n   <em>\n    Fidelity I\n   </em>\n   that registering a judgment under \u00a7 1963 creates a \"new\" judgment, the court of registration can be said to have \"rendered\" a judgment such that the normal jurisdictional requirements apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-7.

For the reasons explained below, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, neither the relevant statute's plain language nor its purpose supports a personal jurisdiction requirement for registration of a judgment. Section 1963 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A judgment in an action for the recovery of money or property entered in any court of appeals, district court, bankruptcy court, or in the Court of International Trade may be registered by filing a certified copy of the judgment in any other district ... when the judgment has become final by appeal or expiration of the time for appeal or when ordered by the court that entered the judgment for good cause shown. ... A judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in this provision limits the district courts in which a judgment may be registered to only those that can assert personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtors. Instead, the provision's text is extremely broad, allowing a judgment entered in \"any ... district court\" to be registered \"in any other district.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the fact that registering a judgment in another district simply requires \"filing a certified copy of the judgment\" suggests that the registration process is intended to be simple, essentially an administrative task that does not require any additional judicial action.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Giving effect to this broad statutory language also accords with the provision's\n   purpose, which is \"to simplify and facilitate collection on valid judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Fidelity I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345614\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/999/\">\n    803 F.3d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

The district court noted that under this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Fidelity I\n   </em>\n   , registering a judgment in another district pursuant to \u00a7 1963 creates a \"new judgment\" that is treated as if it had been rendered in the new district and that \"[a] judgment is void 'if the court that rendered the judgment lacked jurisdiction over the parties ....' \"\n   <em>\n    Fid.

This reasoning, however, is flawed because it incorrectly presumes that constitutional due process protections in the form of a personal jurisdiction requirement attach based on the appearance of a judgment, rather than based on the characteristics of the process that results in that judgment. We must therefore ask\n   this crucial constitutional question: does the Due Process Clause require that a court in which a judgment creditor registers a pre-existing federal judgment have personal jurisdiction over judgment debtors at the time of registration? We hold in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A long line of Supreme Court cases reflects that the personal jurisdiction requirement of due process is grounded in protecting litigants from being unfairly dragged into a faraway court to defend a suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    World-Wide\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Volkswagen Corp. v.

Constitutional due process requirements depend on the procedures at issue, not semantics-just because a court might be said to \"render\" a \"new\" judgment pursuant to registration does not mean that no meaningful distinction exists between, on the one hand, subjecting a person to a lawsuit in which claims are litigated in an ongoing proceeding before a court that may determine or alter substantive rights when it renders a final judgment, and, on the other hand, registering a pre-existing judgment, a process which does not require any party to appear in court and in which no judicial action is taken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaffer\n   </em>\n   , 433 U.S. at 210 n.36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178074\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/186/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, once a judgment is validly rendered against a debtor, the judgment creditor may sue to satisfy the debt with property in a state that lacks personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Registration of a judgment pursuant to \u00a7 1963 can only occur after a court of competent jurisdiction has rendered the original judgment (otherwise there would be no judgment to register).

Thus, registration will only happen\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   full due process has been provided during the original adjudication on the merits that determined the parties' substantive rights and obligations.

Because the Due Process Clause does not require that this broad statutory language be cabined by a jurisdictional limitation, \"any ... district\" includes districts in which personal jurisdiction over judgment debtors may be lacking. As a result, the Washington Judgment was not void for lack of jurisdiction, and the district court erred by vacating the Second Arizona Judgment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED and REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Defendants point out that Fidelity's registration of the California Judgment in Washington was not for the purpose of enforcing the judgment in Washington, but rather for the purpose of creating a new judgment that could subsequently be registered in Arizona and thus provide an end-run around Arizona's statute of limitations on the enforcement of judgments. Defendants' argument that imposing a jurisdictional requirement for registration under \u00a7 1963 is appropriate simply because, as applied to the facts of this case, such a requirement would not contravene the statute's underlying purpose of facilitating enforcement in the state of registration and would close a seeming loophole, is unpersuasive.
