ENGELHARDT, Circuit Judges:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Supreme Court over several years has developed protection from civil liability for persons going about their tasks as government workers in the form of immunity; not the absolute immunity enjoyed by prosecutors and judges, but a qualified immunity. Today we again repair to issues inherent in the qualification. The doctrine protects at the earliest stage of litigation at which the defense's application is determinable. To that end, courts have developed procedures and pretrial practices, including appellate review of pretrial denials, otherwise interlocutory and unappealable, and a reply to an answer under Rule 7(a) on order of the district court, particularized to address the defense of immunity in a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. When those processes do not yield pretrial resolution, as with competing factual narratives, the full reach of qualified immunity gives way to a trial, the first point at which its application is determinable. And in obeisance to constitutional mandate, the worker's defense enjoys a right to the protection of a jury-long a bastion interposed between the state and person, and assured by the Founders. And it signifies that today the district judge has multiple ways to present fully the claims and defenses to a jury to ensure the government\n   worker a full draw upon his immunity defense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   including resolution of the competing factual narratives, one of which-or a meld of both-may foreclose liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, police officers from Sachse, Texas argue that the district court should have sustained their defense of qualified immunity on their pretrial motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. Ryan Cole and his parents Karen and Randy (collectively \"the Coles\") sue Officer Carl Carson, Lieutenant Martin Cassidy, and Officer Michael Hunter of the Sachse Police Department under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Coles allege that the officers violated Ryan Cole's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights during an incident in which Cassidy and Hunter shot Ryan without warning, and then lied about what happened. The officers filed dispositive pretrial motions in the district court, asserting the defense of qualified immunity. The district court denied these motions, concluding that immunity could not be determined at this stage of the proceeding. In\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   , a panel of our court affirmed the denial of summary judgment as to the Coles' Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim and the denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourteenth Amendment false-charge claim, but reversed denials of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourth Amendment and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims attacking the alleged fabrication of evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court vacated\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   , and remanded for consideration in light of its intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Mullenix v. Luna\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the panel affirmed the denial of summary judgment as to the excessive-force claim. Because the Coles' other claims were unaffected by the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   , the panel reinstated\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   's holdings on the fabrication-of-evidence claims. We reheard this case en banc to reconsider disposition of the Coles' excessive-force claim in light of\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We conclude that it will be for a jury, and not judges, to resolve the competing factual narratives as detailed in the district court opinion and the record as to the Coles' excessive-force claim. Limited by our jurisdiction to the materiality of factual disputes, we AFFIRM the denial of summary judgment on this claim and DISMISS Cassidy and Hunter's appeal. The Coles' remaining claims are unaffected by the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   , and so, as in\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   , we AFFIRM denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourteenth Amendment false-charge claim; REVERSE denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourth Amendment and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   fabrication-of-evidence claims based on qualified immunity; and return the case to the district court for trial and resolution of issues consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 25, 2010, at around 10:30 a.m., the Sachse Police Department called\n   available units to the neighboring town of Garland, Texas. There police were searching for Ryan Cole, a seventeen-year-old white male, reported to be walking in the neighborhood with a handgun. Officer Michael Hunter responded by proceeding immediately to the Garland neighborhood. In a statement given on the day of the incident, Hunter related that on arriving in the neighborhood, he overheard a civilian stating that Ryan had given up one of his guns, and that he had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ryan to not keep his handgun. Hunter searched the area, and saw two officers following Ryan, who was walking away from them holding his gun to his head, approaching a wooded area along Highway 78. Although told by officers that things were under control, Hunter volunteered to go behind the wooded area and possibly intercept Ryan, and suggested that Officer Carl Carson, who was also present, join him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Four years later, after this litigation had commenced, Hunter for the first time recalled that the civilian he had overheard had described an altercation with Ryan in which Ryan had threatened him. He also then for the first time recalled hearing police-radio transmissions indicating that officers were protecting nearby schools because of \"[Ryan]'s dangerous conduct which posed a risk of serious harm to a great many innocent in the vicinity.\" Hunter otherwise learned nothing \"that would cause [him] to believe [Ryan] was violent or wanted to hurt anyone.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hunter understood that Ryan was suicidal, and, four years after the incident, he also raised the possibility that Ryan was using suicide as a pretext to evade the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Meanwhile, Lieutenant Martin Cassidy had also heard the original dispatcher's summons. Cassidy called the Sachse Police Department for more information. On the day of the incident, Cassidy swore that he learned \"this subject had shown up at [a] residence with a handgun and had just recently been seen walking away.\" But, four years later, after this litigation had commenced, like Hunter, Cassidy remembered learning more, including that Ryan \"had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to take his gun\"; had refused an order to drop his weapon; and might be headed for Sachse High School \"to possibly engage in violence.\" Cassidy also decided to intercept Ryan on Highway 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The three officers separately arrived at the side of Highway 78 at around the same time. Hunter parked his motorbike and drew his duty weapon; Cassidy also drew his firearm and advised Carson to be ready to use his taser. The officers started walking along the tree line. A steep embankment rose from railroad tracks to the area along Highway 78. Ryan would have to climb this embankment to approach the tree line. Cassidy and Hunter used both the edge of the embankment and the vegetation to conceal themselves as they walked. Hunter also removed his white motorcycle helmet in order to be less conspicuous. Cassidy soon heard a message over the police radio: Ryan was ascending to the tree line. Hunter heard movement in the brush, and signaled to his colleagues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   What occurred next is disputed. Viewing the summary judgment evidence and drawing reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant Coles, the district court determined that a reasonable jury could find the following: Ryan backed out from the tree line in front of Hunter and Cassidy, \"unaware of the Officers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   presence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ryan was holding his handgun pointed to his own head, where it remained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[Ryan] never pointed a weapon at the Officers,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"never made a threatening or provocative gesture towards [the] Officers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Officers [Cassidy and Hunter] had the time and opportunity to give a warning\" for Ryan to disarm himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the officers provided \"no warning ... that granted [Ryan] a sufficient time to respond,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   such that Ryan \"was not given an opportunity to disarm himself before he was shot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hunter and Cassidy then shot Ryan multiple times. Officer Hunter's first shot struck Ryan as he was oriented away from the officers at a 90-degree angle-that is, he was not facing Officer Hunter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following impact of the first shot, as Ryan's body turned or fell towards Hunter, he shot him a second time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an involuntary reflex to being shot, Ryan pulled the trigger, shooting himself in his temple.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the officers did not know that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the shooting, the three officers remained together at the scene. The Coles allege that during this time the officers conspired to insulate Cassidy and Hunter from liability with a fabricated narrative in which Ryan was facing Hunter and pointed his weapon at the officer, at which point Cassidy and Hunter fired on Ryan in defense. Eventually, members of the Garland Police Department arrived and took control of the scene, but did not follow the standard procedure of separating witnesses to ensure independent recollections. Instead, Cassidy and Hunter were allowed to return to their police station together. Later that day, the officers provided statements to investigators. Hunter stated that he had no chance to issue a command to Ryan. Cassidy and Carson, however, swore that, when Ryan backed out from the brush, they heard Hunter shout a warning to him. Hunter and Cassidy stated that Ryan then turned towards Hunter and pointed his handgun at Hunter, at which point both officers-fearing for Hunter's life-opened fire defensively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Dallas County District Attorney presented the officers' narrative to a grand jury, which no-billed the officers and charged Ryan with felony aggravated assault of a public servant. As a result of the charge, Ryan, incapacitated in intensive care, was placed under house arrest. About a month after the indictment, investigators\n   received a ballistics report from the crime lab. The ballistics analysis, taken together with stippling observed around Ryan's head wound, made clear that Ryan had shot himself in the temple, confounding the officers' account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dallas County prosecutors then dropped the aggravated assault charge, accepting Ryan's plea to misdemeanor unlawful carry of a weapon, a $ 500 fine, and forfeiture of his handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ryan suffered permanent injuries, including cognitive impairment, partial paralysis, and other serious mental and physical disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Coles brought, inter alia, four Section 1983 claims against the officers. First, they allege a violation of Ryan's Fourth Amendment right against the use of excessive force arising from the shooting. Second, the Coles allege a violation of Ryan's Fourteenth Amendment right against the imposition of false charges arising from the fabrication of evidence. Third, they allege a violation of Ryan's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures arising from the fabrication of evidence. Fourth, they allege a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation arising from the fabrication of evidence. The officers filed a motion to dismiss these claims under Rule 12(b)(6), asserting qualified immunity defenses. The district court denied the motion in a January 2014 Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carson alone appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' three fabrication-of-evidence claims based on qualified immunity. The district court stayed these fabrication-of-evidence claims pending Carson's appeal, allowing the Coles limited discovery against Cassidy and Hunter's qualified immunity defenses to the excessive-force claim. With that discovery complete, the two officers moved for summary judgment, rearguing qualified immunity. The district court denied their motion and Cassidy and Hunter appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The officers' appeals were consolidated. In 2015, in\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   , a panel of this court affirmed the district court's denial of summary judgment on the Coles' excessive-force claim, affirmed denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourteenth Amendment false-charge claim, and reversed the denial as to the Coles' Fourth Amendment and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   fabrication-of-evidence claims, finding the qualified immunity defense applicable for these claims. The officers petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. In November 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the panel's judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Mullenix v. Luna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   decided in the intervening time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On remand from the Supreme Court, recognizing that its jurisdiction was limited to determining the materiality of factual disputes that the district court determined were genuine, the panel once again held that the applicability of qualified immunity for Cassidy and Hunter could not be determined at the summary judgment stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding the Supreme Court's remand order reached no further, the panel reinstated the\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   opinion on the Coles' three fabrication-of-evidence claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers moved for rehearing en banc, which we granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We hear this case on remand from the Court for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   . We do not reach issues unaddressed by the mandate on remand,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and so we hold as in\n   <em>\n    Cole I\n   </em>\n   with respect to the Coles' three fabrication-of-evidence claims. First, we affirm the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' Fourteenth Amendment claim regarding the imposition of false charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, finding qualified immunity applicable, we reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' claim that the alleged fabrication of evidence violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, finding qualified immunity applicable, we reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss the Coles' claim that the alleged fabrication of evidence entailed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The qualified immunity inquiry includes two parts. In the first we ask whether the officer's alleged conduct has violated a federal right; in the second we ask whether the right in question was \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violation, such that the officer was on notice of the unlawfulness of his or her conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officer is entitled to qualified immunity if there is no violation, or if the conduct did not violate law clearly established at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On an appeal of a denial of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, our jurisdiction is limited to examining the materiality of factual disputes the district court determined were genuine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[I]n an interlocutory appeal we cannot challenge the district court's assessments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence-that is, the question whether there is enough evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]e lack jurisdiction to resolve the genuineness of any factual disputes\" and \"consider only whether the district court erred in assessing the legal significance of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like the district court, we must view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and ask whether the defendant would be entitled to qualified immunity on those facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has summarily reversed this court for failing to take the evidence and draw factual inferences in the non-movants' favor at the summary judgment stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the Court emphasized that the requirement is no less binding \"even when ... a court decides only the clearly-established prong of the standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Within the limited scope of our inquiry, review is de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As instructed, we turn to the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the Court reviewed a denial of qualified immunity to an officer who had shot and killed a fugitive in a car chase. This court had decided that the officer violated the clearly established rule that deadly force was prohibited \"against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officer in\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   reasonably perceived some threat of harm, but we had held the threat was not \"sufficient.\" The Supreme Court reversed our decision. It found that the rule we articulated lacked a referent to define the \"sufficiency\" of threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Precedents provided a \"hazy legal backdrop,\" at best.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given these deficient sources, an officer could not reasonably derive an applicable rule to govern his or her conduct in the situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding that we had defined the applicable rule with too much \"generality,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court reversed our holding that the officer had violated clearly established law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   , application of clearly established law is undertaken with close attention to the relevant legal rule and the particular facts of the case. Here, based on the facts taken in the light most favorable to the non-movant Coles, and\n   with reasonable inferences drawn in their favor, the district court determined there were genuine factual disputes as to Ryan's and the officers' conduct, upon which a reasonable jury could find \"[Ryan] ... did not pose an immediate threat to the officers\" when they opened fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   It held that \"on October 25, 2010, the date of the shooting, the law was clearly established\" that \"shooting a mentally disturbed teenager, who was pointing a gun the entire time at his own head and facing away from the officer, in an open outdoor area, and who was unaware of the officer's presence because no warning was given prior to the officer opening fire, was unlawful.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we will detail, the officers ask us to consider a different set of facts, but we cannot do so. We lack jurisdiction to reconsider the district court's factual determinations on an appeal from denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   announced the principle that the use of deadly force is permitted only to protect the life of the shooting officer or others: \"Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   also requires a warning before deadly force is used \"where feasible,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   a critical component of risk assessment and de-escalation. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that this rule can be sufficient in obvious cases, and this court has applied it in such cases, without dependence on the fact patterns of other cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The summary judgment facts, as determined by the district court, are that Ryan posed no threat to the officers or others to support firing without warning. The \"Officers had the time and opportunity to give a warning and yet chose to shoot first instead.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is an obvious case. Indeed, Officer Hunter conceded that he would have had no basis to fire upon Ryan unless Ryan had been facing him and pointing a gun at him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case is obvious when we accept the facts as we must. It is also informed by our precedent. Before 2010,\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Putnal\n   </em>\n   established clearly that Cassidy's and Hunter's conduct-on the facts as we must take them at this stage-was unlawful. For in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , members of the public told Officer Michael Putnal, a police officer patrolling a crowded Galveston beach area during spring break, that \"someone had entered the crowd with a pistol-gripped shotgun.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minutes later, Officer Putnal heard gunfire and saw the crowd scurrying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was \"a good deal of confusion on the beach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two people directed the officer to a car in which the\n   gunman was supposedly sitting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Putnal then saw Wendell Baker Jr. and another man sitting in a truck parked on the beach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties disputed what happened next. Putnal stated he saw Baker loading a magazine into a handgun, that he warned Baker to freeze or drop the gun, that Baker instead turned the gun upon Putnal, at which point Putnal fired, killing Baker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, witnesses \"state[d] that [Baker] took no threatening action ... as the officer approached the truck,\" that Putnal issued no warning to Baker, and that \"Baker ... may have barely had an opportunity to see Putnal before [the officer] fired his gun.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties did not dispute that Putnal had been searching for a gunman, and that a gun had been recovered from Baker's seat, although they disputed whether and how Baker had been holding it, that is, whether he pointed it at Putnal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was also undisputed that Baker was turning to face Putnal from his seat, although medical reports indicated from \"the nature of the wounds ... that Baker ... was not facing Putnal when he was shot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baker's survivors sued the officer, bringing, inter alia, a Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted Putnal qualified immunity, crediting his account that he had fired in response to Baker turning and aiming the gun at him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, we reversed and remanded the excessive-force claim for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recognizing the dispute as to the officer's warning, Baker's turn, and the position of Baker's gun, we found \"simply too many factual issues to permit the Bakers' \u00a7 1983 claims to be disposed of on summary judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Chaos on the beach and Baker['s] mere motion to turn and face Putnal are not compelling reasons to find that [the officer's] use of force was not excessive as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewing the facts and drawing inferences \"in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\" we held that \"[t]he number of shots and the nature of the wounds raise ... more of a question of fact than a court may dispose of on summary judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Supreme Court's more recent qualified immunity decisions do not shift this analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Kisela v. Hughes\n   </em>\n   , police officers in Tucson, Arizona responded to a call that a woman was behaving erratically with a knife and that she had been hacking at a tree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   When officers arrived on scene, the suspect, Amy Hughes, emerged from a house holding a large kitchen knife, and approached to within \"striking distance\" of a bystander in the driveway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of the officers, Andrew Kisela, whose further approach was impeded by a chain-link fence, repeatedly ordered Hughes to drop the knife, but Hughes did not follow his commands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kisela then fired on Hughes\n   through the fence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hughes brought a Section 1983 excessive force claim against Kisela.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reviewing a denial of qualified immunity to Kisela, the Supreme Court held that, in light of the officer's limited knowledge of the situation and Hughes's refusal to follow his repeated commands to drop the knife while within striking distance of the bystander-obstinance that heightened the risk of immediate harm to another-the law did not clearly establish that the officer's resort to deadly force was unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this case, Officers Cassidy and Hunter found themselves in a search for a suicidal teenager who they knew had already encountered fellow officers and walked away from them with his gun to his head, non-responsive, but without aggressive action. The circumstances of the officers' encounter with Ryan, as in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , remain heavily disputed: as to whether Ryan was aware of the officers, whether and how he turned and aimed his gun, and whether Hunter warned Ryan to disarm himself. The district court here defined the facts in a 21-page opinion, finding genuine disputes regarding these facts, and, viewing these disputes in a light most favorable to the Coles, concluded that a reasonable jury could find that Ryan made no threatening or provocative gesture to the officers and posed no immediate threat to them. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   , where the officer repeatedly warned an armed suspect to disarm, yet that suspect, facing the officer and hearing his warnings, refused to disarm, here the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could find Cassidy and Hunter opened fire upon Ryan without warning, even though it was feasible. On these facts, the officers' conduct violates clearly established law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Rather than engage on the facts as we must take them at the summary judgment stage, the officers repeatedly argue from a different set of facts. While the district court found that Ryan was initially facing away from the officers when they fired the first shot, the officers now describe his \"armed turn towards Officer Hunter.\" While the district court found that Ryan kept his gun aimed at his own head and never pointed it at the officers, the officers now suggest that Ryan's gun was \"below his head,\" moving towards Hunter, and then only momentarily turned back towards Ryan's head at the moment he fired (ignoring Hunter's sworn statement that he fired only when the gun was pointed toward him-a story prosecutors accepted until a ballistics report exposed its impossibility). And although the district court found that Ryan was not given an opportunity to disarm himself, the officers contend that he was warned to disarm before being shot. \"Had the Officers delayed longer, reaction time lag would have precluded their ability to stop [Ryan] from shooting Officer Hunter,\" they argue. Based on this alternative set of facts, echoed again in oral argument to us as a full court, and in the teeth of those found by the district court, the officers now contend Ryan posed a \"deadly threat,\" and no clearly established law in 2010 put the officers' response of firing in self-defense beyond the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Coles and amicus Cato Institute are correct that it is beyond our jurisdiction to consider the officers' set of facts, a narrative evolving over time. \"[I]f an excessive force claim turns on which of two conflicting stories best captures what happened on the street,\" the caselaw \"will not permit summary judgment in favor of the defendant\n   official. ... [A] trial must be had.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whereas the officers will have a chance to present their factual narrative-and to question the Coles'-at trial, they cannot contest the facts in the current appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The dissents also take issue with the disputed facts. Judge Duncan focuses on what he terms \"undisputed pre-encounter events.\" But, particularly in light of the officers' evolving stories, it is disputed whether any of the events recounted were known to Hunter or Cassidy when they fired on Ryan. The dissent cites to the reports and affidavits of other officers and individuals to describe the events occurring before Hunter and Cassidy were called to the scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   But looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Coles, Hunter and Cassidy were not aware of the disturbance at the Coles' house the previous night, the alleged cache of weapons left at the Reeds' house, Ryan's alleged suicidal threat, or his threat to shoot anyone who came near him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   And of course, what matters is what the defendant officers knew when they shot Ryan.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    White v.

The majority state this is an \"obvious case\" for the denial of qualified immunity: the officers could not shoot without first announcing themselves to Cole or looking down the barrel of his gun. What is so obvious? Contrary to the majority's dangerously unrealistic proposition, \"action beats reaction\" every time.\n   <em>\n    Ontiveros v.

Neither we nor the Supreme Court has ever held that police officers confronted in close quarters with a suspect armed and ready to shoot must hope they are faster on the draw and more accurate.

The Current Majority Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Pivoting yet again, the en banc majority opinion commences with a paean to \"the worker's ... right to the protection of a jury,\" not even bothering to cite Supreme Court authorities that explain why qualified immunity is immunity from suit, not just liability. The majority opinion omits or ignores material undisputed facts recited above-the knowledge of the officers, Cole's turning toward them, the significance of his finger in a loaded pistol, and the three to five second interval-and hides behind the assertion that, relevant to qualified immunity, there are \"genuine factual disputes as to Ryan's and the officers' conduct\" such that a reasonable jury could find that Cole posed no \"immediate threat\" to the officers or others. Two paragraphs later, asserting that Cole posed \"no threat ... to support firing without warning,\" the majority deem this an \"obvious case\" for denial of immunity, because the \"officers had time and opportunity to give a warning and yet chose to shoot first instead.\" The \"obvious case\" rationale again derives, in the majority's view, from\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , fortified only by one Fifth Circuit case and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kisela v Hughes\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The only legal question that needs to be addressed by this court is whether, under the circumstances of this five-second confrontation,\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   reasonable police officer would have reasonably perceived\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   life-threatening danger such that deadly force could be used to incapacitate Cole without a preliminary warning. Put otherwise, as a matter of law, was it clearly established that officers may not fire on a suspect, armed and ready to shoot a pistol, who is turning in their direction with one of their brethren ten to twenty feet away, unless the gun barrel points at them or they first shout a warning and await his response?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The majority deny qualified immunity, seeming to answer on the basis of \"disputed fact issues\" that Cole posed \"no threat.\" The majority's reasoning is at too high a level of generality. And the majority ignore the critical criterion for qualified immunity in Fourth Amendment cases: the reasonableness of the officers' reasonable perceptions. In sum, the majority here double down on the mistakes that got our court reversed in\n   <em>\n    Mullenix\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Before discussing these problems in detail, it is necessary to recapitulate the reasoning behind the Supreme Court's qualified immunity cases. The majority's bare mention of the standards for qualified immunity ignores the Court's rationale for the defense. Beginning with\n   <em>\n    Monroe v. Pape\n   </em>\n   in 1961, the Supreme Court unleashed federal courts to enforce constitutional commands against state actors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monroe v.

A foreseeable consequence of facilitating such lawsuits was that a deluge of litigation would follow, at least some of it ill-founded or frivolous. What was to be done to limit claims to those that might have merit? The Court decided in\n   <em>\n    Pierson v.

The devastating costs imposed by unfounded lawsuits on officers otherwise entitled to immunity are reputational, potentially employment-related, financial and emotional.

Unfortunately, the majority here has fallen into the trap of \"letting the jury sort out the truth\" despite the gravity of the situation these officers faced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    As explained above, it is undisputed that the two officers confronted and then shot at Cole as he emerged from dense bushes ten to twenty feet from Officer Hunter, unaware of their presence, and began to turn in their direction. This all happened within three to five seconds. While he turned, Cole held a loaded 9mm semiautomatic pistol, finger on the trigger, pointed in the direction of his own head. The officers knew he was mentally distraught, had ignored other police commands to disarm, had issued threats, and proceeded walking in the direction of nearby schools.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    For immunity purposes, the question phrased one way is whether\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    reasonable officers could have believed that Cole's split-second turning toward them posed a life-threatening danger such that lethal force was necessary. Alternatively, what \"clearly established law\" held as of October 2010 that under all of the relevant circumstances, deadly force was not justified unless either a warning was given and the suspect allowed a chance to react, or the suspect actually turned his loaded pistol on the officer? The answer here directly parallels the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    , which the majority seriously shortchanged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    , this court had denied qualified immunity to a trooper whose shot fatally wounded a suspect fleeing police in a high-speed chase. The Supreme Court's basic criticism of the panel decision was this: \"In this case, the Fifth Circuit held that Mullenix violated the clearly established rule that a police officer may not use deadly force against a fleeing felon who does not pose a sufficient threat of harm to the officer or others. Yet this Court has previously considered-and rejected-almost that exact formulation of the qualified immunity question in the Fourth Amendment context.\"\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

But in\n    <em>\n     Mullenix,\n    </em>\n    the Supreme Court reversed this court because \"[t]he general principle that deadly force requires a sufficient threat hardly settles this matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 309.

Indeed, in describing its holding at the outset,\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    states only that \"[deadly] force may not be used unless it is necessary to prevent the escape [of an apparently unarmed suspected felon] and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/\">\n     471 U.S. at 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 105 S.

Whether, under the material undisputed facts, Cole presented \"no threat\" to a reasonable police officer is the relevant issue to assess a Fourth Amendment violation. But the immunity question, which the majority elides, is whether\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    reasonable officer in this\n    factual context would have known he could not use deadly force.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pearson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n     555 U.S. at 232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n     129 S.

In this case, if Officer Hunter had stood a hundred feet away from Cole, or Cole had not been turning toward the officers, or Cole had put the handgun in his pocket and wasn't touching it, the analysis of qualified immunity could be quite different. Third, describing a situation as posing \"no threat\" is a conclusion, not an explanation or, as the majority seems to think, an exception to defining clearly established law in a specific context. No doubt there are rare \"obvious\" cases of Fourth Amendment violations committed by officers who are plainly incompetent or who knowingly violate the law. In the wide gap between acceptable and excessive uses of force, however, immunity serves its important purpose of encouraging officers to enforce the law, in \"tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving\" split-second situations, rather than stand down and jeopardize community safety.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In their sole, erroneous dependence on\n    <em>\n     Garner,\n    </em>\n    the majority, \"can cite no case from [the Supreme] Court denying qualified immunity because officers [entitled to apprehend Cole] selected one dangerous alternative over another.\"\n    <em>\n     Mullenix,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

In\n    <em>\n     Sheehan\n    </em>\n    , officers used deadly force to subdue a mentally ill woman during an armed confrontation. The Court restated that the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police officers, with the benefit of hindsight, may have made some mistakes, because \"[t]he Constitution is not blind to 'the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments.' \"\n    <em>\n     Sheehan,\n    </em>\n    135 S.

In\n    <em>\n     White\n    </em>\n    , the Court chastised the lower court for \"misunderst[anding]\" the \"clearly\n    established\" analysis by relying on the generalized pronouncements in\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 552.

There is a world of difference between three minutes and three seconds, which Officer Hunter had here, and between Officer White's securing himself behind a stone wall fifty feet from the suspect and Officer Hunter's standing fully exposed only ten to twenty feet away from Cole.

Ct. at 1152. A decision holding only that there was no \"clearly established law\" cannot itself have defined \"clearly established law.\" The Court also criticized the Ninth Circuit for failing to implement correctly the rule that an officer has not \"violated a clearly established right unless the right's contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant's shoes would have understood that he was violating it.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1153 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court catalogued all the relevant circumstances of the confrontation that provoked the shooting: a knife-armed, threatening suspect, whose bizarre behavior had been called in to 911, disobeyed officers' commands to disarm for up to one minute before they felt compelled to shoot.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . The Court concluded, \"[t]his is far from an obvious case in which any competent officer would have known that shooting Hughes to protect [the third party] would violate the Fourth Amendment.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .

The hitch in these particular cases is that there wasn't actually a weapon, yet the officer's objectively reasonable perception was determinative as a matter of law. In another such officer shooting case, this court upheld qualified immunity where the suspect, who was being interrogated for drunk driving at the side of a freeway, turned to walk away from the officer, then appeared to turn around toward him while reaching under his shirttail for what the officer thought could be a concealed weapon.\n    <em>\n     Salazar-Limon v.

An officer may be forced into shooting an unarmed suspect by a\n    <em>\n     Manis\n    </em>\n    act, and thus obtain qualified immunity.

Cole's case, in contrast, does not involve a \"chaos on the beach\" incident. The undisputed facts are starkly different here.

The majority's \"clearly established\" rule has changed, but not its errors.\n    <em>\n     Tennessee v.

The majority's \"no threat\" and \"obvious case\" statements pose the issues here at an excessive level of generality. The majority has no Supreme Court case law demonstrating that Officers Hunter and Cassidy were either plainly incompetent or had to know that shooting at Cole was unconstitutional under the circumstances before them and with the knowledge they possessed-he was mentally distraught; he was armed with his finger in the pistol's trigger; he was very close to Hunter; he had been walking in the direction of schools for which extra police protection had been ordered; and he had ignored other officers' commands to stop and drop his weapon. And they had three to five seconds to decide how dangerous he could be to them. The majority cites not one case from this court denying qualified immunity under similar circumstances.\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    aptly summed it up for our purposes: \"qualified immunity protects actions in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

WILLETT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    I repeat what I said last month: The entrenched, judge-invented qualified immunity regime ought not be immune from thoughtful reappraisal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Qualified immunity strikes an uneasy, cost-benefit balance between two competing deterrence concerns: \"the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    By insulating incaution,\n    the doctrine formalizes a rights-remedies gap through which untold constitutional violations slip unchecked. The real-world functioning of modern immunity practice-essentially \"heads government wins, tails plaintiff loses\"-leaves many victims violated but not vindicated. More to the point, the \"clearly established law\" prong, which is outcome-determinative in most cases, makes qualified immunity sometimes seem like unqualified impunity: \"letting public officials duck consequences for bad behavior-no matter how palpably unreasonable-as long as they were the\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n    to behave badly.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    That said, as a middle-management circuit judge, I take direction from the Supreme Court. And the Court's direction on qualified immunity is increasingly unsubtle. We must respect the Court's exacting instructions-even as it is proper, in my judgment, to respectfully voice unease with them.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    While this bar is not insurmountable, it is sky-high. And it is raised higher when courts leapfrog prong one (deciding whether the challenged behavior violates the Constitution) to reach simpler prong two: no factually analogous precedent. Merely proving unconstitutional misconduct isn't enough. A plaintiff must cite functionally identical authority that puts the unlawfulness \"beyond debate\" to \"every\" reasonable officer.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Last month, for example, the Eleventh Circuit, noting no \"materially similar case\" (thus no \"clearly established law\"), granted immunity to a police officer who fired at a family's dog but instead shot a 10-year-old child lying face-down 18 inches from the officer.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Not only that, the court \"expressly [took] no position\" as to \"whether a constitutional violation occurred in the first place.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Translation: If the same officer tomorrow shoots the same child while aiming at the same dog, he'd receive the same immunity.\n    <em>\n     Ad infinitum\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The Supreme Court demands precedential specificity. But it's all a bit recursive. There's no earlier similar case declaring a constitutional violation because no earlier plaintiff could find an earlier similar case declaring a constitutional violation. \" Section 1983 meets Catch-22. Plaintiffs must produce precedent even as fewer courts are producing precedent. Important constitutional questions go unanswered precisely because no one's answered them before. Courts then rely on that judicial silence to conclude there's no equivalent case on the books. No precedent = no clearly established law = no liability. An Escherian Stairwell.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    In recent years, individual Justices have raised concerns with the Court's immunity caselaw.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Even so, the doctrine enjoys resounding, even hardening favor at the Court. Just three months ago, in a case involving the warrantless strip search of a four-year-old preschooler, a strange-bedfellows array of scholars and advocacy groups-perhaps the most ideologically diverse amici ever assembled-implored the Court to push reset.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    To no avail. This much is certain: Qualified immunity, whatever its success at achieving its intended policy goals, thwarts the righting of many constitutional wrongs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Perhaps the growing left-right consensus urging reform will one day win out. There are several \"mend it, don't end it\" options. The Court could revisit\n    <em>\n     Pearson\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    and nudge courts to address the threshold constitutional merits rather than leave the law undeveloped.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Even if a particular plaintiff cannot benefit (due to the \"clearly established law\" prong), this would provide moving-forward guidance as to what the law prescribes and proscribes. Short of that, the Court could require lower courts to explain\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    they are side-stepping the constitutional merits question.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    Or the Court could confront the widespread inter-circuit confusion on what constitutes \"clearly established law.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    One concrete proposal: clarifying the degree of factual similarity required in cases involving split-second decisions versus cases involving less-exigent situations. The Court could also, short of undoing\n    <em>\n     Harlow\n    </em>\n    and reinstating the bad-faith prong, permit plaintiffs to overcome immunity by presenting\n    <em>\n     objective\n    </em>\n    evidence of an official's bad faith.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Not\n    <em>\n     subjective\n    </em>\n    evidence of bad faith, which\n    <em>\n     Harlow\n    </em>\n    , worried about \"peculiarly disruptive\" and \"broad-ranging discovery,\" forbids.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    And not unadorned\n    <em>\n     allegations\n    </em>\n    of bad faith. But objective evidence that the official actually realized that he was violating the Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Prudent refinements abound. But until then, as Judge Jones explains in today's principal dissent, the Supreme Court's unflinching, increasingly emphatic application of \"clearly established law\" compels dismissal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    III\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    I remain convinced that contemporary immunity jurisprudence merits \"a refined procedural approach that more smartly-and fairly-serves its intended objectives.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    Yet I also remain convinced that a majority of the Supreme Court disagrees. My misgivings, I believe, are well advised. But we would be ill advised to treat the reform of immunity doctrine as something for this court rather than that Court.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    JAMES C.

In\n    <em>\n     Brosseau\n    </em>\n    , an officer shot an\n    <em>\n     unarmed\n    </em>\n    man who refused to open his truck window. In\n    <em>\n     Kisela\n    </em>\n    , officers shot a woman who was hacking a tree with a kitchen knife. In\n    <em>\n     Sheehan\n    </em>\n    , officers shot an old woman holding a kitchen knife in an assisted-living facility. In all of these cases, the Court held the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Third, this is\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    all over again.

An officer fatally shot Garner in the back of the head as he attempted to climb a fence. Our court then extended\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    to Mullenix's case-which involved a man who led police on a high-speed car chase after violating his probation. A state trooper attempted to end the chase by shooting the speeding car's engine block-but he missed the engine, hit the driver in the face, and killed him.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Luna\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315686\" index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/712/\">\n     773 F.3d at 719-20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    ). The Supreme Court summarily reversed us because-as should be painfully obvious from the Court's serial reversals in this area-that's not how qualified immunity works.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

And they GVR'd us\n    <em>\n     in this very case\n    </em>\n    to fix our mistakes in light of\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    .

Here, as in\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    , the majority attempts to rely on\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    to establish the governing rule of law. From\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    , the majority somehow divines a rule that an officer cannot shoot a mentally disturbed teenager holding a gun near his school. This is demonstrably erroneous. In fact, one thing that unites the Supreme Court's recent reversals in cases involving qualified immunity and excessive force is the attempt by lower courts to extrapolate\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    to new facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

Consider the supposed requirement that an officer take some sort of non-lethal measure before using lethal force. In\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    , our court used the power of 20-20 hindsight to say that a reasonable officer should have used spike strips to stop the chase.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315686\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/712/\">\n     773 F.3d at 720-21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Supreme Court emphatically rebuked us.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S. Ct. at 310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . They told us that an officer does not have to expose himself or other officers to\n    harm when the suspect has already refused to be disarmed. That meant Trooper Mullenix did not have to wait to see if the fleeing felon would shoot or run over the officer manning the spike strips.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     at 310-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    So too here. In this case, the majority complains that the officers did not provide sufficient warning. But there was no clearly established law requiring Officers Cassidy and Hunter to announce themselves-while caught in an open and defenseless position-and hope not to get shot. That is particularly true here because officers previously ordered Cole to put down his gun, he refused, and he threatened to kill anyone who attempted to disarm him.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    And in\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    , as here, we accused the police officers of being cowboys. Earlier on the day of the shooting, Trooper Mullenix received a negative performance review for \"not being proactive enough as a Trooper\"; so in the aftermath of the shooting, Mullenix said to his supervisor, \"How's that for proactive?\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4315686\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/712/\">\n     773 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    717 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

The panel opinions and en banc majority opinion in this case likewise seethe with innuendo that Officers Hunter and Cassidy were wannabe cowboys looking for a gunfight. We are in no position to make such accusations.

To quote the panel: \"Qualified immunity is a judicially created doctrine calculated to protect an officer from trial before a jury of his or her peers.

Or in the words of today's majority: \"The Supreme Court over several years has developed protection from civil liability for persons going about their tasks as government workers\" (a rather curious way to describe the men and women who swear an oath to protect our lives and communities).\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 446. But \"the worker's defense\" must yield, in cases like this, \"in obeisance to [the] constitutional mandate\" of a jury trial.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518780\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/905/334/#p337\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    We appreciate the majority's candor.

If we're not willing to re-evaluate all \u00a7 1983 precedents in a balanced and principled way, then it \"is perhaps just as well\" that \"[w]e find ourselves engaged ... in the essentially legislative activity of crafting a sensible scheme of qualified immunities for the statute we have invented-rather than applying the common law embodied in the statute that Congress wrote.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p611\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p611\">\n     at 611-12\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p611\">\n     118 S.Ct. 1584\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Translation: If we're not going to do it right, then perhaps we shouldn't do it at all.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Subjecting these officers to trial on originalist grounds is precisely the unprincipled practice of originalism that Justices Scalia and Thomas railed against. And not just for the procedural reasons they identified in\n    <em>\n     Crawford-El\n    </em>\n    . What about the original understanding of the Fourth Amendment, which the plaintiffs here invoke as their purported substantive theory of liability in this case? Does the majority seriously believe that it is an \"unreasonable seizure,\"\n    <em>\n     as those words were originally understood at the Founding\n    </em>\n    , for a police officer to stop an armed and mentally unstable teenager from shooting innocent officers, students, and teachers?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    And make no mistake: Principled originalism is not just a matter of intellectual precision and purity. There are profound practical consequences here as well, given the important and delicate balance that qualified immunity is supposed to strike. As the Supreme Court has explained, qualified immunity ensures that liability reaches only \"the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n    <em>\n     Mullenix\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12599545\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/305/\">\n     136 S.

Before the shooting, the defendant officers: (1) were tracking a distraught suspect wandering through the woods armed with a loaded 9mm semi-automatic handgun; (2) who had earlier that morning off-loaded a cache of weapons and ammunition at a friend's house; (3) who had already refused to give up his pistol when confronted by the police; and (4) who had threatened to \"shoot anyone who came near him.\" Cole did not dispute those facts and, indeed, convinced the district court they were irrelevant. Joining Judge Jones' dissent in full, I respectfully dissent on the additional grounds provided by these pre-encounter facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    No one doubts some of the events on October 25, 2010-when the officers violently encountered Cole in the woods near Garland, Texas-are disputed. The question is whether those disputes are\n    <em>\n     material\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bazan ex rel. Bazan v.

Judge Jones' dissent compellingly shows they are not: Resolving\n    all disputes in Cole's favor, the undisputed facts still show the officers violated no clearly established law.

First, the district court erred by excluding the undisputed events before the shooting. That error-based on a misreading of our precedent-truncated the qualified immunity analysis. That alone requires reversing the summary judgment denial. Second, in light of those pre-encounter facts, the majority's insistence that this is an \"obvious case\" collapses. Maj. at 453-54. Given what confronted the officers, the majority cannot say what they did was \"obviously\" unlawful.

But events began to unfold much earlier.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Around 2 a.m. that morning, Cole knocked on the door of his friend, Eric Reed Jr., to show him \"a 44 magnum revolver.\" Awakened by the knocking, Eric Jr.'s father (Eric Sr.) left his room, saw Cole with the gun, and told him to leave. Eric Jr. convinced Cole to leave the revolver because \"he [did not] need to be carrying a weapon around.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    Around 8 a.m., Eric Jr. gave his father Cole's gun. Eric Sr., a retired Sachse police officer, then notified Officer Vernon Doggett, who came to the Reeds'. Eric Jr. told his father and Doggett that \"[Cole] told him there were more guns on the side of the house.\" There, they found \"a double barrel shot gun with some shot gun shells and what appeared to be a plastic bag with 9mm bullets,\" which Doggett secured. Eric Jr. also explained Cole \"had broken up with his girlfriend and was going to kill himself and his girlfriend.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Doggett was a resource officer for Sachse High School, where Cole and his girlfriend attended. He contacted Sergeant Garry Jordan, told him about the guns, and asked to meet at the school. Doggett reported that Cole \"may be at school with a 9mm handgun.\" Another officer checked whether Cole was in class, and Jordan searched the parking areas for Cole.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Not finding him, Jordan went to Coles' and spoke to his parents. He learned that, the previous evening, officers had responded to a disturbance there. Officers had found Cole's father \"holding Ryan down\" because \"he did not want [Cole] to leave the residence with the pocket knife that he had.\" He said \"his son had a wild look in his eye and ... had been smoking K2.\" While the officers found there had been no assault, all agreed it was \"a good idea for Cole to stay the night with a friend.\" The Coles had not seen Ryan since then but reported he had \"apparently returned home during the night and had opened the gun safe, removed an unknown amount [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] of weapons, and reset the combination.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Meanwhile, Eric Jr. noticed Cole was back. He asked Cole if he was armed and Cole showed him a \"38 revolver\" and a \"9mm semiauto.\" He convinced Cole to give him the revolver, but Cole told him he was not \"getting the 9mm.\" Cole also said that the 9mm was loaded and that he did not \"wanna use it on [Eric Jr.]\" Cole stated that \"he would shoot anyone who came near him.\" Cole left, and Eric Jr. called his father, who called the police.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Around 10:49 a.m., Officer Stephen Norris radioed \"all available Sachse officers\" to respond to the area of the Reed residence. He reported Cole was \"observed running south of the location with 3 weapons, one a loaded 9mm.\" He also reported Cole was \"irate and distraught and stated he would shoot anyone who came near him.\" Around the same time, Sachse Officer Michael Hunter was dispatched to assist Jordan at the Coles', but on arrival he was told by Sachse Officer Carl Carson he was not needed. As Hunter was leaving, he heard Norris' call advising Cole was \"in the area ... with a gun.\" Hunter stated he \"did not know the specifics of the call at this point,\" but proceeded to the Reeds' residence. In response to Norris' call, Jordan also left the Coles'.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Sachse Officer Martin Cassidy also received Norris' dispatch and went to the area Norris indicated. He was given Cole's description and advised that Cole was \"armed with at least one handgun and possibly three.\" Cassidy spoke with Norris on the phone about \"the proximity of Armstrong Elementary School to the location where [Cole] was last seen.\" Cassidy therefore went to check on the school and a nearby shopping center for any signs of Cole.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Meanwhile, Hunter arrived at the Reeds', where he met Jordan and Carson. Hunter overheard Eric Jr. say he had gotten \"one gun\" from Cole but that Cole had left \"armed with a 9mm handgun.\" \"Hunter put [Cole's] description out to other officers,\" and then he and Carson went to search for Cole. After speaking with the officers, Eric Jr. checked for more guns and found \"6 firearms around [his] house.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Jordan then observed Officers Elliott and Sneed pass by in a patrol unit. Those officers found Cole nearby. Elliott reported that \"Sneed ... advised [Cole] to show his hands.\" Instead, Cole \"reached into his waist band and pulled a pistol and placed it to his head after about three steps and refused to obey Lt. Sneed['s] commands.\" When Jordan arrived, Sneed \"drew his duty weapon and yelled at [Cole] to drop the weapon,\" but Cole refused. As Cole continued eastbound towards Highway 78, Sneed \"warned [Cole] that [he] would shoot him in the back if he tried to get to the highway or walk toward any innocent bystanders.\" Cole \"would occasionally turn his head and yell obscenities at [Sneed].\" Two other officers then parked \"directly in front of [Cole's] path.\" To avoid them, Cole turned \"northbound and began walking the railroad tracks.\" Jordan was constantly updating dispatch about Cole's movements. \"Suddenly, [Sneed] observed [Cole] cut eastbound and run up a hill and into the brush towards Highway 78.\" Dispatch reported that Cole was \"off tracks coming through tree lines towards [Highway] 78.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Hunter, Carson, and Cassidy were monitoring Cole's movements from the dispatches. They arrived separately at the part of Highway 78 where Cole was thought to be. Hunter noted \"[Cole] appeared to be walking towards the railroad track,\" and he advised Carson \"[they] needed to go out to the highway and intercept [him].\" Cassidy advised Carson to get out his taser and follow Cassidy.

Jones Dissent at 463-64. But if we include the undisputed facts leading up to the shooting, the notion that this is an \"obvious case\" crumbles. To believe that, we would have to blind ourselves to the facts that (1) the officers were searching for an irate, distraught suspect; (2) who was wandering through the woods armed with a loaded semi-automatic handgun; (3) who had refused police demands to turn over his weapon; (4) who had just that morning deposited a cache of weapons and ammunition at his friend's house; and (5) who had threatened to \"shoot anyone who came near him.\" Those were the \"totality of the circumstances\" facing the officers,\n    <em>\n     Colston\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888419\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/96/#p100\">\n     130 F.3d at 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and they were not disputed by Cole or the district court. Given those circumstances, the officers might have taken any number of actions when they met Cole in the woods that morning-they might have warned him, or shot him, or shot in the air, or retreated, or remained frozen in place to see what he would do. But to say it is \"obvious\" what they should have done is to denude the concept of an \"obvious case\" of any meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Once stripped of the conceit that this is an \"obvious case,\" the majority has nothing left to justify its holding. The Supreme Court has bluntly told us that, outside the \"obvious case\" scenario, \"\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    ... do[es] not by [itself] create clearly established law[.]\"\n    <em>\n     White v.
