Gurule moved to suppress both the pistol and his subsequent confession as the products of an illegal search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted this motion, concluding Gurule had been unlawfully detained during the traffic stop and the officers lacked the necessary reasonable suspicion to frisk him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We reverse. We conclude the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they (1) reasonably detained Gurule and the other occupants of the car prior to the search; and (2) frisked Gurule after they observed a gun in his pocket and had otherwise developed the reasonable suspicion he might be armed and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the night of June 29, 2017, an officer from the West Valley City street crimes unit observed a sedan commit several traffic infractions. The officer initiated a traffic stop, and the car pulled into the parking lot of a nearby gas station. The parking lot was poorly lit, with a fence to the vehicles' right, the station to their left, and a darkened field beyond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The sedan contained three occupants-two in front and one in back. None possessed a valid driver's license, and the driver had accumulated multiple misdemeanor warrants, which she volunteered to the officer upon first contact. As the officer conducted a records check, one of his colleagues arrived to provide backup. Upon his arrival, the second officer made idle conversation with the occupants of the vehicle and focused primarily on securing the\n   scene. The sedan was outfitted with tinted windows and also contained a great deal of property, since the driver apparently was living out of her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After completing a records check, the driver was informed that a licensed driver was required to operate the vehicle lawfully. The officer also told the driver he would not arrest her if she revealed the presence of any contraband in the sedan. In response, she volunteered that the officers could search her vehicle to verify her claim that it contained nothing illegal. The officer confirmed her consent to the search and asked that she contact a licensed driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The officers then asked the vehicle's passengers to exit. Upon leaving the car, the front-seat passenger consented to a protective frisk. The officers then asked the back-seat passenger-Tommy Gurule-if they could also perform a protective frisk. Gurule twice told the officers that he would not consent to a search, and was directed to sit at a nearby curb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Gurule had initially engaged officers in a friendly manner-even volunteering that a bottle of alcohol in the sedan was his, so as not to incriminate the driver. As one officer asked repeatedly whether Gurule possessed any weapons, both officers began expressing concern that he was responding deceptively. Gurule disputed that he was acting uncooperatively and stated that he had no weapon. Unsatisfied with this response, one of the officers ordered Gurule to stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As Gurule began to stand, the other officer noted a visible bulge in Gurule's right-front pocket. That officer took hold of Gurule's right arm as a protective action. He then observed a gun in Gurule's right-front pocket. Both officers handcuffed Gurule before confiscating a pistol. Gurule's equivocal response to questioning about his criminal history prompted further investigation, which revealed a prior felony conviction. He was arrested and-in a post-arrest interview-confessed to knowingly possessing the pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gurule subsequently filed a motion to suppress both the firearm and his post-arrest statements, arguing they were fruits of an unlawful detention and search. After an evidentiary hearing at which both officers testified, the district court concluded Gurule should have been free to leave the scene on foot before the protective search. The district court also found that-even had Gurule's detention been lawful-the officers had not developed the requisite reasonable suspicion to frisk him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government contends that (1) the officers were permitted to detain Gurule until completion of the traffic stop; and (2) the protective search was lawful since-during the detention-officers developed reasonable suspicion that Gurule was armed and dangerous. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We accept the district court's factual findings \"unless they are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Gurule contends the search began when he was ordered to his feet and one officer grabbed hold of his right arm.

As previously noted, the officers did not frisk Gurule until after they had noticed an unusual bulge in Gurule's right-front pocket. As the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Mimms,\n   </em>\n   a visible and suspicious \"bulge\" in driver's pocket may alone \"permit[ ] the officer to conclude that [the suspect] was armed and thus posed a serious and present danger to the safety of the officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p108\">\n    434 U.S. at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p108\">\n    98 S.Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Gurule contends the district court made no factual finding that either officer noticed the bulge. But this claim ignores both uncontested testimony about what officers observed, as well as footage from both body cameras indicating a plainly-visible bulge.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 116-18. Moreover, the very fact that the officers asked repeatedly whether Gurule was carrying a weapon suggests contemporaneous concern that he was deceitful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The government also emphasizes the vulnerability that attends the act of turning one's back on multiple subjects while searching an unfamiliar vehicle. The very fact of a search creates a need to detain individuals safely.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Manjarrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9069034\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/881/#p886\">\n    348 F.3d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886-87 (10th Cir. 2003) (\"The purpose of the limited pat-down search is not to discover evidence of a crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.\") (citations and quotation marks omitted). Nor does the presence of an additional officer necessarily vitiate this concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082574\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/381/#p389\">\n    811 F.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (10th Cir. 2016) (\"[I]f [the defendant] harbored a desire to use his weapon against the officers, he may very well have used it regardless of whether the backup officer was keeping an eye on him. ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This danger is only heightened when at least one of the subjects has accumulated multiple arrest warrants. Officers are \"entitled to infer a common purpose or enterprise\" between drivers and passengers when one, as here, knows of the other's \"arrest warrants and would want to conceal evidence of any wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .

And the district court found-based on the testimony of one officer-that the vehicle's backseat contained a great deal of property. R. 63. The combination of these circumstances could reasonably lead officers to conclude they should exercise special caution in conducting the search, given the possibility that criminal activity was once again afoot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The time and the place of the traffic stop lastly contribute to the reasonableness of the pat-down search. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , we observed that \"the nature of the area in which a detention takes place is a relevant consideration in the [reasonable-suspicion] analysis.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275992\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/364/1185/#p1194\">\n    364 F.3d at 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The stop transpired at night, (10:30 PM), and the government emphasizes both the darkness of the gas-station parking lot, as well as the proximity of a darkened field just beyond where the vehicles had stopped. In addition, one officer observed that the general area \"regularly sees a high volume of drug activity as well as property crimes[,] including stolen vehicles.\" R. 108-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even had one officer not seen the gun in Gurule's right-front pocket, we conclude these circumstances-when taken together-would create the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify the frisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
