We do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Adree Edmo (formerly Mason Dean Edmo) is a male-to-female transgender prisoner in the custody of the Idaho Department of Correction (\"IDOC\"). Edmo's sex assigned at birth (male) differs from her gender identity (female). The incongruity causes Edmo to experience persistent distress so severe it limits her ability to function. She has twice attempted self-castration to remove her male genitalia, which cause her profound anguish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both sides and their medical experts agree: Edmo suffers from gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition. They also agree that the appropriate benchmark regarding treatment for gender dysphoria is the World Professional Association of Transgender Health Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (\"WPATH Standards of Care\"). And the State\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not seriously dispute that in certain circumstances, gender confirmation surgery (\"GCS\") can be a medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria. The parties' dispute centers around whether GCS is medically necessary for Edmo-a question we analyze with deference to the district court's factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following four months of intensive discovery and a three-day evidentiary hearing, the district court concluded that GCS is medically necessary for Edmo and ordered the State to provide the surgery. Its ruling hinged on findings individual to Edmo's medical condition. The ruling also rested on the finding that Edmo's medical experts testified persuasively that GCS was medically necessary, whereas testimony from the State's medical experts deserved little weight. In contrast to Edmo's experts, the State's witnesses lacked relevant experience, could not explain their deviations from generally accepted guidelines, and testified illogically and inconsistently in important ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court's detailed factual findings were amply supported by its careful review of the extensive evidence and testimony. Indeed, they are essentially unchallenged. The appeal boils down to a disagreement about the implications of the factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Crediting, as we must, the district court's logical, well-supported factual findings, we hold that the responsible prison authorities have been deliberately indifferent to Edmo's gender dysphoria, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The record before us, as construed by the district court, establishes that Edmo has a serious medical need, that the appropriate medical treatment is GCS, and that prison authorities have not provided that treatment despite full knowledge of Edmo's ongoing and extreme suffering and medical needs. In so holding, we reject the State's portrait of a reasoned disagreement between qualified medical professionals. We also emphasize that the analysis here is individual to Edmo and rests on the record in this case. We do not endeavor to project whether individuals in other cases will meet the threshold to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. The district court's order entering injunctive relief for Edmo is affirmed, with minor modifications noted below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our opinion proceeds as follows. In Part I, we provide background on gender dysphoria, the standard of care, and the evidence\n   considered and factual findings made by the district court. Part II explains why this appeal complies with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") and is not moot. In Part III, we turn to the gravamen of the appeal: Edmo's Eighth Amendment claim and showing of irreparable injury. Part IV addresses the State's challenges to the injunction's scope and narrows the injunction as to certain defendants. Part V rejects the State's objections to the procedure employed by the district court. We conclude in Part VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But those concerns need to be managed prior to, or concurrent with, treatment of a person's gender dysphoria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Coexisting medical or mental health issues resulting from a person's gender dysphoria are not an impediment under the fourth criterion. It may be difficult to determine, however, whether mental or medical health concerns result from the gender dysphoria or are unrelated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The WPATH Standards of Care explain that the sixth criterion-living for 12 months in an identity-congruent role-is intended to ensure that the person experiences the full range of \"different life experiences and events that may occur throughout the year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61. During that time, the patient should present consistently in her desired gender role.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Scientific studies show that the regret rate for individuals who undergo GCS is low, in the range of one to two percent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Osborne &amp; Lawrence,\n   <em>\n    Male Prison Inmates With Gender Dysphoria\n   </em>\n   , 45 Archives of Sexual Behav. at 1660; William Byne, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Report of the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Treatment of Gender Identity Disorder\n   </em>\n   , 41 Archives of Sexual Behav. 759, 780-81 (2012). The district court found, and the State does not dispute on appeal, that Edmo does not have any of the risk factors that would make her likely to regret GCS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    358 F.

The next update to the WPATH Standards of Care will likewise apply equally to incarcerated persons. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (\"NCCHC\"), a leading professional organization in health care delivery in the correctional context, endorses the WPATH Standards of Care as the accepted standards for the treatment of transgender prisoners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In summary, the broad medical consensus in the area of transgender health care requires providers to individually diagnose, assess, and treat individuals' gender dysphoria, including for those individuals in institutionalized environments. Treatment can and should include GCS when medically necessary. Failure to follow an appropriate treatment plan can expose transgender individuals to a serious risk of psychological and physical harm. The State does not dispute these points; it contends that GCS is not medically necessary for Edmo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Edmo's Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Edmo is a transgender woman in IDOC custody. Her sex assigned at birth was\n   male, but she identifies as female. In her words, \"my brain typically operates female, even though my body hasn't corresponded with my brain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Edmo has been incarcerated since pleading guilty in 2012 to sexual abuse of a 15-year-old male at a house party. Edmo was 21 years old at the time of the criminal offense. Edmo is currently incarcerated at the Idaho State Correctional Institution (\"ISCI\"). At the time of the evidentiary hearing, she was 30 years old and due to be released from prison in 2021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Edmo has viewed herself as female since age 5 or 6. She struggled with her gender identity as a child and teenager, presenting herself intermittently as female, but around age 20 or 21 she began living fulltime as a woman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although she identified as female from an early age, Edmo first learned the term \"gender dysphoria\" and the contours of that diagnosis around the time of her incarceration. Shortly thereafter, Corizon psychiatrist Dr. Scott Eliason diagnosed her with \"gender identity disorder,\" now referred to as gender dysphoria. Corizon psychologist Dr. Claudia Lake confirmed that diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While incarcerated, Edmo has changed her legal name to Adree Edmo and the sex on her birth certificate to \"female\" to affirm her gender identity. Throughout her incarceration, Edmo has consistently presented as female, despite receiving many disciplinary offense reports for doing so. For example, when able to do so, Edmo has worn her hair in feminine hairstyles and worn makeup, for which she has received multiple disciplinary offense reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Medical providers have documented Edmo's feminine presentation since 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Neither the parties nor their experts dispute that Edmo suffers from gender dysphoria. That dysphoria causes Edmo to feel \"depressed,\" \"disgusting,\" \"tormented,\" and \"hopeless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To alleviate Edmo's gender dysphoria, prison officials have, since 2012, provided hormone therapy. Edmo has followed and complied with her hormone therapy regimen, which helps alleviate her gender dysphoria to some extent. The hormones \"clear[ ] [her] mind\" and have resulted in breast growth, body fat redistribution, and changes in her skin. Today, Edmo is hormonally confirmed, which means that she has the hormones and secondary sex characteristics (characteristics, such as women's breasts, that appear during puberty but are not part of the reproductive system) of an adult female. Edmo has gained the maximum physical changes associated with hormone treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Hormone therapy has not completely alleviated Edmo's gender dysphoria. Edmo continues to experience significant distress related to gender incongruence. Much of that distress is caused by her male genitalia. Edmo testified that she feels \"depressed, embarrassed, [and] disgusted\" by her male genitalia and that this is an \"everyday reoccurring thought.\" Her medical records confirm her disgust, noting repeated efforts by Edmo to purchase underwear to keep, in Edmo's words, her \"disgusting penis\" out of sight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In addition to her gender dysphoria, Edmo suffers from major depressive disorder with anxiety and drug and alcohol addiction, although her addiction has been in remission while incarcerated. Edmo has taken her prescribed medications for depression and anxiety. Prison officials have\n   also provided Edmo mental health treatment to help her work through her serious underlying mental health issues and a pre-incarceration history of trauma, abuse, and suicide attempts. Edmo sees her psychiatrist when scheduled. But Edmo does not see her treating clinician, Krina Stewart, because Edmo does not believe Stewart is qualified to treat her gender dysphoria. Edmo has attended group therapy sessions inconsistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In September 2015, Edmo attempted to castrate herself for the first time using a disposable razor blade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before doing so, she left a note to alert officials that she was not \"trying to commit suicide,\" and was instead \"only trying to help [her]self.\" Edmo did not complete the castration, though she continued to report thoughts of self-castration in the following months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On April 20, 2016, Dr. Eliason evaluated Edmo for GCS. At the time, IDOC's policy concerning the treatment of gender dysphoric prisoners provided that GCS \"will not be considered for individuals within [IDOC], unless determined medically necessary by\" the treating physician.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Corizon's policy does not mention GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In his evaluation, Dr. Eliason noted that Edmo reported she was \"doing alright.\" He also noted that Edmo had been on hormone replacement therapy for the last year and a half, but that she felt she needed more. He reported that Edmo had stated that hormone replacement therapy helped alleviate her gender dysphoria, but she remained frustrated with her male anatomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Dr. Eliason indicated that Edmo appeared feminine in demeanor and interaction style. He also indicated that Edmo had previously attempted to \"mutilate her genitalia\" because of the severity of her distress. Dr. Eliason later testified that, at the time of his evaluation, he felt that Edmo's gender dysphoria \"had risen to another level,\" as evidenced by her self-castration attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   But Dr. Eliason also flagged that he had spoken to prison staff about Edmo's behavior and they explained it was \"notable for animated affect and no observed distress.\" He similarly noted that he had personally observed Edmo and did not see significant dysphoria ; instead, she \"looked pleasant and had a good mood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to GCS, Dr. Eliason explained in his notes that while medical necessity for GCS is \"not very well defined and is constantly shifting,\" in his view, GCS would be medically necessary in at least three situations: (1) \"congenital malformations or ambiguous genitalia,\" (2) \"severe and devastating dysphoria that is primarily due to genitals,\" or (3) \"some type of medical problem in which endogenous sexual hormones were causing severe physiological damage.\" Dr. Eliason concluded that Edmo \"does not meet any of those ... criteria\" and, for that reason, GCS is not medically necessary for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Dr. Eliason instead concluded that hormone therapy and supportive counseling suffice to treat Edmo's gender dysphoria for the time being, despite recognizing that Edmo had attempted self-castration on that regimen. Dr. Eliason indicated that he would continue to monitor and assess Edmo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Dr. Eliason staffed Edmo's evaluation with Dr. Jeremy Stoddart, Dr. Murray Young, and Jeremy Clark, who all agreed with his assessment. They did not observe Edmo; rather, they agreed with Dr. Eliason's recommended treatment as he presented\n   it to them. The record is sparse on the qualifications of Dr. Stoddart and Dr. Young, but Clark has never personally treated anyone with gender dysphoria and was not qualified under IDOC policy to assess whether GCS would be appropriate for Edmo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Dr. Eliason also discussed his evaluation with IDOC's Management and Treatment Committee (\"MTC\"), a multi-disciplinary team composed of medical providers, mental health clinicians, IDOC's Chief Psychologist, and prison leadership. The MTC meets periodically to evaluate and address the unique medical, mental health, and housing needs of prisoners with gender dysphoria. The committee \"does not make any individual treatment decisions regarding\" treatment for inmates with gender dysphoria. \"Those determinations are made by the individual clinicians or the medical staff employed by Corizon.\" The MTC agreed with Dr. Eliason's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although not mentioned in his April 20, 2016 notes, Dr. Eliason testified at the evidentiary hearing that he considered the WPATH Standards of Care when determining Edmo's treatment. Citing those standards, Dr. Eliason testified that he did not believe GCS was appropriate for two reasons: (1) because mental health issues separate from Edmo's gender dysphoria were not \"fully in adequate control\" and (2) because Edmo had not lived in her identified gender role for 12 months outside of prison. He explained that Edmo needed to experience \"living as a woman\" around \"her real social network - her family and friends on the outside\" so that she could \"determine whether or not she felt like that was her real identity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Edmo was never evaluated for GCS again, but the MTC considered her gender dysphoria and treatment plan during later meetings. The MTC continues to believe that GCS is not medically necessary or appropriate for Edmo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In December 2016, Edmo tried to castrate herself for the second time. A medical note from the incident reports that Edmo said she no longer wanted her testicles. Edmo reported to medical providers that she was \"feeling angry/frustrated that [she] was not receiving the help desired related to [her] gender dysphoria. Inmate Edmo's actions were reported as a method to stop/cease testosterone production in Edmo's body. Edmo denied suicidal ideation ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Edmo's second attempt was more successful than the first. She was able to open her testicle sac with a razor blade and remove one testicle. She abandoned her attempt, however, when there was too much blood to continue. She then sought medical assistance and was transported to a hospital, where her testicle was repaired. Edmo was receiving hormone therapy both times she attempted self-castration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Edmo testified that she was disappointed in herself for coming so close but failing to complete her self-castration attempts. She also testified that she continues to actively think about self-castration. To avoid acting on those thoughts and impulses, Edmo \"self-medicat[es]\" by cutting her arms with a razor. She says that the physical pain helps to ease the \"emotional torment\" and mental anguish her gender dysphoria causes her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Edmo further testified that she expects GCS to help alleviate some of her gender dysphoria. In particular, she testified that she expects GCS to help her avoid having \"as much depression about myself and my physical body. I don't think I will be so anxious that people are always knowing I'm different ....\" Edmo recognizes, however, that GCS \"is not a fix-all\": \"[i]t's not a magic operation. ... I'm still going to\n   have to face the same stressors that we all face in everyday life ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Initiation of this Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Edmo filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint on April 6, 2017. She also moved for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and the appointment of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Edmo's motion for appointment of counsel was granted in part, and counsel for Edmo appeared in June and August 2017. Counsel withdrew Edmo's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion for preliminary injunction shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On September 1, 2017, Edmo filed an amended complaint asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Eighth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Affordable Care Act, and for common law negligence. She named as defendants IDOC, Henry Atencio (Director of IDOC), Jeff Zmuda (Deputy Director of IDOC), Howard Keith Yordy (former Warden of ISCI), Dr. Richard Craig (Chief Psychologist at ISCI), Rona Siegert (Health Services Director at ISCI), Corizon, Dr. Eliason, Dr. Young, and Dr. Catherine Whinnery (Corizon employee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Through counsel, Edmo filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction on June 1, 2018. Among other relief, Edmo sought an order requiring the State to provide her with a referral to a qualified surgeon and access to GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The State moved to extend the time to respond to Edmo's motion. After a status conference, the district court set an evidentiary hearing for October 10, 11, and 12, 2018. The court permitted the parties to undertake four months of extensive fact and expert discovery in preparation for the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Evidentiary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, each side had eight hours to present its case. The district court heard live testimony from seven witnesses over three days. It also considered thousands of pages of exhibits, including Edmo's medical records. With the parties' agreement, the court also permitted the State to submit declarations in lieu of live testimony and permitted Edmo to impeach the declarations with deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   At the outset of the hearing, the district court noted that \"[w]e're here on a hearing for a temporary injunction,\" but it explained that \"it's hard for me to envision this hearing being anything but a hearing on a final injunction[,] at least as to\" the injunctive relief ordering GCS. The court stated that it was unsure whether that made a difference, and it asked the parties to address at some point whether the hearing was for a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction. Notably, the State did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The district court heard testimony from three percipient witnesses: Edmo, Dr. Eliason (the Corizon physician), and Jeremy Clark (an IDOC clinician who did not meet IDOC's criteria to assess Edmo for GCS). Their relevant testimony is largely recounted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It also heard testimony from four expert witnesses, two each for Edmo and the State. Dr. Randi Ettner, Ph.D. in psychology, testified first for Edmo. Dr. Ettner is one of the authors of the current (seventh) version of the WPATH Standards of Care. She has been a WPATH member since 1993 and chairs its Institutionalized Persons Committee. Dr. Ettner has authored or edited many peer-reviewed publications on the treatment of gender dysphoria and transgender health care more broadly, including the leading textbook used in medical schools on the subject. She also trains medical and mental health providers on treating people with gender dysphoria. Dr. Ettner has been retained as an expert\n   witness on gender dysphoria and its treatment in many court cases, and she has been appointed as an independent expert by one federal court to evaluate an incarcerated person for GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Dr. Ettner has evaluated, diagnosed, and treated between 2,500 and 3,000 individuals with gender dysphoria. She has referred about 300 people for GCS. She has also refused to recommend surgery for some patients who have requested it. She believes that not everyone who has gender dysphoria needs GCS. Dr. Ettner also has \"[e]xtensive experience\" treating and providing post-operative care for patients who have undergone GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Dr. Ettner has assessed approximately 30 incarcerated individuals with gender dysphoria for GCS and other medical care, but she has not treated incarcerated patients. She has not worked in a prison and she is not a Certified Correctional Healthcare Professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Based on her evaluation of Edmo and a review of Edmo's medical records, Dr. Ettner diagnosed Edmo with gender dysphoria, depressive disorder, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. In Dr. Ettner's opinion, GCS is medically necessary for Edmo and should be immediately performed. She explained that most patients with gender dysphoria do not require GCS, but Edmo requires it because hormone therapy has been inadequate for her and Edmo has attempted to remove her own testicles. Dr. Ettner further explained that GCS would give Edmo congruent genitalia, eliminating the severe distress Edmo experiences due to her male anatomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dr. Ettner further opined that Edmo meets the WPATH criteria for GCS. She explained that Edmo has \"persistent and well-documented long-standing gender dysphoria\"; Edmo \"has no thought disorders and no impaired reality testing\"; Edmo is the age of majority in this country; although Edmo has depression and anxiety, those conditions do not \"impair her ability to undergo surgery\" because they are \"as controlled as [they] can be\"; Edmo has had six years of hormone therapy; and Edmo has lived for more than one year \"as a woman to the best of her ability in a male prison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   More specifically, as to the fourth criterion, Dr. Ettner opined that Edmo does not have mental health concerns that would preclude GCS. She explained that Edmo's depression and anxiety are as \"controlled as can be\" because Edmo \"is taking the maximum amount of medication that controls depression.\" Dr. Ettner noted that Edmo has complied with taking her prescribed medications and that psychotherapy is not \"a precondition for surgery\" under the WPATH Standards of Care. She also flagged that Edmo has the capacity to comply with her postsurgical treatment, as evidenced by her compliance with her hormone therapy to date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As to the clinical significance of Edmo's self-castration attempts and cutting behaviors, Dr. Ettner explained that neither behavior indicates that Edmo has inadequately controlled mental health concerns. Rather, those behaviors indicate \"the need for treatment for gender dysphoria.\" Dr. Ettner explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   when an individual who is not psychotic or delusional attempts what we call surgical self-treatment - because we don't regard removal of the testicles or attempted removal of the testicles as either mutilation or self-harm - we regard it as an intentional attempt to remove the target organ that produces testosterone, which, in fact, is the cure for gender dysphoria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In Dr. Ettner's opinion, Edmo's depression and anxiety \"will be attenuated post surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Dr. Ettner opined that Edmo satisfies the sixth criterion because she has lived\n   \"as a woman to the best of her ability in a male prison.\" Dr. Ettner based her opinion on Edmo's \"appearance ... , her disciplinary records, which indicated that she had attempted to wear her hair in a feminine hairstyle and to wear makeup even though that was against the rules and she was - received some sort of disciplinary action for that, and her - the way that she was receiving female undergarments and had developed the stigma of femininity, the secondary sex characteristics, breast development, et cetera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Dr. Ettner opined that if Edmo does not receive GCS, \"[t]he risks would be, as typical in inadequately treated or untreated gender dysphoria, either surgical self-treatment, emotional decompensation, or suicide.\" Dr. Ettner explained that Edmo \"is at particular risk of suicide given that she has a high degree of suicide ideation.\" If, on the other hand, Edmo receives surgery, Dr. Ettner opined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   [i]t would eliminate the gender dysphoria. It would provide a level of wellbeing that she hasn't had previously. It would eliminate 80 percent of the testosterone in her body, necessitating a lower dose of hormones going forward, which would be particularly helpful given that she has elevated liver enzymes. And it would, I believe, eliminate much of the depression and the attendant symptoms that she is experiencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Dr. Ryan Gorton, M.D., also testified for Edmo. Dr. Gorton is an emergency medicine physician. He also works pro bono at a clinic serving uninsured patients or those with Medicare or Medicaid. Many of those patients have mental health conditions or have been in prison. He has published peer-reviewed articles on the treatment of gender dysphoria, and he has been qualified as an expert witness in cases involving transgender health care. Dr. Gorton also provides training on transgender health care issues to many groups, is a member of WPATH, and serves on WPATH's Transgender Medicine and Research Committee and its Institutionalized Persons Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Dr. Gorton has been the primary care physician for about 400 patients with gender dysphoria. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Gorton was treating approximately 100 patients with gender dysphoria. Dr. Gorton has assessed patients for gender dysphoria, initiated and monitored hormone treatment, referred patients for mental health treatment, and determined the appropriateness of GCS. At the time of the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Gorton was providing follow-up care for about 30 patients who had vaginoplasty. Dr. Gorton has no experience treating transgender inmates and is not a Certified Correctional Healthcare Professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Based on his review of Edmo's medical records and his in-person evaluation of Edmo, Dr. Gorton opined that GCS is medically necessary for Edmo and that she meets the WPATH criteria for GCS. He explained that Edmo has \"persistent well-documented gender dysphoria,\" as shown in her prison medical records; she has the capacity \"to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment\" because \"she didn't seem at all impaired in her decision-making capacity\"; she is the age of majority; she has depression and anxiety, \"but they are not to a level that would preclude her getting [GCS]\"; she had 12 consecutive months of hormone therapy; and she has been living in her \"target gender role ... despite an environment that's very hostile to that and some negative consequences that she has experienced because of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Dr. Gorton further opined that if Edmo \"is not provided surgery, there is a very substantial chance she will try to attempt self-surgery again. And that's especially worrisome given her attempts have been\n   progressive. ... So I think she might be successful\" on her next attempt. He predicted that there is little chance that Edmo's gender dysphoria will improve without surgery. Conversely, Dr. Gorton anticipated that Edmo is unlikely to regret surgery because \"her gender dysphoria is very genital-focused\" and regret rates among GCS patients are very low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. Gorton also opined that Edmo's self-castration attempts demonstrate \"that she has severe genital-focused gender dysphoria and that she is not getting the medically necessary treatment to alleviate that.\" He elaborated that Edmo's depression and anxiety are not driving Edmo's self-castration attempts: \"there [are] a lot of people with depression and anxiety who don't remove their testicles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, Dr. Gorton criticized Dr. Eliason's evaluation of Edmo. He explained that he disagreed with Dr. Eliason's conclusion that Edmo does not need GCS and he also disagreed with the three \"criteria\" Dr. Eliason gave for when GCS would be necessary. Dr. Gorton criticized Dr. Eliason's first criterion-that GCS could be needed where there is \"congenital malformation or ambiguous genitalia\"-because that situation \"isn't even germane to transgender people\"; rather, it relates to \"people with intersex conditions.\" As to the second criterion-that GCS could be needed when a patient is suffering from \"severe and devastating gender dysphoria that is primarily due to genitals\"-Dr. Gorton pointed out that the WPATH Standards of Care for surgery require only \"clear and significant dysphoria.\" And even applying Dr. Eliason's higher bar, Dr. Gorton explained that Edmo would still qualify for GCS because she has twice attempted self-castration, demonstrating \"severe genital-focused dysphoria.\" Finally, Dr. Gorton characterized Dr. Eliason's third criterion-that GCS could be needed in situations when \"endogenous sexual hormones were causing severe physiological damage\"-as \"bizarre.\" Dr. Gorton could not conjure \"a clinical circumstance where that would be the case that your hormones that your body produces are attacking you .... I just don't understand what [Dr. Eliason] is talking about there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Dr. Keelin Garvey, M.D., testified for the State. Dr. Garvey is a psychiatrist and Certified Correctional Healthcare Professional. As the former Chief Psychiatrist of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, Dr. Garvey chaired the Gender Dysphoria Treatment Committee. She directly treated a \"couple of patients\" with gender dysphoria earlier in her career as Deputy Medical Director, but she has not done so in recent years. Prior to evaluating Edmo, Dr. Garvey had never evaluated a patient in person to determine whether that person needed GCS. Dr. Garvey has never recommended a patient for GCS, and she has not done follow-up care with a person who has received GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Based on her evaluation of Edmo and a review of Edmo's medical records, Dr. Garvey diagnosed Edmo with gender dysphoria, major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, stimulant use disorder, and opioid use disorder. She explained that the latter three are in remission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Relying on the WPATH Standards of Care, Dr. Garvey opined that GCS is not medically necessary for Edmo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Garvey first explained that Edmo does not meet the first WPATH Standards of Care criterion-\"persistent, well documented gender dysphoria\"-because of a lack of evidence in pre-incarceration medical records that Edmo presented as female before her time in prison. Dr. Garvey acknowledged,\n   however, that Edmo has been presenting as female since 2012 and that she has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Dr. Garvey then explained that Edmo does not meet the fourth criterion-\"medical/mental health concerns must be well controlled\"-because Edmo \"is actively self-injuring.\" Dr. Garvey elaborated that \"self-injury in any form is never considered a healthy or productive coping mechanism\" and that she would like to see Edmo \"develop further coping skills that she would be able to use following surgery so that she is not engaging in self-injury after surgery.\" Dr. Garvey's concern is that GCS is a \"stressful undertaking\" and Edmo lacks \"effective coping strategies\" to deal with the stress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Finally, Dr. Garvey testified that Edmo does not meet the sixth criterion-\"12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with gender identity\"-because Edmo has not presented as female outside of prison and \"there [are] challenges to using her time in a men's prison as this real-life experience because it doesn't offer her the opportunity to actually experience all those things she is going to go through on the outside.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Dr. Joel Andrade, Ph.D. in social work, also testified for the State. He is a licensed clinical social worker and is a Certified Correctional Healthcare Professional with an emphasis in mental health. Dr. Andrade has over a decade of experience providing and supervising the provision of correctional mental health care, including directing and overseeing the treatment of inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Corrections in his roles as clinical director, chair of the Gender Dysphoria Supervision Group, and member of the Gender Dysphoria Treatment Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As a member of the Gender Dysphoria Treatment Committee, Dr. Andrade recommended GCS for two inmates. But the recommendations were contingent on the inmates living in a women's prison for approximately 12 months before the surgery. The Massachusetts Department of Corrections, like IDOC, houses prisoners according to their genitals, so the inmates had not been moved (nor had their surgery occurred).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Dr. Andrade has never directly treated patients with gender dysphoria, nor has he been a treating clinician for a patient who has had GCS. His \"experience with gender dysphoria comes almost exclusively from [his] participation on the Massachusetts Department of Corrections['] Gender Dysphoria Treatment Committee and Supervision Group.\" Dr. Andrade did not qualify, under the IDOC gender dysphoria policy in effect at the time of his assessment of Edmo, to assess a person for GCS because he is neither a psychologist nor a physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Based on his evaluation of Edmo and a review of her medical records, Dr. Andrade diagnosed Edmo with \"major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission,\" \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" \"alcohol use disorder, severe,\" and gender dysphoria. Dr. Andrade also diagnosed Edmo with borderline personality disorder. The district court did not credit this diagnosis, however, because no other person (including the State's other expert, Dr. Garvey) has ever diagnosed Edmo with borderline personality disorder and Dr. Andrade was unable to identify his criteria for this diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    Edmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    358 F. Supp. 3d at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record amply supports the district court's finding in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Dr. Andrade opined that Edmo does not meet the WPATH criteria for GCS. He explained that, based on his review of Edmo's pre-incarceration records, Edmo did not present as female or discuss her gender dysphoria before incarceration. Dr.\n   Andrade testified that he would like to see Edmo live as female outside of a correctional setting before receiving GCS, or, at the least, live in a women's prison first. IDOC, however, houses prisoners according to their genitals. Dr. Andrade also explained that Edmo needs to work through some of her trauma, particularly sexual abuse that she suffered, and other mental health concerns before receiving surgery. Dr. Andrade opined that Edmo's mental health issues will not be cured by GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   At the close of the hearing, the district court reiterated that it was unsure \"how we can hear [Edmo's request for GCS] on a preliminary injunction. ... [I]f I order it, then it's done.\" The court further suggested that the request for GCS could \"only be resolved in a final hearing\" and noted that it had, in effect, \"treated this hearing as [a] final hearing on the issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The court, as it had done at the outset of the hearing, asked the parties to address whether the hearing was for a preliminary or permanent injunction. In response, Edmo contended that the court could order GCS in a preliminary injunction. The State did not address the court's question. It instead contended that the standard for a mandatory injunction-which can be preliminary or permanent-should apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The district court rendered its decision on December 13, 2018. After recounting the evidence and making extensive factual findings, the district court began its analysis by noting that it was unsure whether the standard for a preliminary injunction or the standard for a permanent injunction applied. The court noted that \"the nature of the relief requested in this case, coupled with the extensive evidence presented by the parties over a 3-day evidentiary hearing, [may have] effectively converted these proceedings into a final trial on the merits of the plaintiff's request for permanent injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Edmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    358 F.

The court rejected the contrary opinions of the State's experts because \"neither Dr. Garvey nor Dr. Andrade has any direct experience with patients receiving gender confirmation surgery or assessing patients for the medical necessity of gender confirmation surgery,\" and neither of the State's experts had meaningful \"experience treating patients with gender dysphoria other than assessing them for the existence of the condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court also noted that the State's \"experts appear to misrepresent the WPATH Standards of Care by concluding that Ms. Edmo, despite presenting as female since her incarceration in 2012, cannot satisfy the WPATH criteria because she has not presented as female outside of the prison setting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the district court noted,\n   \"there is no requirement in the WPATH Standards of Care that a patient live for twelve months in his or her gender role outside of prison before becoming eligible for\" GCS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Finally, the district court explained that the State was deliberately indifferent to Edmo's gender dysphoria because it \"fail[ed] to provide her with available treatment that is generally accepted in the field as safe and effective, despite her actual harm and ongoing risk of future harm including self-castration attempts, cutting, and suicidal ideation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    at 1126-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court permissibly credited the opinions of Edmo's experts that GCS is medically necessary to treat Edmo's gender dysphoria and that the State's failure to provide that treatment is medically unacceptable. Edmo's experts are well-qualified to render such opinions, and they logically and persuasively explained the necessity of GCS and applied the WPATH Standards of Care-the undisputed starting point in determining the appropriate treatment for gender dysphoric individuals. On the other side of the coin, the district court permissibly discredited the contrary opinions of the State's treating physician and medical experts. Those individuals lacked expertise and incredibly applied (or did not apply, in the case of the State's treating physician) the WPATH Standards of Care. In other words, the district court did not clearly err in making its credibility determinations, so it is not our role to reevaluate them. The credited testimony establishes that GCS is medically necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Turning first to the expert testimony offered, the district court credited the testimony of Edmo's experts that GCS is medically necessary to treat Edmo's gender dysphoria and that the State's failure to provide that treatment is medically unacceptable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    358 F. Supp. 3d at 1120-21, 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Ettner and Dr. Gorton opined that GCS is medically necessary because Edmo's current treatment has been inadequate, as evidenced by her self-castration attempts. They also opined that if Edmo does not receive GCS, there is little chance that her gender dysphoria will improve and she is at risk of committing self-surgery again, suicide, and further emotional decompensation. On the other hand, providing GCS to Edmo would, in the opinions of Dr. Ettner and Dr. Gorton, align Edmo's genitalia with her gender identity, thereby eliminating the severe distress Edmo experiences from her male genitalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In sharp contrast, the district court gave \"virtually no weight\" to the opinions of the State's experts.\n   <em>\n    Edmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    358 F. Supp. 3d at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade, who purported to rely on the WPATH Standards of Care, opined that GCS is not medically necessary for Edmo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The district court did not err in crediting the testimony of Edmo's experts and discounting the testimony of the State's experts. Dr. Ettner and Dr. Gorton are well-qualified to opine on the medical necessity of GCS. Both have substantial experience treating individuals with gender dysphoria. Dr. Ettner has evaluated, diagnosed, and treated between 2,500 and 3,000 individuals with gender dysphoria, while Dr. Gorton has been the primary care physician for approximately 400 patients with gender dysphoria. Both have substantial experience evaluating whether GCS is medically necessary for patients. Dr. Ettner has evaluated hundreds of people for GCS, referring approximately 300 while refusing others, and Dr. Gorton routinely determines the appropriateness of GCS for patients. They also have experience providing follow-up care for patients who have undergone GCS. And both have published peer-reviewed articles concerning the treatment of gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The State's experts, by contrast, have substantial experience providing health care in institutional settings, but lack meaningful experience directly treating people with gender dysphoria. Dr. Garvey directly treated a \"couple of patients\" with gender dysphoria early in her career, while Dr. Andrade has never provided direct treatment for patients with gender dysphoria. Moreover, prior to evaluating Edmo, neither had ever evaluated someone in person to determine the medical necessity\n   of GCS. Relatedly, Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade have never provided follow-up care for a person who has received GCS. Indeed, Dr. Andrade did not even qualify under IDOC policy to assess a person for GCS. And neither Dr. Garvey nor Dr. Andrade has published a peer-reviewed article concerning the treatment of gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Neither Dr. Ettner nor Dr. Gorton have treated prisoners with gender dysphoria, nor are they Certified Correctional Healthcare Professionals. But both serve on WPATH's Institutionalized Persons Committee, which \"looks at the care and the assessment of individuals who are incarcerated and develops standards for treatment\" of such individuals. They are thus familiar with medical treatment in prison settings. Moreover, Dr. Ettner has assessed approximately 30 incarcerated persons with gender dysphoria for GCS and other medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   More to the point, the more relevant experience for determining the medical necessity of GCS is having treated individuals with gender dysphoria, having evaluated individuals for GCS, and having treated them post-operatively. Such experience lends itself to fundamental knowledge of whether GCS is necessary and the potential risks of providing or foregoing the surgery. Edmo's experts have the requisite experience; the State's experts do not. For that reason alone, the district court did not clearly err in crediting the opinions of Edmo's experts over those of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caro v.

Supp. 3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   For example, both Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade expressed the view that Edmo does not meet the sixth WPATH criterion, \"12 continuous months of living in a gender role that is congruent with gender identity.\" WPATH SOC at 60. They pointed out that Edmo has not presented as female outside of prison and urged that she needs real-life experiences in the community before undergoing GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   These opinions run head-on into the WPATH Standards of Care. The WPATH standards, which the NCCHC endorses as the accepted standards for the treatment of transgender inmates, apply\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   in their entirety ... to all transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people, irrespective of their housing situation. People should not be discriminated against in their access to appropriate health care based on where they live, including institutional environments such as prisons ....

Access to these medically necessary treatments should not be denied on the basis of institutionalization or housing arrangements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   WPATH SOC at 67. Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade's view-that GCS cannot be medically indicated for transgender inmates who did not present in a gender-congruent manner before incarceration-contradicts these accepted standards. Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade would deny GCS to a class of people because of their \"institutionalization,\" which the WPATH Standards of Care explicitly disavow. They provide no persuasive explanation for their deviation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And nothing in the WPATH Standards of Care or the law supports excluding an entire class of gender dysphoric individuals from eligibility for GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Both Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade also relied on Edmo's failure to attend psychotherapy sessions as an indication that her mental health concerns are not well controlled. But psychotherapy is not a precondition for surgery under the WPATH Standards of Care. WPATH SOC at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   We acknowledge that the WPATH Standards of Care are flexible, and a simple deviation from those standards does not alone establish an Eighth Amendment claim. But the State's experts purported to be applying those standards and yet did so in a way that directly contradicted them. These unsupported and unexplained deviations offer a further reason why the district court did not clearly err in discounting the testimony of the State's experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398067\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/1247/#p1253\">\n    280 F.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Finally, the district court did not err in discrediting the State's experts because aspects of their opinions were illogical and unpersuasive. For example, Dr. Garvey and Dr. Andrade expressed the view that Edmo does not meet the first WPATH criterion-\"persistent, well documented gender dysphoria,\" WPATH SOC at 60-because of a lack of evidence from pre-incarceration\n   records of Edmo presenting as female. But both experts acknowledged that Edmo has been diagnosed with and treated for gender dysphoria since 2012-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for six years as of the evidentiary hearing. Neither Dr. Garvey nor Dr. Andrade questioned Edmo's diagnosis, and both agree that she currently suffers gender dysphoria. There can be no doubt that Edmo has \"persistent, well documented gender dysphoria,\" so their opinion is inexplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Dr. Garvey's and Dr. Andrade's opinions on this point also ignore that individuals with gender dysphoria do not always experience symptoms early in life or throughout their life, or do not identify them as such. As Dr. Ettner testified, \"gender dysphoria intensifies with age.\" And as with treatment for any other medical condition, treatment for gender dysphoria must be based on a patient's current situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The opinions of Edmo's experts are notably devoid of these flaws. Dr. Ettner and Dr. Gorton cogently and persuasively explained why GCS is medically necessary for Edmo and why Edmo meets the WPATH criteria for GCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   For example, consistent with the WPATH Standards of Care, Dr. Ettner explained that Edmo has lived for \"12 continuous months ... in a gender role that is congruent with gender identity\" (the sixth WPATH criterion) because she has lived \"as a woman to the best of her ability in a male prison.\" In support of her opinion, Dr. Ettner cited Edmo's \"appearance ... , her disciplinary records, which indicated that she had attempted to wear her hair in a feminine hairstyle and to wear makeup even though that was against the rules and she was - received some sort of disciplinary action for that, and her - the way that she was receiving female undergarments and had developed the stigma of femininity, the secondary sex characteristics, breast development, et cetera.\" Dr. Gorton similarly explained that Edmo satisfies the sixth WPATH criterion because she has lived for years in her \"target gender role ... despite an environment that's very hostile to that and some negative consequences that she has experienced because of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Moreover, both Dr. Ettner and Dr. Gorton offered reasoned explanations tying Edmo's self-castration attempts to her severe gender dysphoria. Dr. Ettner explained that doctors regard \"surgical self-treatment ... as an intentional attempt to remove the target organ that produces testosterone, which, in fact, is the cure for gender dysphoria.\" As Dr. Gorton elaborated, Edmo's self-castration attempts demonstrate deficient treatment for \"severe genital-focused gender dysphoria.\" He rejected the notion that Edmo's depression and anxiety drove her self-castration attempts: \"there [are] a lot of people with depression and anxiety who don't remove their testicles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In light of the experts' backgrounds and experience, and the reasonableness, consistency, and persuasiveness of their opinions, the district court did not err in crediting the opinions of Edmo's experts and giving little weight to those of the State's experts. The district court carefully examined the voluminous record, extensive testimony, and conflicting expert opinions in this case and set forth clear reasons, supported by the record, for relying on the testimony of Edmo's experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    La Quinta Worldwide\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179253\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/867/#p879\">\n    762 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a factual finding is clear error if it is \"illogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record\");\n   <em>\n    Caro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398067\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/1247/#p1253\">\n    280 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1253 ;\n   <em>\n    Beech Aircraft Corp. v.

Dr. Eliason explained in his notes that, in his view, GCS is medically necessary in three situations: \"congenital malformation or ambiguous genitalia,\" \"severe and devastating dysphoria that is primarily due to genitals,\" or \"some type of medical problem in which endogenous sexual hormones were causing severe physiological damage.\" The conclusion of his notes-\"[t]his inmate does not meet any of those [three] criteria\"-suggests that he views those as the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   three scenarios in which GCS would be medically necessary, an impression he did not dispel during his testimony. Those \"criteria\" (Dr. Eliason's term), however, bear little resemblance to the widely accepted, evidence-based criteria set out in the WPATH's Standards of Care. As Dr. Eliason acknowledged, the NCCHC endorses the WPATH Standards of Care as the accepted standards for the treatment of transgender prisoners. And as the district court found and the State does not contest, \"[t]here are no other competing, evidence-based standards that are accepted by any nationally or internationally recognized medical professional groups.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Eliason did not follow these standards in rendering his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   The State challenges the district court's finding that Dr. Eliason \"did not apply the WPATH Criteria,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    at 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on two grounds. First, citing Dr. Eliason's testimony at the evidentiary hearing, it urges that Dr. Eliason concluded that GCS was not medically necessary for Edmo because Edmo's mental health issues were not well controlled (the fourth WPATH criterion) and she had not consistently presented as female outside of prison (the sixth).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   The district court's rejection of this post hoc explanation was not clear error. Neither of the explanations offered by Dr. Eliason during the evidentiary hearing appears in Dr. Eliason's notes. Nor did he give these reasons during his deposition. Their absence is conspicuous, given that Dr. Eliason took the time to indicate instances where, in his opinion, GCS is appropriate and to explain that Edmo did not satisfy his \"criteria.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Second, the State highlights that Dr. Eliason's notes recommend further \"supportive counseling\" for Edmo and indicate that Edmo was up for parole. The State construes these notes as shorthand for the fourth and sixth WPATH criteria, respectively. The State's proposed reading of Dr. Eliason's notes is unreasonable. His notes are clear that GCS is not needed because Edmo did not meet his three \"criteria,\" and the district court was well within its factfinding discretion in rejecting the State's strained reading. We therefore conclude that the district court reasonably found that Dr. Eliason \"did not rely upon any finding that Ms. Edmo did not meet the WPATH criteria in concluding in his April 2016 assessment that she did not\n   meet the criteria for gender confirmation surgery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n    at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Notably, neither Dr. Eliason nor the State has offered any explanation or support for Dr. Eliason's \"criteria.\" Dr. Eliason testified that he could not recall where he came up with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Nor has Dr. Eliason or the State contended that Dr. Eliason's criteria were a reasonable deviation or modification of the WPATH Standards of Care. In any event, we could not accept that argument. Dr. Eliason's criteria-apparently invented out of whole cloth-are so far afield from the WPATH standards that we cannot characterize his decision as a flexible application of or deviation from those standards. Indeed, as Dr. Gorton explained, two of Dr. Eliason's criteria are inapplicable to the care of transgender individuals. Dr. Eliason's criterion of \"congenital malformation or ambiguous genitalia\" \"isn't ... germane to transgender people.\" His statement that GCS could be needed when \"endogenous sexual hormones were causing severe physiological damage,\" is, in Dr. Gorton's words, \"bizarre. I can't think of a clinical circumstance where ... your hormones that your body produces are attacking you .... I just don't understand what [Dr. Eliason] is talking about there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Dr. Eliason, in short, did not follow the accepted standards of care in the area of transgender health care, nor did he reasonably deviate from or flexibly apply them. Dr. Eliason did not apply the established standards, even as a starting point, in his evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Putting to the side Dr. Eliason's failure to follow or reasonably deviate from the accepted standards of care, his decision was internally contradictory in an important way. His notes reflect that GCS would be medically necessary if a person is suffering \"severe and devastating gender dysphoria that is primarily due to genitals.\" At his deposition, Dr. Eliason conceded that self-castration could show gender dysphoria sufficiently severe to satisfy that criterion. And at the evidentiary hearing, he acknowledged that Edmo \"does primarily meet that criteri[on].\" Thus, even under Dr. Eliason's own criteria, Edmo should have been provided GCS. Neither Dr. Eliason nor the State has reconciled this important contradiction between Dr. Eliason's criteria and his determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   In sum, Dr. Eliason's evaluation was not an exercise of medically acceptable professional judgment. Dr. Eliason's decision was based on inexplicable criteria far afield from the recognized standards of care and, even applying Dr. Eliason's criteria, Edmo qualifies for GCS. Given the credited expert testimony that GCS is necessary to treat Edmo's gender dysphoria, Dr. Eliason's contrary determination was \"medically unacceptable under the circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Snow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884912\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/978/#p988\">\n    681 F.3d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The record demonstrates that Dr. Eliason acted with deliberate indifference to Edmo's serious medical needs. Dr. Eliason knew, as of the time of his evaluation, that Edmo had attempted to castrate herself. He also knew that Edmo suffers from gender dysphoria ; he knew she experiences \"clinically significant\" distress that impairs her ability to function. He acknowledged that Edmo's self-castration attempt was evidence that Edmo's gender dysphoria, in his words, \"had risen to another level.\" Dr. Eliason nonetheless continued with Edmo's ineffective treatment plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Edmo then tried to castrate herself a second time, in December 2016. Dr. Eliason knew of that nearly catastrophic event, but he did not reevaluate or recommend a change to Edmo's treatment plan, despite indicating in his April 2016 evaluation that he would continue to monitor and assess Edmo's condition. Dr. Eliason continued to see Edmo after that time, and he considered Edmo's treatment as a member of the MTC. At no point did Dr. Eliason change his mind or the treatment plan regarding surgery. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Dr. Eliason knew of and disregarded the substantial risk of severe harm to Edmo.\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p835\">\n    511 U.S. at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p835\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The State urges that neither Dr. Eliason nor any other defendant acted with deliberate indifference because none acted with \"malice, intent to inflict pain, or knowledge that [the] recommended course of treatment was medically inappropriate.\" The State misstates the standard.

None is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   First, the State argues that the \"long delay\" of \"nearly a year\" between Edmo filing her Amended Complaint and her preliminary injunction motion \"implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.\" We disagree. The procedural history demonstrates that Edmo did not sit on her rights. Proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , Edmo moved for preliminary injunctive relief when she filed her original complaint. The court then appointed counsel for Edmo, and shortly after appearing, appointed counsel withdrew Edmo's motion and filed an amended complaint. To assess the urgency of surgery, Edmo's counsel promptly sought access to Edmo's medical records, which the State did not produce until more than six months later. Edmo moved for injunctive relief shortly thereafter. During that time, Edmo and her counsel diligently investigated and compiled the necessary record to move for injunctive relief. That it took them months to do their diligence does not suggest that Edmo will not be harmed absent an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Second, the State contends that Edmo has not established irreparable injury because both she and her expert, Dr. Gorton, agree that GCS is not an emergency surgery and that the State should have six months to provide such surgery. The State's argument would preclude courts from ordering non-emergent medical care, even if the Eighth Amendment demands it. That is untenable. The State also ignores the rationale for the six-month time period. As Dr. Gorton explained, all patients who receive GCS \"are seen, they are evaluated, there is a process you have to go through.\" In his experience, that process typically concludes within six months. That Edmo requested relief on a reasonable timeline, based on the medical evidence, does not undermine the strong evidence of irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Third, the State contends that Edmo has not established irreparable harm because she \"has not attempted suicide or self-castration for years.\" That argument overlooks the profound, persistent distress Edmo's gender dysphoria causes, as well as the credited expert testimony that absent GCS, Edmo is at risk of further attempts at self-castration, and possibly suicide. The district court did not err in finding that Edmo would be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Challenges to the Scope of the Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   We turn to the State's contentions that the district court's injunction was overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Individual Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The State contends that the injunction should not apply to Atencio, Zmuda, Yordy, Siegert, Dr. Young, Dr. Craig, Dr. Eliason, or Dr. Whinnery because the district court did not find that they, individually,\n   were deliberately indifferent to Edmo's medical needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   As explained in Section III.A, Edmo has established that Dr. Eliason was deliberately indifferent to her serious medical needs. The injunction was properly entered against him because he personally participated in the deprivation of Edmo's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181175\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1060/#p1068\">\n    763 F.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Edmo sued Attencio, Zmuda, and Yordy in their official capacities.

The State does not contest that Attencio, as Director of IDOC, and Zmuda, as Deputy Director of IDOC, would be responsible for implementing any injunctive relief ordered.

On remand, the district court shall amend the injunction to substitute Al Ramirez (or the then-current Warden of ISCI) as a party for Yordy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Edmo also named Yordy as a defendant in his individual capacity. She likewise named Siegert, Dr. Young, Dr. Craig, and Dr. Whinnery as defendants in their individual capacities (though she does not argue on appeal that the injunction properly included them). We hold that the evidence in the current record is insufficient to conclude that they were deliberately indifferent to Edmo's serious medical needs. In particular, the record does not show what they knew about Edmo's condition and what role they played in her treatment or lack thereof. Edmo has not established their liability, and the district court improperly included them within the scope of the injunction.

At the beginning of the hearing, the district court explained \"it's hard for me to envision this hearing being anything but a hearing on a final injunction at least as to that part of the relief requested [GCS],\" and it asked the parties to address by the end of the hearing whether it was for a permanent injunction. At the close of the hearing, the district court again questioned whether it could order GCS in a preliminary injunction. It explained that it had, in effect, \"kind of treated this hearing as the final hearing\" on Edmo's request for GCS, and it again asked the parties to address in their oral closings or written briefs whether the hearing was one for a permanent injunction. The State never answered the court's question or objected to consolidation, despite the district court specifically noting it had treated the hearing as final.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly v.

This is not a case where the district court gave no notice whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Regardless, the State has not shown any prejudice. With full awareness of the stakes, the district court permitted the parties four months of discovery and held a three-day evidentiary hearing. The parties called seven witnesses, submitted declarations in lieu of live testimony for other witnesses, and submitted thousands of pages of exhibits and extensive pre- and post-trial briefing. Most importantly, both parties put on extensive evidence concerning the treatment provided to and withheld from Edmo and why it was or was not appropriate-the key issue at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   When it comes to identifying prejudice, the State is tellingly short on specifics. It indicates that it \"would have objected\" to consolidation, but it failed to do so despite repeated invitations-indeed, directives-to address the issue. The State also urges that it would have requested that the named defendants be able to testify live, but it stipulated-knowing full well the stakes of the hearing-to submit certain testimony via declaration \"[i]n lieu of and/or in addition to live testimony.\" Moreover, the State fails to identify what testimony those witnesses would have offered\n   or explain how presenting that testimony live, instead of via declaration, \"could have altered the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Michenfelder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655752\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/860/328/#p337\">\n    860 F.2d at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   We apply the dictates of the Eighth Amendment today in an area of increased social awareness: transgender health care. We are not the first to speak on the subject, nor will we be the last. Our court and others have been considering Eighth Amendment claims brought by transgender prisoners for decades. During that time, the medical community's understanding of what treatments are safe and medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria has changed as more information becomes available, research is undertaken, and experience is gained. The Eighth-Amendment inquiry takes account of that developing understanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    429 U.S. at 102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   We hold that where, as here, the record shows that the medically necessary treatment for a prisoner's gender dysphoria is gender confirmation surgery, and responsible prison officials deny such treatment with full awareness of the prisoner's suffering, those officials violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   We affirm the district court's entry of an injunction for Edmo.

As a result, a plaintiff need not show that \"extreme or very serious damage will result,\" as is required for mandatory preliminary injunctions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-282\">\n    As we have explained, the district court granted Edmo injunctive relief under both the preliminary and permanent injunction standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Edmo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     358 F.

Because the standard for granting permanent injunctive relief is higher (in that it requires actual success on the merits) and the State contends in its opening brief that we should review the injunction as a permanent injunction, we consider whether the district court erred in granting Edmo permanent injunctive relief. But we would also affirm under the mandatory preliminary injunction standard, because the district court correctly applied the proper standard for mandatory preliminary injunctive relief, and not the lower standard for prohibitory preliminary injunctions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Edmo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     358 F.

So far as we can discern, the argument is that because a psychiatrist (Dr. Eliason) evaluated Edmo for GCS, only other psychiatrists are qualified to opine as to the medical necessity of GCS and to contradict his assessment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Oral Arg. at 10:00-10:30. We reject that contention. Edmo's experts, as explained, have significant experience evaluating patients for GCS-precisely what Dr. Eliason did. On the basis of their medical experience treating persons with gender dysphoria, they are well-qualified to render an opinion on the medical necessity of GCS and whether failure to provide the surgery is medically acceptable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

Tellingly, each expert for Edmo and the State likewise used the WPATH Standards of Care as a starting point. As the district court recognized: \"There are no other competing, evidence-based standards that are accepted by any nationally or internationally recognized medical professional groups.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     at 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And as the State acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing, the \"WPATH standards of care in the seventh edition do provide the best guidance\" and \"are the best standards out there.\" For these reasons, the WPATH Standards of Care establish a useful starting point for analyzing the credibility and weight to be given to each expert's opinion and whether that opinion was consistent with established standards of care. The State does not contest the district court's finding that the WPATH Standards of Care are the \"internationally recognized guidelines for the treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529462\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/358/1103/#p1111\">\n     at 1111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . They are the gold standard on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-286\">\n    In concluding that Edmo does not meet the sixth WPATH criterion, Dr. Garvey expressed concern that there is a lack of evidence regarding GCS in prison settings. That rationale acts as self-fulfilling prophecy. If prisons and prison officials deny GCS to prisoners because of a lack of data, the data will never be generated, and the cycle will continue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-287\">\n    Dr. Eliason was not alone in his decision. Dr. Stoddart, Dr. Young, and Jeremy Clark agreed with his assessment, as did the MTC. The State contends that such general agreement demonstrates that Dr. Eliason's decision was reasonable. But general agreement in a medically unacceptable form of treatment does not somehow make it reasonable. This is especially so in light of the limited review those individuals performed: Dr. Stoddard, Dr. Young, and Jeremy Clark agreed with Dr. Eliason's recommended treatment as\n    <em>\n     he\n    </em>\n    presented it to them and without personally evaluating Edmo, and the MTC \"does not make any individual treatment decisions regarding [gender dysphoric] inmates. Those determinations are made by the individual clinicians or the medical staff employed by Corizon,\" like Dr. Eliason.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-288\">\n    We do not suggest that every member of the medical and mental health communities agrees that GCS may be medically necessary. There are outliers.
