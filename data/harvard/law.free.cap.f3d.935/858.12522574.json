Third, under FOIA's most-recognized provision, members of the public may request agency records, and the agency-subject to limited exemptions-must produce them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(3).

DOJ,\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act: Proactive Disclosures\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    DOJ 2014 Guide to FOIA\n   </em>\n   \"), 12-13 (July 23, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/proactive-disclosures.pdf. However, Congress ushered FOIA into the electronic age in 1996, amending the statute to require proactively disclosed records created after November 1, 1996, to be available by \"electronic means.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Pub.

In 2016, Congress again amended \u00a7 552(a)(2), this time specifying that agencies shall make records available \"for public inspection in an electronic format.\" FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, Pub.

L. No. 104-231. Legislative reports, the DOJ, and the DOJ's Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\") justify the availability of frequently requested records in terms of reducing requests for copies, streamlining processing, and trimming bloated agency backlogs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2016 amendments retained an agency's ability to determine which records deserved \u00a7 552(a)(2) treatment based on the likelihood of \"becom[ing] the subject of subsequent requests[,]\" but also codified the \"Rule of 3,\" requiring automatic reading-room treatment for records previously released under \u00a7 552(a)(3) and requested three or more times.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the three key disclosure provisions, FOIA vests jurisdiction in federal courts \"to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B).

In February 2017, APHIS removed the various compliance and enforcement records from its website. APHIS represents that it has devoted substantial resources to reviewing and re-posting the records.

For example, declarations from ALDF and Animal Folks allege how the organizations have visited the online reading rooms, using agency records to identify areas of animal welfare concern and seek enforcement actions, including asking the USDA to revoke licenses or bring facilities into compliance. ALDF also pursues legal actions on behalf of its members, such as a recent lawsuit against a pet store chain, alleging the company violated consumer protection laws by representing it did not obtain puppies from \"puppy mills.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Executive Director of SAEN averred that he checked the databases up to ten times a day, and often issued press releases and filed enforcement actions within twenty-four hours of APHIS uploading records about problematic animal research facilities. One campaign culminated in the USDA revoking the company's dealer license, canceling its research registration, and imposing a $ 3.5 million fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CAPS has alleged its work involves acting as a watchdog, in that it performs its own investigations, compares them to APHIS's reports, and refers discrepancies to the Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\").

APHIS argues that the judicial-review provision restricts courts to ordering agencies to produce copies of the records to an individual plaintiff. Yet this reading collapses an agency's affirmative responsibility to post certain records (identified in the statute by Congress) into an agency's responsibility to respond to requests for copies of documents under \u00a7 552(a)(3). However, \u00a7 552(a)(3) does not apply to \"records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.\" The idea of \u00a7 552(a)(3) annexing \u00a7 552(a)(2) for purposes of judicial review creates particular problems in the case of frequently requested documents required to be posted under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). APHIS's interpretation would mean FOIA deliberately brings certain \u00a7 552(a)(3) records into \u00a7 552(a)(2) -specifically to preempt \u00a7 552(a)(3) requests-yet, if an agency shrugs that congressional command, the statute forces plaintiffs right back into the requests and backlogs Congress sought to avoid in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   APHIS next argues that district courts only have authority to order agencies to produce copies of \u00a7 552(a)(2) records to particular plaintiffs, because the statute authorizes district courts to refer certain cases that raise questions about the agency's conduct to the Office of Special Counsel, but only if \"the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F)(i). APHIS argues it would be illogical for Congress to include such a provision if courts did in fact have authority under the \"to enjoin\" clause to order agencies to post \u00a7 552(a)(2) documents in online reading rooms, because a court \"must do so at the price of losing its authority to institute disciplinary proceedings.\" However, the provision simply allows district courts, when ordering \"records improperly withheld\" to be produced, to flag when \"agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously,\" because these additional written findings trigger a mandatory duty for the Office of Special Counsel to investigate.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em https:=\"\" index=\"151\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.&lt;/extracted-citation&gt;harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 552(a)(4)(F).

Plaintiffs' first APA claim hinges on their allegation that, in the event we conclude there is no authority for district courts to order agencies to comply with FOIA's reading-room provision, then APHIS's failure to post categories of records previously available on the databases constitutes a \"failure to act,\" reviewable as a \"final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having concluded that FOIA authorizes district courts to provide the relief Plaintiffs request, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the first APA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' second APA claim for similar reasons. Plaintiffs' second APA claim alleges that the agency's decision to delete the databases constitutes final agency action reviewable under the APA's \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 706. Plaintiffs' allegations that FOIA's reading-room provision applies to all of the records in this case unlocked the gates for judicial review under FOIA. Because FOIA authorizes district courts to order agencies to comply with the reading-room provision and supplies the standard for reviewing such claims, the potential for meaningful relief under FOIA displaces the APA's catch-all cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 704.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED in part, AFFIRMED in part, and REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the reasons set forth by the D.C.

Plaintiffs argue their injury is \"based on the\n   <em>\n    public's\n   </em>\n   inability to access the records.\" This is exactly what the D.C.

This is also the basis for the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction: \"courts cannot compel agencies to make documents available to the public at large under FOIA's reading room provision\" and thus \"this court lacks jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs' FOIA claim.\" Ordering the publication of documents to the individual plaintiffs is not the same as ordering the publication of\n   documents to the public at large.
