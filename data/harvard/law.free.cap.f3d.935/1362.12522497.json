The petitions contained a combined total of seventeen grounds. The petition in IPR2015-00165 included seven grounds, the petition in IPR2015-00168 included five grounds, and the petition in IPR2015-00169 included five grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"Board\" or \"PTAB\") instituted review on a single ground in each petition. For the fourteen other non-instituted grounds, the Board found that BioDelivery failed to establish a reasonable likelihood of prevailing\n   on the merits. In the final written decisions, the Board sustained the patentability of all claims subject to the instituted challenges in each proceeding. BioDelivery appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After oral argument in the appeals, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    SAS Institute, Inc. v.
