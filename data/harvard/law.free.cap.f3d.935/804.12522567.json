The district court correctly interpreted \u00a7 12601 when it concluded that the statute does not require an official municipal policy of violating constitutional rights in order for the United States to prevail. Colorado City's arguments about the district court's factual findings, even if they are correct, do not entitle it to relief because the district court's judgment is supported on other grounds. The district court did not err in admitting several statements that Colorado City contends were hearsay. We affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Straddling the Utah and Arizona border, the Short Creek Community is a religious settlement composed of the Towns. Most residents are FLDS members and follow the teachings of Warren Jeffs, whom they sustain as a prophet and leader of the Church. Since becoming the head of the Church in 2002, Jeffs has promulgated a strict set of rules for FLDS members, such as prohibitions on: vacations, toys, attendance at public schools, and displays of affection between husbands and wives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States brought a civil action against the Towns and their municipal utility providers, Twin City Water Authority and Twin City Power, alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination against non-FLDS residents. The essential allegation of the United States was that the Towns functioned as an arm of the Church and conspired with FLDS leaders to use the Towns' municipal resources to advance Church interests. The complaint stated a claim against the Towns pursuant to \u00a7 12601 for violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because \u00a7 12601 does not provide a right to a jury trial, the parties agreed that a jury would render only an advisory verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the United States argued that FLDS leaders selected the Towns' leaders and members of the Colorado City Marshal's Office (Marshals), which served as the police department for the Towns. The United States offered testimony that the FLDS \"ran the [Towns'] government\" and that the Towns' government \"was a part of the [C]hurch.\" It also offered evidence demonstrating that FLDS leaders instructed local government officials on how to perform their jobs in a way that advanced the Church's interests. Marshals, for example, ignored violations of the law-such as underage marriage, unlicensed drug distribution, and food stamp fraud-by FLDS members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Marshal's Office worked closely with FLDS leaders. Marshals helped\n   FLDS leaders evade service of process by the FBI, and ran computer checks of license plates of unfamiliar cars, when asked to do so by FLDS leaders. Cooperation between the Church and the Towns even extended to sharing tangible resources. For example, the Marshal's Office provided equipment such as tasers and night-vision binoculars to Church Security, the FLDS's private security force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Marshal's Office also helped Jeffs after he became a fugitive. Less than three years after Jeffs became head of the Church, the United States secured a warrant for his arrest on charges of sexual misconduct with children. The FBI sought the help of the Marshal's Office to locate Jeffs, but the Marshals did not cooperate; instead, they hindered the FBI's investigation and helped Jeffs hide for over a year. The Marshals also provided Jeffs with financial assistance and information on the activities of federal law enforcement to help him evade capture. The Marshals even helped destroy evidence of the crimes for which Jeffs was accused by burglarizing a former FLDS member's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States also presented evidence that members of the Marshal's Office discriminated against non-FLDS residents. It contended that the Marshals failed to provide effective police protection to residents who were not FLDS members. One non-FLDS resident testified, for example, that a Marshal drove to his home, walked out of his car, and \"just came over and grabbed my arm and [ ] bent it up around my back.\" Although the resident explained that he had a legal right to occupy the property and presented an occupancy agreement, he was charged with trespassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury returned an advisory verdict finding the Towns liable under \u00a7 12601. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court issued a judgment holding the Towns liable under \u00a7 12601 for engaging in a pattern or practice of violating the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights of their residents. The court determined that the Marshal's Office \"fostered excessive government entanglement with religion\" in an effort to \"endors[e], favor[ ], or promot[e] the FLDS Church at the expense of non-FLDS residents.\" The court also concluded that members of the Marshal's Office \"selectively enforce[ed] the law based upon religion\" and arrested several residents who were not FLDS members without probable cause. The district court ordered injunctive relief requiring the Towns to, among other things, work with a court-appointed monitor to institute national guidelines for constitutional policing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the Towns appealed the district court's finding of liability under \u00a7 12601, Hildale City has since withdrawn from this appeal. Accordingly, we address only Colorado City's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether the district court correctly interpreted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is a legal question that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    GoTo.com, Inc. v.

It asserts that \u00a7 12601 requires the United States to demonstrate that the Towns \"instituted an official municipal policy\" of violating residents' constitutional rights. The United States, on the other hand, contends that the statute \"imposes liability on municipalities for patterns of constitutional violations [that] their law enforcement officers commit, without requiring an additional showing that the municipality's policy or custom caused those violations.\" This issue-whether \u00a7 12601 imposes\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is one of first impression in our circuit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because \u00a7 1983 imposes liability only where a state actor, \"under color of some official policy, 'causes' an employee to violate another's constitutional rights,\" the Court reasoned that Congress did not intend to impose vicarious liability on municipalities \"solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The absence of that language from \u00a7 12601, therefore, suggests that Congress did not intend to limit liability to those acting under an official law or policy. Instead, the plain text of \u00a7 12601 shows that any government agent who engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons of their constitutional rights violates \u00a7 12601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, \u00a7 12601 does not limit liability to those who \"cause [citizens or persons] to be subjected\" to a deprivation of their constitutional rights.

The lack of that causal phrase in \u00a7 12601 suggests that Congress did not intend to limit local governments' liability to situations when \"the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body's officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Colorado City focuses on the legislative history of \u00a7 12601's predecessor bill, the Police Accountability Act of 1991 (PAA). H.R. 2972, 102d Cong. (1991). That history suggests that Congress enacted the PAA to \"close [a] gap in the law\"-the Justice Department's inability \"to address systematic patterns or practices of police misconduct.\" H.R. Rep. No. 102-242, pt. 1, at 137, 138 (1991). The House Judiciary Committee did not define \"pattern or practice,\" but did mention \"[t]wo cases [that] illustrate both the need for this authority and how it will work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One case involved police officers from Mason County, Washington who beat \"citizens in four incidents\" due to \"the lack of training.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-39. The other case, which arose from Goldsboro, North Carolina, involved \"a young black man who was strangled to death by city police officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139. Congress did not suggest that either incident arose from an official policy or custom. Nonetheless, Colorado City contends that this history-although history of a different and superseded law-demonstrates that Congress did not intend to impose\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability under \u00a7 12601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We disagree. At best, the PAA's legislative history supports the argument that Congress passed \u00a7 12601's predecessor bill to allow the United States to prosecute municipalities when local police departments violate constitutional rights-whether or not those violations arose from an official policy or custom. Our construction of the statute, which allows local governments to be held liable when their agents engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons of their constitutional\n   rights, accords with that statutory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When interpreting legislation, our role \"is to apply the statute as it is written-even if we think some other approach might 'accor[d] with good policy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burrage v.

Because the statutory language does not demonstrate that Congress intended to exclude local governments from\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability, we hold that \u00a7 12601 imposes liability based on general agency principles. Accordingly, the district court did not err in its construction of \u00a7 12601.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Colorado City next argues that the district court made three mistakes in its factual findings related to the Towns' alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment. First, it argues that the court erroneously included legal conclusions in its findings of fact, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Second, it contends that the district court improperly adopted the government's proposed findings of fact and failed to independently evaluate the evidence. Third, it argues that the court improperly made summary findings in its written judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We need not address these alleged errors because they do not affect the district court's holding that Colorado City violated \u00a7 12601. As the district court stated in its judgment, a finding \"of a pattern or practice of violating any one of the three constitutional amendments in question\"-the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments-\"would entitle [the United States] to relief.\" The district court held that the Towns violated all three constitutional amendments. Because Colorado City's arguments relate only to the court's findings of fact as to the Fourth Amendment violation, the court's judgment stands even if Colorado City is correct. Accordingly, any such purported error by the district court was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Colorado City urges us to nevertheless address the merits of its argument because \"the district court's erroneous factual findings exposed the Towns to unfounded liability through lawsuits that Isaac Wyler, Patrick Pipkin, and Andrew Chatwin filed for unlawful arrest.\" Those lawsuits, however, are irrelevant to our harmless error analysis because the relevant question is \"whether the [ ] verdict actually rendered in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   trial\" was attributable to the district court's error.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    508 U.S. 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).

Admission of FLDS Leaders' Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, we turn to Colorado City's argument that the district court erred when it admitted the statements of various FLDS leaders under the co-conspirator exception to the rule against hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Before trial, the United States moved to admit several FLDS leaders' statements under the co-conspirator exception.

[t]he statement is offered against a party and is ... a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" (alterations in original)). The district court held the United States' motion in abeyance pending trial, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Although a final decision on this point must await trial evidence, prior proceedings in this case cause the court to believe that the United States will succeed in producing evidence of a joint venture or concert of action between the FLDS Church and the [Towns]. Subject to the United States proving up its concerted action contention, the court is prepared to rule that out-of-court statements of FLDS leaders in furtherance of concerted action between the FLDS Church and [the Towns] [are] not hearsay and [are] admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Later during trial, the court determined that the United States had satisfied its burden of establishing the existence of a conspiracy. It instructed the jury that \"the [United States] has made its case, as far as I am concerned, for purposes of the admission of the testimony, that there was a [conspiracy].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Colorado City first argues that the district court clearly erred by finding the existence of a conspiracy between the Church and the Towns. Its contention rests largely on the claim that \"[w]hen the district court 'tentatively' ruled that the United States had established a conspiracy, the evidence was insufficient to show the existence of a conspiracy for purposes of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\" That argument fails because \"[i]t is not controlling [ ] whether sufficient independent evidence connecting [the Church] with the conspiracy existed at the time the trial judge made his first ruling under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The evidence must \"be considered in a light most favorable to the government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1236017\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/649/1345/#p1351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the United States presented extensive evidence at trial that supported the existence of a conspiracy between the Church and the Towns. That evidence included testimony that: officials from the Towns attended meetings in which FLDS leaders instructed them on how to handle legal issues in a way that advanced the Church's interests; Jeffs excommunicated the Towns' leaders who did not follow his orders; FLDS leaders determined who would occupy the Towns' government positions such as mayor, city council members, and police officers; the Marshal's Office was willfully blind to FLDS members' illegal activities; members of the Marshal's Office helped Jeffs evade capture by the FBI while he was a fugitive; and several of the Towns' officials \"spied\" on residents who the Church considered \"out of conformance with [FLDS] regulations.\" Taken together, this evidence is sufficient to establish that the Towns conspired with\n   FLDS members to advance the Church's illicit objectives. The district court did not clearly err in making that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Colorado City also argues that the district court legally erred by misinterpreting the co-conspirator exception to the rule against hearsay. That argument, however, is belied by the record. The district court repeatedly acknowledged that a statement must be made in furtherance of a conspiracy to qualify under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). Moreover, when instructing the jury, the court accurately stated the standard for statements to fall under the co-conspirator exception: \"one, certain individuals worked with the defendants toward a common goal in a joint venture or in a concerted effort and, two, that those individuals made out-of-court statements during and in furtherance of that effort.\" Accordingly, we reject Colorado City's argument that the court misconstrued the rules of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Lastly, contrary to Colorado City's argument, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting over twenty statements by FLDS leaders. Several of the statements, including several transcriptions of Jeffs' dictations and telephone calls, were properly admitted under the coconspirator exception. These statements \"catalogued and analyzed factors relevant\" to the alleged conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They include statements by Jeffs recounting instructions he gave to FLDS members to perform underage marriages, describing the appointment of FLDS members to leadership positions in the Towns, and stating that FLDS members had gone into hiding \"to not be served [ ] legal papers.\" That \"some portions of the statement[s] may have been 'idle chatter' or [']casual admissions of culpability' [does] not render\" the statements inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11289972\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/881/608/#p612\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is especially true because, during trial, the Towns moved to exclude \"the statement[s] as a whole\" rather than \"particular passages in the statement[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While certain other statements admitted by the district court and challenged by Colorado City do not fall under the co-conspirator exception in Rule 801(d)(2)(E), we hold that the district court did not err in admitting them because they were otherwise admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
