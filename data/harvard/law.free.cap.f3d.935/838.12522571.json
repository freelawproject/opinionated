When Ahmad McAdory (\"McAdory\") was charged and later sentenced under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the answer was straightforward. According to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Three occupants of the crashed car fled the scene; only two were apprehended. McAdory was not one of them, but the police found McAdory's wallet and identification in the back seat of the car, along with a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson pistol. Ballistics testing linked this pistol to a drive-by shooting that took place several weeks prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Warrants were already pending for McAdory's arrest in connection with several thefts from cell phone stores in Washington and Oregon. Seattle Police Officers went to the residence of McAdory's girlfriend and arrested McAdory on the theft warrants. McAdory told the officers he had a gun, and the officers recovered a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson pistol from his pocket. Later investigation revealed that the pistol was stolen; McAdory said he bought it from an individual in Tacoma. McAdory admitted that he had been the third, unapprehended occupant of the car and that he had been present at the drive-by shooting associated with the pistol recovered from the car. But he denied owning that pistol and claimed he had never fired a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McAdory was charged as a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The indictment alleged he had three prior convictions, each punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, for: (1) Taking a Motor Vehicle without Permission in the Second Degree, (2) Residential Burglary, and (3) Felony Harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All of McAdory's prior convictions were in Washington, which has a mandatory system of sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .94A.505(2)(a). In addition to the statutory maximum provided for each offense, Washington law prescribes a \"standard sentence range\" based on the offender's \"offender score\" and the \"seriousness level\" of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.505(2)(a)(i), 9.94A.510. The presence of certain aggravating or mitigating factors can alter a defendant's standard sentencing range.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.94A.533. The sentencing court may depart from the\n   standard sentencing range only if, after consideration of certain statutorily enumerated considerations, the court finds \"that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.94A.535.

The statutory maximum sentence was five years. The court did not make a finding of substantial and compelling reasons to justify a sentence above or below the standard range, and sentenced McAdory to fifteen days of confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the Residential Burglary conviction, McAdory pled guilty and had a standard sentencing range of 0-30 days of detention. The statutory maximum sentence was ten years. The court made no special findings, allegations, or sentencing enhancements. McAdory was sentenced to twenty-one days confinement, with credit for twenty-one days of pre-disposition detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the Felony Harassment conviction, McAdory initially received a deferred disposition and had a standard sentencing range of 0-30 days of detention. The statutory maximum sentence was five years. The court imposed no confinement, and there is no indication the court made any special findings or sentencing enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McAdory pled guilty to violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) and admitted that each of these prior offenses was \"punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\" His guilty plea also resolved some, but not all, of his state theft charges. He was sentenced to twenty-four months in prison, with credit for time served.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   McAdory timely appealed his sentence but not his conviction.

The Government suffers no prejudice because of McAdory's failure to raise the issue to the district court-at the time, under then-current law, the answer would have been obvious and in the Government's favor. On appeal, the effect of intervening law was the subject of supplemental briefing and the main focus of oral argument so the Government has had a full opportunity to present its views.
