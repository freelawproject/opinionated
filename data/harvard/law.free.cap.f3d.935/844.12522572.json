The bank's parent company declared bankruptcy. Mark Waldron, the bankruptcy estate's trustee, contended that the tax refunds should be considered part of the bankruptcy estate, and the bankruptcy court agreed. But Waldron did not exhaust the administrative claims process as required by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989\n   (\"FIRREA\"). We hold that because of the failure to exhaust, the bankruptcy court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Venture Bank (\"the Bank\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Venture Financial Group, Inc. (\"VFG\"). For each tax year before 2009, VFG filed consolidated federal tax returns on behalf of both entities, in accordance with a 1993 tax allocation agreement (\"TAA\") between VFG and the Bank. The TAA set forth guidelines for how the consolidated tax returns would be handled, specifying that, \"[f]or each taxable period, each subsidiary of the Affiliated Group shall compute its separate tax liability as if it had filed a separate tax return and shall pay such amount to the Parent.\" It further provides that \"in the case of a refund, the Parent shall make payment to each member for its share of the refund.\" The TAA has remained in place and unchanged since its execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2009, Washington State banking regulators closed the Bank and placed it into federal receivership; the FDIC was appointed as the Bank's receiver. In July 2011, the FDIC submitted a request to the IRS to allow the FDIC to serve as an alternative agent for the Bank's affiliated group, per Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6402-7(c). The FDIC sought to file amended tax returns carrying back losses incurred by the Bank and claiming refunds not previously pursued. The FDIC notified VFG of this request. Although VFG objected to \"the FDIC being [its] agent with the IRS,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the IRS granted the FDIC's request to act as an alternative agent. Between August 2011 and September 2013, the FDIC filed a series of amended tax returns to recover refunds owed to the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2013, VFG filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Mark Waldron was selected as the chapter 7 trustee. In response to the bankruptcy petition, the FDIC filed a protective proof of claim, declaring that the pending tax refunds were property of the FDIC, not VFG or its bankruptcy estate, but stating a claim for payments from the estate should the VFG or the bankruptcy estate be determined to be owner of the refunds. The FDIC did not file a claim for any amount beyond the tax refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ultimately, the IRS accepted the FDIC's refund requests and paid the refunds with interest. The IRS paid some of the refunds before VFG filed for bankruptcy, and some after. In total, the FDIC received $8,471,982.36 in tax refunds from the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2014, Waldron filed this preference action in bankruptcy court against the FDIC, seeking to recover the tax refunds obtained by the FDIC as a preferential transfer. The FDIC moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing, among other things, that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over Waldron's claims because he had failed to exhaust the administrative claims process as required by FIRREA, Pub. L. No. 101-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20Stat.%20183\">\n    103 Stat. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a bench trial, the bankruptcy court issued a decision. The court first reiterated its conclusion that it had subject-matter jurisdiction despite Waldron's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, then interpreted the 1993 TAA to \"establish[ ] a creditor-debtor relationship between VFG and the Bank.\" According to the bankruptcy court, \"[a]ny tax refunds received were the property of VFG, and the Bank merely held a claim for payment against VFG for its share of the funds.\" In so ruling, the bankruptcy court rejected the FDIC's argument that the \"\n   <em>\n    Bob Richards\n   </em>\n   rule\" applies in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bob Richards Chrysler-Plymouth Corp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"275544\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/473/262/#p265\">\n    473 F.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265 (9th Cir. 1973)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (establishing the default rule that, absent an agreement to the contrary, tax refunds belong to the entity whose losses formed the basis for the refunds). Thus, the court held, the bankruptcy estate was entitled to the refunds as a voidable preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FDIC appealed the bankruptcy court's decision to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court's decision and entered final judgment on March 20, 2018. Forty-two days later, on May 1, 2018, the FDIC filed its notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first discuss whether this appeal is timely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4. Concluding that it is, we next address whether the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction in this case. We hold that FIRREA does divest the bankruptcy court of subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) provides that, generally, in a civil case, \"the notice of appeal ... must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\" Fed.

But \"if one of the parties is ... a United States agency,\" then the notice of appeal \"may be filed by any party within 60 days ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"275544\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/473/262/#p265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   r. 4(a)(1)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Waldron contends that when acting solely as a receiver, the FDIC does not qualify as a \"United States agency\" within the meaning of Rule 4, so the FDIC's notice of appeal, filed 42 days after final judgment, is untimely.

First, an FDIC receivership does perform a government function-it \"reduc[es] the losses borne by federal taxpayers when federally insured financial institutions ... fail.\"\n   <em>\n    Sahni v.

Second, the federal government maintains direct involvement in an FDIC receivership. The FDIC's board members, who oversee the FDIC in all capacities (including its receiverships), are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201812\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201812\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5491. Third, although the operations of the FDIC as receiver are financed by the assets of the failed bank, those funds are essentially government funds, as the FDIC is the successor to any assets not paid out to the failed bank's creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201812\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1821(d)(2)(A).

Instead, in that circumstance, the debtor's preference action is, for purposes of subsection (D)(i), a partial affirmative defense rather than a claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123758,10513894\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1145/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such a preference action is a partial affirmative defense because it \"arises incident to the [FDIC's]\n   <em>\n    collection\n   </em>\n   efforts\" in bankruptcy and is an \"attempt[ ] to defend [the debtor] from personal liability\" on the FDIC's proof of claim.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1153, 1155. Creating an exception to FDIC's jurisdictional bar under these narrow circumstances is justified to avoid \"requiring presentment and proof to the [FDIC] of all potential affirmative defenses that might be asserted in response to unknown and unasserted claims or actions by the [FDIC].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

A bank lent Parker North American Corporation (\"PNA\") $10 million as part of a sale-and-leaseback agreement. PNA repaid the bank $4.65 million before defaulting. PNA then filed for bankruptcy and sought to recover the $4.65 million as a preferential transfer. In response, the Resolution Trust Corporation (\"RTC\") (a predecessor to the FDIC), in its capacity as receiver for the bank, filed proofs of claim against PNA \"for the balance of the $10 million and for other sums arising from the sale and leaseback transaction,\" amounting to a total of approximately $14 million.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1148. Once RTC initiated collection efforts, PNA's preference action was converted into a partial affirmative defense. As the concurrence noted, \"[a]lthough PNA initiated the preference action, and therefore at one time may have appeared to be using that action as something more than an affirmative defense, subsequent events have made it clear that the preference action will lead at most to a setoff\" rather than an affirmative recovery of funds.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1156 (B. Fletcher, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, in contrast, Waldron's claim seeking to recover the tax refund from the FDIC is not an affirmative defense. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , the FDIC never initiated collection efforts against VFG, nor has it asserted any non-contingent claim against the bankruptcy estate. Instead, it is the FDIC that is attempting to avoid liability to VFG's bankruptcy estate, which is affirmatively seeking to recover the refund from the FDIC. Although the FDIC filed a proof of claim, that claim equals the amount sought to be recovered by Waldron and functions solely as a protective measure in the event that it is determined that the refund belongs to VFG's bankruptcy estate. The present case is thus quite different from\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   because it does not involve \"a preference action which arises incident to the [FDIC]'s\n   <em>\n    collection\n   </em>\n   efforts against the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   's narrow holding does not apply here, we consider whether to expand its exception to FIRREA to cover the present circumstances. We decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We note, first, that the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   exception is a judicially created one, inconsistent with the language of FIRREA creating an exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   so noted, observing that \" 'we do not think [\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   's] construction of the \u00a7 1821(d)(13)(D) jurisdictional bar quite squares with the statutory text.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9071252,9070263\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/1075/\">\n    348 F.3d at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   PNA's preference action did not fall under (D)(ii) because it did not relate to an \"act or omission\" of the bank or the RTC as receiver.

It is certainly not a reason to expand\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   to cover circumstances in which the proof of claim does not exceed the amount the debtor seeks to recover in a preference action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That reluctance is reinforced by the fact that\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   's other surviving rationale\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -in addition to the consideration that the preference action in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   was a partial affirmative defense to a collection claim filed in the bankruptcy-was the special expertise of bankruptcy courts.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   observed: \"Bankruptcy courts have expertise in determining preference actions, which involve legal matters unique to the Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The [FDIC], on the other hand, has no special skill in determining bankruptcy questions and, in fact, would be under no obligation to apply bankruptcy law to a debtor's preference complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123758,10513894\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1145/\">\n    24 F.3d at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So recognizing,\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   sought to \"harmonize the [Bankruptcy] Code and FIRREA and permit bankruptcy courts to determine matters in which they, and not the [FDIC], have specific expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1155-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   's emphasis on bankruptcy court expertise has little salience here. In\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , no matter how the court ruled on the preference petition, the RTC had a remaining claim against PNA's bankruptcy estate concerning the single transaction involved in the preference action. That claim needed to be addressed by the bankruptcy court in any event. And the context of that claim-an ordinary commercial transaction-was one that routinely arises in bankruptcy preference actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The bankruptcy context is of little significance in this case. The FDIC's contingent proof of claim here was entirely predicated on the success of the VFG estate's assertion of ownership of the tax refunds obtained as a result of the FDIC's filings with the IRS. No issue requiring interpretation of the preference provisions of the bankruptcy code or determination of any claim in bankruptcy will arise if Waldron's assertion of ownership fails. Resolving that ownership question involves applying fairly arcane questions of federal tax law concerning the concept of consolidated filing groups, intertwined with a federal default ownership rule that can be overridden pursuant to state contract law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bob Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"275544\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/473/262/#p265\">\n    473 F.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As no bankruptcy law or rule or bankruptcy claim-related determination\n   will be relevant in resolving the critical ownership dispute, that dispute is not a matter as to which \"bankruptcy courts ... have specific expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123758,10513894\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/1145/\">\n    24 F.3d at 1155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, we conclude that although\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   's reasoning may be wide-ranging, its holding is not applicable and its other extant rationale-bankruptcy court expertise-is not here pertinent.
