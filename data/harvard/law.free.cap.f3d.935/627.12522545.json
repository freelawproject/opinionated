In July 2017, through appointed counsel, he moved for \u00a7 2255 relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . The district court denied the motion as untimely but issued a certificate of appealability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

During that time, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court decided the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case. In April 2016, believing\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated his sentence, Chachanko wrote his South Dakota Federal Public Defender\n   (\"FPD\") asking for \"some information and paperwork so I could file before the June deadline.\" The FPD wrote back on May 2, 2016, stating that it was reviewing potential\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claims, and \"[i]f we conclude that you are eligible, we will file an appropriate motion to reduce your sentence within one year of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision which is the deadline to file. If we find that you are not, we will let you know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By letter dated June 15, 2016, the FPD informed Chachanko that he was not eligible for\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   relief \"because recent Eighth Circuit case law has held that a Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under the force clause of 924(c).\" The letter stated that the FPD would \"not file any motion seeking to reduce your sentence as a result.\" The letter included instructions \"on how to file your own 2255\" if \"you disagree with our conclusion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For unknown reasons, Chachanko did not receive the June 2016 letter; it was returned to the FPD unopened. He finally spoke with an FPD attorney around August 24, 2016. The attorney informed him that the June letter had been returned unopened, and the FPD had not filed a \u00a7 2255 petition on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2017-a month after his release from the SHU and almost a year after the statute of limitations for a\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   claim expired-Chachanko filed a pro se letter seeking \u00a7 2255 relief. In July 2017, through appointed counsel, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court denied the motion as untimely, ruling \"Chachanko has failed to show that he diligently pursued his rights.\" It found that he \"did nothing between June 27, 2016, and August 24, 2016, such as contact the court, to check on the status of his claim,\" and that he did not take \"any steps ... to pursue his claim in the 233 days-or more than seven months-that passed between August 24, 2016, when Chachanko first learned that the FPD had not filed a motion to reduce his sentence, and April 13, 2017, when Chachanko filed his pro se motion to reduce his sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Chachanko concedes his \"petition was not timely.\" But he asserts the court should consider the merits of his claim based on equitable tolling. This court reviews \"a denial of equitable tolling\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ,\" and \"underlying fact findings for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     English v.

Equitable tolling is an \"extraordinary\" remedy that \"affords the otherwise time-barred petitioner an exceedingly narrow window of relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Jihad v. Hvass\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499667\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/803/#p805\">\n    267 F.3d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805 (8th Cir. 2001). \"A petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling only if he shows '(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.' \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Burks v.

Indeed, based on what he was told earlier, he believed that hearing nothing from the FPD meant that his lawyers had filed, or would be filing, the petition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This is not an extraordinary circumstance. This court considered a similar claim in\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n    735 F.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2013). There, the defendant argued that his \u00a7 2255 filing was late due, in part, to confinement in a SHU. Like Chachanko, he also argued that \"he mistakenly relied upon his attorney's assertion that she would file a section 2255\n   motion on his behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Muhammad\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n    735 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court affirmed the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion. First, this court held that \"Muhammad's five-month confinement in the Special Housing Unit does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting the application of equitable tolling.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Next, this court held that \"Muhammad's allegations against [his attorney]\" do not show extraordinary circumstances even though she \"initially stated she would file the section 2255 motion on his behalf and then quit communicating with him.\"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n    at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, this court noted that the attorney did not lie about deadlines, tell him she would file a motion, fail to communicate critical information about his case, or withhold paperwork necessary to file the motion.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Chachanko's case is less extraordinary. Here, his attorney did not stop communicating with him. Rather, the attorney sent a letter stating she would not file a claim on his behalf. Chachanko's failure to receive the letter, especially in light of his failure to follow up about the status of his claim, is not an extraordinary circumstance.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722963\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/812/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Kreutzer v.
