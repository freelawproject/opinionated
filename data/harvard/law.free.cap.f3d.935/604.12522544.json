First Student, Inc. is the largest provider of school transportation services in North America. Its bid to provide transportation services for Saginaw Public School District was first selected in October 2011, but the School District decided not to proceed because the academic year had already begun. First Student's bid was again selected in February 2012 and contract negotiations began. A few weeks later, First Student representatives met with School District transportation employees who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement and stated it would offer employment to existing employees, and expressed the desire to retain as many of them as possible. First Student now petitions for review of a Decision and Order of the National Labor Relations Board finding it was a \"perfectly clear\" successor employer and violated the National Labor Relations Act by changing the terms and conditions on which it would hire the incumbent employees without bargaining with their union. First Student contends that the Board applied the wrong legal standard, departed without justification from its precedent, and made factual findings regarding notice of the new terms and conditions that are not supported by\n   substantial evidence. The Board has cross petitioned for enforcement of its Order. We deny First Student's petition and grant enforcement of the Board's Order in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act to \"redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management ... by conferring certain affirmative rights on employees and by placing certain enumerated restrictions on the activities of employers.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

These employees (hereinafter \"unit employees\") were jointly represented by the United Steel Workers International Union and Local 8410 (collectively \"the Union\"). The most recent collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between the Saginaw Board of Education and the Union covered the period of August 27, 2010 through August 31, 2012. The Board of Education voted in October 2011 to accept First Student's services but the School District's Superintendent decided not to proceed for that academic year; in November the School District informed First Student that it planned to open a new bidding process in 2012. It did, and First Student submitted a new bid on February 3, 2012. The School District again selected First Student as the winning bidder, and the parties began negotiating a transportation services contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While contract negotiations were ongoing, the School District arranged for First Student officials to discuss the impending transition in management with the unit employees. On March 2, 2012, approximately 40 of the 55 unit employees attended a meeting with Douglas Meek, First Student's area general manager, and Daniel Kinsley, its development manager. Meek told the employees that once the contract was approved, First Student would offer employment to current employees who submitted an application and met its hiring criteria, which included a background check, physical examination, and drug screening, criteria that the Board found were similar to the School District's hiring criteria and common throughout the bus transportation industry. In responding to employees' questions, Meek testified that he told the employees that First Student \"wanted to hire as many individuals as possible,\" that it would recognize the Union if it hired \"51 percent of the existing workforce,\" and that it \"typically\" hires \"80 to 90 percent of the existing workforce.\" Hr'g Tr. 420 (July 25, 2013). With respect to how many hours of work employees would be guaranteed, Meek stated that First Student \"would know more about that\" once it established bus routes for the coming year, which it would do \"using the [School] District's routing system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 421. Meek also said matters such as paid time off, vacation pay, and sick pay would be \"subject to negotiations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 421-22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 460 (July 26, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The School District and First Student reached agreement on a five-year transportation services contract in early May 2012. On May 16, the Board of Education held a public meeting to consider whether to approve the contract. In response to Board questions, Kinsley stated that First Student would hire unit employees if they met its hiring criteria, that it \"intended to maintain their current wages,\" and that if 51 percent or more of the incumbents were hired it would recognize the Union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 463-64, 480. The Board of Education voted to approve the contract. Later that day, Kinsley spoke with a Union representative and several unit employees, repeating that First Student's goal was to hire all unit employees who met the hiring criteria, that it would \"recognize the Union if [it] hired 51 percent or more\" of them, and that \"their wages would be maintained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 466, 483. By its terms, the contract was a binding agreement as of May 16. The School Superintendent signed it on May 24 and First Student signed it on June 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 17, the day after the Board of Education approved the contract and it took effect, First Student officials met with nearly all the unit employees. The officials distributed a memorandum inviting them to apply for employment. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in the memorandum deviated from the CBA in important respects. For example, the memorandum stated that First Student would maintain incumbent employees' current hourly rate of pay for transportation duties but reduce the rate of pay for \"non-student transportation duties,\" such as \"attending training, employee or school meetings, clerical work, bus washing, etc.\" Also, significantly, it guaranteed fewer hours of work than the CBA. Incumbent employees were instructed to submit employment applications no later than May 23 in order to retain their seniority and current wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 18, the Union contacted First Student requesting to bargain over the terms of a new labor agreement, using the existing CBA as a starting point. First Student responded that it did not know whether it would hire enough of the unit employees to trigger its obligation to recognize and bargain with the Union. The Union agreed to follow up in July, when First Student would be further along in its hiring process. During July and August, the Union's repeated attempts to schedule bargaining with First Student produced no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Meanwhile, First Student began hiring employees. After conducting interviews and background checks, it made offers of employment to 42 of the approximately 55 unit employees. Two offer letters were issued on June 27, a third on July 11, and the remainder on August 1. By August 17, 2012, First Student had hired 38 employees, 36 of whom had formerly worked for the School District. When First Student began its operations for the 2012-2013 academic year on August 27, it had hired 51 employees, 41 of whom were unit employees. That same day, First Student announced an employee attendance policy that differed from the policy in the Union's prior CBA with the School District. In late August, the Union renewed its request to bargain, but First Student still did not come to the bargaining table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 21, the Steel Workers Union (acting through another Local) filed charges with the Board's Regional Office alleging that First Student had violated Section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act by \"refus[ing] to recognize and bargain with\" the Union and by failing to negotiate \"over initial terms and conditions of employment\" even though it was a \"perfectly clear\" successor to the School District. On September 25, First Student offered to schedule collective bargaining negotiations in November. The Union responded that it would agree to wait until November provided First Student would abide by the terms of the prior CBA in the meantime. First Student replied that it had no obligation to abide by the CBA and offered to begin negotiations in October if the Union would drop the pending unfair-labor-practice charges. Although the Union did not drop the charges, the parties began collective bargaining negotiations on October 17, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On April 30, 2013, the Acting General Counsel issued a complaint alleging that First Student had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act. An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") held an evidentiary hearing on July 24-26, 2013. The ALJ found that First Student was a successor to the School District but not a \"perfectly clear\" successor because it had announced new terms of employment when it distributed employment applications to unit employees on May 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    First Student, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-CA-092212, slip op. at 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206576819\">\n    2013 WL 6576819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.L.R.B.

Not until May 17 - six days before First Student's application deadline for unit employees desiring to keep their wage rates and seniority - did First Student inform employees that it intended to decrease their wages and guaranteed hours.

First Student could have declined to meet with the unit employees on March 2 or told them that it planned to exercise the right to set initial terms and conditions of employment.

Normally, the new employer would not be a successor until it actually hired a majority of bargaining unit employees, but the Court recognized that sometimes it is \"perfectly clear that the new employer plans to retain all of the employees in the unit\" (and that the previous employees will constitute a majority), in which case it is obliged to consult (bargain) with the union before making changes.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170384\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/272/\">\n    406 U.S. at 294-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170384\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/272/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (In other words,\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   would apply.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is crucial to note that the only factor the Supreme Court relied on to distinguish a so-called \"perfectly clear successor\" from an ordinary successor was the employer's plan to hire\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the bargaining unit employees, presumably as a group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In our\n   case, both the ALJ and the Board found Petitioner anticipated hiring only a majority of employees, not that it planned to hire\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the bargaining unit employees. In a meeting on March 2, Petitioner's representative emphasized applicants would have to pass its hiring criteria, and that in past cases where Petitioner had taken over in a conversion, between 80 and 90 percent of the existing work force was hired. Still, Petitioner's representative warned that it would only bargain with the union\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   it hired a majority of the bargaining unit employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority observes that the hiring criteria used by the former employer (the School District) was essentially the same, so it would be expected that the employees would qualify, but that ignores a new organization's possibly different application of criteria, such as driving tests. It is clear to me that the Petitioner intended to make individual decisions rather than planned to hire all the bargaining unit employees as a group - which is what the Supreme Court contemplated. Indeed, only 41 out of 55 were actually hired. The ALJ determined that under\n   <em>\n    Fall River\n   </em>\n   , it was not until August 17 that Petitioner became an ordinary successor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Board implicitly recognized this hole in its case by arguing before us that the\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   test for a \"perfectly clear successor\" could be satisfied if an employer planned to hire\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   of the bargaining unit employees (apparently some number between a majority and all). Resp't's Br. 21. But that just flies in the face of the Supreme Court's language and represents a regulatory agency's rebellion. Indeed, in both\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781128,509083\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/595/664/\">\n    595 F.2d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    S &amp; F Market Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542353,3664954\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/354/\">\n    570 F.3d at 358-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we reiterated the requirement that the perfectly clear successor is one that plans to hire\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the bargaining unit employees of the predecessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The majority reasons that in\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   , we determined that we were obliged to defer to the Board's interpretation of the perfectly clear successor concept. A careful analysis of the opinion reveals that the Court did not actually defer to the Board's interpretation of the term \"perfectly clear successor,\" but rather to what indications would be relevant in determining whether or not an employer planned to hire all of the incumbent bargaining unit employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirmed the Board's determination that Boeing, the successor employer, was not a \"perfectly clear successor\" because it had announced before taking over that it would pay lower wages and benefits. The Board reasoned - which we thought logical - that the employer who announced that it would pay lower wages and benefits was not planning to retain\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the bargaining unit employees. We recognized,\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781128,509083\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/595/664/\">\n    595 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   673 n.41, that deferring to a Board's interpretation of a Supreme Court opinion was not equivalent to the level of deference we give an agency's interpretation of a statute, but we noted that the Board's reasoning was consistent with the spirit and purpose of the Supreme Court's short definition of a perfectly clear successor. So we were actually deferring to the Board's evidentiary finding that the employer did not meet the Supreme Court's test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Of course, if the second employer were to, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   , indicate that it planned to hire all of the predecessor's bargaining unit employees (and that would be a majority of its workforce), employees would be entitled to assume that their\n   wages and working conditions would remain unchanged. And if the successor were to institute new wages and working conditions upon the transition, the Board's concern with misleading employees would be legitimate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To be sure, this is not the first case in which the Board has asserted its \"less than all\" position,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spitzer Akron, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=219%20N.L.R.B.%2020\">\n    219 NLRB 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1975),\n   <em>\n    enforced\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"315566\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/540/841/\">\n    540 F.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1976), but I believe the Board is clearly wrong as a matter of law. Unfortunately for Petitioner, it forfeited - even expressly waived at oral argument - a challenge to the Board's transformation of the word\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   to a much lesser number. Therefore, I agree with the majority concerning the failure of Petitioner to preserve this argument. I have, nonetheless, written about this troubling Board effort to frustrate the Supreme Court and our Court's interpretation of a perfectly clear successor for the benefit of a subsequent case. I would not ordinarily discuss a matter not raised, but it is impossible to understand what the Board has done without realizing how convoluted has been its abandonment of the Supreme Court's test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In that regard, I believe the Board's further expansion of its perfectly clear successor doctrine is also illegal. The Board, as in this case, now asserts that a successor - who expects to hire some number more than a majority - is a perfectly clear successor\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   it makes clear that it intends to alter the bargaining unit's compensation or working conditions. Otherwise, in the Board's view, employees could be \"misled,\" thinking the status quo would be maintained and thereby encouraged to remain. The Board, as should be apparent, has taken the logic of\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   and reversed it. Whereas\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   approved the Board concluding that a successor who proposed a diminution of compensation or working conditions could not be thought to hire\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the bargaining unit employees. Now the Board - having ignored the \"all\" requirement - concludes that a successor who plans to hire some number more than a majority is a perfectly clear successor if it does not affirmatively state that it plans to change the compensation package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If the Board had properly applied\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    S &amp; F Market Street\n   </em>\n   limiting the perfectly clear successor to a successor who planned to hire all of the bargaining unit employees, this would have been totally inapposite. Let me explain. If the record showed that a successor planned to hire all of the predecessor's bargaining unit employees as a group and nothing more about its plans, it would be assumed, legitimately, that a planned seamless transition is contemplated in which compensation and benefits would be maintained (which is what the Supreme Court obviously envisioned). It would only be if the successor announced an intention to\n   <em>\n    lower\n   </em>\n   the wages and benefits that one could conclude, as was true in\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   , that the employer did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   plan to hire all of the bargaining unit employees. Once the Board illegally expanded the concept to include an employer who plans to hire most of the bargaining unit employees - only those who qualify - then it further expanded the perfectly clear successor doctrine by determining that the successor employer was stuck with a perfectly clear successor restraint unless it affirmatively stated that it intended to change wages and working conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Petitioner did object to the Board's imposition of the burden on the successor, who wished to avoid perfectly clear successor status, to affirmatively state that it\n   planned to change the employment conditions. It argued that the Board's requirement goes far beyond any concern with misleading employees and is, therefore, arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree, but as I have explained, the Board's concern would be irrelevant - at least with regard to the definition of a perfectly clear successor - if the Board had legitimately applied\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Still, even assuming the Board's convoluted interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   was legitimate and Petitioner was obliged to signal that it wished to make changes in working conditions in order to avoid being classified as a perfectly clear successor, I think the Board's determination that Petitioner did not disclose that it planned a change lacked substantial evidence. Petitioner gave every indication that should it take over, working conditions could change. Besides indicating that it wouldn't even have an obligation to bargain unless it hired 51 percent of the employees, in response to questions, it said that working hours would be determined by the school district's routing system and that employment conditions, like paid time off, vacation pay, and sick pay, would be subject to negotiations - which certainly indicates that Petitioner did not intend to commit to the same conditions. The majority determines that First Student's statement that certain matters - terms and conditions of employment - would be subject to negotiations with the union indicates that it did not intend to put in those terms initially. But that conclusion misunderstands labor law. Even if a successor employer is allowed under\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   to put in place terms and conditions unilaterally, it would be obliged to bargain with the union; it just means it can bargain from its own base. The sufficiency of these statements is particularly clear given the context in which they were made. The transition from a public to private employer would put any reasonable employee on notice that economic \"changes were afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    S &amp; F Market Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542353,3664954\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/354/\">\n    570 F.3d at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Why else would the municipality make the change?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   I am emboldened in my view that the Board's factual conclusions lack substantial evidence because the basic question is the employer's intention - whether or not it planned to maintain the municipality's compensation package. We should bear in mind that the ALJ - whose judgment on credibility issues must be weighed heavily by the Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931620\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/474/#p496\">\n    340 U.S. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931620\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/474/#p496\">\n    71 S.Ct. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%20456\">\n    95 L.Ed. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1951) - concluded that Petitioner did not mislead employees and gave fair indication that working conditions would not necessarily be continued under its auspices. The majority thinks that the ALJ's determination, as to what plans Petitioner had, is not as important as how its views were understood by employees, relying on\n   <em>\n    Fall River\n   </em>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Fall River\n   </em>\n   is a case dealing with a much more complicated question as to whether a new company is a successor, not a perfectly clear successor. It involves a range of issues and the Supreme Court did conclude that how the employees, who leave one company and end up at a second, see their status is very important in determining whether the second company is a successor, but at no time did the Supreme Court ever suggest that\n   <em>\n    Fall River\n   </em>\n   , in any way, modified\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   , or its narrow exception. The perfectly clear successor test relies entirely on the successor's plans, not the employee's views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Still, even if the employee's view of the Petitioner's plans are determinative, the\n   Board's hypothesis that Petitioner's plans were not \"sufficiently clear to put [the employees] on notice that there would be changes in the initial terms and conditions of their employment\" - even given the Board's expertise - is arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Student, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20NLRB%20No.%2013\">\n    366 NLRB No. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , slip op. at 4 (Feb. 6, 2018). I can't imagine that any employee was misled into believing that existing terms and conditions were sacrosanct. The Board is simply putting an unreasonable burden on a successor inconsistent with the Supreme Court's clear objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That brings me to the most important issue that Petitioner did preserve. It argued that it was a legal error for the Board to conclude that it was a perfectly clear successor as of March 2. I agree. At that point, Petitioner was not even an employer - it was still in negotiations. To be sure, if in March Petitioner had unequivocally stated that it planned to hire all of the bargaining unit employees, it would be legitimate to determine that it was a perfectly clear successor when it did complete the transition. Yet the Board determined that it had,\n   <em>\n    as of March 2\n   </em>\n   , a bargaining obligation with the union. In my view, that is ridiculous. That was four months before the ALJ, in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Fall River\n   </em>\n   standard. determined that Petitioner was an ordinary successor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Indeed, if at that stage it had entered into negotiations with the union, it would have violated Section 8(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Altmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285570\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/731/\">\n    366 U.S. at 737-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285570\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/731/\">\n    81 S.Ct. 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding employer violated the Act by recognizing union that claimed, but did not demonstrate, that it represented a majority - notwithstanding employer's good faith);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Majestic Weaving Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20N.L.R.B.%20859\">\n    147 NLRB 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860-61 (1964) (holding that employer violated the Act when it negotiated agreement with union contingent upon union gaining majority support),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20NLRB%20No.%20135\">\n    149 NLRB No. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 9, 1964),\n   <em>\n    enforcement denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"842209\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/355/854/\">\n    355 F.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1966). The majority implies that my reference to\n   <em>\n    Altmann\n   </em>\n   is a new argument, but relying on a Supreme Court case that supports Petitioner's argument is never a new argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amax Land Co. v. Quarterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670909,11665095\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/1356/\">\n    181 F.3d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1363 (D.C. Cir. 1999). And since Petitioner made the contention that it could not become a perfectly clear successor as of March 2, it is quite permissible to draw attention to a case illustrating why that argument is sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It is black letter labor law that a bargaining obligation includes the requirement to bargain over a union's proposal, including one to change the status quo. Yet simply by recognizing and bargaining with the union, First Student would be in violation of Section 8(a)(2) because it would be telling employees who was their bargaining representative before the employees have chosen. In other words, to simply recognize a union as the bargaining agent - without the necessary showing of employee support - is a violation of Section 8(a)(2) - whether or not a new agreement is reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The majority suggests, based on statements of the Board's counsel (who did not object that 8(a)(2) was a legitimate consideration), that the March 2 bargaining obligation was not\n   <em>\n    really\n   </em>\n   a bargaining obligation in which an employer must respond to a union's proposal, but that is simply inconsistent with the Board decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Student,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20NLRB%20No.%2013\">\n    366 NLRB No. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , slip op. at 5 (finding \"that the General Counsel has met his burden of proving that the Respondent became a 'perfectly clear' successor,\n   with an obligation to bargain over initial terms, on March 2\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20NLRB%20No.%2013\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.13 (concluding that \"there is no impediment to holding that the Respondent's bargaining obligation attached on March 2\"). And that it was only some months later that First Student was determined to have delayed bargaining in violation of the Act, which the majority emphasizes, is absolutely irrelevant as to its legal status on March 2. The majority acknowledges that First Student had an obligation, but it was only an obligation to bargain over initial terms, but that is exactly what the Supreme Court has held to be illegal without a showing of majority status. The Board's counsel's suggestion that Petitioner could have waited to bargain until it had hired a substantial and representative complement of its workforce is a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   explanation and inconsistent with the Board's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Board seems to have recognized that it was on thin ice relying on March 2 because it suggested an alternative date that Petitioner became a perfectly clear successor. That date was May 16 - only the day before Petitioner announced its actual working conditions package. Even if the Board's theory that a company becomes a perfectly clear successor if it plans to hire most, rather than all, and moreover, does not affirmatively state that the employment conditions will be significantly different were correct, relying on May 16 statements, is arbitrary and capricious (unreasonable). After all, the Board's theory is such statements are necessary so that employees are not misled to their detriment, and it is pure fantasy to imagine that anyone would be disadvantaged by a statement on May 16 that was different from the actual terms and conditions announced on May 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The majority suggests that even if employees were not misled on May 16, only one day before Petitioner invited applications, nevertheless the Board of Education, with whom Petitioner was contracting, relied on Petitioner's statements on May 16. But what that has to do with disadvantaging the employees, or even the price of tea, is beyond me. The majority's creative suggestion is not part of the Board's decision, nor could it be. It has nothing to do with the employer's labor relations or the National Labor Relations Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This case discloses a rather disturbing effort on the part of the Board to substantially nullify a right given to employers, under a Supreme Court opinion, by vastly expanding a narrow exception to that right.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Of course, even if a successor plans to hire all the bargaining unit employees, one or more might drop off.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As a part-time law school professor, I am struck by the impact of the decline of the Socratic method and the reliance on computers - which pick up stray comments in opinions - leading to the atrophy of legal analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The majority's accusation that my position is indifferent to the misrepresentation of employees is inaccurate.
