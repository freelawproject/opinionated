We grant Qualcomm's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FTC alleged that Qualcomm, a leader in cellular standard technology, violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act in connection with the licensing of its standard essential patents (\"SEPs\") and sale of its code division multiple access (\"CDMA\") and premium long-term evolution (\"LTE\") modem chips. Specifically, Qualcomm refused to license SEPs to rival chip suppliers, allegedly in contravention of commitments Qualcomm made to certain standard setting organizations in the industry; refused to sell modem chips to any original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") that lacked patent licensing agreements with Qualcomm; and imposed in its OEM licensing agreements excessive royalty rates on a per-handset basis, irrespective of whether the handset contained a Qualcomm chip or a chip from one of Qualcomm's competitors. The complaint alleged that the upshot of this conduct was to maintain Qualcomm's monopoly in the CDMA and premium LTE chip markets and impose an anticompetitive surcharge on its competitors' chips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a ten-day trial, the district court issued extensive findings of fact and determined that Qualcomm's practices violate the antitrust laws. The district court concluded that Qualcomm (1) has an antitrust duty to license its SEPs to rival chip suppliers, and (2) engaged in anticompetitive conduct by using its royalty rates to effectively impose a surcharge on its competitors' chips. The district court entered a multipart permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Qualcomm seeks a stay of the injunction's provisions requiring that Qualcomm make exhaustive SEP licenses available to its competitors, prohibiting Qualcomm from conditioning chip sales on the purchase of patent licenses, and requiring Qualcomm to negotiate or renegotiate its license agreements in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To determine whether to issue a stay pending appeal, we consider \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\"\n   <em>\n    Nken v.

Applying those factors here, we grant Qualcomm's motion for a partial stay of the injunction pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is well-settled that, \"as a general matter, the Sherman Act 'does not restrict the ... right of [a] trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v.

The Supreme Court recognized a very limited exception to that general rule when a monopolist terminated a voluntary and profitable course of dealing with a competitor and sacrificed short-term benefits to exclude competition in the long run.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aspen Skiing Co. v.

And, here, even the two government agencies charged with the enforcement of antitrust laws-the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v. AT&amp;T Mobility LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516107\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/848/#p862\">\n    883 F.3d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862 (9th Cir. 2018) (en banc)-disagree as to whether Qualcomm's conduct implicates the duty to deal. Indeed, while the FTC prosecuted this antitrust enforcement action, the DOJ filed a statement of interest expressing its stark disagreement that Qualcomm has any antitrust duty to deal with rival chip suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We are satisfied that Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits of the district court's determination that Qualcomm has an antitrust duty to license its SEPs to rival chip suppliers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lair v.

Qualcomm likewise has made the requisite showing that its practice of charging OEMs royalties for its patents on a per-handset basis does not violate the antitrust laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

The injunction requires Qualcomm to enter new contractual relationships and renegotiate existing ones on a large scale. The fundamental business changes that the injunction imposes cannot be easily undone should Qualcomm prevail on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NCAA v.

Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v.

Although the hardship to the party opposing the stay and the public interest usually merge when the government is the opposing party,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p426\">\n    556 U.S. at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p426\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this case is unique, as the government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest. Indeed, the Department of Defense and Department of Energy aver that the injunction threatens national security, and the DOJ posits that the injunction has the effect of\n   <em>\n    harming\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    benefiting\n   </em>\n   consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Whether the district court's order and injunction represent a trailblazing application of the antitrust laws, or instead an improper excursion beyond the outer limits of the Sherman Act, is a matter for another day. For now, weighing all relevant factors, we conclude that the requested stay is warranted. Therefore, pending the resolution of this appeal or until further order of this court, we stay the portions of the district court's injunction requiring that (1) \"Qualcomm must make exhaustive SEP licenses available to modem-chip suppliers,\" and (2) \"Qualcomm must not condition the supply of modem chips on a customer's patent license status\" and \"must negotiate or renegotiate license terms\" with its customers in that respect.
