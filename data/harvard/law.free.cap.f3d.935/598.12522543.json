The trademarks were associated with the slogan\n   \"Pork: The Other White Meat.\" The agreement required the Board to pay $3 million per year for twenty years, but permitted the Board, with advance notice, to cancel the contract for any reason. In 2011, the Board adopted a new marketing campaign and stopped using three of the four trademarks, but it declined to end the contract and continued to make the annual payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, the Humane Society of the United States, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, and Harvey Dillenburg filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of Agriculture. The Humane Society is an animal-protection organization; Iowa Citizens is an organization of farmers; and Dillenburg is an individual pork farmer. They sought to challenge both USDA's initial approval of the contract and its later approvals of the annual payments. They contend that the contract impermissibly funds the Council's lobbying activities, which has become more apparent as the Board continues to pay for trademarks that it no longer uses. The complaint alleges that this misuse of checkoff funds \"diminishes the resources available for promotions or other legitimate programs\" under the Act, thus \"diminishing Mr. Dillenburg's return on his compelled checkoff investment.\" J.A. 51. The complaint further alleges that Dillenburg is harmed by the payment of funds to the Council, \"a lobbying organization that pushes for policies\" he opposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, the district court held that none of the plaintiffs adequately alleged standing.\n   <em>\n    Humane Soc'y v.

Cir. 2019). On that score, Dillenburg's declaration says little. Without elaboration, it speaks of a \"direct economic benefit\" that other promotions would have provided. J.A. 147. But on summary judgment, a party cannot establish standing with \"conclusory allegations of an affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

For that reason, in\n   <em>\n    Swanson Group Manufacturing LLC v.

Cir. 2015), we held that a declaration asserting only \"economic loss and hardship,\" which \"told nothing about the nature\" of the loss, was insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273114,4279670\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/235/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273114,4279670\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/235/\">\n    at 242-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). The same is true here-Dillenburg fails to elaborate on the \"direct economic benefit\" that he allegedly has lost because of the Board's misdeeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In concluding that Dillenburg proved standing, the district court reasoned that Dillenburg, as a pork producer, \"is affected by the market price for pork.\"\n   <em>\n    Humane Society III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523391\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/5/#p15\">\n    290 F. Supp. 3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perhaps so, but Dillenburg's declaration lacks any indication that the \"price for pork\" was \"affected\" by the alleged misuse of checkoff funds. The court assumed this critical fact based on\n   <em>\n    Carpenters Industrial Council v. Zinke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276801\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1/\">\n    854 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

Yet\n   <em>\n    Carpenters\n   </em>\n   did not displace settled law that courts cannot \"presume the missing facts necessary to establish an element of standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273114,4279670\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/235/\">\n    790 F.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). To the contrary, our decision carefully combed \"the complaint and declarations to assess whether the plaintiff's assertions suffice to show the elements of standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Carpenters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276801\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1/\">\n    854 F.3d at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We explained that the declarations in that case identified specific \"harms ranging from lost sales and diminished production to closures and layoffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276801\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276801\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1/\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, Dillenburg's one-page declaration makes no similar showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The declaration suggests a second injury: Dillenburg \"oppose[s] the misuse of checkoff funds ... for the purpose of influencing legislation,\" because he \"believe[s]\" those efforts are \"harmful to [him] and other independent farmers.\" J.A. 147. This theory of injury also falls short. Plaintiffs\n   cannot predicate Article III standing on a \"mere interest in a problem or an ideological injury.\"\n   <em>\n    PETA v.

Here, Dillenburg does not explain how his pork business is harmed by lobbying to promote the pork industry, let alone identify a specific lobbying activity that causes him a concrete injury. Instead, Dillenburg highlights his general opposition to the Council's lobbying and the government's funding of it. This declares \"only a generally available grievance about government,\" which \"does not state an Article III case or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Defs. of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    504 U.S. at 573-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs cannot salvage this case based on the possible standing of the Humane Society or Iowa Citizens. On summary judgment, neither organization filed any standing declarations or affidavits. And now in this Court, the plaintiffs do not assert the standing of these organizations as an alternative ground for reaching the merits. The plaintiffs thus have twice forfeited any claim that these organizations have standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scenic Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354576\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/42/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   53 n.4 (\"Although a party cannot forfeit a claim that we lack jurisdiction, it can forfeit a claim that we possess jurisdiction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the plaintiffs offer no evidence that the Board's alleged misuse of checkoff funds caused them to suffer an injury in fact, we vacate the district court's order and remand with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
