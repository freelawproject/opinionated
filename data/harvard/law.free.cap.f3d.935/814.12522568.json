But the second definition is not. A review of state statutes indicates that only Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming incorporate any form of physical pain into their definitions. I therefore conclude that the generic federal definition of \"serious bodily injury\" does not include \"prolonged physical pain\" as that term is defined in Nevada law. As a result, Nevada's offense is not a categorical match for the generic federal definition of aggravated assault and is not a \"crime of violence\" under the enumerated offense clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Attempted battery with substantial bodily harm under Nevada law is not a crime of violence under either the elements clause or the enumerated offenses clause. I respectfully dissent and would affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
