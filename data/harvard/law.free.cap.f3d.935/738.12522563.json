As a result of the infant's death, the Hawai'i Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") listed both Bird and her husband on the state's Central Child Abuse Registry (\"CCAR\"). Bird's husband later confessed to killing their infant baby and the criminal investigation concluded that Bird was not a suspect. DHS, however, did not remove Bird's name from the CCAR. Throughout this time, DHS never told Bird that she was listed on the registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Bird did not learn that she had been listed on the CCAR until June 2012-more than five years later-when the report turned up on a background check. When a request for a hearing and various communications with DHS failed to result in Bird's removal from the CCAR, Bird's attorney threatened DHS in May 2013 with suit in federal court. Bird did not file suit, however, until July 20, 2015-more than two years after her extensive communications with DHS and previous threat to sue. The district court determined that Bird's claims brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   were untimely and granted summary judgment in favor of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Because Bird's complaint is not subject to any exception from the normal discovery rule of accrual, we agree that Bird's claim accrued no later than May 2013, when Bird threatened to sue DHS if she was not removed from the CCAR. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.

At the appeal, however, the listed individual remains subject to the requirements for expungement laid out in Hawai'i Revised Statutes \u00a7 350-2, which at all relevant times in this case required the listed individual to prove that the report\n   was \"unsubstantiated,\" in other words, that it was \"frivolous or ... made in bad faith.\" Act of May 18, 2017, sec. 3, \u00a7 350-2(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Haw.%20Sess.%20Laws%2060\">\n    2017 Haw.

Haw. Admin. R. \u00a7 17-1610-12(c). Instead, the listed individual's exclusive means by which to expunge his or her listing in the CCAR is to prevail at an adjudicatory hearing before the family court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n    Haw.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 587A-28(d)(1). Significantly, if DHS returns custody of the child and settles the family court proceeding before it reaches the adjudicatory phase, the statutory scheme leaves listed individuals who are wrongfully listed in the CCAR with no recourse for expunging their names.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2003, Bird married Frank Fontana and two years later gave birth to a daughter, T.F. Fontana, who worked for the Navy, was subsequently transferred to Hawai'i. Bird and their daughter accompanied him to Hawai'i to live in base housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after their arrival, in February 2007, Bird gave birth to a second daughter, C.F. Over the next six weeks, between early February and March 20, C.F. was examined by over thirty healthcare personnel in multiple well-child checks, and as she was treated for jaundice, wheezing, apnea induced by acid reflux, and a fever. Over the course of this treatment, C.F. underwent two chest x-rays, neither of which showed any injuries. None of the doctors and nurses that treated C.F. ever noted any signs of abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 28, Bird returned home from a dentist appointment to find Fontana administering CPR to C.F. C.F. was transported by ambulance to Tripler Army Medical Center, where she died of cardiac arrest. The doctors and nurses who examined C.F. noted multiple bruises on her body, evidence of a fractured rib, and evidence of possible fractures in her femurs. As a result, an emergency department nurse at the hospital called the Child Welfare Services branch (\"CWS\") of DHS to report a case of possible child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In accordance with its regulations, DHS listed both Bird and Fontana on the CCAR and initiated an investigation. On April 2, an investigative multidisciplinary team concluded that C.F.'s death was likely due to child maltreatment, and recommended that DHS seek custody of Bird and Fontana's remaining daughter, T.F. On the basis of this report, CWS concluded on April 5 that the alleged physical abuse of C.F. by her parents, Fontana and Bird, was \"confirmed.\" DHS then filed a Petition for Foster Custody of their remaining daughter, T.F., with the family court. DHS, however, failed to give Bird notice that she was now listed on the CCAR as a \"perpetrator or maltreater.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the same time, Naval Criminal Investigative Services (\"NCIS\") initiated an investigation into the death of C.F. In July 2007, Fontana \"confessed [to Navy investigators] to harming [C.F.] with actions that caused [her] death.\" Fontana was charged with first degree murder and subsequently pled guilty to the crime. In November 2007, NCIS reported to DHS that \"[Bird was] not a suspect\" in their on-going investigation. Nevertheless, because DHS did not conclude that its initial assessment was\n   \"frivolous or in bad faith,\" DHS took no action and Bird remained on the CCAR as a \"confirmed\" child abuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Meanwhile, Bird was still engaged with the family court in an attempt to regain custody of T.F. \"After months of home checks, supervised visits, and evaluations by various medical and social work professionals,\" Bird was granted physical custody of T.F. in November 2007. In December, the family court authorized Bird to leave Hawai'i with T.F. and return to Tennessee where she could live with her father on the condition \"that Tennessee DHS approves the ... placement, and Tennessee DHS puts in writing that services for [Bird] and [T.F.] will be in place when mother and daughter arrive in Tennessee, and both are received by the Court.\" In June 2008, the Hawai'i family court terminated its jurisdiction and revoked the prior order of family supervision. Although the family court entered no findings with respect to Bird's alleged mistreatment of C.F., it found that \"[T.F.'s] family can provide a safe family home without the assistance of a service plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Bird alleges that throughout these events, she was never given notice, written or otherwise, of her listing on the CCAR and that she \"did not have any knowledge that a child abuse registry even existed.\" Without that notice, Bird believed that an adjudicatory trial before the family court concerned only her custody of her surviving daughter, T.F. She did not know that obtaining a finding or ruling from the family court would be the only way for her to get her name removed from a registry she did not know existed. Bird had rejected an adjudicatory trial before the family court, opting instead to work with DHS to drop the case. Bird contends that without notice, she did not know \"that failure to adjudicate [her] claim through the Family Court would result in [her] being on a list of confirmed child abusers for the rest of [her] life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After returning to Tennessee, Bird eventually remarried. Bird and her new husband decided that they wanted to adopt a child from Africa, \"[p]referably ... an older child who was HIV positive so that [they] could provide him or her with the kind of medical and family care that [he or she was] lacking.\" During the adoption process, the adoption agency conducted background checks with each of the states where Bird had previously lived, and discovered in June 2012 that she was listed on Hawai'i's Central Child Abuse Registry. This report rendered Bird ineligible to adopt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bird contacted DHS in June 2012 and requested an administrative hearing before the agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DHS initially refused to give Bird a hearing, explaining that jurisdiction had been turned over to the family court five years prior in connection with the custody dispute over T.F. After further correspondence with Bird and her attorney, DHS offered Bird an administrative hearing limited to determining \"whether DHS properly confirmed (i) abuse of a minor and (ii) threat of abuse of a minor.\" Bird rejected this hearing, deeming the evidentiary standard impossible to meet. In a letter dated May 14, 2013, Bird's attorney indicated to DHS that Bird would \"proceed with litigation\" if she was not removed from the registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In July 2015, Bird filed a complaint in the First Circuit Court, State of Hawai'i, seeking both injunctive and monetary relief against the State of Hawai'i, DHS and various state officials, in both their official\n   and individual capacities. She alleged violations of her state constitutional right to due process and her federal constitutional rights, a claim brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants timely removed the action to federal court, and sought summary judgment on the ground that Bird's claims fail as a matter of law. At the hearing on the motion, the district court raised sua sponte the issue of whether Bird's \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. In response, Bird's attorney requested leave to amend the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After supplemental briefing, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that Bird's \u00a7 1983 claim was untimely. The court concluded that a two-year statute of limitations applies to Bird's \u00a7 1983 claim, and that her claim had accrued \"at the\n   <em>\n    very\n   </em>\n   latest-by May 2013, more than two years before Bird filed her July 20, 2015 Complaint.\" The court rejected Bird's argument that her complaint was protected by the continuing violation doctrine and denied Bird leave to amend. Having dismissed Bird's \u00a7 1983 claim, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Bird's remaining state law claim, and remanded the case to state court. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.

Instead, she raises two arguments against applying the normal discovery rule of accrual. First,\n   Bird argues that \"[w]here a plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of a statutory or regulatory scheme, the plaintiff's claim does not accrue until the offending law is repealed.\" Second, Bird argues that her complaint alleges a \"continuing violation\"-an exception to the usual discovery rule of accrual. Because neither argument prevails, we conclude that the normal discovery rule of accrual applies. We agree with the district court's conclusion that Bird knew of her injury no later than May 2013, and affirm the district court's order dismissing Bird's complaint as time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Bird first contends that a facial challenge to an allegedly unconstitutional statute is exempt from the traditional rules of accrual. More specifically, Bird asserts that a claim seeking \"injunctive relief to invalidate an [ongoing] unconstitutional statutory and regulatory scheme\" does not accrue until the statute is repealed. In essence, Bird's proposed rule would mean that a person who has been harmed by an allegedly unconstitutional statute can bring suit\n   <em>\n    at any time\n   </em>\n   so long as the statute remains in operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bird acknowledges that \"[t]he Ninth Circuit has not yet addressed\" the issue, and relies on several out-of-circuit cases to support her position.

The traditional interests of protecting defendants and facilitating the administration of such claims are thus applicable to a due process claim and justify enforcing a limitations period through the discovery rule of accrual. Although enforcing the statute of limitations here will\n   make Bird's alleged losses permanent, such a cost is present in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case where a plaintiff's claim is denied on statute of limitations grounds and is alone insufficient to justify departing from the normal discovery rule of accrual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, Bird's assertion that applying the discovery rule of accrual to her case will forever immunize an unconstitutional state statute is untrue. The only way for the state to immunize itself from further suit by future plaintiffs would be to stop enforcing its statute. As long as Hawai'i continues to enforce its statute, it is subject to a facial challenge by every individual it affects. Enforcing the statute of limitations in the case of a facial challenge to an allegedly unconstitutional statute, thus, does not render the statute immune from challenge; it merely requires that such challenges be brought in a timely manner. For these reasons, we decline to adopt Bird's proposed rule exempting claims seeking \"injunctive relief to invalidate an [ongoing] unconstitutional statutory ... scheme\" from the discovery rule of accrual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We next consider whether Bird's claim qualifies as a continuing violation.

[her] \u00a7 1983 claim arises from a continued deprivation of liberty interests caused by an unconstitutional rule or statute.\" This argument is, in essence, an attempt to recast Bird's claim as a substantive due process claim for deprivation of liberty interests in working with and adopting children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Bird's case, however, is distinguishable from that of\n   <em>\n    Kuhnle\n   </em>\n   .

She had no way of knowing that she was on the registry until years later, after her ex-husband had been convicted of killing their daughter, Hawai'i family court restored her older daughter to her custody, she had left Hawai'i for her family's home in Tennessee, she remarried, and she and her new husband sought to adopt a special-needs child from a third-world country. By the time Ms. Bird learned that she was on Hawai'i's CCAR, the damage had been done. She was disqualified by Tennessee from adoption (and probably many other things she hadn't figured out yet), and her only recourse was to go back to Hawai'i five years after the incident and try to persuade an agency that didn't want to deal with her to give her a hearing. In the end, DHS begrudgingly offered her \"an administrative hearing for the sole purpose of deciding whether DHS properly confirmed (i) abuse of a minor and (ii) threat of abuse of a minor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We have seen this bad movie before. In\n   <em>\n    Humphries\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that California's procedures for listing and maintaining individuals on the CACI were constitutionally deficient because they created a high likelihood that innocent names would remain on the registry. We first emphasized that the statutory standard for inclusion on the CACI was \"a very low threshold\" that created a high likelihood of \"false positives.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684083\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1170/\">\n    554 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We observed that\n   California law essentially \"reverse[d] ... the presumption of innocence in our criminal justice system: the accused [was] presumed to be a child abuser and listed [on the registry] unless the investigator [affirmatively] determine[d] that the report [was] false, improbable, or accidental.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684083\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1170/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The danger of an erroneous listing was further compounded by the lack of any statutory procedure by which an individual could challenge his or her inclusion on the CACI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684083\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1170/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684083\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1170/\">\n    at 1195-1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Hawai'i regulations require that even \"not confirmed\" reports of child abuse be listed on the CCAR, thereby creating a high likelihood of \"false positives.\" Haw. Admin. R. \u00a7 17-1610-19(a)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The danger of erroneous listings in the CCAR is magnified by inadequate procedures by which an individual can challenge his or her inclusion in the CCAR. Unlike the statutory scheme at issue in\n   <em>\n    Humphries\n   </em>\n   , Hawai'i regulations do require notice and do allow for administrative review of CCAR listings in some circumstances. At least one of the two means for review occurs on DHS's initiative and can be terminated on DHS's initiative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 350-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). If DHS petitions for a separate family court proceeding in which it claims custody of the listed individual's child, the listed individual is not permitted to seek administrative review of his or her registry listing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haw. Admin. R. \u00a7 17-1610-12. Instead, the listed individual must prevail at an adjudicatory hearing before the family court can expunge the report.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 350-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At first blush, this statutory scheme appears more protective than the scheme at issue in\n   <em>\n    Humphries\n   </em>\n   , where listed individuals were offered neither administrative review nor a court hearing capable of expunging the listing. Ms. Bird's unfortunate situation, however, highlights a glaring hole in Hawai'i's regulations: In cases where DHS chooses to return a child to his or her parents rather than pursue the family court proceeding to the adjudicatory phase, listed individuals are denied access to both an administrative hearing and a court adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n    Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 350-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; Haw. Admin. R. \u00a7 17-1610-12(c). In other words, under Hawai'i procedures, DHS can both return a child to the parents and keep the parent's names on the CCAR. In that circumstance, the only way the parent can get a hearing on the CCAR listing is to decline the opportunity to get the child back and pursue litigation in the family court to a full adjudication. This makes no sense. The parents who settle with DHS and thus forego adjudication get their child back, but may be barred forever from teaching school or coaching Little League.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Humphries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684083\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1170/\">\n    554 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1183 &amp; n.9. Persons such as Ms. Bird have no recourse for expunging their names from the CCAR, except to file a civil rights action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The state suggests that the hole in its regulations, by which certain individuals are offered neither administrative review nor a court adjudication, is immaterial because\n   parents who are listed on the CCAR should know better than to regain custody of their children from DHS without enduring a court adjudication. According to the State, the onus lies on the parents to insist that the district court proceed to an adjudication where it would otherwise be unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The flaw in the state's procedures is compounded in this case by the fact that it never told Ms. Bird she was listed on the CCAR. The state's position that it was, nevertheless, Ms. Bird's burden to insist on an adjudication is just astounding. Even worse, the State argues that the lack of notice in this case is\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   immaterial because Ms. Bird was represented by counsel in the dependency proceeding before the family court and thus should have \"just known\" that she was listed on the CCAR and that the only way for her to get off was to insist on proceeding to an adjudicatory hearing in spite of the fact that DHS had effectively mooted the family court proceeding by agreeing that Bird's daughter could be safely returned home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I don't understand how the State of Hawai'i can maintain such arguments with a straight face. Ms. Bird was plainly denied due process of law. And, if the facts are as she alleges them, not only was she denied notice and an opportunity to contest her placement on the CCAR, she was erroneously listed in the first place. The state has twice wronged her: first, by listing her at all; second, by denying her an opportunity to prove that she didn't deserve to be blacklisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Hawai'i prevails here only because of a statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are important to the search for truth. They \" 'promote justice by preventing surprises through [plaintiffs'] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.' \"\n   <em>\n    CTS Corp. v.

The state gets the benefit of that rule today, because Ms. Bird filed her suit just outside the two-year statute of limitations. The irony is that while Ms. Bird filed her suit just two months late, she didn't even learn of the CCAR-and her cause of action-until five years after the state listed her. Hawai'i will not be compelled by law-at least not by us-to give Ms. Bird an opportunity to show she doesn't deserve to be on its CCAR, but it can always choose to do the right thing voluntarily. In any event, DHS should not interpret our decision today as in any way condoning the blatantly insufficient procedures by which it maintains Ms. Bird's name in its Central Child Abuse Registry.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    I recognize that on May 29, 2017, the statute governing listings on the Registry,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Haw.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20350-2\">\n     Haw.
