As the teenagers-Michael Sanders, Abdul Wooten, J.N.G., and J.H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -stood in a tight circle dancing and rapping, Sanders was holding a plastic Airsoft replica gun with a bright orange tip as a prop. Just as they turned off the music and were getting ready to head to school, J.N.G. was shot by Officer Michael Gutierrez of the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\"). Officer Gutierrez fired his weapon because he mistook Sanders's replica gun for an actual gun. Gutierrez fired multiple shots, one of which hit J.N.G. in the back. After the shooting, officers detained the group for over five hours while they investigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   J.N.G. and J.H. (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a lawsuit against the officers, the LAPD, and the City of Los Angeles, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and various state laws. The district court denied qualified immunity on two of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. Gutierrez appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At around 7:15 a.m. on February 10, 2015, J.N.G., J.H., Michael Sanders, and\n   Abdul Wooten met in an alley at the corner of 10th Avenue and Florence Avenue in Los Angeles, CA, a few blocks from their high school. They regularly gathered in that alleyway before and after school to listen to music and freestyle rap. That morning, as they were rapping and dancing in a circle, Sanders was holding a plastic toy gun with a bright orange tip. J.N.G., J.H., and Wooten maintain that Sanders kept the gun pointed downward around waist-level and did not fire the gun that morning. At approximately 7:40 a.m., the teenagers turned off the music and began preparing to head to school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around this time, Officer Everardo Amaral was driving down 10th Avenue in an unmarked car with his partner, Officer Gutierrez. From the passenger seat, Gutierrez \"saw a person (later identified as Michael Sanders) pointing ... a blue steel handgun at another person (later identified as Plaintiff J.H.).\" Gutierrez, believing that J.H. was \"being robbed at gun point or was about to be murdered,\" yelled \"Gun, gun, gun!\" Amaral stopped the vehicle south of the alley on 10th Avenue. Without conferring with Amaral, Gutierrez immediately jumped out of the car and ran into the alley. Amaral parked the car and followed Gutierrez. Neither officer was in uniform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gutierrez claims he identified himself as an LAPD officer and commanded Sanders to drop the gun. However, J.H., J.N.G., and Wooten all contend that Gutierrez did not identify himself or make any verbal commands prior to shooting his weapon. A few seconds after he entered the alley, Officer Gutierrez fired at least three shots, one of which hit J.N.G. in the back. J.N.G. and J.H. contend that Gutierrez fired his gun with one hand while running toward them, while Gutierrez stated that he fired only after stopping a few feet away from the group. When the shots were fired, J.H. was about to put on his school uniform, and J.N.G. was spraying cologne on his face. The four of them had been standing in a tight circle, \"within a foot or so of each other.\" Sanders soon turned and dropped the toy gun, though the parties dispute whether this occurred before or after Gutierrez fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly after Officer Gutierrez fired, Officer Amaral arrived and requested three additional units. Amaral also requested an ambulance when he realized that J.N.G. had been shot. The officers held the group at gunpoint, face down on the ground. The parties dispute how far the dropped \"gun\" was from the teenagers when they were on the ground, but neither officer picked it up or moved it away from them. While on the ground, J.H. shouted that the gun was \"not even a real gun\" and repeatedly asked why the officers shot at them and \"What did we do wrong?\" The officers remained silent in response to his questions, with dumbfounded expressions on their faces. Responding officers soon arrived, and they searched and handcuffed the group. Gutierrez was \"involved in the decision to handcuff them.\" Officer Amaral later explained in his deposition that the detention of the boys was \"[f]or [a] weapons violation.\" Officers Gutierrez and Amaral were separated and monitored soon after additional units arrived on the scene. J.H. remained in handcuffs throughout the investigation, which lasted until around 1:00 p.m., over five hours after the shooting. J.N.G. also remained in handcuffs for over five hours-through the duration of his hospital examination-until detectives interrogated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.N.G., by and through his mother and guardian ad litem Geraldine Nicholson, and J.H., by and through his father and guardian ad litem Jose Fernando Huerta, sued Officer Gutierrez, Officer Amaral, the City of Los Angeles, the LAPD, Chief of Police Charles Beck, and Commander Andrew\n   Smith. In addition to various state law claims, Plaintiffs J.N.G. and J.H. alleged claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violations of their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from excessive force and unreasonable seizure and violations of their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. Defendants Gutierrez, Amaral, and the City of Los Angeles jointly moved for summary judgment, arguing in part that no constitutional violation occurred and that qualified immunity applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' joint motion for summary judgment. Relevant to this appeal, the district court denied Gutierrez qualified immunity in part on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim and on Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim.

A reasonable officer would know that participation in an ongoing seizure after any probable cause had dissipated violates the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, it was soon apparent to the officers that the teenagers were unarmed, posed no threat to anyone, and were not engaged in any criminal activity. The incident occurred in the morning right before the start of school hours, and Plaintiffs had their school uniforms and backpacks. In fact, as Officer Gutierrez approached the scene, J.N.G. was spraying on cologne and J.H. was donning his school uniform. Moreover, Officer Gutierrez admitted that he perceived at least J.H. to be a possible victim, not a suspect, further undermining any justification to detain him. We agree with the district court that under these circumstances, Plaintiffs' continued detention for five hours-well after any probable cause would have dissipated-and the use of handcuffs throughout the duration of the detention violated Plaintiffs' clearly established Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unlawful arrest and excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Officer Gutierrez does not appear to dispute that the prolonged detention and handcuffing violated Plaintiffs' clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. Instead, Gutierrez focuses his argument on the fact that he was separated and monitored after the shooting. Thus, his argument goes, while he admittedly \"was an integral participant in the initial handcuffing and detention,\" he is not responsible for any subsequent constitutional violation because he played no role in that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A police officer need not have been the sole party responsible for a constitutional violation before liability may attach. \"An officer's liability under section 1983 is predicated on his 'integral participation' in the alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Blankenhorn v.

We do not discount the seriousness of the situation that Officer Gutierrez thought he observed: a person holding what appeared to be a gun standing near others who may have been in danger. But Sanders \"was not engaged in any threatening or menacing behavior, and he kept the airsoft gun securely pointed toward the ground.\" The alleyway was near a school, and Plaintiffs were \"equipped with school uniforms and backpacks ... [appearing] to be minors on their way to school and not gang members.\" Yet within seconds of observing the \"gun,\" without consulting with his partner, Gutierrez rushed down the alleyway. As he ran, he fired his gun toward both Sanders, the perceived perpetrator of a possible crime, and innocent bystanders, with one bullet ultimately striking J.N.G. in the back. Under these circumstances, a rational finder of fact could find that Gutierrez's use of deadly force shocks the conscience and was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Gutierrez's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. As a preliminary matter, Gutierrez challenges the district court's finding that a reasonable jury could find that deliberation was practical under the circumstances. But because this is an interlocutory appeal, we are not free to revisit the district court's conclusions as to \"which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , 736 F.3d at 834.

Assuming the facts in Plaintiffs' favor, no attendant circumstances weighed in favor of the immediate use of deadly force, other than Gutierrez's belief that Sanders was holding a gun. As the district court noted, under these circumstances, Gutierrez's immediate use of force without communicating with his partner, his failure to seek cover, and his failure to formulate a plan before acting were all contrary to LAPD's training and policy. We agree with the district court that the evidence is sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact on whether deliberation was practical under the circumstances, and, in any event, we would be without power to reverse on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Gutierrez next argues that, as a matter of law, the district court erred in failing to apply the \"intent to harm\" standard, under which Plaintiffs must show that he acted \"with a purpose to harm unrelated to legitimate law enforcement objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695729\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/546/#p554\">\n    610 F.3d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Without more, we cannot say that this situation gives an officer \"no time for reflection,\" as in a high-speed chase involving a fleeing suspect in a fast-moving vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Lopez v.

In\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

There, we held that the \"rapidly escalating nature\" of the confrontation between the officer and the suspect behind the wheel left too little time for adequate deliberation and thus necessitated application of the \"intent to harm\" standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893639\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/1131/#p1137\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Moreland v.

Given the ongoing crisis, we held that the officers had no opportunity to deliberate in light of the \"immediate risk of serious harm or death to the many innocent individuals trapped in the parking lot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615424\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/365/#p372\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the \"intent to harm\" standard was appropriate. By contrast, assuming Plaintiffs' contentions that Sanders was not pointing the toy gun at anyone and had not given any indication that he was likely to harm anyone, there was no \"rapidly escalating\" confrontation or \"extreme emergency\" here that would have deprived Gutierrez of the opportunity to confer with his partner and formulate a plan to ascertain what was happening before charging in with gunfire. Contrary to Gutierrez's argument, we have not previously applied the intent to harm standard to Fourteenth Amendment claims involving facts similar to this case, and we decline to do so now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We thus agree that application of the deliberate indifference standard is warranted under these circumstances. As the district court explained, in \"minimal information\" situations, an officer must take some time to assess what is happening before employing deadly force. Holding\n   otherwise would result in an \"intolerably high risk of a tragic shooting that may otherwise have been avoided by proper deliberation whenever practical.\" As such, applying the deliberate indifference standard to Plaintiffs' version of the facts, we hold that Gutierrez's shooting violated their substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if a constitutional violation occurred, qualified immunity nevertheless applies unless the violation was clearly established.

Plaintiffs do not challenge this ruling and thus the question of whether the shooting violated their Fourth Amendment rights is not before us in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Similarly, the district court also relied principally on Fourth Amendment cases in denying qualified immunity on this claim. However, as with Plaintiffs' citations, some of these cases were decided after the incident,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Gelhaus\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266169\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/998/#p1011\">\n     871 F.3d 998\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and one has since been reversed by the Supreme Court on the \"clearly established\" question.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kisela\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n     138 S. Ct. 1148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n     200 L.Ed.2d 449\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These problems present additional reasons why we find that the law was not clearly established on Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Certainly, considerations of reasonableness germane to a Fourth Amendment analysis are relevant to the substantive due process inquiry. Historically, our cases have recognized some overlap in these two constitutional protections.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     P.B. v. Koch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650052\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/96/1298/\">\n     96 F.3d 1298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1303 n.4 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that, \"[r]egardless of the appropriate 'home' for plaintiffs' right to be free from excessive force, there was a clearly established right to be free such force\" because \"[u]nder any standard, [the defendant's] alleged actions were clearly unlawful.\"). But we have held that a Fourteenth Amendment claim of excessive force \"must be governed by a different standard than\" a Fourth Amendment claim of excessive force.\n    <em>\n     Byrd v. Guess\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"105909\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/137/1126/#p1133\">\n     137 F.3d 1126\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1133-34 (9th Cir. 1998),\n    <em>\n     superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Little v. City of Manhattan Beach\n    </em>\n    , 21 Fed. App'x 651 (9th Cir. 2001). Thus, our Fourth Amendment cases cannot clearly establish the contours of the Fourteenth Amendment right, despite similarities between the standards.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
