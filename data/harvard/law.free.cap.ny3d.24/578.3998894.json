(Strauss)/Creative Finishes, Ltd. (Creative) contracted with the Metropolitan Opera Association, Inc. (the Met) to perform work on the Met\u2019s premises; specifically, to strip and repaint the rooftop steel carriage track for the opera house\u2019s automated window-washing equipment (hereafter, generally referred to as the contract). The contract was a tailored version of the American Institute of Architects\u2019 \u201cAbbreviated Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor For CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OF LIMITED SCOPE where the Basis of Payment is a STIPULATED SUM\u201d (AIA Document A107 [1978 ed]), with the parties\u2019 attached exhibits A through D made a part thereof. The first page of the contract designates the Met as \u201cthe Owner\u201d and Strauss/Creative as \u201cthe Contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Indemnification and Insurance Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The contract mandates that Strauss/Creative indemnify and hold the Met harmless, \u201c[t]o the fullest extent permitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>law,\u201d from and against all claims and damages attributable to bodily injuries \u201carising out of or resulting from\u201d work performed by Strauss/Creative or any of its subcontractors \u201ccaused in whole or in part by [their] negligent act or omission,\u201d and \u201cregardless of whether or not. . . caused in part by [the Met].\u201d The contract\u2019s provisions addressing insurance obligate Strauss/ Creative to purchase and maintain contractors liability insurance to protect the Met from claims under workers\u2019 compensation and other employee benefit acts, and \u201cclaims for damages because of bodily injury . . . which may arise out of or result from [Strauss/Creative\u2019s] operations\u201d under the contract, whether undertaken by Strauss/Creative, any of its subcontractors or \u201canyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them.\u201d Additionally, the insurance \u201cshall include contractual liability insurance\u201d applicable to Strauss/Creative\u2019s contractual duty to indemnify and hold the Met harmless; and \u201c[certificates of such insurance shall be filed with [the Met] prior to the commencement of\u2019 the construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Importantly, exhibit D, entitled \u201cINSURANCE REQUIREMENTS,\u201d fleshes out Strauss/Creative\u2019s insurance obligations. This contract document requires Strauss/Creative to procure three types of insurance: (1) workers\u2019 compensation insurance (para [a]); (2) owners and contractors protective liability (OCP) insurance with a combined single limit of $5 million (para [b]); and (3) comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance, with combined coverage for property and bodily injury with a minimum single limit of $5 million, which might be met by umbrella coverage (para [c]). As relevant to this appeal, paragraph (b) of exhibit D, after identifying OCP coverage as an insurance requirement, specifies that \u201c [Liability should add [the Met] as an additional insured and should include contractual liability and completed operations coverage\u201d; paragraph (e) directs Strauss/Creative to \u201cfurnish [the Met] [with] an Original Owners and Contractors policy,\u201d and also to \u201cprovide certificates of insurance for the [Workers\u2019] Compensation, the [CGL] and the \u2018Umbrella\u2019 Policy, prior to the commencement of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The contract was signed on behalf of the Met as \u201cOWNER\u201d by the opera house\u2019s manager, and on behalf of Strauss as \u201cCONTRACTOR\u201d by Ralph Drewes (Drewes) as \u201cVP\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Strauss and Creative, although separately owned, shared the same ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>dress and some of the same employees. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At his deposition, Drewes testified that he ran the day-to-day operations of both companies, and reported to both Victor Strauss, the owner and president of Strauss, and Hillary J. Klein, the owner and president of Creative. Strauss did not have an agreement with District Council 9, the painters\u2019 union, while Creative did, and the contract between Strauss/Creative and the Met required the construction project to be carried out by \u201cfully insured union painters.\u201d For this reason, Strauss subcontracted the labor to Creative by agreement dated September 3, 2008, consisting of an unaltered standard form contract with an agreed-upon rider and attachments, and the underlying construction contract between Strauss/Creative and the Met (hereafter, the subcontract).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The subcontract designates Strauss as \u201cthe Contractor\u201d and Creative as \u201cthe Subcontractor,\u201d and generally requires Creative to undertake the construction project in accordance with the terms of the contract, and to provide specified insurance and indemnify and hold harmless the Met and/or Strauss. The subcontract makes Creative solely responsible for work site safety. Victor Strauss signed the subcontract on behalf of Strauss; Drewes testified that he \u201cbelieve[d] that [he] signed it on behalf of Creative.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Creative began work on the construction project on September 4, 2008. At some point, the Met was supplied with a certificate of insurance for a CGL policy issued by Nova to Creative, stating that the Met and Strauss were additional insureds under the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Met was never furnished an original OCP policy covering the construction project, and, as it turned out, neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Strauss nor Creative actually purchased an OCP policy to protect the Met.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Strauss\u2019s CGL Policy with Mt. Hawley</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">At the time Strauss/Creative contracted with the Met, Strauss had in place a CGL policy issued by Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (Mt. Hawley) for the policy period of November 7, 2007 to November 7, 2008. The policy included ISO (Insurance Services Office, Inc.) form endorsement CG 20 33 07 04 (\u201cADDITIONAL INSURED \u2014 OWNERS, LESSEES OR CONTRACTORS \u2014 AUTOMATIC STATUS WHEN REQUIRED IN CONSTRUCTION AGREEMENT WITH YOU\u201d), which specifies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cWHO IS AN INSURED is amended to include as an additional insured any person or organization for whom [Strauss is] performing operations <em>when [Strauss] and such person or organization have agreed in writing in a contract or agreement that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on [Strauss\u2019s] policy\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Under the policy, \u201csuch person or organization\u201d would be an additional insured with respect to liability for bodily injury so long as the injury was caused, at least in part, by Strauss\u2019s acts or omissions or \u201c[t]he acts or omissions of those acting on [Strauss\u2019s] behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Regarding notice, the policy specifies that bodily injury \u201cwill be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the earliest time when any insured listed under . . . WHO IS AN INSURED or any employee authorized by [an insured] to give or receive notice of an occurrence or claim . . . [b]ecomes aware . . . that bodily injury . . . has occurred or has begun to occur\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the insured \u201cmust see to it that [Mt. Hawley is] notified as soon as practicable of an occurrence or an offense which may result in a claim\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">The Accident, the Personal Injury Lawsuit and Notice to the Insurers</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">On September 16, 2008, Manuel Mayo (Mayo), a Creative employee, was injured when he fell from a fixed ladder located on the sixth floor of the opera house. This 15-foot ladder led to a hatch door in the ceiling, which provided access to the rooftop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and thus the steel carriage track. Mayo was trying to close the hatch door at the end of his shift when he lost his footing. Drewes first learned of Mayo\u2019s accident when the receptionist/ office manager at Creative\u2019s office fielded a telephone call late in the workday on September 16th from someone at the opera house. The caller (not identified in the record) reported that Mayo had been injured and was being transported to the hospital by ambulance. Drewes happened to be in the office at the time the call was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The next day Drewes called his \u201cprimary contact\u201d at I. Dachs &amp; Sons, Inc. (Dachs), the insurance broker for both Creative and Strauss, to discuss upcoming liability insurance renewals. During this conversation, Drewes brought up Mayo\u2019s accident, and was \u201c[led] to believe by [the broker] that there was no reason to notify the carrier, general liability carrier, because it was a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Creative timely filed an \u201cEMPLOYER\u2019S REPORT OF WORK-RELATED ACCIDENT/OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE\u201d (Form C-2) to notify the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board and Creative\u2019s compensation carrier about Mayo\u2019s accident. \u201cA couple of days later\u201d or perhaps \u201ca week after\u201d Mayo\u2019s accident while Drewes was at the opera house to check on how the construction project was coming along, he mentioned to the Met\u2019s house manager that \u201c[t]here was an accident, the man was hurt and he [i.e., Drewes] expected him [i.e., Mayo, the injured worker] to come back to work, [and] at that point it was a worker\u2019s comp claim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">By complaint dated November 19, 2008, Mayo and his wife sued the Met and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. (Lincoln Center), asserting causes of action for negligence, violations of the Labor Law and loss of consortium in connection with Mayo\u2019s work-related injuries (hereafter, the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit). Mayo alleged that the hatch door was broken and in disrepair, the ladder\u2019s rungs were worn and not skid-resistant, and there were no proper safety devices such as a cage, safety belt or safety line. The Met received the summons and complaint in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit from the Secretary of State on December 5, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">That same day, the Met\u2019s in-house attorney wrote to Strauss and Creative, with a copy to Travelers Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>(Travelers), the Met\u2019s primary liability carrier, forwarding the summons and complaint. The attorney advised Strauss that the Met expected to be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law, as agreed to by Strauss in the contract. This December 5th letter also referred to the certificate of insurance provided the Met, which \u201cevidenced] General Liability coverage of $1,000,000 per occurrence/$2,000,000 aggregate from [Nova] and Excess/Umbrella Liability coverage issue[d] by RSUI Indemnity Co[.] in the amount of $5,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.\u201d Asserting that the Met was an additional insured under these policies, the attorney asked Strauss to \u201cimmediately notify these carriers that the Met expect[ed] them to provide, without cost to the Met, a defense in this lawsuit as well as indemnification.\u201d On December 11, 2008, the Met received another copy of the summons and complaint by mail, this time from the Mayos\u2019 lawyer. The Met\u2019s in-house attorney again wrote Strauss and Creative, with a copy to Travelers, forwarding the summons and complaint and requesting that \u201cthe necessary actions\u201d be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On December 29, 2008, a representative of Travelers wrote to Strauss, Creative, Nova and Dachs. She stated that Travelers was the general liability insurer for the Met and Lincoln Center, and that Travelers had received a complaint alleging that Mayo had been injured while working for Creative at the opera house; she then recited Strauss\u2019s obligation under the contract to indemnify and hold the Met harmless from claims such as the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit, and to \u201cprocure insurance naming [the Met] as an additional insured.\u201d The Travelers representative enclosed copies of the lawsuit, contract and certificate of insurance, and asked for written confirmation that \u201ca defense and indemnification will be provided, and [for] the identity of counsel assigned to the defense.\u201d On January 12, 2009, Mt. Hawley\u2019s broker received notice of the Met\u2019s claim (including a copy of Travelers\u2019 December 29th letter) from Dachs. Mt. Hawley\u2019s broker then faxed the Met\u2019s claim to Mt. Hawley, which acknowledged receipt on January 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Mt. Hawley\u2019s Response to Strauss\u2019s and the Met\u2019s Tenders and the Met\u2019s Third-Party Action</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On February 3, 2009, Mt. Hawley wrote to Strauss to deny coverage on the basis of late notice because Strauss \u201cwas aware of this occurrence on the date it occurred[,] which was September 16, 2008\u201d; and to inform Strauss that Mt. Hawley was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201creviewing the information as to whether [the Met] and/or [Lincoln Center] qualify as additional insureds under the terms of [the] policy.\u201d Finally, Mt. Hawley let Strauss know that it had tendered the defense of the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit to Nova on its behalf; i.e., by letter dated February 2, 2009, with copies to Drewes and Dachs, Mt. Hawley asked Nova to defend and indemnify the Met and Lincoln Center in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit, and to defend and indemnify Strauss in any third-party action brought by the Met and Lincoln Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In a letter to Travelers, also dated February 3, 2009, Mt. Hawley first observed that the contract between the Met and Strauss/Creative nowhere stated that Lincoln Center was to be indemnified or made an additional insured under any policy issued to Strauss and/or Creative. Accordingly, Mt. Hawley denied Travelers\u2019 tender as to Lincoln Center.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mt. Hawley continued that it was \u201cattempting to determine\u201d whether the Met qualified as an additional insured under the terms of its CGL policy with Strauss.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Referring to the C-2, which showed that Mayo was employed by Creative, Mt. Hawley requested \u201ccopies of checks [that] [the Met] issued for payment of the work required in the contract,\u201d adding that \u201c[i]t [was] questionable as to whether [Strauss] was actually involved in this work.\u201d Mt. Hawley noted that, in light of the additional insured endorsement in its CGL policy with Strauss, \u201cwe need to determine whether [Strauss] was actually involved in this work in order to determine whether [the Met] is added as an additional insured\u201d; and that \u201c[a]t this point in time, [Mt. Hawley] reserves the right to assert that [the Met] is not an additional insured under the Policy . . . issued to [Strauss] [;] [h]owever, we continue to ask for more information and it may take further discovery to determine our obligations.\u201d Summing up, Mt. Hawley told Travelers that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201c[a]s we have denied coverage for contractual indemnification to [Strauss] and have reserved our rights as to whether [the Met] is an additional insured under the policy issued to [Strauss], we will not be taking over the defense and/or indemnification of [the Met] at this time. As stated above, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>have denied coverage for contractual indemnification as to [Lincoln Center].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On March 4, 2009, Mt. Hawley again wrote Travelers, this time stating that the information requested in the February 3rd letter (i.e., copies of checks issued by the Met to Strauss to pay for the construction project) had not been received, and that its \u201cinvestigation [had] yielded information that [the Met] was aware of this loss on the date that it occurred . . . [since] [apparently . . . [the Met] contacted [Drewes] at [Strauss] to inform him of the accident.\u201d Mt. Hawley added that \u201c[s]hould the information that we have been provided be correct, no coverage would apply to [the Met] in this lawsuit,\u201d and requested an affidavit as to when the Met \u201cfirst became aware\u201d of Mayo\u2019s accident. Mt. Hawley further declared that \u201c[u]ntil such time as we can review the affidavit being provided, [Mt. Hawley] reserves the right to assert that no coverage would apply based on\u201d the CGL policy\u2019s notice provision. Both the Met and Lincoln Center are shown as copied on this letter. That same day, March 4, 2009, Mt. Hawley wrote to Strauss\u2019s attorney, reiterating its denial of coverage to Strauss on the ground of late notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Meanwhile, on January 28, 2009, Nova responded to Travelers\u2019 December 29th letter by disclaiming coverage of the Met as an additional insured on Creative\u2019s CGL policy due to late notice <em>(see Mayo v Metropolitan Opera Assn., Inc., </em>2011 NY Slip Op 32943[U], *12 [Sup Ct, NY County 2011]). The Met was not copied on this disclaimer letter sent to Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">On February 6, 2009, the Met brought a third-party action in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit against Strauss, Creative and Nova. The Met alleged causes of action against Strauss and Creative for common-law and contractual indemnification, and for breach of contract for failure to purchase the OCP policy required by exhibit D of the contract, and alleged a cause of action against Nova for breach of contract for denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Strauss\u2019s Lawsuit against Mt. Hawley and the Met and the Decisions Below</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">By complaint filed on March 16, 2009, Strauss commenced this action against Mt. Hawley and the Met, seeking a declaration that Mt. Hawley was obligated to defend and indemnify it in the Met\u2019s then just-filed third-party action. On June 16, 2010, 15 months later, the Met cross-claimed against Mt. Hawley, asking in its first cross claim for a declaration that it was an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy, thereby requiring Mt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Hawley to defend and indemnify it in the <em>Mayo </em>litigation; on July 9, 2010, the Met moved for summary judgment on this cross claim. On July 14, 2010, Mt. Hawley moved to dismiss the Met\u2019s cross claims as untimely, and on July 30, 2010, Mt. Hawley cross-moved for summary judgment against the Met, seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to defend and indemnify the Met in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit. Then on July 26, 2010, Mt. Hawley moved for an order granting summary judgment to dismiss Strauss\u2019s complaint and to declare that it was not obligated to defend and indemnify Strauss in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Supreme Court disposed of these motions and cross motion in a decision and order dated October 13, 2011 (2011 NY Slip Op 32706[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2011]). Addressing the Met\u2019s motion and Mt. Hawley\u2019s cross motion, the Judge determined that the Met was an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy, and that while the Met\u2019s three-month (counting from the date of the lawsuit) or four-month (counting from the date of the accident) delay in notifying Mt. Hawley was unreasonable as a matter of law, Mt. Hawley did not comply with its statutory duty under Insurance Law former \u00a7 3420 (d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to promptly disclaim coverage, as the letters from Mt. Hawley to Travelers and/or the Met only reserved Mt. Hawley\u2019s right to do so. Consequently, the Judge ruled that Mt. Hawley was precluded from disclaiming coverage to the Met. Relatedly, Supreme Court denied Mt. Haw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ley\u2019s motion to dismiss the Met\u2019s cross claim due to untimeliness, chalking up any delay to Mt. Hawley\u2019s neglect to disclaim coverage promptly; and dismissed Strauss\u2019s complaint against Mt. Hawley on the basis of its late notice to Mt. Hawley of Mayo\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In its decision and order dated April 11, 2013, the Appellate Division agreed with Supreme Court that Mt. Hawley was required to defend the Met in the <em>Mayo </em>lawsuit because the contract directed Strauss to purchase liability insurance naming the Met as an additional insured, and the CGL policy issued by Mt. Hawley to Strauss contained an additional insured endorsement (105 AD3d 512, 513 [1st Dept 2013]). The court also agreed with Supreme Court that Mt. Hawley had not timely disclaimed coverage; rather, its letters were only \u201cintended to preserve its right to disclaim,\u201d and thus were \u201cinsufficient to actually disclaim coverage\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Finally, the Appellate Division rejected Strauss\u2019s claim that its notice to Mt. Hawley was timely, opining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201c[Strauss\u2019s] notice of the accident to Mt. Hawley was untimely as a matter of law, and Mt. Hawley timely disclaimed coverage on that ground. [Strauss\u2019s] notice to its broker did not provide timely notice to Mt. Hawley. There is no indication that [Strauss\u2019s] broker acted as an agent for Mt. Hawley or that the CGL policy listed [Strauss\u2019s] broker as its agent\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 514).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Strauss now appeals and Mt. Hawley cross-appeals pursuant to leave granted by the Appellate Division on August 20, 2013, asking us whether its order in this matter was properly made (2013 NY Slip Op 82536[U] [1st Dept 2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">In this long-running coverage dispute, Strauss\u2019s appeal calls upon us to decide whether Strauss timely notified Mt. Hawley of Mayo\u2019s accident. Mt. Hawley\u2019s cross appeal poses the threshold question of whether the Met is an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy with Mt. Hawley; and then, if it is, whether Mt. Hawley promptly notified the Met that it was disclaiming coverage on account of untimely notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Strauss\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Strauss argues that the lower courts erred when they concluded that its notice to Mt. Hawley was untimely as a mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ter of law. Relying on <em>Mighty Midgets v Centennial Ins. Co. </em>(47 NY2d 12 [1979]), Strauss takes the position that whether it gave notice to Mt. Hawley \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d or, alternatively, whether its late notice was excusable are questions for the trier of fact and may not be decided as a matter of law. This is so, Strauss contends, because Drewes followed his usual and customary practice of promptly notifying Dachs, Strauss\u2019s broker, of Mayo\u2019s accident, with every reasonable expectation that Dachs, in turn, would timely notify the proper insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We have long held that a policyholder\u2019s timely notice to a broker does not \u201cconstitute the notice contemplated by the [insurance] policy since a broker is normally the agent of the insured and notice to the ordinary insurance broker is not notice to the liability carrier\u201d <em>(Security Mut. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v Acker-Fitzsimons Corp., </em>31 NY2d 436, 442 n 3 [1972]; <em>see also Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v Baseball Off. of Commr., </em>236 AD2d 334, 334 [1st Dept 1997] [late notice was not excused even though the policyholders \u201cinstructed their broker to inform (the primary and excess insurers) about the lawsuit shortly after its commencement\u201d], l<em>v denied </em>90 NY2d 803 [1997]; <em>Gershow Recycling Corp. v Transcontinental Ins. Co., </em>22 AD3d 460, 462 [2d Dept 2005] [a policyholder\u2019s \u201ctimely notice of the action to its broker is of no consequence\u201d and thus does not excuse the failure to comply with notice obligations under an insurance policy]). Our decision in <em>Mighty Midgets </em>does not alter this fundamental principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Mighty Midgets was a nonprofit corporation organized to encourage, manage and otherwise support boys\u2019 football teams in Orangetown in Rockland County. The Dunn &amp; Fowler Division of Frank B. Hall &amp; Company (Dunn) secured two insurance policies for the Orangetown Midgets: a liability policy from Centennial Insurance Company (Centennial) and a policy providing accident and health protection with the Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company (the Hartford). We described Dunn as \u201ca leading specialist in athletic team insurance and apparently the organization upon which the more than 2,500 teams enrolled in the national program of which the Midgets were a part would rely for guidance in insurance matters\u201d <em>(Mighty Midgets, </em>47 NY2d at 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The roles of Dunn and Centennial were uncommonly intertwined; specifically, in addition to being the solicitor of liability policies with Centennial, Dunn collected the premiums and was designated by the policy as \u201cagent or broker.\u201d Dunn wrote most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of its athletic team business with Centennial, which entrusted Dunn with large batches of blank policies already executed by Centennial-authorized signatories, leaving it completely up to Dunn to fill in policy numbers, names of insureds, premiums and the date a policy was to go into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">On October 18, 1970, a nine-year-old boy, a member of a Midgets-sponsored team, was injured when, right after a game in which he had played, a large pot of boiling water which rested on the counter of an improvised hot dog stand operated by the Midgets as a fundraising activity was \u201ccaused to pour over him\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Robert Halle (Halle), the 21-year-old volunteer president of the Midgets, was not present at the time, but he learned of the accident before the day was out and called Dunn to ask \u201cwhether he should \u2018put it under a medical or [a] liability claim\u2019 \u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Dunn representative instructed Halle to notify the Hartford, and Halle dutifully filed a claim with the Hartford, on a form supplied by Dunn.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Then on April 7, 1971, the Hartford notified the Midgets that its policy did not cover the accident because it happened after the game in which the nine year old had played. Although the nine year old\u2019s father, \u201can avid supporter of the Midgets,\u201d had never before exhibited the slightest inclination to pursue a liability claim, the Hartford\u2019s refusal to pay his son\u2019s medical claim caused him to consult a lawyer, who wrote the Midgets a letter dated May 25, 1971, indicating that a liability suit was \u201cin the offing\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Halle immediately forwarded the lawyer\u2019s letter to Centennial in care of Dunn. This was the Midgets\u2019 first written notice to Centennial. The liability policy required notice of an occurrence to be made to the insurer in writing and \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d In light of the seven-month delay, Centennial disclaimed coverage due to untimely notice, and the Midgets brought a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On this record, the trial judge, sitting without a jury, found as a fact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201c(1) that Dunn\u2019s handling of the communications from Halle was negligent; (2) that, \u2018under the circumstances\u2019, including Halle\u2019s \u2018limited . . . understanding of insurance matters\u2019 and the relationship between Dunn and Centennial, the Midgets acted reasonably in that they did all that they \u2018could do\u2019 until the arrival of the letter on May 25 first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>disabused them of the misinformation Dunn had imparted; and (3) that the letter transmitting the . . . lawyer\u2019s liability claim letter constituted written notice given \u2018as soon as practicable\u2019 after the claim was made\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 18-19 [footnote omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting (62 AD2d 1014 [2d Dept 1978]). There was no disagreement about the facts; the dissenters simply would have held the written notice to be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Sitting as a six-Judge Court, we also affirmed, by a margin of four to two. The dissenters commented that \u201cit [was] especially difficult to conclude that it was not \u2018practicable\u2019 to give notice long before the expiration of seven months when the insured gave the agent oral notice the day after the accident\u201d (47 NY2d at 23 [Jones, J, dissenting]). The majority ruled, however, that \u201cin the facts and circumstances\u201d presented,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cthere was enough evidence from which it could be found that the Midgets\u2019 failure to notify the insurer before it did was not unreasonable and that, consequently, Centennial was not entitled to disclaim. Since our review is limited to determining whether the conclusion of the fact-finding courts finds support in the evidence, we must uphold their determination\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 16, 21).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Like the lower courts, the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d that we considered particularly compelling were not just Halle\u2019s youth and \u201climited personal and vocational background[ ] [which was] totally alien to either the world of insurance or that of the law\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 18), but also the unusually close ties between Centennial and Dunn, which reasonably caused Halle to solicit and blindly follow Dunn\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Here, by contrast, although Dachs may have long been Strauss\u2019s insurance broker, nothing in this record reveals the kind of close relationship between Dachs and Mt. Hawley that existed between Dunn (which was also Centennial\u2019s agent for receipt of notice of claim) and Centennial. The record here does not support the proposition that the insurer and broker had a relationship sufficiently close to suggest that service to the broker was effectively service to the insurer. By contrast, in a situation more akin to <em>Mighty Midgets </em>it might be possible for even a relatively sophisticated representative of an insured to have a good faith, reasonable belief that notice to the broker is sufficient if the insurer\u2019s own actions hold the broker out to be its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>agent for the purpose of giving notice. In such a case, if the effect of the insurer\u2019s representations is to lull the insured into a false belief that notice had been provided through the agent, the insurer should not be able to raise the insured\u2019s failure to provide an earlier notice as a defense to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Further, it should be noted that Drewes was not an unsophisticated 21 year old like Halle, unusually dependent upon Dunn, the insurance broker, for advice and guidance. Rather, Drewes was the longtime day-to-day operations manager of two construction contractors in New York City. Indeed, by virtue of Drewes\u2019s experience in the construction industry, it is a wonder that he did not grasp the overwhelming probability that Strauss would be drawn into a Labor Law lawsuit immediately upon learning that Mayo had suffered an elevation-related injury while on the job. In short, the outcome in <em>Mighty Midgets </em>turned on unusual and extenuating facts, not remotely comparable to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Mt. Hawley\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Under the additional insured endorsement of Strauss\u2019s CGL policy, whether the Met was an additional insured hinges on whether Strauss and the Met \u201chave agreed in writing in a contract or agreement that [the Met] be added as an additional insured on [Strauss\u2019s] policy.\u201d The Met argues that the second sentence of paragraph (b) of the contract\u2019s exhibit D contains the requisite agreement in writing. Paragraph (b), in its entirety, requires Strauss/Creative to procure the following insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cb. Owners and contractors protective liability insurance with a combined single limit of $5,000,000.00. <em>Liability should add the Metropolitan Opera Association as an additional insured and should include contractual liability and completed operations </em>coverage\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Mt. Hawley counters that paragraph (b) simply reflects the Met\u2019s considered choice to require Strauss to purchase OCP coverage to protect the Met from risks arising out of Strauss\u2019s work, rather than mandating that Strauss include the Met as an additional insured on its CGL policy. Mt. Hawley observes that the OCP policy specified in this paragraph would have provided the Met with an unshared $5 million limit; by contrast, as an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL, the Met would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>to have shared the policy limits with Strauss and any other insureds on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"ACm\">We agree with Mt. Hawley that the second sentence in paragraph (b) can only refer to the OCP coverage that Strauss promised to purchase for the Met in the first sentence \u2014 but never actually acquired. This conclusion is buttressed by paragraph (c) of exhibit D, which sets out Strauss\u2019s insurance commitments to the Met with respect to CGL coverage, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cComprehensive General Liability. Combined coverage for property and bodily injury with a minimum single limit of $5,000,000.00 (Limits may be met with an \u2018Umbrella Policy\u2019D].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Notably, this provision \u2014 the only paragraph in exhibit D addressing Strauss\u2019s insurance obligations with respect to CGL coverage \u2014 says nothing about including the Met as an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy. We therefore conclude that the Met is not an additional insured on the CGL policy issued to Strauss by Mt. Hawley.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Finally, because the Met is not an additional insured under Strauss\u2019s CGL policy, we do not reach and need not decide the question of whether Mt. Hawley promptly notified the Met that it was disclaiming coverage under that policy due to untimely notice <em>(see Zappone v Home Ins. Co., </em>55 NY2d 131, 134 [1982] [\u201cfailure to disclaim coverage does not create coverage which (a liability) policy was not written to provide\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by denying defendant Metropolitan Opera Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its first cross claim and, as so modified, affirmed, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. In other words, although the first page of the contract designates Strauss/Creative as \u201cthe Contractor,\u201d Drewes executed the contract on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>signature line identifying only Strauss as \u201cCONTRACTOR\u201d (see <em>Mayo v Metropolitan Opera Assn., Inc., </em>108 AD3d 422, 424 [1st Dept 2013] [concluding, in the Met\u2019s third-party action against Strauss, Creative and Nova Casualty Company (Nova), Creative\u2019s CGL insurer, that an issue of fact exists with respect to whether Drewes had authority or intent to bind Creative to the contract]). Throughout this opinion, we have generally identified \u201cStrauss/ Creative\u201d as the contractor because this is what the contract\u2019s first page says. We do not intend thereby to imply that Creative is bound to the contract, an issue which has yet to be resolved.

The second sentence of exhibit D, paragraph (b) in the September 3, 2008 construction contract (hereafter, the contract) states as follows: \u201cLiability should add the Metropolitan Opera Association as an additional insured and should include contractual liability and completed operations coverage.\u201d While this sentence may be awkwardly phrased and infelicitously placed within exhibit D,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is not ambiguous in light of the realities of the insurance marketplace. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>differences between owners and contractors protective liability (OCP) and comprehensive general liability (CGL) policies, this sentence clearly obligates Strauss Painting, Inc. (Strauss) to have in place a CGL policy protecting the Metropolitan Opera Association, Inc. (the Met) as an additional insured. With all due respect to my colleagues, there is simply no other way to read it. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from so much of the majority\u2019s decision as determined that the Met is not an additional insured on the CGL policy issued by Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (Mt. Hawley) to Strauss. For the reasons that follow, I would therefore answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">An OCP policy covers the named insured\u2019s liability for bodily injury and property damage caused, in whole or in part, by the designated contractor\u2019s work for the insured on a specified construction project. The contractor purchases the OCP policy, which protects the insured from vicarious liability incurred as a result of the contractor\u2019s acts or omissions on the project, and liability arising out of the insured\u2019s own acts or omissions in connection with its \u201cgeneral supervision\u201d of the work performed by the contractor <em>(see generally </em>Donald S. Malecki et al., The Additional Insured Book, International Risk Management Institute [IRMI] at 202-217 [7th ed 2013] [hereafter Malecki]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Craig F. Stanovich, <em>OCP Liability versus Additional Insured Coverage, </em>IRMI [Oct. 2009] [hereafter Stanovich 2009], www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2009/stanovichl0-cgl-generalliability-insurance.aspx).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Mt. Hawley insists that the second sentence of paragraph (b) obligated Strauss to include the Met as an additional insured on the OCP policy that the first sentence directed Strauss to purchase for the benefit of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. (Lincoln Center). For this reason, Mt. Hawley criticizes the Appellate Division for \u201cfailing to recognize the critical distinction between the OCP Policy, on which the Contractor was expressly required to have the Met named as an additional insured, and the CGL Policy, for which no such requirement existed\u201d; and argues that \u201cas the owner of the property, Lincoln Center would have been listed as the owner on any OCP Policy. The Met would have been an additional insured on that policy\u201d (emphasis omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is how Mt. Hawley tries to explain away the requirement to make the Met an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Lincoln Center owns the opera house and is the Met\u2019s landlord; however, as Mt. Hawley itself pointed out when responding to Travelers\u2019 December 29th letter, Lincoln Center (the entity) is nowhere mentioned in the contract, which identifies the Met as the project owner. Thus, there is no basis within the four corners of the contract for interpreting paragraph (b) as requiring Strauss to purchase an OCP policy issued in the name of Lincoln Center. And it is not obvious how such a policy could have been obtained since Lincoln Center was not the party with which Strauss contracted to perform the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Next, the second sentence of paragraph (b) states that the policy on which the Met is to be included as an additional insured must provide \u201ccontractual liability and completed operations coverage.\u201d \u201cContractual liability\u201d in this context refers to the liability assumed by Strauss under the contract\u2019s hold harmless and indemnification provision, while \u201ccompleted operations\u201d refers to coverage for injuries or damages occurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>after </em>the construction project has been finished. These coverage options (i.e., contractual liability and completed operations) are available to an additional insured on a CGL policy; they are <em>not, </em>however, available on an OCP policy <em>(see e.g. </em>Craig F. Stanovich, <em>Contractual Liability and the CGL Policy, </em>IRMI [May 2002], www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2002/stanovich05.aspx7cmd [explaining how contractual liability insurance, found in the CGL insurance policy, applies]; Stanovich 2009 [\u201cThe OCP policy excludes coverage for bodily injury or property damage if such injury or damage takes place after the earlier of when the operation has been completed or put to its intended use by anyone other than another contractor or subcontractor working for the Designated Contractor on that project. <em>The ISO CG 20 37 and many insurers\u2019 independently filed additional insured endorsements provide coverage for the additional insured for bodily injury or property damage within the products and completed operations hazard. This coverage option is not available on the OCP policy\u201d </em>(emphasis added)]; Malecki at 58-60, 202). In short, the second sentence of paragraph (b) cannot mean that Strauss was required to purchase an OCP policy with contractual liability and completed operations coverage for the benefit of the Met as an additional insured because no such policy option exists. This pair of agreed-to coverages could only be provided by including the Met as an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The Met sought in exhibit D to transfer or shift to Strauss in every way possible the risk of financial loss due to bodily injuries or property damages occurring in connection with the construction project by requiring Strauss to have in place (1) workers\u2019 compensation insurance; (2) an OCP policy in favor of the Met as the named insured; (3) a contractual hold harmless and indemnification provision whereby Strauss assumed the Met\u2019s tort liability arising out of construction operations; and (4) a CGL policy including the Met as an additional insured, which provided for contractual liability and completed operations coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Known as the \u201cbelt and suspenders\u201d approach, adding an indemnitee (here, the Met) as an additional insured on the indemnitor\u2019s (here, Strauss\u2019s) liability insurance gives \u201csome protection to fall back on in the event there is a problem with the enforceability of the hold harmless agreement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 59-60, 69 [\u201c(M)ost contractual risk transfers . . . involve using both an indemnity clause and additional insured status to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>hand-in-hand\u201d]; <em>see also </em>The Handbook on Additional Insureds, American Bar Association at 38-39 [Michael Menapace et al. ed 2012] [\u201cThere are multiple reasons for a party to insist on both indemnification provisions and insurance requirements in a single contract . . . (T)he protection afforded by indemnification and hold harmless provisions, on the one hand, and additional insured coverage, on the other, are in many instances complimentary (sic) and not co-extensive. Thus, to maximize one\u2019s protection, a party should include in the contract both an indemnification and hold harmless requirement and an additional insured requirement\u201d]). Further, \u201c[i]n the construction industry, general contractors and project owners who seek additional insured protection often will insist upon receiving [ISO endorsements allowing] coverage for both ongoing operations and completed operations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">As Mt. Hawley points out, an OCP policy may be an alternative to adding the owner as an additional insured to the contractor\u2019s CGL policy. But while there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach <em>(see generally </em>Malecki at 214-217), an OCP policy and additional insured status are not, as Mt. Hawley implies, mutually exclusive. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is not unusual for an indemnitee to request both an OCP policy and additional insured status in the expectation that one of the coverages will apply in the event of a claim or suit\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 216). Nothing (except perhaps cost and/or relative bargaining power) prevents a project owner from seeking to avail itself of the complementary advantages of <em>both </em>coverages, as the Met clearly did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Finally, Mt. Hawley contends that the Met sought OCP coverage in lieu of additional insured status as part of a \u201cwell-reasoned insurance scheme\u201d since \u201c[t]he OCP policy would provide the Met with protection arising out of [Strauss\u2019s] work and, more importantly, ... an unshared $5M limit,\u201d whereas, \u201c[a]s an additional insured on [Strauss\u2019s] CGL policy, the Met would . . . share the policy limits with all other insureds on the Policy \u2014 exposing the Met to a wasting of liability limits beyond its control.\u201d Again, Mt. Hawley assumes that a project owner would only bargain with its contractor to provide OCP coverage or additional insured status on the contractor\u2019s CGL policy, not both. It is certainly true that an OCP policy provides the named insured a separate set of limits, while CGL policy limits are shared by all insureds; that is one of the advantages that an OCP policy offers. But Mt. Hawley disputes that the Met was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the intended named insured on the OCP policy that Strauss agreed but failed to purchase; therefore, under Mt. Hawley\u2019s interpretation of exhibit D, paragraph (b), the Met would not, in fact, have enjoyed the benefit of the unshared limits that Mt. Hawley contradictorily also claims motivated the Met to choose coverage under an OCP policy rather than additional insured status under Strauss\u2019s CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Because I conclude that the Met was an additional insured on Strauss\u2019s CGL policy, I reach the issue of whether Mt. Hawley promptly notified the Met that it was disclaiming coverage on account of untimely notice <em>(see </em>Insurance Law former \u00a7 3420 [d] [an insurer wishing to deny coverage on account of late notice \u201cshall give written notice as soon as is reasonably possible of such disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage to the insured and the injured person or any other claimant\u201d]). On February 3, 2009 Mt. Hawley stated, in a letter sent to Travelers, that it was attempting to determine whether the Met qualified as an additional insured under the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The word \u201cdisclaim\u201d does not appear in this letter, and the word \u201cdenial\u201d shows up only in the context of Strauss or the nonparty Lincoln Center. As to the Met, Mt. Hawley advised Travelers that \u201cwe need to determine whether Strauss Painting was actually involved in this work in order to determine whether [the Met] is added as an additional insured. At this point in time, [Mt. Hawley] reserves the right to assert that [the Met] is not an additional insured.\u201d In its letter to Travelers dated March 4, 2009, with a copy to the Met, Mt. Hawley stated that it was investigating how early the Met was aware of the Mayo incident. While this letter recited the policy\u2019s notice conditions, it merely cautioned, in the conditional tense, that <em>\u201c[sjhould </em>the information that we have been provided be correct, no coverage <em>would </em>apply\u201d to the Met (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In sum, the two letters constituted ineffective notice because they did not disclaim coverage; instead, they reserved the right to disclaim coverage in the future <em>(see Hartford Ins. Co. v County of Nassau, </em>46 NY2d 1028, 1029 [1979] [\u201cA reservation of rights letter has no relevance to the question whether the insurer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>timely sent a notice of disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage\u201d]; <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v Petrizzi, 121 </em>AD2d 276, 277 [1st Dept 1986] [\u201cA letter from an insurance company to its policyholder which contains a reservation of the insurance company\u2019s rights to disclaim coverage under its policy is not such a notice of disclaimer as to satisfy the requirements of the Insurance Law\u201d]). Because Mt. Hawley never disclaimed for late notice, it waived the late notice defense <em>(see Hartford Ins. </em>at 1029 [\u201cA failure by the insurer to give such notice as soon as is reasonably possible after it first learns of the accident or of grounds for disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage, precludes effective disclaimer or denial\u201d]).</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-5\">Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur; Judge Read dissents in part in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Order modified, without costs, by denying Metropolitan Opera Association, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its first cross claim and, as so modified, affirmed, and certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">.

Apparently, the only ISO (Insurance Services Office, Inc.) endorsement available for use in adding an additional insured to an OCP policy is the \u201cAdditional Insured \u2014 Engineers, Architects or Surveyors (CG 20 31)\u201d endorsement <em>(see </em>Malecki at 214, Appendix B), which obviously is not relevant here. In other words, there is no such thing as standard policy language for a lessee who contracts with a contractor for a construction project on the leased premises to become an additional insured on an OCP policy. This is not surprising since the lessee under such circumstances, as is the case with the Met here, would be the named insured on the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">. In this case, the Met did not raise the issue of whether an insurer may validly disclaim coverage by sending written notice to the insured\u2019s own carrier only <em>(see Sierra v 4401 Sunset Park, LLC, </em>24 NY3d 514 [2014] [decided today]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
