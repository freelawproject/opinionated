We hold that it did not and therefore affirm the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">In 2007, as part of its comprehensive reform of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, the legislature amended Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Law \u00a7 13-a (5) in two ways: (1) it raised from $500 to $1,000 the maximum cost of specialist treatments for which the employer is automatically liable without prior authorization, and (2) it directed that the Board issue and maintain a list of preauthorized procedures that a claimant can obtain at the employer\u2019s expense even if the cost exceeds $1,000, without the need for the employer\u2019s prior approval. The purpose of both of these provisions was to \u201cremove impediments to prompt diagnostic and treatment measures and to better reflect current medical service costs. The provision permitting the creation of a pre-authorized list allows the Board appropriate regulatory flexibility to add or remove procedures depending on best practices, increases or decreases in costs, or opportunities presented by managed care approaches\u201d (Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem No. 9, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 6 at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">A task force of credentialed medical professionals was assembled to develop and recommend a set of guidelines for the pre-authorized medical procedures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2010, the Board published proposed regulations, which incorporated by reference the guidelines recommended by the task force. Following the comment period, the Board adopted the \u201cMedical Treatment Guidelines,\u201d which were subsequently incorporated by reference in the regulations <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 324.2 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The Guidelines include the list of pre-authorized medical procedures and set forth limitations on the scope and duration of each procedure. They also set forth a variance procedure, under which medical treatment providers can, on behalf of a claimant, request authorization for medical care not included in the Guidelines or in excess of the scope and/or duration that is pre-authorized <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 324.3 [a] [1]). The medical treatment provider requesting a variance must demonstrate that the requested treatment is appropriate for the claimant and medically necessary <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 324.3 [a] [2], [3] [i] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In December 1996, claimant Maureen Kigin, a Hearing Reporter for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, injured her neck and back in a work-related automobile accident. In June 1997, the Board accepted her claim for wage replacement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>benefits and ongoing medical treatment. In 2006, Kigin\u2019s case was reopened and transferred to the Special Fund for Reopened Cases (hereafter the carrier) pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 25-a. On December 14, 2006, she was classified as permanently partially disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Claimant alleges that she suffers chronic neck and back p'ain as a result of her injuries. Her treating physician, Dr. Andrea Coladner, prescribed acupuncture. On November 9, 2009, she received authorization from the carrier for acupuncture three times a week for six weeks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In March 2011, Dr. Coladner reevaluated claimant and recommended that she receive additional acupuncture treatment, namely, three acupuncture treatments to her cervical and lumbar spine each month for six months. The doctor again requested authorization from the carrier, this time under the newly-created Medical Treatment Guidelines established by the Board that had become effective on December 1, 2010. Specifically, she requested two variances, one for claimant\u2019s cervical spine and another for her lumbar spine. These variances were required because the Guidelines for the treatment of neck injuries provided that the optimum duration of acupuncture treatments is one month and the maximum duration is 10 treatments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Coladner opined that the treatments would increase flexibility, increase circulation, decrease headaches, decrease muscle tightness, and allow claimant to maintain function and activities of daily living.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In response to the variance requests, the carrier obtained an independent medical examination of claimant, conducted by Dr. Peter Chiu, a physician board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation and certified in acupuncture. Based on his examination, as well as his review of claimant\u2019s medical records, Dr. Chiu determined that further acupuncture treatments were not medically necessary. Dr. Chiu noted that claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were not supported by objective findings, that she did not suffer from any disability, and that she could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>resume normal activity of daily living and her occupation without restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Based on Dr. Chiu\u2019s findings, the carrier denied the variance requests. Claimant thereafter sought review of the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Dr. Coladner and Dr. Chiu testified as to whether the variances should be granted to allow the additional acupuncture treatment. Dr. Coladner testified that claimant had tried several different treatments and that acupuncture was the treatment modality that helped her maintain her functional level. Dr. Coladner averred that claimant reported a reduction in pain following the acupuncture treatments, although no improvement in her range of motion. Further, Dr. Coladner asserted that additional acupuncture treatments were recommended because, without them, claimant continued to report worsening pain and therefore diminished function.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Dr. Chiu testified that, in his opinion, the variances were properly denied because the requirements set forth in the Guidelines were not satisfied. Specifically, Dr. Chiu testified that Dr. Coladner\u2019s medical records did not include claimant\u2019s response to treatment or any improvement in her range of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">A Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge determined that claimant\u2019s medical provider failed to show that the additional acupuncture treatments were medically necessary. In particular, the Judge noted that, although Dr. Coladner testified that claimant reported some pain reduction from the prior treatments, there was no evidence in the record that these earlier treatments resulted in the objective improvement of functional outcomes with respect to claimant\u2019s neck, or that it was reasonable to expect that further acupuncture would result in such improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">On claimant\u2019s administrative appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board panel affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge\u2019s determination. The Board found that the variance applications failed to meet the burden of proof that the additional acupuncture treatment requested is medically necessary within the meaning of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Claimant appealed the Board\u2019s decision, arguing, as relevant here, that (1) the Board lacked the authority to promulgate the regulations and incorporated Guidelines, (2) the variance procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>improperly shifts the burden of proof to claimant\u2019s physician to prove the medical necessity of a proposed treatment, and (3) the Guidelines violate claimant\u2019s due process right to a meaningful hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, affirmed (109 AD3d 299 [3d Dept 2013]). The court rejected claimant\u2019s argument that the Board exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the regulations, holding that \u201cthe Board acted within its legislatively conferred authority when it devised a list of preapproved medical care deemed in advance to be medically necessary for specified conditions, and did so in a manner consistent with Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13 (a) and the overall statutory scheme\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 307). In support of its conclusion, the court noted that \u201cmedical necessity and appropriateness . . . have always been prerequisites to an employer\u2019s obligation\u201d to pay and \u201cthe Legislature purposefully conferred the authority on the Board to predetermine medical necessity for medical care, and its scope and duration, consistent with best medical practices\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 306-307 [emphasis omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The court also rejected claimant\u2019s argument that the variance procedure improperly shifts the burden to the claimant\u2019s treating physician to prove medical necessity, in conflict with Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 21 (5) <em>{see id. </em>at 307-310). Finally, the court found unavailing claimant\u2019s argument that the Guidelines deprived her of due process, noting that the regulations provide an opportunity to be heard, \u201can expedited process for determining the medical necessity\u201d of the requested care, and a review process <em>{id. </em>at 310).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The dissenting Justice agreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cBoard has authority to promulgate reasonable rules and regulations consistent with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law,\u201d but disagreed with its \u201coverreaching conclusion that medical treatments falling outside the Guidelines are predetermined and presumed not to be medically necessary\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 312-313 [McCarthy, J., dissenting]). The dissent would have found that the variance procedure conflicts with the statutory scheme and specifically with section 21 (5) <em>(see id. </em>at 313-314). The dissent reasoned that the variance procedure \u201cundermine[s] the remedial purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and [is] contrary to the legislative purpose behind authorizing the Board to promulgate [the] Guidelines\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 315).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">This Court granted claimant leave to appeal (22 NY3d 854 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Claimant first contends that the Board exceeded its statutory-authority to \u201cpreauthorize\u201d medical treatment under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-a (5) by using the Guidelines to \u201cpredeny\u201d medical treatment. The Board responds that the Guidelines are a valid exercise of its broad regulatory authority because the regulations are rationally related to the underlying policies of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Board is authorized to \u201cadopt reasonable rules consistent with and supplemental to the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Law]\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 117 [1]). Courts will uphold regulations that have \u201ca rationed basis and [are] not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious or contrary to the statute under which [they were] promulgated\u201d <em>(see generally Kuppersmith v Dowling, </em>93 NY2d 90, 96 [1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We hold that the Board acted properly and lawfully when it promulgated the Guidelines, as they reasonably supplement Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13 and promote the overall statutory framework of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, which is to provide appropriate medical care to injured workers. There is no dispute that the Board was statutorily authorized under section 13-a (5) to issue a list of pre-authorized procedures. That determination necessarily meant that the Board consider what is <em>not </em>best practice and what may <em>not </em>be medically necessary. Contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, the procedures that are not on the list are not \u201cpre-denied,\u201d given the possibility of obtaining a variance. In other words, treatments that are not in accord with the Guidelines may nevertheless be approved for particular claimants pursuant to the variance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The establishment of the variance procedure was within the Board\u2019s broad regulatory powers (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 13, 141, 117 [1]). The Board explained that the prior lack of standards in assessing the medical necessity of treatment had resulted in \u201cdisputes over treatment, delayed care, and increase[d] frictional costs\u201d (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NY Reg, June 30, 2010 at 33-38). Disputes over the medical necessity or the frequency/duration of medical care were often made after the care was provided, on a case-by-case basis, when the employer disputed the bill. It was reasonable for the Board to promulgate uniform guidelines for defining the nature and scope of treatment considered medically necessary. By adopting the pre-authorized list and variance procedure for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the necessity of care, the Board provides a measure of avoiding delay and uncertainty that previously resulted from disputes over the medical necessity of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Claimant next claims that the Guidelines remove the burden of proof from the employer and the carrier and shift it to the injured worker and the treating physician. This, claimant argues, is directly contrary to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Under the regulations, the burden of proof to establish that a variance is appropriate and medically necessary rests on the treating medical provider (12 NYCRR 324.3 [a] [2]). Whether a treating medical provider has met this burden is a threshold determination that must be made whenever a carrier properly and timely articulates an objection to a variance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, nothing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law has ever precluded the Board from requiring proof of medical necessity from claimant\u2019s health care provider. Indeed, the claimant generally has the burden in the first instance of proving facts sufficient to support his or her claim for compensation <em>(see Matter of Malacarne v City of Yonkers Parking Auth., </em>41 NY2d 189, 193 [1976] [claimant has the burden of showing that injuries were sustained in the course of employment]). Moreover, in her argument, claimant relies on the provision of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-a (5) that an employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s refusal to authorize \u201cspecial services\u201d costing more than $1,000 must be based on a \u201cconflicting second opinion\u201d by a Board-authorized physician. That requirement presupposes that the claimant has submitted the first opinion, from his or her treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We also disagree with claimant\u2019s contention that section 21 (5) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law establishes that the burden rests on the employer or carrier. That provision creates a presumption, \u201c[i]n any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation,\u201d that \u201cthe contents of medical and surgical reports introduced in evidence by claimants for compensation shall constitute prima facie evidence of fact as to the matter contained therein\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 21 [5]). It is the carrier that then bears the burden of proffering \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to contradict the content of those medical reports <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We agree with the Appellate Division majority that claimants can continue to rely on the presumption, while also satisfying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the variance procedure\u2019s requirement that they establish the medical necessity of the requested treatment. While the presumption establishes the facts contained in the medical report, the claimant must first establish the medical necessity for the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Finally, claimant argues that the Guidelines deny injured workers due process by predetermining their need for medical treatment. She contends that the Guidelines do not provide an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time and manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Generally, procedural due process principles require an opportunity for a meaningful hearing prior to the deprivation of a significant property interest (see <em>Hodel v Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., </em>452 US 264, 303 [1981]). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner\u201d <em>(Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 333 [1976] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see Curiale v Ardra Ins. Co., </em>88 NY2d 268, 274 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Guidelines provide claimants with a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the denial of any variance request. The variance procedure expressly provides a process for requesting review of the denial of a variance request, under which the treating medical provider may elect review by a medical arbitrator or through an expedited hearing process <em>(see </em>12 NYCRR 324.3 [d]). Indeed, in this case, a hearing was held at which a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge considered testimony by both claimant\u2019s own care provider and the independent expert engaged by the carrier. Claimant was represented by counsel, who cross-examined the carrier\u2019s expert. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge\u2019s decision was reviewed by the Board, which considered legal arguments by claimant\u2019s attorney, and the Board\u2019s decision was subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. The guidelines were limited to the treatment of injuries to the low back, cervical spine, knee, and shoulder because those injuries account for a disproportionately large amount of the cost of workers\u2019 compensation medical care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">. Although Dr. Coladner sought prior authorization for the acupuncture treatment under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-a (5), at that time no such prior authorization was required under that section because the treatments did not involve \u201cspecialist consultations\u201d or \u201cspecial services\u201d within the meaning of that section and would not have cost more than $1,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">. <em>See </em>New York State Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, New York Neck Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines at 21 (2d ed 2013), available at http:// www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/hcpp/MedicalTreatmentGuidelines/ NeckInjuryMTG2012.pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b535-10\">Rivera, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGl\">(dissenting). I agree that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board acted within the scope of its statutory authority under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law in adopting regulations incorporating a list of pre-authorized medical procedures, and a system for implementing consideration of treatment recommendations not included on the list. However, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>exceeded its authority when it promulgated regulations imposing a preapproval requirement that forecloses reimbursement for medical services that vary from the list and the Board\u2019s Medical Treatment Guidelines (Guidelines) in all cases where the services are rendered in advance of approval. Also, to the extent the Board\u2019s regulations establish a variance scheme that predetermines that all treatment not included on the preauthorized list of services is presumptively not medically necessary, it imposed a burden on Kigin and other claimants inconsistent with the statute\u2019s language and underlying purpose. Therefore, I would reverse the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u201cis framed on broad principles for the protection of [workers]\u201d <em>(Matter of Waters v Taylor Co., </em>218 NY 248, 251 [1916]; <em>accord Matter of Illaqua v Barr-Llewellyn Buick Co., </em>81 AD2d 708, 708 [3d Dept 1981], citing <em>Matter of Heitz v Ruppert, </em>218 NY 148, 154 [1916], and <em>Matter of Lorer v Gotham Concrete &amp; Cement Finish Corp., </em>8 AD2d 221, 224 [3d Dept 1959]), and thus \u201cshould be construed liberally in favor of the employee\u201d <em>(Matter of Wolfe v Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co., </em>36 NY2d 505, 508 [1975]). It is beyond dispute that the Board has broad regulatory power to administer and carry out the mandates of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law <em>(see e.g. </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 117 [1]; 141). To that end, the Board is authorized to \u201cadopt reasonable rules consistent with and supplemental to\u201d the statutory scheme <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 117 [1]). However, the Board\u2019s powers are not limitless, and we review its \u201cadministrative regulations to determine whether they are rational and to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious\u201d or contrary to the statute under which they are promulgated <em>(Matter of Belmonte v Snashall, </em>2 NY3d 560, 567 [2004]; <em>see Kuppersmith v Dowling, </em>93 NY2d 90, 96 [1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law states that employers \u201cshall be liable for the payment of\u2019 and \u201cshall promptly provide for an injured employee\u201d medical treatment \u201cfor such period as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may require\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13 [a]). Prior to the Board\u2019s regulatory adoption of the Guidelines in 2010, where an employer or carrier disputed a request for treatment reimbursement, the parties resolved the dispute pursuant to an individualized determination of whether the request is compensable after treatment was rendered to the claimant <em>(see Matter of Kigin v State of N.Y. Workers\u2019 Compensation Bd., </em>109 AD3d 299, 306 [3d Dept 2013], citing Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 13-g, 13-k, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>13-l, 13-m, <em>Matter of Spinex Labs. [Patton], </em>213 AD2d 884, 885 [3d Dept 1995], and <em>Employer: Livingston County, </em>2011 WL 5618432, *5, 2011 NY Wrk Comp LEXIS 6751, *15-16 [WCB No. 7990 5338, Nov. 9, 2011]; <em>see also </em>110 NY Jur 2d, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 565 [after treatment is rendered, employer must pay or give written notice of the reasons for nonpayment]). Only in certain cases where the claimant sought treatment in the form of \u201cspecialist consultations, surgical operations, physiotherapeutic or occupational therapy procedures, x-ray examinations or special diagnostic laboratory tests costing more than [$500]\u201d was the provider required to obtain preauthorization for the treatment from the employer or Board in order to obtain reimbursement (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-a [5]). A denial of pre-authorization under this section must be based on \u201ca conflicting second opinion rendered by a physician authorized by the board\u201d <em>(id,.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">As part of the legislative efforts to streamline compensation for workers\u2019 injuries and increase benefits for injured workers while reducing costs, in 2007, the legislature amended section 13-a (5) by raising the threshold cost of services requiring preauthorization to $1,000 and directing the Board to \u201cissue and maintain a list of pre-authorized procedures\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 13-a [5]; L 2007, ch 6, \u00a7 28). Pursuant to this legislative mandate and at the direction of the executive branch, the Board promulgated regulations that incorporated the Guidelines developed by various medical experts, and which served as a basis for the list of pre-authorized procedures. The Board then promulgated regulations that implemented a regulatory scheme whereby reimbursement for medical services would be subject to the Guidelines. All of this was well within the Board\u2019s power and in furtherance of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Board went awry when it promulgated regulations that imposed a variance scheme that requires preapproval for reimbursement requests related to treatment that varies from the Guidelines. Section 324.3 of the Board\u2019s regulations states that a variance for medical care that varies from the Guidelines \u201cmust be requested and granted . . . before [that care is] provided to the claimant\u201d (12 NYCRR 324.3 [a] [1]). Nothing in the language of the statute limits compensation to care approved in advance of treatment unless the pre-authorization requirement of section 13-a (5) applies, and there is no claim that it does here. Thus, the regulation\u2019s preapproval requirement lacks a necessary textual grounding to the extent that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>extends the limited pre-authorization requirement of section 13-a (5) to care beyond that specifically enumerated in that section of the statute. Indeed, it is undisputed that prior to implementation of the regulations, disputes over reimbursement for medical services other than those in section 13-a (5) were usually resolved after the services had been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In this regard, the Board\u2019s regulations also undermine the purpose of the 2007 amendments \u201cto remove impediments to prompt diagnostic and treatment measures\u201d <em>(see </em>Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem No. 9 at 5, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 6). The regulations instead serve to hinder timely medical service delivery by denying payment to providers who fail to secure preapproval. Under the regulations, \u201ca request for a variance will not be considered if the medical care has already been provided\u201d (12 NYCRR 324.3 [a] [1]). As a result, the preapproval requirement incentivizes providers to delay treatment based on financial concerns. Realistically, providers will defer medical care until they are certain of reimbursement, which under the regulations means until a variance is granted. How long this may take is uncertain, and dependent upon the deliberateness of the administrative process. Such delay carries with it the potential for significant adverse health consequences due to a break in medical services. In contrast, the statute expressly provides ensured compensation for medically necessary services, making no mention of whether treatment was rendered prior to approval. The Board\u2019s regulations would permit denial of reimbursement even for medically necessary treatment simply because the medical services were provided prior to preapproval. As a consequence, the regulations are inconsistent with the mandate of section 13 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The Board is also subject to challenge for interpreting its regulations so as to deny Kigin\u2019s request for reimbursement on the ground that her treatment varied from the Guidelines. This interpretation contravenes the statutory and regulatory scheme for individual assessment of compensable injuries, and was not mandated by the 2007 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Although I agree with the majority that the claimant had the burden to establish that the treatment was compensable under the statute <em>(see </em>majority op at 468), under the Board\u2019s interpretation of the regulations the claimant is subject to an adverse presumption that the requested services are not medically necessary simply because they are not included on the preauthorized list and vary from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The Board argues, and the majority concludes, that the legislature\u2019s directive to create a list of pre-authorized procedures also means that the Board has the authority to predetermine that all excluded services are not medically necessary. I disagree. The more logical and reasonable interpretation of the statutory language, and one which furthers the 2007 amendments\u2019 purpose to increase benefits to workers, is that the legislature authorized the Board to predetermine procedures over which there was general medical consensus, leaving claims regarding other medical services to the preexisting dispute resolution process. That process is better suited to determinations focused on the individual\u2019s condition and needs. Conversely, the rule-making process is more appropriate to pronouncements of generalized treatment protocols, without consideration of specific individualized health concerns <em>(see </em>State Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 102 [2] [a] [i] [defining a \u201crule\u201d as \u201cthe whole or part of each agency statement, regulation or code of <em>general applicability </em>that implements or applies law\u201d (emphasis added)]; <em>see also Matter of Alca Indus. v Delaney, </em>92 NY2d 775, 778 [1999] [discussing distinction between rulemaking and \u201cad hoc decision making based on individual facts and circumstances\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The statutory language does not support the Board\u2019s position that the variance process established by the regulations is consistent with the preexisting statutory scheme. The source of the Board\u2019s authority for the Guidelines, section 13-a (5), merely states that the Board \u201cshall issue and maintain a list of preauthorized procedures.\u201d It does not state that excluded procedures are to be treated as presumptively not medically necessary. Since the Guidelines were adopted pursuant to the exercise of the Board\u2019s rule-making power, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute would permit the regulations to supplant the individualized assessment of medical necessity by establishing a presumption against certain services. We would expect that such a dramatic departure from the prior statutorily established case-by-case approach would be authorized by clear, unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Moreover, the Board\u2019s interpretation favors the legislative goal to reduce costs to the detriment of the legislative goal to increase benefits to workers. Under the Board\u2019s approach, the claimant faces a previously unknown burden to rebut a presumption against payment for certain medical services, and must endure the physical and mental effects of delays in service pending the outcome of the variance request. This appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>in furtherance of cost reduction for its own sake, for it increases the challenges faced by claimants rather than \u201cremov[ing] impediments to prompt diagnostic and treatment measures\u201d (Governor\u2019s Program Bill Mem No. 9 at 5). Conversely, both goals are achievable by the adoption of a pre-authorized list which expedites treatment delivery without automatically labeling certain medical care medically unnecessary, thus increasing benefits for workers, and at the same time reducing the number of claims and parties subjected to the dispute and variance process, thus containing costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The statutory presumption in favor of claimants applicable to proceedings to enforce claims for compensation, found in section 21 (5), illustrates the legislative commitment to reducing the burdens faced by claimants in securing benefits, and further supports the conclusion that the Board\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the statute and the legislative intent. Section 21 (5) states that in any proceeding to enforce a claim for compensation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cit shall be presumed in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201c . . . [tjhat the contents of medical and surgical reports introduced in evidence by claimants for compensation shall constitute prima facie evidence of fact as to the matter contained therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">No such presumption applies to the carrier/employer\u2019s medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The presumption clearly indicates the legislature\u2019s intention to ease the claimant\u2019s burden of establishing a right to reimbursement for treatment. The Board\u2019s interpretation undermines that intent because it requires the claimant to establish by facts and opinion that the treatment is medically necessary, without benefit of the fact presumption, and it eliminates the carrier/employer\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption with substantial evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Here, the Board determined that Kigin\u2019s medical provider failed to establish that the request for compensation for additional acupuncture treatments was medically necessary. That determination, however, was based on the independent medical examination and report of Dr. Chiu, who concluded that the treatments were not medically necessary because Kigin was not disabled and the treatments failed to comply with the Guidelines. This was error, as the Board had previously classified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Kigin as permanently partially disabled, and Dr. Chiu should have evaluated the services not as against generalized Guidelines of pre-authorized treatment, but based on the medical care\u2019s impact on Kigin\u2019s conditions and needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-6\">Judges Read, Smith and Abdus-Salaam concur; Judge Rivera dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Graffeo concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
