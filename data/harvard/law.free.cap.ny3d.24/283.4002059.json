A pending amendment to Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 seeks to exempt rent-stabilized leases from a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy assets, illustrating that the New York State Legislature did not intend to exempt such assets under the current version of Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2).

The apartment is rent-stabilized. After her husband died in June 2011, Santiago-Monteverde was unable to pay her credit card debts of approximately $23,000 and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, she remained current on her rent obligations. She initially listed her apartment lease on schedule G of her bankruptcy petition as a standard unexpired lease. Shortly thereafter, the owner of the apartment approached the bankruptcy trustee, respondent John S. Pereira, and offered to buy Santiago-Monteverde\u2019s interest in the lease. When the trustee advised her that he planned to accept the offer, she amended her filing to list the value of her lease on schedule B as personal property exempt from the bankruptcy estate under Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2) as a \u201clocal public assistance benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The Bankruptcy Court granted the trustee\u2019s motion to strike the claimed exemption on the ground that the value of the lease did not qualify as an exempt \u201clocal public assistance benefit\u201d <em>(In re Santiago-Monteverde, </em>466 BR 621, 622 [SD NY 2012]). The court noted that Santiago-Monteverde\u2019s counsel did not dispute \u201cthat a rent-stabilized lease is property of the estate and that the Trustee may \u2018assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>citing 11 USC \u00a7 365). The court reasoned that \u201c[the] benefit of paying below market rent ... is not a \u2018public assistance benefit\u2019 that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>entitled to any exemption in bankruptcy\u201d and that the benefit \u201cis a quirk of the regulatory scheme in the New York housing market, not an individual entitlement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 625).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court <em>(In re Santiago-Monteverde, </em>2012 WL 3966335, 2012 US Dist LEXIS 129481 [SD NY, Sept. 10, 2012, Castel, J., No. 12 Civ 4238(PKC)]), holding that \u201cthe value in securing a lawful termination of the rent-stabilized lease ... is a collateral consequence of the regulatory scheme and not a local public assistance benefit\u2019 \u201d (2012 WL 3966335, *2, 2012 US Dist LEXIS 129481, *4).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On appeal to the Second Circuit, Santiago-Monteverde argued that \u201cthe lease (or its value) is a local public assistance benefit\u2019 because the value of the lease (in whole or in part) is traceable to the protections afforded to her under the [Rent Stabilization Code]\u201d (747 F3d 153, 157 [2d Cir 2014]). Recognizing that this argument raises an open issue of New York law, the Second Circuit certified the following question to this Court: \u201cWhether a debtor-tenant possesses a property interest in the protected value of her rent-stabilized lease that may be exempted from her bankruptcy estate pursuant to New York State Debtor and Creditor Law Section 282(2) as a local public assistance benefit\u2019?\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 159).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The Bankruptcy Code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to \u201cassume or reject any . . . unexpired lease of the debtor\u201d (11 USC \u00a7 365 [a]). As was noted by the Second Circuit, there is limited case law from both New York courts and bankruptcy courts holding that a trustee\u2019s authority under section 365 extends to rent-stabilized leases <em>(see 187 Concourse Assoc. v Bunting, </em>175 Misc 2d 870 [Civ Ct, Bronx County 1997] and cases cited therein; <em>see also In re Toledano, </em>299 BR 284, 292 [SD NY 2003]; <em>In re Stein, </em>281 BR 845 [SD NY 2002]; <em>In re Yasin, </em>179 BR 43, 49 [SD NY 1995]). In this case, the debtor\u2019s counsel acknowledged at the hearing before the Bankruptcy Judge that a rent-stabilized lease is property of the estate and that the trustee had the power to assume the lease pursuant to section 365 (466 BR at 622).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Section 522 (b) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USC) permits the debtor to exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate, and section 522 (d) provides a list of property that may be exempt. However, the code also permits states to create their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>own list of exemptions, and New York has done so. Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 sets forth the permissible exemptions in personal bankruptcy. Debtors domiciled in New York have the option of choosing either the federal exemptions or New York exemptions (11 USC \u00a7 522 [b]; Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 285). Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2), entitled \u201cBankruptcy exemption for right to receive benefits,\u201d lists the following as exemptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cThe debtor\u2019s right to receive or the debtor\u2019s interest in: (a) a social security benefit, unemployment compensation or a local public assistance benefit; (b) a veterans\u2019 benefit; (c) a disability, illness, or unemployment benefit; (d) alimony, support, or separate maintenance, to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor; and (e) all payments under a stock bonus, pension, profit sharing, or similar plan or contract on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">When the rent-stabilization regulatory scheme is considered against the backdrop of the crucial role that it plays in the lives of New York residents, and the purpose and effect of the program, it is evident that a tenant\u2019s rights under a rent-stabilized lease are a local public assistance benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The legislature has concluded that rent stabilization is necessary to preserve affordable housing for low-income, working poor and middle class residents in New York City. As we said in <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp. </em>(84 NY2d 385, 389 [1994]), \u201c[t]he rent stabilization system began in 1969 to ameliorate, over time, the intractable housing emergency in the City of New York\u201d due to a housing shortage which was caused by continued high demand and decreasing supply. We noted in <em>Manocherian </em>that \u201c[b]y regulating rents and providing occupants with statutory rights to tenancy renewals under rent stabilization . . . the State intended to protect dwellers who could not compete in an overheated rental market, through no fault of their own\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The New York City Administrative Code provides that the City Council \u201cfinds that a serious public emergency continues to exist in the housing of a considerable number of persons within the city of New York,\u201d and that \u201cunless residential rents and evictions continue to be regulated and controlled, disruptive practices and abnormal conditions will produce serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>threats to the public health, safety and general welfare\u201d (Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 [Administrative Code of City of NY] \u00a7 26-501).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The rent-stabilization program has all of the characteristics of a local public assistance benefit. It is plainly local in that it depends on periodic determinations by local authorities as to the continuing existence of an emergency in the particular jurisdiction. The program is public as it was enacted by the New York Legislature and implemented by legislative and administrative bodies at both the state and local level. Rent stabilization provides assistance to a specific segment of the population that could not afford to live in New York City without a rent regulatory scheme. And the regulatory framework provides benefits to a targeted group of tenants \u2014 it protects them from rent increases, requires owners to offer lease renewals and the right to continued occupancy, imposes strict eviction procedures, and grants succession rights for qualified family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The trustee argues that the benefits of rent stabilization are unlike the other exemptions listed in Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2), such as Social Security benefits, unemployment compensation, and alimony, support, or separate maintenance because those exemptions all involve periodic payments, while the rent-stabilization program does not involve payments to tenants. However, that argument ignores the reality of social programs such as food stamps, vouchers, medical care, discounted prescriptions, and the like, that do not involve payments to the recipients of the benefit. While many public assistance benefits are administered through programs that provide periodic cash payments, such payments are not a prerequisite to a benefit being in the nature of public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Furthermore, when the legislature meant to refer only to \u201cpayments\u201d in the Debtor and Creditor Law, it used that term. For example, in section 282 (2) (e), it exempted certain \u201cpayments\u201d under pension and other plans. But it used the broader term \u201cbenefit\u201d in section 282 (2) (a), indicating that benefits and payments are not the same. Likewise, the legislature has demonstrated that the general term \u201cpublic assistance\u201d denotes more than cash payments. For example, the Social Services Law in effect when Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2) (a) was enacted provided that \u201c[p]ublic assistance and care includes home relief, veteran assistance, aid to dependent children, medical assistance for needy persons, institutional care for adults and child care granted at public expense\u201d (former Social Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>vices Law \u00a7 2 [18] [1982]). The current definition of public assistance is similar. Like other public assistance benefits exempted by New York law from a bankruptcy estate, the Rent Stabilization Law serves a select, defined group of New Yorkers who struggle, in this case, to afford suitable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The trustee also argues that the benefit of a rent-stabilized tenancy cannot be a public assistance benefit because it is not subsidized by the government, as are the other benefits of Social Security and unemployment compensation listed in Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2). However, the rent-stabilization program is an exceptional regulatory scheme that enables a specifically targeted group of tenants to maintain housing in New York City. This uncommon regulatory program reflects the legislative intent to create a benefit for certain individuals who fall below certain income or rent thresholds, based upon the legislature\u2019s conclusion that there is a continuing housing emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">While the rent-stabilization laws do not provide a benefit <em>paid for </em>by the government, they do provide a benefit <em>conferred by </em>the government through regulation aimed at a population that the government deems in need of protection. Among other things, the Rent Stabilization Law caps legal rents. Although the population that benefits from rent stabilization may not meet the requirements for New York City public housing programs or Section 8 assistance, the government, recognizing that housing protection is necessary to benefit a specific group of tenants, has created a public assistance benefit through a unique regulatory scheme applied to private owners of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">There are other public assistance benefits that are, at least in part, regulatory in form. Medicare is an example of a government program that is not solely the creature of a government subsidy. Although the government does, to some extent, contribute to the cost of medical care for Medicare recipients, it also sets the rates that can be charged by doctors. Medicare, like the rent-stabilization program, is not strictly for the needy. It is a public assistance benefit that regulates what doctors can charge for services, while rent stabilization is a public assistance benefit that regulates the rents property owners can charge protected tenants. While the classic examples of public assistance benefits may be solely government subsidized, or a mixture of subsidy and regulation as with Medicare, nothing prevents a targeted regulation from qualifying as a public assistance benefit. The rare regulatory scheme of rent stabilization is such a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Finally, as was recently noted by the United States Supreme Court, exemptions serve the important purpose of protect [ing] the debtor\u2019s essential needs\u201d <em>(Clark v Rameker, </em>573 US \u2014, \u2014, 134 S Ct 2242, 2247 [2014] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). Affordable housing is an essential need. Mindful that exemption statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of debtors <em>(In re Miller, </em>167 BR 782, 783 [SD NY 1994]), the certified question should be answered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b358-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-1\">(dissenting). I dissent, because the majority grossly misreads Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cPublic assistance\u201d is a common synonym for \u201cwelfare.\u201d It refers, in ordinary speech, to government subsidies for the poor, whether paid in cash or in kind. The majority quotes a list of examples from former Social Services Law \u00a7 2 (18): \u201chome relief, veteran assistance, aid to dependent children, medical assistance for needy persons, institutional care for adults and child care granted at public expense\u201d <em>(see </em>majority op at 290). The current version of the statute adds \u201csafety net assistance\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 2 [18]). Neither list includes rent control or rent stabilization, though they have long been and still are prominent features of life in New York. Nor does the statutory list include any other regulatory program not involving a government subsidy. In fact, I do not think I have ever seen or heard the words \u201cpublic assistance\u201d used to refer to such a program before this case, and the majority cites no example of such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Ignoring the generally accepted meaning of \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d the majority chooses to interpret \u201cpublic assistance benefits\u201d in the Debtor and Creditor Law literally. The rent stabilization program is public, in the way that all government regulation is public; it \u201cprovides assistance to a specific segment of the population\u201d that is in economic need; and it \u201cprovides benefits\u201d to that same segment (majority op at 290). The same could be said of a great many programs \u2014 e.g., minimum wage laws; antidiscrimination laws; workplace safety regulations \u2014 that no one would think of calling \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I would like to try asking every rent-controlled or rent-stabilized tenant in New York: \u201cDo you receive public assistance?\u201d I would be surprised to find even one (apart from those receiving government subsidies from other programs) who answered yes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Pigott and Rivera concur; Judge Smith dissents and votes to answer the certified question in the negative in an opinion in which Judge Read concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of this Court\u2019s Rules of Practice, and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
