We are asked to decide whether that corporation is protected from suit by the Seneca Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity. Applying the factors set out in <em>Matter of Ransom v St. Regis Mohawk Educ. &amp; Community Fund </em>(86 NY2d 553 [1995]), we hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>L</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In 2002, the Seneca Nation\u2019s legislative body, the Tribal Council, granted a corporate charter to Seneca Gaming Corporation (Seneca Gaming), under the laws of the Seneca Nation, to develop, finance, operate and maintain gaming facilities. Seneca Gaming is wholly owned by the Seneca Nation. In the same year, again under the laws of the Seneca Nation, the Tribal Council granted a corporate charter to Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corporation (Seneca Niagara), created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Seneca Gaming, to develop, finance, operate and conduct the business of the Nation\u2019s gaming operations in Niagara County specifically. Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara are two of the most financially successful revenue-producing assets of the Seneca Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Lewiston Golf was incorporated in June 2007, under the laws of the Seneca Nation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Seneca Niagara, to develop, finance, operate and conduct the business of an 18-hole golf course in the Town of Lewiston. The following month, it acquired real property from Seneca Niagara, on which to construct the golf course. The property is not part of any Indian reservation and is not sovereign land.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">As Lewiston Golfs predecessor had explained in its application to Niagara County Industrial Development Agency for tax abatements and deferrals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it was \u201clooking to create a championship level public/semi-private golf course offering the millions of visitors [to] the Niagara Falls region and the patrons of the Seneca Niagara Casino &amp; Hotel a new tourist destination project that will attract golf enthusiasts from Canada and the United Statest,] and to capitalize on the growing tourist market, which will create new jobs and allow for prolonged stays in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In resolving to authorize the creation of Lewiston Golf, the Tribal Council stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cthe Lewiston Golf Course [would] be developed and operated as an amenity to [Seneca Niagara]\u2019s casino operations, together with the casino\u2019s lodging, dining, retail and entertainment amenities, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>purpose of which amenities is to enhance the overall success and profitability of the casino\u2019s operations consistent with the powers described in [Seneca Niagara]\u2019s charter and the purposes for which [Seneca Niagara] was formed . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">\u201c[T]he use of a separate corporation or legal entity to own and operate the Lewiston Golf Course is advisable due to various legal and accounting considerations, including the status of the Lewiston Golf Course as an off-territory business venture of the Nation, subject to legal, tax and other requirements that are not applicable to the Nation\u2019s on-territory business . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201c[T]he Nation desires to establish Lewiston Golf ... as a separate legal entity, governmental instrumentality of the Nation, and wholly-owned subsidiary of [Seneca Niagara], for the purpose of developing and operating the Lewiston Golf Course in the Town of Lewiston, New York, and legally doing business in such jurisdictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Lewiston Golfs charter describes in detail the nature of the relation between it and the Seneca Nation. The charter provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u2022 \u201c[n]o activity of [Lewiston Golf] nor any indebtedness incurred by it shall encumber, implicate or in any way involve assets of the Nation or another Nation Entity not assigned or leased in writing to [Lewiston Golf]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u2022 \u201cthe Nation shall not be liable for the debts or obligations of [Lewiston Golf], and [Lewiston Golf] shall have no power to pledge or encumber the assets of the Nation\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u2022 \u201c[t]he Obligations of [Lewiston Golf] shall not be a debt of the Nation or of [Seneca Gaming] or any other Nation-chartered Gaming corporation\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">\u2022 \u201c[Lewiston Golf] shall not have . . . any power ... to borrow or lend money on behalf of the Nation, or to grant or permit or purport to grant or permit any right, lien, encumbrance or interest in or on any of the assets of the Nation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">On the other hand, the Boards of Directors of Lewiston Golf, Seneca Gaming, and Seneca Niagara are identical, are appointed by the Tribal Council, and during this dispute were composed entirely of enrolled members of the Seneca Nation. Lewiston Golf, like Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara, is required by its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>charter to obtain approval from the Seneca Nation before undertaking significant expenditures of resources or personal property; adopting, amending, or repealing corporate bylaws; providing significant guarantees or incurring significant liabilities; lending money to other Seneca Nation entities; buying, selling, or encumbering real property; entering into financing arrangements involving securities; or entering into, performing, or canceling contracts with any government or government agency. Lewiston Golf, like Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara, must keep detailed corporate and financial records and submit for the Seneca Nation\u2019s approval an annual statement of its financial condition. And Lewiston Golf, once again like Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara, is required to receive consent from the Seneca Nation before taking such legal actions as commencing a lawsuit, consenting to a court\u2019s jurisdiction, or waiving a claim to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In the summer of 2007, plaintiff Sue/Perior Concrete &amp; Paving, Inc. (Sue/Perior) entered into a contract with Lewiston Golf, whereby Sue/Perior would build a golf course on the property, for the sum of $12,700,000. However, the business relationship between Sue/Perior and Lewiston Golf deteriorated in 2009. Sue/Perior demanded payment of certain bills; Lewiston Golf insisted that Sue/Perior was seeking remuneration for work not done or exaggerating its costs. Sue/Perior filed mechanic\u2019s liens, the third of which is in the amount of $4,130,538, for materials furnished and labor performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Sue/Perior commenced this foreclosure action against Lewiston Golf and other defendants in June 2010, with respect to that mechanic\u2019s lien. Lewiston Golf counterclaimed for willfully exaggerated lien, fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. Sue/Perior subsequently amended its complaint to add additional defendants \u2014 Seneca Niagara, Seneca Gaming, and 15 corporate officers and directors \u2014 and to assert additional causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, promissory estoppel, and fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Seneca Niagara, Seneca Gaming, Lewiston Golf and the individual defendants moved to dismiss Sue/Perior\u2019s complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211, alleging protection from suit under the sovereign immunity of the Seneca Nation. Supreme Court denied the motion to dismiss, ruling, as pertinent here, that Lewiston Golf did not qualify as an \u201carm\u201d of the Seneca Nation. Lewiston Golf appealed. For its part, Sue/Perior withdrew claims against all defendants except Lewiston Golf.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s order, as modified in a manner not relevant here (109 AD3d 80 [4th Dept 2013]). In ruling that Lewiston Golf lacked sovereign immunity, the Appellate Division relied on our decision in <em>Matter of Ransom. </em>There, we set out factors for courts to consider when deciding whether a tribal subagency or a corporate entity affiliated with an Indian tribe is entitled to sovereign immunity, as the tribe itself is. The Appellate Division found that most of the <em>Ransom </em>factors, and in particular those that the <em>Ransom </em>court \u201ccharacterized as the \u00a3[m]ore important ]\u2019 financial factors, weigh in favor of a determination that [Lewiston Golf] does not share in the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity\u201d (109 AD3d at 88, quoting <em>Ransom, </em>86 NY2d at 559 [some brackets in Appellate Division opinion]). The Appellate Division noted, for example, that \u201c[Lewiston Golf]\u2019s charter clearly provides that [Lewiston Golf] has no power to bind or otherwise obligate the funds of the Nation\u201d and that \u201cthe record is devoid of evidence that a lawsuit against [Lewiston Golf] would adversely impact the Nation\u2019s treasury either directly or indirectly\u201d (109 AD3d at 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With respect to the non-financial factor comparing Lewiston Golfs purposes with those of the Nation, the Appellate Division found that statements by the Tribal Council and the documents Lewiston Golf submitted to the Industrial Development Agency in support of its request for economic assistance</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201creflect that the purpose of [Lewiston Golf] ... is several steps removed from the purposes of tribal government . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u00a3\u00a3[T]he central purpose of the golf course project was not to provide funds for traditional governmental programs or services but, rather, was to serve as a regional economic engine . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cNotably absent is any reference to improving the quality of life on reservation lands, creating jobs for Native Americans living on the reservation, or generating funds to support educational, social, or other government-related programs for tribal members\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 89-90).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, the Appellate Division observed \u201cthat declining to extend sovereign immunity to [Lewiston Golf] under the circumstances of this case will not diminish the policies underlying tribal sovereign immunity. . . . Here, permitting [Lewiston Golf] to retreat behind the Nation\u2019s cloak of sovereign immunity after it held itself out as an independent, market-participating entity subject to the jurisdiction of the State of New York, including its courts, would discourage non-Indians from entering into business relationships with the Nation\u2019s corporations, which may well retard the Nation\u2019s economic growth and undermine one of the purposes of its sovereign immunity\u201d (109 AD3d at 92 [internal quotation marks, citation and brackets omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Appellate Division granted Lewiston Golf leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the question whether its order was properly made. We now affirm and answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Indian tribes possess the common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers, unless waived. In <em>Matter of Ransom, </em>we set out several factors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for courts to use to determine whether an entity, such as a corporation or agency, that is affiliated with an Indian tribe has the right to claim sovereign immunity against suit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">\u201cAlthough no set formula is dispositive, in determining whether a particular tribal organization is an \u2018arm\u2019 of the tribe entitled to share the tribe\u2019s immunity from suit, courts generally consider such factors as whether: [1] the entity is organized under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the tribe\u2019s laws or constitution rather than Federal law; [2] the organization\u2019s purposes are similar to or serve those of the tribal government; [3] the organization\u2019s governing body is comprised mainly of tribal officials; [4] the tribe has legal title or ownership of property used by the organization; [5] tribal officials exercise control over the administration or accounting activities of the organization; and [6] the tribe\u2019s governing body has power to dismiss members of the organization\u2019s governing body. More importantly, courts will consider whether [7] the corporate entity generates its own revenue, whether [8] a suit against the corporation will impact the tribe\u2019s fiscal resources, and whether [9] the subentity has the power to bind or obligate the funds of the tribe. The vulnerability of the tribe\u2019s coffers in defending a suit against the subentity indicates that the real party in interest is the tribe.\u201d (Ransom, 86 NY2d at 559-560 [internal quotation marks, citations and brackets omitted].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Applying these factors, we held in <em>Ransom </em>that the St. Regis Mohawk Education and Community Fund \u2014 a nonprofit corporation, organized under the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, providing educational, health care, social and historical services to residents of the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in Franklin County \u2014 was a tribal entity that enjoyed sovereign immunity from suit. We explained that \u201c[t]he Fund was established to enhance the health, education and welfare of Tribe members, a function traditionally shouldered by tribal government. Additionally, the Fund received its resources from the Tribe, and the Tribe was designated by the Fund as the recipient of its funds and services. Critically, under its by-laws, the Fund\u2019s governing body may only be comprised of elected Chiefs of the Tribe. Thus, the Fund\u2019s provision of social services on behalf of and under the direct fiscal and administrative control of the Tribe renders it an entity so closely allied with and dependent upon the Tribe that it is entitled to the protection of tribal sovereign immunity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 560).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We begin our discussion of the present appeal with the functions or purposes factor. The question is whether Lewiston Golfs purposes are similar to, or serve, those of the Seneca Nation. The Appellate Division reasoned that Lewiston Golf\u2019s purposes are significantly different from those of tribal govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ment, because Lewiston Golf has functioned to develop an amenity outside the Seneca Nation\u2019s reservation land that would serve as a regional economic engine, not to promote tribal welfare on the reservation directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Lewiston Golf and the dissent rely on <em>Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. </em>(523 US 751 [1998]), in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that \u201c[t]ribes enjoy immunity from suits on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental or commercial activities and whether they were made on or off a reservation\u201d (523 US at 760). In <em>Kiowa Tribe, </em>a private party sued an Indian tribe for defaulting on a promissory note, and asked the courts to limit tribal immunity to suits involving conduct on reservations or involving noncommercial activities. The Supreme Court refused to create a \u201creservation\u201d or a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception to the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity from suit. Recently, a sharply fractured Supreme Court declined to revisit that decision <em>(see Michigan v Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US \u2014, 134 S Ct 2024 [2014]).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Lewiston Golf contends that it is inconsistent with <em>Kiowa Tribe </em>to treat the fact that an Indian tribe\u2019s subsidiary engages primarily in commercial activities not located on the tribe\u2019s reservation as evidence that the subsidiary is not an \u201carm\u201d of the tribe. We disagree. <em>Kiowa </em>and <em>Bay Mills </em>do not apply in the present appeal, because they concerned lawsuits against Indian tribes themselves, not against corporate affiliates of tribes. They do not illuminate questions concerning whether such an entity is an \u201carm\u201d of the tribe. The United States Supreme Court has never held that corporations affiliated with an Indian tribe have sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">As the Appellate Division notes, the primary purpose of creating the golf course in Lewiston was to act as a regional economic engine and thereby serve the profit-making interests of the Seneca Nation\u2019s casino operations in the area. While this may result in more funds for government projects on the Seneca Nation\u2019s reservations and elsewhere that benefit members of the tribe, we agree with the Appellate Division that the purposes of Lewiston Golf were sufficiently different from tribal goals that they militate against Lewiston Golf\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity. However, the purposes factor of <em>Ransom </em>is not determinative, and we proceed to discuss the other criteria. While some of the remaining <em>Ransom </em>factors favor the conclusion that Lewiston Golf is protected by sovereign immunity, the most important ones strongly support the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">It is true that Lewiston Golf was organized under tribal law, not federal law, and that Lewiston Golf\u2019s governing body is comprised of tribal officials. The Seneca Nation controls Lewiston Golfs Board of Directors, which is made up exclusively of enrolled members of the Nation appointed by the Tribal Council. Moreover, it is clear from the record that tribal officials exercise control over the administration or accounting activities of Lewiston Golf, and that the tribe\u2019s governing body has power to dismiss members of Lewiston Golfs governing body. Indeed, the Tribal Council has exclusive authority to remove members of Lewiston Golf\u2019s Board. These considerations indicate that Lewiston Golf is dependent on the Seneca Nation in a manner that might suggest it partakes in the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">However, all the remaining <em>Ransom </em>factors, and particularly those that consider the financial relationship between the subsidiary or agency and the Indian nation, support the conclusion that Lewiston Golf lacks sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">First, the Seneca Nation does not have legal title or ownership of the golf course being developed by Lewiston Golf. Contrary to the Seneca Nation\u2019s contention, the question posed by this factor is not whether Lewiston Golf is owned by the tribe. Rather, the issue is whether the property used by Lewiston Golf is owned by the tribe, and the record leaves no room for doubt that the owner of the golf course is Lewiston Golf, not the Seneca Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Next, and most significantly, the record firmly indicates the intent to ensure that a suit against Lewiston Golf will not impact the Seneca Nation\u2019s fiscal resources. The founding charter provided that no indebtedness incurred by it would \u201cin any way involve assets of the Nation,\u201d which would \u201cnot be liable for the debts or obligations\u201d incurred by Lewiston Golf. The charter stated that Lewiston Golf would have no power to allow \u201cany right, lien, encumbrance or interest in or on any of the assets of the Nation.\u201d All the evidence in the record points to the conclusion that Lewiston Golf lacks the power to bind or obligate the funds of the Seneca Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In response, Lewiston Golf does not deny that the statements in the charter have their ordinary meaning and that the Seneca Nation intended to create a corporation for whose debts it would not be liable. Lewiston Golf does not contend that the Seneca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Nation\u2019s independent coffers are vulnerable. Rather, it argues that a lawsuit against Lewiston Golf would have an economic impact on the Seneca Nation because revenues that would otherwise be distributed to the Nation will not be available. Lewiston Golf expressly concedes that it generates its own revenue, rather than being dependent on the resources of the Seneca Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Whether Lewiston Golf\u2019s revenues will become part of the Seneca Nation\u2019s resources, as Lewiston Golf emphasizes, is beside the point. The test, with respect to the financial relationship factors of <em>Ransom, </em>is not the indirect effects of any liability on the tribe\u2019s income, but rather whether the immediate obligations are assumed by the tribe. Here, the financial obligations were assumed by Lewiston Golf and any liability insurer, not by the Seneca Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">These financial relationship considerations are the most important of the <em>Ransom </em>factors, as we noted when we first set out the criteria (see <em>Ransom, </em>86 NY2d at 559). In attributing such weight to them, we have taken into consideration federal precedent on the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States. While the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe is not based on the Federal Constitution, it has in common with Eleventh Amendment immunity <em>\u201ca </em>background of traditional ideas about the power and privileges of the sovereign\u201d <em>(Runyon v Association of Vil. Council Presidents, </em>84 P3d 437, 440 n 12 [Alaska Sup Ct 2004]; <em>see Thebo v Choctaw Tribe of Indians, </em>66 F 372, 376 [8th Cir 1895]). In considering whether an entity is an \u201carm\u201d of an Indian tribe, the most significant factor is the effect on tribal treasuries, just as \u201cthe vulnerability of the State\u2019s purse\u201d is considered \u201cthe most salient factor\u201d in determinations of a State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity <em>(Hess v Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, </em>513 US 30, 48 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">If a judgment against a corporation created by an Indian tribe will not reach the tribe\u2019s assets, because the corporation lacks \u201cthe power to bind or obligate the funds of the tribe\u201d <em>(Ransom, </em>86 NY2d at 559 [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]), then the corporation is not an \u201carm\u201d of the tribe. However, if a tribe is legally responsible for a corporation\u2019s obligations, the tribe is \u201cthe real party in interest\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 560). As the Supreme Court of Alaska has observed, in a thoughtful opinion, \u201ca tribe might, for commercial purposes, wish to form a corporation exposed to suit in order to cultivate trust with business partners. . . . The tribes\u2019 use of the corporate form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>protects their assets from being called upon to answer the corporation\u2019s debt. But this protection means that they are not the real party in interest\u201d <em>(Runyon, </em>84 P3d at 441; <em>accord e.g. American Prop. Mgt. Corp. v Superior Court, </em>206 Cal App 4th 491, 506, 141 Cal Rptr 3d 802, 813-814 [4th Dist, Div 1 2012]; <em>Uniband, Inc. v Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>140 TC 230, 255 [2013]; <em>Seaport Loan Prods., LLC v Lower Brule Community Dev. Enter. LLC, </em>41 Misc 3d 1218[A], 2013 NY Slip Op 51765[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2013]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, protection of a tribal treasury against liability in a corporate charter is strong evidence against the retention of sovereign immunity by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The dissent\u2019s principal objection to our ruling is that lower courts have found that Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara have sovereign immunity <em>(see </em>dissenting op at 556-560, citing <em>Sue/Perior Concrete &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>99 AD3d 1203; <em>Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corp., </em>2005 WL 3510348, 2005 Conn Super LEXIS 3295; <em>Warren v United States, </em>859 F Supp 2d 522 [WD NY 2012], <em>affd </em>517 Fed Appx 54 [2d Cir 2013]; <em>Myers v Seneca Niagara Casino, </em>488 F Supp 2d 166 [ND NY 2006]). Neither this Court nor the United States Supreme Court has so held, and our decision today may imply the opposite. As noted above, the question whether a corporate affiliate of an Indian tribe is protected by the tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity has not been settled by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, even assuming that it is a pure question of federal law, we remain at liberty to answer it in a manner that may conflict with the determinations of courts in our federal circuit. Contrary to the dissent, New York State courts are not bound by the decisions of federal courts, other than the United States Supreme Court, on questions of federal constitutional law <em>(see </em>Arthur Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals \u00a7 1:8 at 18 [3d ed rev 2005]). It is well-established that \u201cthe interpretation of a Federal constitutional question by the lower Federal courts may serve as useful and persuasive authority for our Court <em>while not binding us. </em>This Court in its long-standing tradition and indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>dent responsibility has exercised its correlative adjudicative power on questions of Federal law\u201d <em>(People v Kin Kan, </em>78 NY2d 54, 60 [1991] [citation omitted and emphasis added], citing <em>New York R.T. Corp. v City of New York, </em>275 NY 258, 265 [1937] [noting that a decision of the Second Circuit, \u201cwhile entitled to great weight, is not binding on this court\u201d], <em>affd </em>303 US 573 [1938]; <em>see also e.g. People v Konstantinides, </em>14 NY3d 1, 13 [2009]; <em>Matter of Mason [State Commn. on Jud. Conduct], </em>100 NY2d 56, 58 [2003]). The same principle applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Alternatively, it could be argued that Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara are distinguishable from Lewiston Golf in that their purposes are more closely aligned with those of the Seneca Nation. In any case, that question is not before us, and the dissent simply begs the question, assuming \u2014 what has not been held by this Court or the Supreme Court \u2014 that Lewiston Golfs corporate parents have sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In conclusion, we agree with the Appellate Division that the most significant <em>Ransom </em>factors count against sovereign immunity on the part of Lewiston Golf. Its ruling was proper. It is unnecessary for us to address the parties\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\">. The application was approved, and eventually Lewiston Golf and the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency entered into a payment-in-lieu-of-tax agreement, providing for Lewiston Golf to make payments in lieu of taxes, as well as a lease agreement and leaseback agreement. In this manner, Lewiston Golf was granted certain exemptions from real property and sales taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. Sue/Perior also commenced a separate action against Seneca Gaming, Seneca Niagara, and certain individual defendants \u2014 but not Lewiston Golf-alleging tortious interference with contract, tortious interference with prospective business advantage, concerted action, and prima facie tort (punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>damages). The Appellate Division dismissed Sue/Perior\u2019s complaint <em>(Sue/Perior Concrete &amp; Paving, Inc. v Seneca Gaming Corp., </em>99 AD3d 1203 [4th Dept 2012]). We take no position on whether that appeal was properly decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\">. Some commentators justifiably refer to our \u201cnine factors\u201d (see <em>e.g. </em>Gregory J. Wong, Note &amp; Comment, <em>Intent Matters: Assessing Sovereign Immunity for Tribal Entities, </em>82 Wash L Rev 205, 220 [2007]), but the last two, or last three, factors have often been treated as one by courts citing <em>Ransom, </em>generating an eight-factor or seven-factor test (see <em>e.g. Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corp. v Klewin Bldg. Co., Inc., </em>2005 WL 3510348, 2005 Conn Super LEXIS 3295 [Jud Dist of New London 2005, No. KNL-CV-05-4004218-S]). We too treat the last three factors as closely interrelated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-5\">.

The question on this appeal is whether a corporate subsidiary of a corporation owned and controlled by an Indian Tribe, and which exists solely for the economic benefit of the Tribe and its members, is immune from private suit based on the Tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity. I can find no rational legal basis to distinguish between the corporate parent, which is a recognized arm of the Tribe, and its subsidiary. Therefore, I would find the subsidiary is immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The Seneca Nation of Indians (the Nation) is a sovereign Tribe, predating the creation of the United States, with its own government, laws and cultural identity (see Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, 79 Fed Reg 4748-02 [2014]; <em>Seneca Nation of Indians v State of New York, </em>26 F Supp 2d 555, 560 [WD NY 1998], <em>affd </em>178 F3d 95 [2d Cir 1999]). As a tribal sovereign it provides its members with various health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>education-related services and programs, which are dependent on the Nation\u2019s financial stability and well-being. The Nation has identified the gaming industry as \u201cvitally important to the economy of the Nation and the general welfare of its members\u201d (Seneca Gaming Corporate Charter Law Enactment, Council of the Seneca Nation of Indians, Aug. 1, 2002). As part of its economic development activities it has created and chartered, under the Nation\u2019s corporate charter, three interlocking corporate entities, intended to further the Nation\u2019s gaming operations, all for the benefit of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Nation created the Seneca Gaming Corporation (Seneca Gaming) to \u201cfinance, develop, construct, operate, and maintain Nation Gaming Facilities.\u201d The Nation then created the Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corporation (Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming) as a subsidiary of Seneca Gaming, for purposes of \u201cdeveloping, financing, operating and conducting the business of the Nation Gaming Facility\u201d on Nation territory located in Niagara County, New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming is subject to the \u201ccontrol, operation and management\u201d of Seneca Gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The Nation decided to capitalize on the subsequent success of its gaming operations, and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming commenced development of a golf course in the Town of Lewiston, New York in Niagara County. The Nation thereafter created the Lewiston Golf Course Corporation (Lewiston Golf) \u201cas a separate legal entity, governmental instrumentality of the Nation, and wholly-owned subsidiary of [Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming], for the purpose of developing and operating the Lewiston Golf Course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">All three of the Nation\u2019s resolutions creating Seneca Gaming, Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, and Lewiston Golf, and their respective corporate charters provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cit is declared the policy of the Nation to promote the welfare and prosperity of its members and to actively promote, attract, encourage and develop economically sound commerce and industry through governmental action for the purpose of preventing unemployment and economic stagnation; and . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cthe economic success of the Nation\u2019s gaming operations is vitally important to the economy of the Nation and the general welfare of its members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Plaintiff Sue/Perior Concrete &amp; Paving, Inc., a contracting company who had previously done business with the Nation, entered a contract with Lewiston Golf to construct the golf course. After certain payment disputes, plaintiff filed a mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure action against Lewiston Golf in Niagara County. Plaintiff also filed an action in Erie County against several of the same defendants, with the exception of Lewiston Golf, but Erie County Supreme Court dismissed that action based on the sovereign immunity of Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Lewiston Golf moved to dismiss the action, asserting sovereign immunity against suit as an arm of the Nation. Supreme Court and the Appellate Division both rejected this contention, and held that Lewiston Golf is not an arm of the Nation. The majority now agrees, and based on <em>Matter of Ransom v St. Regis Mohawk Educ. &amp; Community Fund </em>(86 NY2d 553 [1995]) concludes that because Lewiston Golf is without power to bind or obligate the Nation\u2019s funds it lacks a sufficient financial relationship with the Nation to entitle it to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I disagree with the majority that certain financial factors identified by this Court in <em>Ransom, </em>and as applied here, should be treated as outcome determinative of the question of the expanse of the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity over its corporate subsidiary Lewiston Golf. Instead, our focus should be the purpose and corporate structure of Lewiston Golf. As a corporate entity created and chartered by the Nation, established to enhance the Nation\u2019s gaming operations for the purpose of benefitting the Nation\u2019s members, I would hold Lewiston Golf is clothed with the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Tribes are \u201c \u2018separate sovereigns pre-existing the [United States] Constitution\u2019 \u201d <em>(Michigan v Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US \u2014, \u2014, 134 S Ct 2024, 2030 [2014], quoting <em>Santa Clara Pueblo v Martinez, </em>436 US 49, 56 [1978]), and possess \u201c \u2018common-law immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>Santa Clara Pueblo, </em>436 US at 58). Indeed, \u201csovereign immunity [is] an inherent part of the concept of sovereignty and what it means to be a sovereign\u201d <em>(Breakthrough Mgt. Group, Inc. v Chukchansi Gold Casino &amp; Resort, </em>629 F3d 1173, 1182 [10th Cir 2010]), and \u201cis \u2018a necessary corollary to Indian . . . self-governance\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2030, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v Wold Engineering, P.

Sovereign immunity serves interests essential to tribal identity, and is fundamental to the survival and growth of tribes and their members. Moreover, immunity is \u201c \u2018necessary to promote the federal policies of tribal self[-] determination, economic development, and cultural autonomy\u2019 \u201d <em>(Breakthrough Mgt. Group, Inc., </em>629 F3d at 1182 [modification in original], quoting <em>American Indian Agric. Credit Consortium, Inc. v Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, </em>780 F2d 1374, 1378 [8th Cir 1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The United States Supreme Court has broadly applied tribal sovereign immunity to extend to \u201csuits on contracts, whether those contracts involve governmental or commercial activities and whether they were made on or off\u201d Indian lands <em>(Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., </em>523 US 751, 760 [1998]; <em>see also Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2030-2031). There are no exemptions for tribal commercial activity <em>(see Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y. v Seneca County, N.Y., </em>761 F3d 218, 221 [2d Cir 2014]), and, thus, sovereign immunity extends to tribal business ventures <em>(Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., </em>498 US 505, 510 [1991]). Immunity may be limited only by Congress or express waiver of a tribe <em>(Kiowa, </em>523 US at 754).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Unsurprisingly, \u201ctribes across the country, as well as entities and individuals doing business with them, have for many years relied on [Supreme Court precedent], negotiating their contracts and structuring their transactions against a backdrop of tribal immunity\u201d <em>(Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2036, referencing <em>Kiowa, </em>523 US 751). Over the years tribal activities have grown, \u201ctribal gaming revenues [have] increased more than thirty fold,\u201d and \u201cother tribal enterprises, ranging from cigarette sales to ski resorts\u201d have flourished <em>(Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2037; <em>see </em>572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2050-2051 [Thomas, J., dissenting]). \u201c[T]ribal business operations are critical to the goals of tribal self-sufficiency because such enterprises in some cases \u2018may be the only means by which a tribe can raise revenues.\u2019 This is due in large part to the insuperable (and often state-imposed) barriers Tribes face in raising revenue through more traditional means\u201d (572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2043 [Sotomayor, J., concurring] [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">As federal courts have held, the Seneca Nation of Indians has immunity from suit based on its status as a sovereign Indian Nation <em>(Seneca Nation of Indians, </em>178 F3d 95) and that Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming and Seneca Gaming are arms of the Nation (W<em>arren v United States, </em>859 F Supp 2d 522, 540-541 [WD NY 2012], <em>affd </em>517 Fed Appx 54 [2d Cir 2013]; <em>Myers v Seneca Niagara Casino, </em>488 F Supp 2d 166 [ND NY 2006]) fully clothed with the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity. The question of whether Lewiston Golf, another subentity of the Nation, may assert sovereign immunity then seems a rather straightforward one, and one which should be decided in Lewiston Golfs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Tribal sovereignty, including immunity from suit, \u201cis subject to the superior and plenary control of Congress [and] without congressional authorization, the Indian Nations are exempt from suit\u201d <em>(Santa Clara Pueblo, </em>436 US at 58 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). As such, tribal immunity is \u201ca matter of federal law and is not subject to diminution by the States\u201d <em>(Kiowa, </em>523 US at 756). The Nation is a sovereign with its own government and rights to self-determination, and as such empowered to determine how best to structure its business ventures. Therefore, we are without authority, absent congressional limitation, to reject the Nation\u2019s adoption of a corporate structure that furthers its economic development goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The majority relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ransom </em>for the legal framework by which to decide Lewiston Golfs sovereign immunity. However, <em>Ransom </em>was decided before the United States Supreme Court announced its decisions in <em>Kiowa </em>and <em>Bay Mills Indian Community </em>recognizing sovereign immunity applied broadly to Indian business ventures, even those outside Indian lands. Therefore, the factors in <em>Ransom </em>cannot supercede federal proscriptions, and we must be cautious not to rely on these factors in a way that conflicts with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The record makes abundantly clear that the Nation created Lewiston Golf as a commercial business venture to increase the Nation\u2019s gaming revenues for the benefit of the Tribe and its members. The Nation determined that the best way to pursue this goal is through a corporate structure whereby Lewiston Golf is controlled by the Nation\u2019s corporate entity. As a sovereign, the Nation is certainly able to decide that this corporate arrangement will enhance its economic independence and sustain its tribal membership and self-sustaining tribal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>government. The Nation, having made that choice, is no less entitled to expect that the protections afforded by its sovereign immunity will apply equally to the activities of Lewiston Golf as it does to the activities of Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The logic of treating uniformly the corporate entities for sovereign immunity purposes is illustrated by comparing Lewiston Golf and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming. As their respective corporate charters reveal, Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming and Lewiston Golf are strikingly similar, both are owned by an arm of the Nation (Seneca Gaming in the case of Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming in the case of Lewiston Golf), and both are controlled and run by the Nation. Both seek to increase the Nation\u2019s revenue, with the obvious difference that Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming was created for the \u201cpurpose of developing, constructing, owning, leasing, operating, managing, maintaining, promoting and financing a Nation Gaming Facility on Nation territory within the exterior boundaries of Niagara County pursuant to the terms of the [gaming] Compact,\u201d and Lewiston Golfs purpose is to \u201cdevelop[ ], construct [ ], own[ ], leas[e], operat[e], manag[e], maintain [ ], promot[e] and financ[e] the Lewiston Golf Course on land\u201d which at the time of Lewiston Golf\u2019s creation was owned by Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming. Thus, one exists to maintain a casino for the Nation\u2019s benefit, the other exists to maintain a golf course to enhance casino revenues for the Nation\u2019s benefit. Both improve the Nation\u2019s economic position. Moreover, not only are they similar in purpose and service to the Nation and its members, but Lewiston Golf is intended as an amenity to the casino to \u201cfurther[ ] . . . the economic success of the Nation\u2019s gaming operations.\u201d The point of both business enterprises is to bring revenues to the Nation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the golf course was owned by Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, a recognized arm of the Nation, there would be no question that sovereign immunity would foreclose plaintiff\u2019s suit against Lewiston Golf. Consequently, there is no logical basis to treat Lewiston Golf differently simply because it is a subsidiary of Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Therefore, I can find no legally defensible ground for rejecting sovereign immunity to Lewiston Golf, a corporate entity that is established under the Nation\u2019s laws and constitution, chartered by the Nation to develop, construct and operate a golf course in furtherance of the Nation\u2019s existing gaming operations, and, consistent with the Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming charter, controlled by Nation officials who make all significant business decisions. Like its parent Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, Lewiston Golf is an engine for tribal economic development and growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The majority claims that there is no legal support for presuming Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming\u2019s sovereign immunity. However, in <em>Warren </em>the district court, as affirmed by the Second Circuit, held that Seneca Gaming \u201cis a government instrumentality entitled to immunity\u201d (859 F Supp 2d at 541), finding specifically that Seneca Gaming</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201cis incorporated under Seneca tribal law; it was created to generate income to provide for the general welfare of [the Nation\u2019s] members; a majority of the board of directors are enrolled Senecas; [Seneca Gaming\u2019s] principal place of business is on the Cattaraugus reservation; all important corporate acts require approval of the tribal Council; [and] the tribal Council may remove [Seneca Gaming] board members for cause\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In <em>Myers, </em>the district court stated that Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming \u201cenjoys all of the privileges and immunities of the Nation\u201d <em>(Myers v Seneca Niagara Casino, </em>488 F Supp 2d at 167-168 n 2). Thus, it is undisputed that under federal law these entities are entitled to the Nation\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Nevertheless, the majority casts these decisions to the wind, and asserts that in the instant appeal it may ignore federal precedent and place in question sovereign immunity as it applies to the Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, and a fortiori Lewiston Golf (majority op at 551). According to the majority, it is free to apply outdated decisions, propound unfounded conclusions, and clear its own path on the question of sovereign immunity until such time as the United States Supreme Court speaks on the issue. Well the Supreme Court has spoken, and we are bound to comply with its pronouncement that tribal sovereign immunity is a federal matter \u201cnot subject to diminution by the States\u201d <em>(Kiowa, </em>523 US at 756). Thus, our Court is without authority to render tribal commercial activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>meaningless by subjecting tribal entities to suit in contravention of federally recognized immunity. Consequently, with respect to Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming the law is currently settled in New York that they are arms of the Nation and clothed with sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Implicit in the majority\u2019s argument for rejecting Lewiston Golf\u2019s claim is the notion that the corporate form, and the protections therein, categorically bars the extension of sovereign immunity. This is simply an irrelevant consideration because the sovereign immunity of a tribe extends to its subordinate economic entities <em>(see e.g. Native Am. Distrib. v Seneca-Cayuga Tobacco Co., </em>546 F3d 1288 [10th Cir 2008] [tobacco manufacturer]), including corporate entities <em>(see e.g. Memphis Biofuels, LLC v Chickasaw Nation Indus., Inc., </em>585 F3d 917, 921 [6th Cir 2009] [tribal conglomerate was an arm of the Tribe; incorporating under 25 USC \u00a7 477, i.e., a section 17 corporation, did not automatically waive tribal sovereign immunity]; <em>Koscielak v Stockbridge-Munsee Community, </em>340 Wis 2d 409, 418, 811 NW2d 451, 456 [2012] [golf course and supper club], <em>review granted </em>342 Wis 2d 155, 816 NW2d 321 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The majority rests its decision on Lewiston Golfs apparent inability to bind or obligate the funds of the Seneca Nation. As noted above, the financial and administrative duties and obligations of Lewiston Golf the Seneca Nation are nearly identical to those of Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming. According to their charters, neither can bind nor obligate the funds of the Seneca Nation. Yet, Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming is an arm of the Tribe <em>(see Sue/Perior Concrete &amp; Paving, Inc. v Seneca Gaming Corp., </em>99 AD3d 1203 [4th Dept 2012]; <em>Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corp. v Klewin Bldg. Co., Inc., </em>2005 WL 3510348, *5, 2005 Conn Super LEXIS 3295, *14 [Nov. 30, 2005, No. KNL-CV-05-4004218-S] [Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seneca Gaming is a governmental instrumentality of the Seneca Nation]; <em>Warren, </em>859 F Supp 2d at 540-541 [Seneca Gaming entitled to immunity; finding Seneca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Gaming charter provisions incorporated in all relevant respects into the Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming charter], citing <em>Klewin Bldg. Co., Inc., </em>2005 WL 3510348, *5, 2005 Conn Super LEXIS 3295, *12-14; <em>Myers, </em>488 F Supp 2d at 167-168 n 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In deciding the expanse of sovereign immunity, our focus should be on the purpose and goals of the corporate entity. We should look to whether the corporate entity furthers tribal self-determination and self-governance, and as such, benefits the tribe\u2019s members. Therefore, I would not rely primarily on <em>Ransom\u2019s </em>financial interconnectedness factors. Indeed, federal and state courts have criticized the multi-factor approach to subordinate economic analysis as contravening <em>Kiowa (see Kiowa, </em>523 US at 754-755; <em>Breakthrough Mgt. Group, Inc., </em>629 F3d at 1185-1189 [expressly overruling district court\u2019s holding that financial interconnectedness is a threshold factor]; <em>Cash Advance &amp; Preferred Cash Loans v State, </em>242 P3d 1099, 1110 n 12 [Colo 2010] [distinguishing <em>Ransom </em>as <em>pre-KiowaJ). </em>Moreover, <em>Runyon, </em>also a pr<em>e-Kiowa </em>case, was an expressly narrow ruling, which relied on <em>Ransom </em>and Alaska corporate law <em>(Runyon v Association of Vil. Council Presidents, </em>84 P3d 437, 441 [Alaska Sup Ct 2004], citing Alaska Stat \u00a7 10.20.051 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Plaintiff argues that even if Lewiston Golf is entitled to sovereign immunity, that immunity has been waived and thus it is subject to suit. I can find no basis in law or the record to support waiver. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, \u201can Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity\u201d <em>(Kiowa, </em>523 US at 754). Just this past term, in <em>Michigan v Bay Mills Indian Community, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed, not only that it is for Congress \u201cto abrogate tribal immunity for off-reservation commercial conduct,\u201d but that Congress has chosen not to do so (572 US at \u2014, 134 S Ct at 2031).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">As the court in <em>Ransom </em>recognized, \u201cpreserving tribal resources and tribal autonomy are matters of vital importance\u201d and waiver of \u201csovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed\u201d <em>(Ransom, </em>86 NY2d at 560-561 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting <em>Santa Clara Pueblo, </em>436 US at 58). \u201c[W]aivers . . . are . . . strictly construed in favor of the Tribe\u201d <em>(Ransom, </em>86 NY2d at 561 [internal quotation marks omitted], quoting <em>Rupp v Omaha Indian Tribe, </em>45 F3d 1241, 1245 [8th Cir 1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s contract with Lewiston Golf lacks any express waiver of sovereign immunity. Plaintiff seeks to avoid sovereign immunity arguing that Lewiston Golf is subject to suit for the mechanic\u2019s lien foreclosure. However, courts have failed to recognize the distinction between in rem and in personum jurisdiction asserted by the respondent <em>(see Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y., </em>761 F3d 218, 220; <em>Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v Madison County, Oneida County, N.Y., </em>605 F3d 149, 159 [2d Cir 2010], <em>vacated on other grounds and remanded </em>562 US 42 [2011]). Regardless, the suit ultimately seeks to enforce Lewiston Golfs alleged debt to the plaintiff, and does not seek title to the land, so even plaintiffs in rem theory must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">I would reverse the Appellate Division because Lewiston Golf is entitled to sovereign immunity, therefore I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-5\">Judges Graffeo, Smith and Abdus-Salaam concur; Judge Rivera dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge Lippman and Judge Read concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Order affirmed, with costs, and certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">. The Nation Gaming Facility operates in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the Compact between the Nation and New York State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-5\">. There is certainly nothing unique in establishing a golf course as an economic development venture. As Lewiston Golf points out, New York has several public golf courses that are public amenities that \u201ccreate jobs and support economic development.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\">. Realizing that it cannot avoid federal law, the majority opines that perhaps Lewiston Golf is different from the other Seneca corporate entities because the purposes of Seneca Gaming and Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming are more aligned with those of the Nation (majority op at 552). The record belies any such distinction. Indeed, the corporate charters are quite clear that the purpose of these three entities is to benefit the Nation and its members through \u201cgovernmental action for the purpose of preventing unemployment and economic stagnation,\u201d achieved through the economic success of the Nation\u2019s gaming operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
