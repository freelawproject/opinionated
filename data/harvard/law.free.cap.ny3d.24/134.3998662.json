The court violated William O\u2019Daniel\u2019s right to his choice of counsel when retained counsel became gravely ill and was hospitalized. <em>(People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264; <em>United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140; <em>People v Price, </em>262 NY 410; <em>People v McLaughlin, </em>291 NY 480; <em>People v Sides, </em>75 NY2d 822; <em>Powell v Alabama, </em>287 US 45; <em>Chandler v Fretag, </em>348 US 3; <em>Wheat v United States, </em>486 US 153; <em>Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v United States, </em>491 US 617; <em>United States v Morrison, </em>449 US 361.)

Martineau was suffering at the time from a debilitating medical condition. On March 1, 2010, Martineau requested an adjournment of defendant\u2019s trial, scheduled to begin the following week in County Court, due to a \u201cflare-up\u201d of his medical condition. The request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">On April 28, 2010, following a hospitalization, Martineau requested another adjournment on medical grounds, but also mentioned that if adjournment were problematic for County Court then he would \u201cadvise [his] client and assist him in attempting to obtain substitute counsel in an effort to move this matter along.\u201d The trial was rescheduled to August 16, and finally, after the People sought an adjournment, to October 12, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">In the fall of 2010, Martineau\u2019s health was again poor. At the suggestion of County Court, Martineau identified a \u201csecond chair\u201d who would take over if his health worsened: attorney Bruno, who had represented defendant at his arraignment. Martineau took a turn for the worse and defendant\u2019s file was delivered to Bruno\u2019s office on September 30. Bruno met with defendant the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">On October 5, 2010, a week before trial was due to start, attorney Bruno represented defendant at a conference in County Court. On behalf of defendant, Bruno moved to adjourn the trial date, mentioning that defendant believed \u201cthat the legal system . . . [was] being unfair to him because of Mr. Martineau\u2019s health.\u201d However, Bruno also informed the court that he had \u201creviewed [defendant\u2019s] entire file\u201d and was \u201cconfident\u201d that, should the motion be denied, he would \u201cbe prepared and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ready to <em>go </em>forward to trial\u201d the following week. Bruno added that he had explained to defendant that County Court had an \u201cobligation to move matters along in a timely fashion.\u201d The People opposed the adjournment motion, and County Court denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On October 12, 2010, the day trial was to begin, Bruno \u201crenew[ed] the motion to adjourn the trial,\u201d on behalf of defendant, stating that defendant \u201cfrom his perspective, is of the opinion that we need more time to prepare for the trial.\u201d Again, the People opposed the motion, and County Court denied it, noting that Bruno had not indicated \u201cthat he is unable to proceed directly\u201d or \u201cthat he is in need of extra time with regard to a specific need to prepare in some specific way.\u201d Jury selection began, and the trial followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of all charges. Defendant moved to set aside the verdict under CPL 330.30. Bruno and Martineau filed affidavits stating that the latter had been unable to assist with the trial; that Bruno had first reviewed defendant\u2019s file 12 days before the trial began; and that until a few days before trial defendant expected Martineau to be his trial attorney. Defendant contended that County Court\u2019s denial of the October motions for adjournment violated his right to the retained attorney of his choice. County Court denied the CPL 330.30 motion and in March 2011, with the now-recovered Martineau serving as defendant\u2019s counsel, imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Defendant appealed, raising several challenges, principally that County Court violated his right to choice of counsel. Defendant contends that County Court did so when it denied the October adjournment requests without making any inquiry into defendant\u2019s choice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The Appellate Division affirmed County Court\u2019s judgment, observing with respect to defendant\u2019s primary argument that the record contained no</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201cindication that defendant was unwilling to proceed to trial with Bruno as counsel or, more to the point, that he sought further adjournment of the trial date for the express purpose of retaining another attorney. Rather, defendant . . . instructed Bruno to seek two further adjournments in order to give Bruno more time to prepare. Bruno, however, voiced no concerns as to his readiness to proceed. To the contrary, Bruno indicated . . . that he had reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>defendant\u2019s \u2018entire file,\u2019 met with defendant \u2018quite frequently\u2019 and was \u2018confident\u2019 that, if the trial proceeded as scheduled, he would be \u2018prepared and ready to go forward\u2019 \u201d (105 AD3d 1144, 1146-1147 [3d Dept 2013]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (21 NY3d 1018 [2013]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A defendant who does not require appointed counsel has a right under both Federal and State Constitutions to choose who will represent him <em>(see United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140, 144 [2006]; <em>People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264, 270 [1980]). \u201cThe constitutional guarantee to be represented by counsel of one\u2019s own choosing is a fundamental right\u201d <em>(Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d at 273). Nevertheless, \u201cthe right to counsel of choice is qualified, and may cede, under certain circumstances, to concerns of the efficient administration of the criminal justice system\u201d <em>(People v Griffin, </em>20 NY3d 626, 630 [2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In particular, we have held that a defendant may not use the right to counsel of choice</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cas a means to delay judicial proceedings. The efficient administration of the criminal justice system is a critical concern to society as a whole, and unnecessary adjournments for the purpose of permitting a defendant to retain different counsel will disrupt court dockets, interfere with the right of other criminal defendants to a speedy trial, and inconvenience witnesses, jurors and opposing counsel\u201d <em>(Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d at 271).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In short, appellate courts must recognize \u201ca trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and against the demands of its calendar\u201d <em>(Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US at 152 [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Significantly, in the present case, defendant does not contend that he expressly requested new counsel on October 5 or October 12, 2010 and that the request was wrongly denied. Rather, defendant\u2019s principal argument is that when he moved, through counsel, for adjournment, County Court was obliged to inquire of him whether he was in fact seeking new counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">When newly retained defense counsel requests an adjournment of trial and states that defendant believes that the trial would otherwise be unfair, the better practice would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>inquire of counsel and, if necessary, defendant as to whether defendant seeks an adjournment so that he may have the opportunity to retain new counsel or so that his counsel may become better prepared for trial. However, in this case, County Court did not violate any of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by denying the adjournment motions without that inquiry. On the record before us on direct appeal, when the colloquies of October 5 and October 12 are considered together, no communication was made to County Court from which it would appear that defendant was asking for the opportunity to retain new counsel, or for an adjournment in the hope that Martineau would recover quickly enough to become his trial counsel. Rather, defendant simply sought an adjournment to give Bruno more time to prepare. Under these circumstances, there was no obligation on the part of County Court to inquire as to whether defendant was seeking new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-7\">Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"AYb\">(dissenting). There is no dispute that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel entails the right of a criminal defendant to be represented by the attorney he or she has retained <em>(see United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140, 144 [2006]). Nor, after <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>is it debatable that the wrongful refusal of a court to honor a defendant\u2019s prerogative to retain his or her lawyer is per se reversible, error of this description having been deemed structural for its potential to subvert the very framework of a criminal proceeding in ways resistant to harmless error analysis <em>(id. </em>at 150). But here, on facts establishing that defendant was, without compelling justification, forced to proceed to trial with an attorney other than the one he had retained, the majority denies relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Mr. Martineau was defendant\u2019s attorney of record and Mr. Bruno, who stood in for him at defendant\u2019s trial, was never substituted for Martineau, or even retained as cocounsel by defendant. All concerned, most notably the trial court, which had itself set in motion the sequence leading to Mr. Bruno\u2019s assumption of the role of trial counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> knew that Mr. Bruno was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>appearing at defendant\u2019s behest but at the request of Mr. Martineau to accommodate the trial court\u2019s concern with meeting \u201cStandards and Goals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Even if defendant\u2019s October 5th adjournment request had been ambiguous as to whether it involved an assertion of his right to retain his own lawyer, his subsequent request for a trial postponement, made just one week later, immediately before the commencement of the trial, could have left no doubt that defendant was invoking his right to be represented by an attorney of his choosing. At that time, Bruno, at defendant\u2019s insistence, requested a stay, urging that one was mandatory pursuant to CPLR 321 (c), which, in substance, requires a 30-day stay of proceedings against a party whose attorney becomes disabled to permit that party to retain other counsel. After reading verbatim the relevant portion of the statute, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bruno reiterated that Mr. Martineau, whom all concerned understood to be disabled, \u201cis retained counsel by Mr. O\u2019Daniel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Defendant makes a plausible argument that CPLR 321 is applicable in criminal proceedings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the trial court was therefore obliged, in light of Mr. Martineau\u2019s disability, to stay the proceedings so that he could retain new counsel. But even if CPLR 321 is not applicable in criminal matters, the salient point is that defendant\u2019s reliance upon it should have placed the court on unequivocal notice that defendant was asking for an opportunity to decide for himself who would represent him at trial. To the extent that he was reasonably able to do so through a reluctant interlocutor not of his choosing whom he may very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>well have elected not to retain,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defendant had asserted his fundamental right to select his own lawyer, and the court was bound to honor that right unless there was some compelling reason not to <em>(see People v Griffin, </em>20 NY3d 626, 630 [2013]; <em>People v Knowles, </em>88 NY2d 763, 769 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The closest the court came to identifying such a reason was when it noted that the case had been pending a long time and that fairness required a trial without further delay. But the lengthy pendency of the prosecution was attributable to adjournments requested by both sides and there was, in the context of a postponement request by defendant, no apparent urgency to try the matter, which was based on relatively recent allegations of misconduct said to have taken place years before. We have, of course, observed that a defendant\u2019s right to choose his attorney \u201cis qualified in the sense that a defendant may not employ such right as a means to delay judicial proceedings\u201d <em>(People v Arroyave, </em>49 NY2d 264, 271 [1980]), but here it is clear that defendant\u2019s request for a stay expressly to enable the exercise of his right to choose his lawyer, was not a dilatory tactic. The serious deterioration in attorney Martineau\u2019s condition barely two weeks prior to the October 12, 2010 trial date was not a circumstance over which defendant had any control and there is no record support for the suggestion that, in requesting an additional postponement of the trial just days after learning that Mr. Martineau would be unable to appear for him if the trial commenced on October 12th, defendant was engaging in an eleventh hour manipulation to prolong his period of release on bail. The court was not obliged to put off the trial indefinitely, but it was required, given the fundamental, indeed structural right implicated, at least to inquire whether Mr. Martineau could be expected to recover and try the case within a reasonable time<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, if that did not seem likely, to afford defendant a reasonable opportunity himself to retain substitute counsel. I do not believe that forcing defendant forthwith to trial with a lawyer he had not retained was a constitutionally permissible alternative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Judges Gkaffeo, Read, Smith, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur; Chief Judge Lippman dissents in an opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\">. Mr. Bruno\u2019s introduction to the matter was in response to the trial judge\u2019s suggestion to attorney Martineau that, in view of his still tenuous health as of September 2010, he \u201cseek out a second chair.\u201d The suggestion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the court explained, was made \u201cpurely [as] a matter of fairness and Standards and Goals.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">. The relied upon statute stipulates that</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u201cIf an attorney dies, becomes physically or mentally incapcitated, or is removed, suspended or otherwise becomes disabled at any time before judgment, no further proceeding shall be taken in the action against the party for whom he appeared, without leave of the court, until thirty days after notice to appoint another attorney has been served upon that party either personally or in such manner as the court directs\u201d (CPLR 321 [c]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\">. Defendant points out that article I, section 6 of the State Constitution provides that <em>\u201cIn any trial in any court </em>whatever the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel <em>as in civil actions\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The argument is thus made that if a stay is required in civil actions to allow representation by counsel \u2014 which is to say by chosen counsel \u2014 when a defendant\u2019s attorney becomes disabled, the same rule must be applicable in criminal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">. Defendant it appears had previously been represented by Mr. Bruno in a Family Court matter. It is thus likely that his decision to hire Mr. Martineau in this very serious criminal matter reflected a considered preference for his representational skill set over that of Mr. Bruno.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">. It appears that Martineau recuperated sufficiently to resume his professional responsibilities by December 2010, and, in fact was present at defendant\u2019s sentencing in March 2011 at which time he thanked Bruno for standing in for him \u201con very short notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
