We dismiss the proceeding in <em>Matter of State of New York v Kenneth T. </em>on the ground of legal insufficiency. We begin our discussion with that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">On December 16,1982, respondent Kenneth T., 27, brandished a knife and forced a 17-year-old girl to accompany him to a rooftop, where he raped her. He also stole her coat. Kenneth T. was arrested after being seen wearing the coat, and his victim identified him in a lineup. In November 1983, following trial, he was convicted of rape in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and possession of stolen property in the third degree, and sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In September 1999, Kenneth T. was conditionally released to parole, having served some 17 years in prison. On October 31, 2000, Kenneth T., while employed at a university cafeteria, offered a female student a ride to the train station. He drove to a parking lot, ordered the woman out of his car, threw her to the ground, and attempted to rape her. The woman resisted, biting one of Kenneth T.\u2019s fingers when he tried to cover her mouth and leaving a bite mark on the finger. She was able to escape when a passerby observed the commotion. Kenneth T. was arrested, and pleaded guilty to attempted rape in the first degree. In January 2001, he was sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by five years\u2019 postrelease supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">During his incarcerations, Kenneth T. incurred disciplinary \u201ctickets,\u201d the most serious offenses being assault on staff, disobeying a direct order, and harassment, and he was removed from sex offender counseling for disciplinary reasons on three occasions. However, he was not accused of any sexual \u201cacting out\u201d while in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In October 2008, as he was about to be released to postrelease supervision, the State commenced this civil commitment proceeding against Kenneth T. under Mental Hygiene Law article 10. At a probable cause hearing, Dr. Paul Etu, a board-certified psychologist who had interviewed Kenneth T. and reviewed his records, testified that in his opinion Kenneth T. suffered from a mental abnormality as defined by Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i). Among other things, Dr. Etu testified that Kenneth T. had told him that he had difficulty controlling his sexual impulses. Supreme Court found probable cause to believe that Kenneth T. was a sex offender requiring civil management.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Following the hearing, Kenneth T. was committed to a secure treatment facility pending the conclusion of the article 10 proceeding. In June 2010, a bench trial was held in Supreme Court, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.07, on the issue of whether Kenneth T. suffered from a mental abnormality within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The State presented a licensed psychologist, Dr. Stuart Kirschner, who had interviewed Kenneth T. and reviewed his records. Dr. Kirschner opined that Kenneth T. had two disorders that, together, predisposed him to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense and resulted in his having serious dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ficulty in controlling that conduct: \u201cparaphilia\u2122 not otherwise specified\u201d (paraphilia NOS) and \u201cantisocial personality disorder\u201d (ASPD).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Dr. Kirschner defined \u201cparaphilia NOS\u201d using the \u201cbroad criteria\u201d that characterize paraphilia in general: \u201csexual fantasies, urges or behaviors directed ... at inanimate objects or non-consenting partners or minors.\u201d Specifically, Dr. Kirschner testified that in his opinion Kenneth T. had \u201csexual fantasies, urges or behaviors involving non-consenting partners.\u201d Challenged on cross-examination as to whether he could diagnose paraphilia NOS without any direct evidence that Kenneth T. was sexually aroused by nonconsensual sexual activity, Dr. Kirschner suggested that such arousal could be inferred simply from \u201cthe way [Kenneth T.] conducted himself during . . . the two offenses.\u201d However, Dr. Kirschner admitted that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d whether Kenneth T. found the nonconsensual aspect of his crimes sexually arousing.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">With respect to ASPD, Dr. Kirschner testified that this disorder is characterized by \u201cviolations of the law, disregard for the truth, lack of remorse, irritability and aggressiveness,\u201d as well as \u201cirresponsibility in the sense that the person does not meet financial responsibilities.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Kirschner opined that Kenneth T. met \u201c[p]retty much all of\u2019 these criteria of ASPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Dr. Kirschner conceded that ASPD could be found in most prison inmates (\u201cprobably ... 80 percent\u201d). He also testified that ASPD does not \u201cin and of itself\u2019 show mental abnormality as defined by Mental Hygiene Law article 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Dr. Kirschner attached special significance to the fact that, in his view, Kenneth T. suffered both from paraphilia and from ASPD. He testified that the paraphilia predisposed Kenneth T. to commit rape, and his ASPD gave rise to a serious difficulty in controlling the urge to rape. Dr. Kirschner identified Kenneth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>T.\u2019s ASPD with a lack of \u201cability to think before he acts,\u201d \u201cinternal [braking] mechanism,\u201d or \u201cinternal controls such as a conscience that might curb his impulses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As evidence that Kenneth T. had serious difficulty in controlling his sexual misconduct, Dr. Kirschner identified two factors. The first was that Kenneth T. carried out offenses in circumstances that would allow for his identification by the victims. (In particular, Kenneth T. committed the first offense in a neighborhood that he frequented, and afterwards wore a coat he had taken from the victim, while the second victim was a woman who knew Kenneth T. and could easily give the police information leading to his arrest.) The second was the fact that Kenneth T. attempted the second rape despite having spent some 17 years in prison for the earlier crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Following the bench trial, Supreme Court concluded that Kenneth T. had a condition, disease or disorder that predisposed him to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense and resulted in his having serious difficulty in controlling such conduct. Kenneth T. moved to set aside the verdict, arguing that the evidence was legally insufficient. Kenneth T. contended that Dr. Kirschner believed him to have a mental abnormality under Mental Hygiene Law article 10 purely on the basis of his crimes \u2014 crimes that in themselves did not distinguish him adequately from recidivist rapists who do not suffer from mental abnormality of this kind. Supreme Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A dispositional hearing was held, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.07 (f), and Supreme Court found that Kenneth T. suffered from a mental abnormality involving such a strong predisposition to commit sex offenses, and such an inability to control behavior, that he was likely to be a danger to others and to commit sex offenses if not confined to a secure treatment facility <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [e]). Accordingly, Supreme Court ordered that Kenneth T. be confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Kenneth T. appealed. The Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s order (106 AD3d 829 [2d Dept 2013]), ruling that \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s finding that the State established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the appellant suffers from a \u2018mental abnormality,\u2019 as that term is defined in Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i), was warranted by the facts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 830).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">We granted Kenneth T. leave to appeal, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>m.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On July 26, 2002, respondent Donald DD., then 18, had sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old acquaintance. As she later recalled, she \u201cfell for his wit and . . . had sex with him.\u201d Donald DD. then asked the girl whether her 12-year-old cousin would have sex with him. The younger girl was afraid, and did not resist when Donald DD. partially inserted his penis into her vagina. The two girls told the authorities what had occurred, and Donald DD. was arrested. At the time, Donald DD. was on probation, following a conviction of criminal contempt in the second degree for violating an order of protection obtained against him by an ex-girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Donald DD. pleaded guilty to rape in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.30 [1] [being 18 years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person less than 15 years old]), attempted rape in the second degree (under the same statute), and endangering the welfare of a child. In January 2004, he was convicted and sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment and 10 years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On July 1, 2004, after release from prison, Donald DD. persuaded a young woman, a close friend of his wife, to accompany him on a walk to a local cemetery. There, he kissed the woman and, ignoring her repeated protests, had sexual intercourse with her. Afterwards, the woman returned to Donald DD.\u2019s house with him; when she was leaving, he said he knew she was \u201cgood at keeping secrets\u201d and added that they would \u201cboth be in trouble\u201d if she revealed what had happened. The young woman, however, sought medical help and gave a statement to the police. Donald DD. was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Donald DD. pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in the second degree. He was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment; he remained on probation upon release. Donald DD.\u2019s probation was revoked in the summer of 2006, after he was arrested following an incident in which he threw stones or rocks at an acquaintance\u2019s car, injuring a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In April 2007, Donald DD. was resentenced on the January 2004 convictions, to 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment. He participated in sex offender treatment while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">In the spring of 2008, Donald DD. was evaluated for civil management under Mental Hygiene Law article 10. A psychiatric examiner, Dr. Mark Cederbaum, opined that Donald DD. suffered from ASPD, but did <em>not </em>have a mental abnormality within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Donald DD. was conditionally released to parole supervision in June 2008. Donald DD.\u2019s special conditions of release included that he \u201cnot be in contact with\u201d anyone under 18, \u201cwithout the presence of an adult.\u201d Donald DD. and his wife had two children, a five-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl. His wife\u2019s sister had primary physical custody of the children, but they spent weekends at the apartment in which Donald DD. and his wife lived. In December 2008, the state police and the county child protective services investigated allegations by Donald DD.\u2019s children that one evening when he was alone with them, Donald DD. had touched their \u201cprivates\u201d and encouraged them to touch each other\u2019s and his \u201cprivates.\u201d Additionally, Donald DD.\u2019s wife told the police that on occasions when she did not want to have sex with Donald DD., he would force himself on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The District Attorney decided not to pursue criminal charges against Donald DD. However, his parole was revoked, and he was returned to custody to serve the remainder of his 2007 maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In June 2009, the State commenced this civil commitment proceeding against Donald DD. under Mental Hygiene Law article 10. Following a probable cause hearing, Donald DD. was committed to a secure treatment facility pending the conclusion of the proceeding. On March 2, 2010, a jury trial commenced in Supreme Court, pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.07, on the issue of whether Donald DD. suffered from a mental abnormality as defined by Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The State presented two licensed psychologists, Dr. Christopher Kunkle and Dr. Richard Hamill, as witnesses, both of whom had interviewed Donald DD. and reviewed his records. Dr. Kunkle and Dr. Hamill opined that Donald DD. suffered from ASPD, defined as set forth above. They described the disorder as \u201ccharacterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for others and violation of the law\u201d and testified that an individual who meets at least three of seven specific criteria may be diagnosed with the disorder. The criteria, as the State\u2019s experts explained, may be summed up as: failure to conform to social norms and laws, impulsivity, aggressiveness, disregard for the safety of self or others, lack of remorse, deceitfulness, and irresponsibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Dr. Kunkle concluded that Donald DD. had all seven traits, while Dr. Hamill concluded that he had at least six.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Dr. Kunkle noted that \u201ca very small portion of individuals with antisocial personality disorders . . . are actually incarcerated for a sexual offense,\u201d estimating that the proportion was 7%. As he explained, \u201c[s]ome sex offenders have antisocial personality disorder, some don\u2019t. Some with antisocial personality disorder commit sex offenses and some don\u2019t.\u201d However, Dr. Kunkle stated that Donald DD.\u2019s ASPD predisposed him to commit conduct constituting a sex offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cIn [Donald DD.\u2019s] case, his disorder predisposes him in a way because his behavior has shown you that. His behavior has shown you what goes on inside his mind, and he acts upon the urges that he has. When [Donald DD.] has a sexual urge towards 12 and 14 year old girls, a wife\u2019s friend, his own children, he acts upon that urge and neglects the laws that govern.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Asked about the concept of paraphilia, Dr. Kunkle testified that he had <em>not </em>diagnosed Donald DD. with paraphilia, which he defined as \u201ca sexual disorder where the person has abnormal sexual interests.\u201d He opined that, although ASPD is not a paraphilia, it can nevertheless be a mental abnormality within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i). He testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201c[i]f someone has antisocial personality disorder and they showed a pattern where they continuously act in a way that they violate laws and those violations are sexual, then they have shown that through their antisocial personality disorder they are predisposed to commit sexual crimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Dr. Kunkle further opined that Donald DD.\u2019s ASPD resulted in his having serious difficulty in controlling his sex-offending conduct. He pointed to Donald DD.\u2019s tendency to commit both sexual and non-sexual offenses, in spite of past incarcerations, despite sex offender treatment, and while on probation, as evidence that the ASPD was \u201cdriving\u201d his illegal actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Consistently with Dr. Kunkle\u2019s testimony, Dr. Hamill observed that \u201cthe large majority, 93 percent of those diagnosed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>[ASPD,] are not sex offenders.\u201d Dr. Hamill accepted the proposition that ASPD does not \u201cin and of itself predispose a person to commit conduct constituting a sex offense.\u201d Nonetheless, he opined that ASPD predisposed Donald DD. to engage in conduct constituting a sex offense. Asked what had led him to this conclusion, Dr. Hamill mentioned the fact that Donald DD.\u2019s victims were \u201cmale and female and in three major age groups.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Dr. Hamill further opined that Donald DD.\u2019s ASPD resulted in his having serious difficulty in controlling his sex-offending conduct. He testified that the ASPD affected Donald DD.\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and volitional capacities: \u201cpredisposing] him to act out impulsively in an aggressive manner,\u201d creating \u201ccognitive distortions,\u201d and inhibiting his \u201cability to control [his] behavior and keep it according to . . . [his] sense of right and wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Finally, the State called Dr. Mark Cederbaum, who had examined Donald DD. in 2008 and found no mental abnormality. Dr. Cederbaum stated that he could no longer stand by his original opinion, especially in light of the recent allegations that Donald DD. had sexually abused his own children and engaged in spousal rape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">For his part, Donald DD. presented the testimony of a licensed psychologist, Dr. Joseph J. Plaud, who had also examined Donald DD. and reviewed his records. Dr. Plaud opined that there was no evidence that Donald DD. suffered from a condition that predisposed him to commit sex offenses and caused him to have serious difficulty controlling this conduct. Rather, Dr. Plaud saw Donald DD. as an opportunistic offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">With respect to ASPD, Dr. Plaud opined that the condition \u201cis not particular to sexual control. I would say the vast majority of individuals in all the state prisons in this state could be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. By definition they all have difficulty conforming their behavior to the law.\u201d He explained that ASPD can act \u201cin combination with ... a diagnosable sexual disorder, and . . . can add extra fuel to the fire, if you will,\u201d but cannot \u201cin and of itself . . . predict sexual impulse control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Donald DD. himself testified, admitting to the sexual crimes involving the 14 year old and 12 year old but protesting that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>had not known their ages, and insisting that the sexual activity with his wife\u2019s friend in the cemetery had been consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The jury found that Donald DD. had a condition, disease or disorder that predisposed him to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense and resulted in his having serious difficulty in controlling such conduct. Donald DD. moved to set aside the verdict, contending, inter alia, that ASPD is an inapplicable predicate for a finding of mental abnormality because it is \u201cnot a sexual disorder.\u201d Supreme Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Following a dispositional hearing, Supreme Court found that Donald DD. suffered from a mental abnormality involving such a strong predisposition to commit sex offenses, and such an inability to control behavior, that he was likely to be a danger to others and to commit sex offenses if not confined to a secure treatment facility. Accordingly, Supreme Court ordered that Donald DD. be confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Donald DD. appealed, again challenging the use of ASPD as a basis for the jury\u2019s finding of mental abnormality.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s order (107 AD3d 1062 [3d Dept 2013]), holding that a mental condition need not itself have any sexual component in order to predispose a person to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense and result in that person\u2019s having serious difficulty in controlling such conduct. The Appellate Division reasoned that ASPD</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201caffects the emotional and volitional capacity of its sufferers by predisposing them to act upon their urges in an aggressive manner. Petitioners\u2019 experts found respondent to have inappropriate sexual urges given his pattern of engaging in sex offenses, and that the disorder caused him to disregard any restraints he may have had against acting upon them. Those experts further opined that respondent\u2019s repeated commission of sex offenses demonstrated his serious difficulty in restraining those impulses, particularly because he acted upon them despite knowing that he was under supervision and having already undergone sex offender treatment\u201d <em>{id. </em>at 1064 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We granted Donald DD. leave to appeal, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Kenneth T.\u2019s article 10 trial differed from Donald DD.\u2019s in that the factfinder heard evidence that Kenneth T. suffered not only from ASPD but also from paraphilia NOS. In <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>State of New York v Shannon S. </em>(20 NY3d 99 [2012]), this Court held that \u201cany issue pertaining to the reliability of paraphilia NOS as a predicate condition for a finding of mental abnormality\u201d may be \u201cviewed as a factor relevant to the weight to be attributed to the diagnosis, an issue properly reserved for resolution by the factfinder\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 107). The Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201c[a]ny professional debate over the viability and reliability of paraphilia NOS is subject to the adversarial process which, by vigorous cross-examination, would expose the strengths and weaknesses of the professional medical opinions offered in reaching a considered legal determination as to whether a respondent suffers a mental abnormality, as defined by statute\u201d <em>(id. </em>[internal quotation marks omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Paraphilia NOS is a controversial diagnosis. It is listed in the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, but only as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d category for paraphilias that are not specifically enumerated elsewhere in the manual because they are \u201cless frequently encountered\u201d (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 567 [4th ed Text Rev 2000]). The examples given include necrophilia (sexual attraction to corpses) and zoophilia (sexual attraction to animals) <em>(see id. </em>at 576). In the dissent in <em>Shannon S., </em>three members of this Court who are now in the majority stated our view that the paraphilia NOS diagnosis presented by Dr. Kirschner<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and another expert witness in that case \u201c amount [ed] to junk science devised for the purpose of locking up dangerous criminals\u201d and we expressed \u201cgrave doubt\u201d whether such a \u201cdiagnosis would survive a <em>Frye </em>hearing to determine whether it is \u2018sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance\u2019 in the psychiatric community\u201d <em>(Shannon S., </em>20 NY3d at 110 [Smith, J., dissenting, joined by Lippman, Ch. J., and Pigott, J.], quoting <em>Frye v United States, </em>293 F 1013, 1014 [DC Cir 1923]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Nonetheless, we do not overrule <em>Shannon S. </em>The doctrine of stare decisis governs here, \u00a3\u00a3rest[ing] upon the principle that a court is an institution, not merely a collection of individuals, and that governing rules of law do not change merely because the personnel of the court changes\u201d <em>(People v Bing, </em>76 NY2d 331, 338 [1990]). Stare decisis is \u201cthe preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process\u201d <em>(Payne v Tennessee, </em>501 US 808, 827 [1991]). We perceive no compelling justification for overruling <em>Shannon S.\u2019s </em>holding that a diagnosis of paraphilia NOS was sufficient to support a finding of mental abnormality on the record in that case. We did not, however, decide in <em>Shannon S. </em>the question that would be decided at a <em>Frye </em>hearing: whether the diagnosis of paraphilia NOS, as testified to by the State\u2019s experts, has received general acceptance in the psychiatric community. Nor do we decide that question today, because here, as in <em>Shannon S., </em>no <em>Frye </em>hearing was requested or held.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In the present case, it is unnecessary for us to decide any issue concerning paraphilia NOS, because we need not decide whether there was legally sufficient evidence that Kenneth T. had a condition \u201cthat predispose[d] him ... to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense\u201d within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i). Rather, we hold that, even assuming that mental abnormality was demonstrated to that extent, there was not clear and convincing evidence that Kenneth T. had \u201cserious difficulty in controlling\u201d his sexual misconduct within the meaning of section 10.03 (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As evidence that Kenneth T. had serious difficulty in controlling conduct amounting to sex offenses, Dr. Kirschner identified the fact that Kenneth T. carried out both offenses in a way that would allow for identification by his victims, and the fact that he attempted the second rape despite having spent many years in prison for the earlier crime. It is evident that circumstances of this nature are insufficient to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person has serious difficulty in controlling his sexual urges within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i). A rapist who killed his victims so that they could not identify him may have serious difficulty controlling his sexual urges. Conversely, one who raped an acquaintance and permitted her to escape may not have serious difficulty controlling his sexual urges within the meaning of article 10. A person who commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ted a rape soon after serving a very short sentence for sexual abuse may have serious difficulty in controlling his sexual misconduct. Conversely, one who committed a rape soon after serving a very lengthy sentence may not have serious difficulty controlling his sexual urges. Rather, the rape may be a crime of opportunity, and the defendant willing to risk the prospect of a return to incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Undoubtedly, sex offenders in general are not notable for their self-control. They are also, in general, not highly risk-averse. But beyond these truisms, it is rarely if ever possible to say, from the facts of a sex offense alone, whether the offender had great difficulty in controlling his urges or simply decided to gratify them, though he knew he was running a significant risk of arrest and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We do not decide on this occasion from what sources sufficient evidence of a serious difficulty controlling sex-offending conduct may arise, but they cannot consist of such meager material as that a sex offender did not make efforts to avoid arrest and re-incarceration. A detailed psychological portrait of a sex offender would doubtless allow an expert to determine the level of control the offender has over his sexual conduct. However, Dr. Kirschner\u2019s testimony that Kenneth T. lacked \u201cinternal controls such as a conscience that might curb his impulses\u201d is not a basis from which serious difficulty in controlling sexual conduct may be rationally inferred. It is as consistent with a rapist who could control himself but, having strong urges and an impaired conscience, decides to force sex upon someone, as it is with a rapist who cannot control his urges. Even viewed in the light most favorable to the State, this testimony is legally insufficient to support the conclusion that Kenneth T.\u2019s mental conditions resulted in his having serious difficulty in controlling conduct constituting a sex offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the State\u2019s petition against Kenneth T. under Mental Hygiene Law article 10 should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">VL</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Donald DD.\u2019s appeal presents us with an opportunity to decide a question left open in <em>Matter of State of New York v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>John S. </em>(23 NY3d 326 [2014]), namely whether a civil commitment under Mental Hygiene Law article 10 may be based solely on a diagnosis of ASPD, together with evidence of sexual crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in its rulings upholding a Kansas civil confinement statute against constitutional challenge (see <em>Kansas v Hendricks, </em>521 US 346 [1997]; <em>Kansas v Crane, </em>534 US 407 [2002]), has held that as a matter of substantive due process the evidence of a respondent\u2019s \u201cserious difficulty in controlling behavior . . . when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself, must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment <em>from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal </em>case\u201d <em>(Crane, </em>534 US at 413 [emphasis added]; <em>see also Hendricks, </em>521 US at 360). \u201cThat distinction is necessary lest \u2018civil commitment\u2019 become a \u2018mechanism for retribution or general deterrence\u2019 \u2014 functions properly those of criminal law, not civil commitment\u201d <em>(Crane, </em>534 US at 412, quoting <em>Hendricks, </em>521 US at 373 [Kennedy, J., concurring]). We must interpret the Mental Hygiene Law article 10 statute on the assumption that it accords with these constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In his testimony in the <em>Kenneth T. </em>trial, the State\u2019s expert Dr. Kirschner said that the proportion of people currently in prison (or who have been imprisoned) who could be diagnosed with ASPD is \u201cprobably about as high as 80 percent.\u201d The Supreme Court and other courts have postulated figures ranging from 40% to 70% <em>(see e.g. Crane, </em>534 US at 412, citing P Moran, <em>The Epidemiology of Antisocial Personality Disorder, </em>34 Soc Psychiatry &amp; Psychiatric Epidemiology 231, 234 [1999] [40-60% of male prison population diagnosable with ASPD]; <em>United States v Wilkinson, </em>646 F Supp 2d 194, 209 [D Mass 2009], citing Jack Vognsen &amp; Amy Phenix, <em>Antisocial Personality Disorder is Not Enough: A Reply to Sreenivasan, Weinberger, and Garrick, </em>32 J Am Acad Psychiatry L 440, 442 [Dec. 2004] [50-70%]).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>These statistics are compelling. A diagnosis of ASPD alone\u2014 that is, when the ASPD diagnosis is not accompanied by a diagnosis of any other condition, disease or disorder alleged to constitute a mental abnormality \u2014 simply does not distinguish the sex offender whose mental abnormality subjects him to civil commitment from the typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case. ASPD \u201cmeans little more than a deep-seated tendency to commit crimes\u201d <em>(Shannon S., </em>20 NY3d at 110 [Smith, J., dissenting, joined by Lippman, Ch. J., and Pigott, J.]). Its use in civil confinement proceedings, as the single diagnosis underlying a finding of mental abnormality as defined by Mental Hygiene Law article 10, proves no sexual abnormality. It therefore cannot be the sole diagnosis that grounds such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We believe that an ASPD diagnosis has so little relevance to the controlling legal criteria of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) that it cannot be relied upon to show mental abnormality for article 10 purposes. As Donald DD.\u2019s counsel expressed the objection, ASPD is \u201cnot a sexual disorder.\u201d Our conclusion is not based on research that is outside of the record, or our own armchair psychology, or even common sense (though all of these point in the same direction). Instead, we base it on the expert testimony in the appeals before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The State\u2019s expert in the <em>Kenneth T. </em>case, Dr. Kirschner, testified that ASPD does not \u201cin and of itself\u201d show mental abnormality as defined by Mental Hygiene Law article 10. Dr. Hamill, the State\u2019s expert in <em>Donald DD., </em>conceded that ASPD does not \u201cin and of itself predispose a person to commit conduct constituting a sex offense,\u201d noting, along with his co-witness, that a very small proportion \u2014 7%\u2014of individuals with ASPD are convicted of a sexual offense. Dr. Plaud, testifying for Donald DD., opined that while ASPD can act \u201cin combination with . . . a diagnosable sexual disorder\u201d to produce a potent abnormal condition, it cannot \u201cin and of itself . . . predict sexual impulse control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We do not believe that the experts were merely stating the obvious truth that a diagnosis of ASPD without any evidence of sexual crimes is insufficient to show mental abnormality. Rather, it is clear that the experts \u2014 even experts whose usual role is to testify that a respondent suffers from a mental abnormality for article 10 purposes \u2014 agree, when pressed, that ASPD alone is not a \u201ccondition, disease or disorder that affects the emotional, cognitive, or volitional capacity of a person in a manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>predisposes him or her to the commission of conduct constituting a sex offense </em>and that results in that person having serious difficulty in controlling such conduct\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Our conclusion is <em>not </em>that ASPD is in itself an unreliable diagnosis rejected by the psychiatric profession. ASPD is not analogous to the diagnoses we considered hypothetically in <em>Shannon S. </em>that are \u201cpremised on such scant or untested evidence and ... so devoid of content, or so near-universal in their rejection by mental health professionals, as to be violative of constitutional due process\u201d <em>(Shannon S., </em>20 NY3d at 106-107 [internal quotation marks and brackets omitted]). The problem is that ASPD establishes only a general tendency toward criminality, and has no necessary relationship to a difficulty in controlling one\u2019s sexual behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Finally, our conclusion does not conflict with the holding in <em>Shannon S. </em>The diagnosis of paraphilia NOS, whatever its strength or weakness as an evidentiary matter, is, at the very least, potentially relevant to a finding of predisposition to conduct constituting a sex offense. The same is not true of ASPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">For the reasons stated above, Supreme Court erred in using an ASPD diagnosis, together with testimony concerning Donald DD.\u2019s sex crimes, but without evidence of some independent mental abnormality diagnosis, to ground a finding of mental abnormality within the meaning of Mental Hygiene Law article 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Accordingly, in each appeal, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">.

The diagnosis proffered by experts to support this finding was antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). I believe that ASPD may be a viable predicate for a determination of mental abnormality in certain cases since such a diagnosis is consistent with the statutory definition and its use in the article 10 context does not offend principles of substantive due process.

The State\u2019s expert diagnosed Kenneth T. with ASPD and paraphilia not otherwise specified (NOS), based on his alleged attraction to nonconsenting partners. I agree with the majority that the State did not present legally sufficient evidence to support the finding of a mental abnormality in this case, but I rely on different grounds for the reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In 2007, the legislature enacted the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act (SOMTA) as part of \u201ccomprehensive reforms to enhance public safety\u201d by authorizing the civil management of sex offenders (Senate Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 7 at 15). SOMTA was the result of a legislative determination that \u201c[cjivil and criminal processes have distinct but overlapping goals, and both should be part of an integrated approach that is based on evolving scientific understanding, flexible enough to respond to current needs of individual [sex] offenders, and sufficient to provide meaningful treatment and to protect the public\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.01 [a]). To that end, the legislature formulated a two-tiered civil management scheme for certain recidivistic sex offenders that \u201cpose a danger to society\u201d due to \u201cmental abnormalities that predispose them to engage in repeated sex offenses\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 10.01 [a], [b], [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In an effort to balance the significant civil liberties and treatment needs of sex offenders with the State\u2019s interest in protecting potential victims and preventing sexual assaults, Mental Hygiene Law article 10 contains a detailed procedure for the evaluation of detained sex offenders by mental health professionals before release from incarceration. The Office of Mental Health (OMH) initiates a case review of high risk offenders to assess whether any should be recommended for treatment in the community or civil commitment <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10.05 [a], [b], [d], [e]). Two levels of case review by qualified personnel are undertaken, which usually includes a psychiatric examination of the candidate, to identify sex offenders who may have a mental abnormality <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10.05 [d]-[f]). If the candidate is deemed eligible for civil management, OMH notifies the offender of this status <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10.05 [g]). OMH also submits its recommendation to the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which may, in its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tion, file a petition seeking civil management of the offender <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10.05 [g]; 10.06 [a]). If a petition is filed, the candidate for civil commitment receives appointed counsel and, within 30 days, the court holds a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the offender requires civil management <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 10.06 [c], [g], [k]). In the event that probable cause is found, a jury ultimately resolves the question \u201cwhether the respondent is a detained sex offender who suffers from a mental abnormality\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 10.07 [a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the statutory scheme requires that OMH, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and a jury determine, as a threshold matter, that a sex offender suffers from a mental abnormality before that individual may be subjected to any category of civil management.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Following a finding of mental abnormality and after the presentation of additional evidence, the court considers which of two available dispositions is appropriate: (1) strict and intensive supervision and treatment (SIST) or (2) civil confinement in an OMH facility <em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10.07 [f]; <em>Matter of State of New York v Nelson D., </em>22 NY3d 233, 238 [2013]). An offender ordered to participate in SIST returns to the community under the supervision of parole officers and must abide by specified conditions and comply with a course of treatment prescribed by the individual\u2019s treating medical professional <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.11 [a]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">If the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that the individual is a \u201c[d]angerous sex offender requiring confinement,\u201d it must order the person confined to a secure treatment facility <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 10.03 [e]; <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 10.07 [f]). In these cases, the court must find that the offender\u2019s mental abnormality involves \u201csuch a strong predispostion to commit sex offenses, and such an inability to control behavior, that the person is likely to be a danger to others and to commit sex offenses if not confined\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10.03 [e]; 10.07 [f]).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Neither disposition, however, terminates the court\u2019s review of an offender\u2019s civil management program. An offender may petition the court for discharge at any time and is entitled to an annual review and an evidentiary hearing at least once each year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>(see id. </em>\u00a7 10.09). These safeguards are designed to ensure that only persons who continue to suffer from mental abnormalities and cannot control their sexual misconduct remain subject to civil management.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">I now turn to the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In <em>Matter of State of New York v Donald DD., </em>the majority holds that a detained sex offender cannot be subjected to civil management solely because the individual is diagnosed as suffering from antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) <em>(see </em>majority op at 188-191). I agree with this statement. The State cannot civilly confine or supervise someone under article 10 of the Mental Hygiene Law simply because that person has been diagnosed with a disorder or condition, paraphiliac or otherwise. Rather, under the Mental Hygiene Law and principles of due process, the State can only civilly manage a sex offender who has a mental abnormality, which requires not just the diagnosis of a predicate disorder but also proof that the disorder predisposes the offender to commit sexual misconduct related to serious difficulty controlling such behavior <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i]).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">As I read the majority\u2019s opinion, it is declaring that because ASPD does not always predispose an individual to commit sex crimes, ASPD can never qualify as a predicate disorder in a civil management proceeding. The fundamental flaw in this view is that it equates a \u201ccongenital or acquired condition, disease or disorder\u201d with a \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d thereby requiring that the predicate disorder itself inherently include the additional predisposition and impulse control elements of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) <em>(see </em>majority op at 177, 190-191). This interpretation directly conflicts with the language of the statute and unduly narrows the definition of mental abnormality in a manner that principles of substantive due process do not require.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">I begin my analysis with the federal case law that has served as the backdrop to the definition of \u201cmental abnormality\u201d in Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i). In <em>Kansas v </em>Hendricks, the United States Supreme Court upheld a statute providing for the civil confinement of sexually violent predators who suffered from a \u201cmental abnormality,\u201d the definition of which was similar to that which was subsequently enacted in Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) (521 US 346, 352 [1997]). In rejecting a substantive due process challenge to the Kansas statute, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Court recognized that legal definitions of terms such as mental abnormality \u201cneed not mirror those advanced by the medical profession\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 359). The Court therefore concluded that the civil confinement statute satisfied due process requirements because it did not predicate civil confinement on a finding of dangerousness alone but also required \u201cproof of some additional factor, such as a . . . \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 \u201d that made it difficult for an offender to control dangerous sexual behavior <em>(id. </em>at 358-359). As applied to the facts in <em>Hendricks, </em>the Court held that the offender\u2019s \u201cadmitted lack of volitional control, coupled with a prediction of future dangerousness, adequately distinguished] [him] from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings\u201d (i<em>d. </em>at 360).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Later, in <em>Kansas v Crane </em>(534 US 407 [2002]), the United States Supreme Court again reviewed Kansas\u2019s confinement statute. In addressing a constitutional challenge, the Supreme Court clarified that, although a State must connect a mental condition and dangerousness finding to an inability to control sexual behavior, the State need not prove that a sex offender lacks total control over the offensive conduct <em>(see id. </em>at 410-413). A \u201cserious difficulty in controlling behavior,\u201d the Court postulated, can be adequate \u201cwhen viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself, ... to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 413). Significantly, the Court emphasized that \u201cthe States retain considerable leeway in defining the mental abnormalities and <em>personality disorders </em>that make an individual eligible for commitment\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The adoption of New York\u2019s civil management scheme reflects this federal precedent. The statute requires that all offenders subject to civil management, including SIST, must be found to have a mental abnormality as a threshold qualification. Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) defines a mental abnormality as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201ca congenital or acquired condition, disease or disorder that affects the emotional, cognitive, or volitional capacity of a person in a manner that predisposes him or her to the commission of conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>constituting a sex offense and that results in that person having serious difficulty in controlling such conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Article 10 authorizes civil confinement only of those sex offenders whose \u201cmental abnormality\u201d involves such a strong disposition to commit sexual misconduct and inability to control behavior that the person is dangerous to society (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7\u00a7 10.03 [e]; 10.07 [f]). Drawing from <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Crane, </em>the statutory structure does not run afoul of substantive due process because it requires the State to prove that the individual is dangerous, and the dangerousness must be coupled with a mental abnormality, which \u2014 by definition\u2014 incorporates a requirement that the offender have serious difficulty with behavioral control. Thus, where the State\u2019s evidence conforms to the statutory definition of a mental abnormality, i.e., the State shows that the offender suffers from any \u201ccongenital or acquired condition, disease or disorder\u201d that predisposes the person to sexual misconduct and results in difficulty controlling sexual urges, due process is satisfied and the offender may be subjected to either SIST or civil confinement depending on the risk of danger to the community <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 10.03 [i]).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The majority concludes that ASPD \u201ccannot be used to support a finding that [an offender] has a mental abnormality . . . when it is not accompanied by any other diagnosis of mental abnormality\u201d (majority op at 177). The obvious flaw in this position is that a \u201ccongenital or acquired . . . disorder\u201d is, under the language of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i), only one element of a mental abnormality finding \u2014 not the equivalent thereof. In conflating the predicate disorder with the mental abnormality, the majority implicitly injects a requirement that the underlying disorder be \u201csexually-related\u201d into Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) on the mistaken premise that such a requirement is necessary to distinguish an offender subject to civil management from a \u201ctypical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case\u201d (majority op at 189). Neither the plain language of the statute nor due process compels this conclusion <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i]; <em>see generally Crane, </em>534 US at 411-414; <em>Hendricks, </em>521 US at 357-360). Instead, it is the effect of the condition \u2014 sexually-related or not \u2014 on the offender\u2019s capacities and ability to control sexual impulses that is key. Where a disorder predisposes a person to sex offending by impacting the individual\u2019s cognitive, volitional, or emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>capacities, it is the interplay of these factors and the concomitant impulse control problems \u2014 not the inherently sexual nature of the predicate disorder \u2014 that distinguishes an offender subject to management from a \u201cdangerous but typical recidivist\u201d <em>(Crane, </em>534 US at 413). Whether a disorder such as ASPD has the necessary effect on the offender to support a mental abnormality finding must therefore be determined on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The majority\u2019s misreading of the Mental Hygiene Law does not simply mean that a sex offender cannot be civilly confined where ASPD is the predicate disorder for a mental abnormality finding, although that is the result in this particular case. Because a finding of mental abnormality is a precursor to a determination of whether SIST is appropriate, the majority necessarily holds that offenders cannot be compelled to participate in SIST on the basis of an ASPD diagnosis. This outcome is unfortunate since the elimination of treatment after release into the community exposes these offenders to a greater risk of re-offending and is detrimental to the protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The majority assures us that it is not basing its conclusion that ASPD is per se insufficient as a predicate disorder in the civil management context on research not properly before us or their \u201cown armchair psychology\u201d (majority op at 190). The majority purports to rely on the testimony of the State\u2019s experts at Donald DD.\u2019s mental abnormality trial <em>(see </em>majority op at 190). Dr. Hamill did concede that \u201cASPD does not \u2018in and of itself predispose a person to commit conduct constituting a sex offense\u2019 \u201d (majority op at 184). But the majority\u2019s interpretation of this testimony as some type of concession that ASPD may never constitute a condition that predisposes an individual to sex offending is, at best, a mischaracterization of the stated opinion <em>(see </em>majority op at 190-191), and reflects its flawed equation of the predicate \u201cdisorder\u201d or \u201ccondition\u201d to a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i]). Taking Dr. Hamill\u2019s testimony in context, the expert was accurately stating that, absent evidence connecting an ASPD diagnosis to a predisposition for committing sex offenses and lack of control, such diagnosis, like any other, does not satisfy the statutory definition of mental abnormality. By contrast, where the additional mental abnormality elements are present, ASPD may be a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>diagnosis in a civil management case. For this reason, Dr. Hamill opined that Donald DD.\u2019s ASPD did predispose him to commit sex offenses and caused him to have serious difficulty controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">With regard to the majority\u2019s concern that ASPD is too prevalent a diagnosis to distinguish sex offenders subject to civil management from the mental condition of many others in the prison population, it is the impaired impulse control that provides the necessary distinction. The prevalence of ASPD among non-sex offenders and whether ASPD generally predisposes all who suffer from it to the commission of sex offenses is irrelevant. Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) and due process require only that the State prove that the predicate disorder\u2014 here ASPD \u2014 affects the emotional, cognitive, or volitional capacity of the specific offender in such a manner that it predisposes the offender to commit sex offenses and have serious difficulty controlling sexual impulses <em>(see </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i]). In other words, the crucial distinction between other criminal recidivists and those subject to civil management is not whether the two categories of offenders carry a similar diagnosis but whether their mental condition \u2014 as evaluated by experts \u2014 affects them in such a way that the remaining mandatory elements of a mental abnormality are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Reading Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 (i) within the confines of due process to permit the use of ASPD in the mental hygiene context does not permit the State to use article 10 to unjustly confine vast numbers of persons convicted of sex offenses. Although a certain percentage of the incarcerated may meet the diagnostic criteria for ASPD, the disorder concededly manifests in such a manner as to predispose the individual to the commission of sex offenses in a limited subset of ASPD sufferers <em>(see </em>majority op at 190). Those few who meet the ASPD diagnostic criteria and whose disorder manifests in such a way that the additional elements of a mental abnormality exist are sufficiently distinguishable from recidivists on a broader level. Notably, courts of other states have upheld civil confinement on an ASPD diagnosis standing alone <em>(see Commonwealth v Mazzarino, </em>81 Mass App Ct 358, 369, 963 NE2d 112, 121 [2012], <em>review denied </em>462 Mass 1109, 970 NE2d 333 [2012]; <em>In re Civil Commitment </em>of K.J.W., 2012 WL 5372393, *2-3, 2012 NJ Super Unpub LEXIS 2443, *3-7 [App Div 2012]; <em>In re Detention of Shaw, </em>165 Wash App 1021 [2011]; <em>In re Detention of Barnes, </em>689 NW2d 455, 459 [Iowa 2004]; <em>In re Commitment of Adams, </em>223 Wis 2d 60, 65-71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>588 NW2d 336, 338-341 [Ct App 1998]). Despite the majority\u2019s dissatisfaction with the implications of article 10, our analysis must be based on the law as the legislature and Governor saw fit to enact because the statute \u2014 and the viability of ASPD as a predicate disorder under the statutory definition of mental abnormality \u2014 comports with due process. Consequently, where the State presents clear and convincing evidence through expert testimony linking an offender\u2019s ASPD to a predisposition for the commission of sex offenses and an inability to control his or her conduct, the mental abnormality finding should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Examined in this light, the State\u2019s evidence in Donald DD.\u2019s case was clearly legally sufficient <em>(see Matter of State of New York v John S., </em>23 NY3d 326, 349 [2014], <em>rearg denied </em>24 NY3d 933 [2014]). Three psychologists, Drs. Hamill, Kunkle, and Cederbaum, diagnosed Donald DD. with ASPD and explained their basis for that diagnosis, namely Donald DD.\u2019s criminal history, violent conduct, inability to maintain consistent long-term employment, failure to show remorse, and tendency to blame his victims. Although Drs. Kunkle and Hamill agreed that a diagnosis of ASPD does not automatically mean that an individual suffers from a mental abnormality, in Donald DD.\u2019s case, they concluded that ASPD predisposed him to commit sex offenses because it caused him to act out in a sexually aggressive manner against victims ranging in age. In addition, Dr. Hamill testified that Donald DD.\u2019s ASPD affected his cognition and \u201cemotionality\u201d so that he had \u201ccognitive distortions,\u201d which resulted in his inability to understand that his sexual misconduct was improper and allowed him to \u201cgive [himself] permission to act\u201d in a sexually offensive manner. Drs. Kunkle and Hamill also testified that Donald DD. had serious difficulty controlling his sexual urges as a result of his ASPD, as evidenced by the early onset of his illegal sexual conduct, and his commission of sexual offenses while married and under parole or probation supervision. And, although Donald DD. presented an expert witness who disputed the State\u2019s proof, this conflicting testimony presented a question for the factfinder to resolve. Accordingly, on this record, I would uphold the jury\u2019s mental abnormality finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Turning to the second case before us, in <em>Matter of State of New York v Kenneth T., </em>I agree that it is necessary to reverse the finding of mental abnormality on legal insufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>grounds. I do not, however, concur with the majority that the State failed to present legally sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Kenneth T. had serious difficulty controlling his sexual impulses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The evidence proffered to the factfinder at Kenneth T.\u2019s trial established that he committed his first violent sex offense while on parole for a non-sex offense crime, during daylight hours and in an area that he frequented. Dr. Kirschner opined that these circumstances indicated that Kenneth T. had difficulty controlling his impulses because the likelihood that he would be recognized in an area that he frequented \u201cdid not serve as a deterrent,\u201d as it perhaps would to a person who simply saw an opportunity to act out with impunity. Thus, Dr. Kirschner opined that Kenneth T. lacks sufficient impulse control and \u201chas very little braking mechanism to stop his impulses once [they are] set in motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The circumstances of Kenneth T.\u2019s second offense also support Dr. Kirschner\u2019s conclusion that Kenneth T. had serious difficulty controlling his sexual urges. Kenneth T. committed his second sexual act a mere 13 months after being released from 17 years of incarceration, which was apparently the consequence of his failure to curb his sexual impulses \u2014 he attempted to rape a female student who could easily identify him as an employee of the university that she attended. This offense took place in a public parking lot in the vicinity of Kenneth T.\u2019s home. At the time, Kenneth T. was on parole and subject to sex offender registration. Dr. Kirschner testified that the circumstances of this sexual attack against someone who was familiar with him, and in a public place where he could be identified by a passerby who recognized him, demonstrated Kenneth T.\u2019s \u201c[p]oor impulse control\u201d and that his ASPD affected his \u201cvolitional capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The majority concludes that this evidence is legally insufficient to support a finding that Kenneth T. had \u201cserious difficulty in controlling his sexual misconduct\u201d because it is just as likely that he consciously chose to disregard his impulses <em>(see </em>majority op at 188). This rationale establishes an impossible standard. The majority fails to indicate exactly what other type of evidence a factfinder may rely upon to determine an offender\u2019s inability to control sexual behaviors, short of a clear admission from the offender regarding a lack of control over urges <em>(see </em>majority op at 188). Indeed, Dr. Etu reported that Kenneth T. admitted that he had \u201cdifficulty controlling his sexual impulses\u201d <em>(see </em>majority op at 188 n 7). Contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>majority\u2019s position, the circumstances surrounding the recurrence of criminal sexual conduct despite the prior imposition of severe sanctions for similar behavior are factors that are directly relevant to evaluating whether an offender struggles to control his sexual conduct <em>(see John S., </em>23 NY3d at 349; <em>Matter of State of New York v Shannon S., </em>20 NY3d 99, 108 [2012], <em>cert denied </em>568 US \u2014, 133 S Ct 1500 [2013]). I therefore cannot agree that the evidence was legally insufficient to demonstrate that Kenneth T. had serious difficulty controlling his behavior. But my analysis does not end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">I conclude that the determination of mental abnormality must be reversed since the State failed to present legally sufficient evidence to support its proffered diagnosis of parapahilia NOS, nonconsenting partners. Like the majority <em>(see </em>majority op at 186-187), I do not believe that resolution of Kenneth T.\u2019s case requires us to revisit our holding in <em>Matter of State of New York v Shannon S. </em>(20 NY3d 99 [2012]). There, a majority of this Court rejected the respondent\u2019s challenge to the viability of paraphilia NOS as a predicate condition, holding that a condition need not be listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to so qualify <em>(see id. </em>at 106). Further, we explained that \u201c[a]ny professional debate over the viability and reliability\u201d of predicate conditions is an issue properly reserved for resolution by the factfinder <em>(id. </em>at 107). Those same principles apply in this case, but the State must present \u201can adequate record\u201d for the factfinder and reviewing courts to assess the applicability of the asserted diagnosis <em>(id.). </em>In this respect, assuming without deciding that paraphilia NOS, nonconsenting, is a valid diagnosis, the evidence presented was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At Kenneth T.\u2019s trial, Dr. Kirschner testified that paraphilia NOS generally involved \u201csexual fantasies, urges or behaviors directed ... at inanimate objects or non-consenting partners or minors\u201d and that Kenneth T, specifically, \u201chas sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors involving non-consenting partners.\u201d Although Dr. Kirschner claimed that he could \u201cinfer[ ]\u201d that Kenneth T. had paraphilia NOS, nonconsenting, from \u201cthe evidence or the record,\u201d he also stated that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d he would infer that Kenneth T. was aroused by the nonconsensual nature of his sexual misconduct. Dr. Kirschner admitted that he did not believe that it \u201creally . . . matter[ed]\u201d whether Kenneth T.\u2019s sexual crimes were the result of a paraphilia and he conceded that, on these facts, he could not distinguish Kenneth T. from a rapist motivated by a need for power and control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>rather than paraphiliac urges. In his view, whether Kenneth T.\u2019s predisposition to commit sex crimes was caused by a \u201ccongenital or acquired condition, disease or disorder\u201d was irrelevant (Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 10.03 [i]). According to his testimony, paraphilia NOS, nonconsenting, may be diagnosed through evidence of the offender\u2019s fantasies and feelings related specifically to the nonconsensual aspect of an offense. Any such proof, however, was admittedly lacking here. Because Dr. Kirschner grounded his opinion that Kenneth T. suffered from a mental abnormality on both the ASPD and paraphilia NOS diagnoses and the two cannot be separated based on the testimony adduced, the mental abnormality finding must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent in <em>Matter of State of New York v Donald DD. </em>and concur in result only in <em>Matter of State of New York v Kenneth T.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Smith and Rivera concur; Judge Graffeo dissents in an opinion in which Judges Read and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In <em>Matter of State of New York v Donald DD.: </em>Order reversed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-9\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Smith and Rivera concur; Judge Graffeo concurs in an opinion in which Judges Read and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">In <em>Matter of State of New York v Kenneth T.: </em>Order reversed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">.
