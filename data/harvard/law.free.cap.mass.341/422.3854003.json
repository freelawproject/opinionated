The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the trial judge\u2019s direction of a verdict for the defendants. The evidence is summarized in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Zelig was employed as a freight elevator operator by a shoe company. The company was tenant, under an oral agreement made in 1952, of one half of the second floor and of all of the third to seventh floors, inclusive, of the defendants\u2019 Haverhill factory building. The defendants maintained and repaired the freight elevator, which ran from the basement to the seventh floor. As a part of bis work Zelig moved racks of shoes, including taking them from the fifth to the fourth floor. Zelig went to work on March 28, 1955, at 7 a.m and was found dead at the bottom of the elevator pit at some time before 9:30 a.m. on that day. No one saw Zelig fall. He was last seen alive between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. He had been on the fourth and fifth floors that morning and had been seen leaving the fourth floor, probably bound for the fifth floor, about 7:50 a.m. His watch was stopped at 8:40 a.m. Zelig\u2019s injuries were \u201cconsistent with a fall from five flights.\u201d It could have been found (a) that two to three months prior to March 28, the elevator gate at the fifth floor on occasion became caught in a raised position when the elevator ascended to higher floors; (b) that maintenance work was done upon this gate in November, 1954; (c) that this defect also appeared during an inspection on March 31, three days after the accident, although there was testimony that the defect was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>apparent when the elevator was tested in the presence of two police inspectors later on the morning of the accident, and during a test three days before the accident; (d) that, on March 31, there was a screw loose in a pulley, later repaired, on the fifth floor elevator gate which caused the gate to stick in an up position; (e) that Zelig had told his brother that he would be on the fifth floor between 8 and 9 in the morning on the day of the accident; and (f) that the fifth floor gate had been seen at about 8 a.m. to be in an up position by an observer from the ground floor platform when the elevator was \u201cway up\u201d at a floor above the fifth floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The fifth floor safety gate consisted of two horizontal bars, about twenty-six inches apart, possibly with vertical pickets between them, but the evidence as to this was conflicting. The elevator had two wooden sides and an opening on either end. No one \u201ccould fall between the elevator and either of the outside walls.\u201d The elevator was operated by a cable device and \u201ca person . . . outside of the elevator could operate . . . [it] by reaching inside the shaft and pulling the cable up or down. \u2019 \u2019 On the morning of March 28, Grlassman \u201cappeared in very good humor\u201d to the witness. Another witness quoted him \u201cas saying he felt dizzy.\u201d About 8:45 a.m. to 9 a.m. one witness found the elevator on the seventh floor with the elevator door closed. There was an empty rack inside. This witness found all the elevator doors shut except that on the sixth floor, which he did not visit, but he was told that Grlassman had not been on the sixth floor all morning. \u201cWith all the doors shut, and Grlassman not being on the sixth floor at all, the witness could not explain how Grlassman got into the elevator well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We need not decide whether the defendants\u2019 liability was merely that of a landlord bound to use reasonable care to maintain the elevator in the same condition in which it was, or appeared to be, at the time of the letting (see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Isenberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 170, 172; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>A. W. Perry Co. </em>325 Mass. 479, 480-481) or whether the defendants were under liability by reason of an express agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to keep the elevator continuously in repair. Compare <em>Ryerson </em>v. <em>Fall River Philanthropic Burial Soc. </em>315 Mass. 244, 250-251, and <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>South Middlesex Co-op. Bank, </em>316 Mass. 659, 662, with <em>Banaghan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>340 Mass. 73, 78. Even if it were to be assumed that there was a defect in the fifth floor gate of which the defendants had notice, which they negligently did not repair, and for which they were responsible, the evidence did not warrant a finding of causal connection between that defect and Zelig\u2019s injury. The cause and circumstances of that injury are left to surmise and conjecture. See <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>318 Mass. 626, 630. Cf. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>245 Mass. 1, 5-6; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Lyon Realty Corp. </em>308 Mass. 66, 71. The evidence does not warrant the conclusion that there is greater likelihood that it was occasioned by the negligence of the defendants than by a cause for which the defendants are not liable. The case in this aspect is governed by <em>Mucha </em>v. <em>Northeastern Crushed Stone Co. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 592, 594-597, and <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Kilbourn, </em>317 Mass. 358, 362-363, rather than by the cases collected in <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Republic Pipe &amp; Supply Corp. </em>335 Mass. 422, 427-428, and <em>Poulin </em>v. <em>H. A. Tobey Lumber Corp. </em>337 Mass. 146, 148-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
