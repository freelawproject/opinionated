The single member found that the employee on March' 29, 1958, had sustained first, second and third degree burns over much of her body; that she lived more or less in a state of shock until her death on May 25,1958; and that her death was causally related to the accident. The award of the reviewing board to the employee\u2019s brother and sister, as claimants, was embodied in the decree of the Superior Court. The insurer contests the award of specific compensation totaling $6,500: $2,500 under c. 152, \u00a7 36 (h), for disfigurement, and $4,000 under sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>section (q) for functional loss of use of both legs, $2,000 for each. The insurer also contests the approval of the bills of six physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Henderson\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 491, 495, established that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, gives to dependents the rights to specific compensation under \u00a7 36 to which a deceased employee had become entitled at the time of \u201cthe happening of the event upon which the employee bases his claim.\u201d The insurer contends that the reference is to \u201cthat point in time when the medical end result of the employee\u2019s injuries can be determined\u201d with such certainty that the end result is \u201cadmitted or conclusively proven.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">There is no basis for a special rule of evidence in the proof of the relevant medical fact. The question is essentially the same as that which the board resolves for living claimants under \u00a7 36 and other sections of the act, by finding as a fact for present award the future state of health and bodily function of living claimants. <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529. <em>Royal\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 374, 376-377. This is a rule of evidence of general application. <em>Menard </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>298 Mass. 40. <em>Rezendes </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>285 Mass. 505, 513. Compare <em>Pullen </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>208 Mass. 356. The board makes these determinations notwithstanding conflicting medical testimony and, under the familiar rule, it may make the finding on testimony of probabilities but not on conjecture or speculation. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 534-535. <em>Brownhill </em>v. <em>Kivlin, </em>317 Mass. 168,170. Under \u00a7 36 (q) the board must find, as to a living claimant, whether the present state of his legs or arms is such that there is permanent total, or partial, loss of use; that is, what on the medical testimony the board concludes he will be able to do with these members in the future. Under \u00a7 36 (e) there is a similar determination for partial loss of vision. Similar issues are resolved under \u00a7\u00a7 34 (total incapacity), 34A (permanent and total incapacity), and 35 (partial incapacity). See <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass, 351, 355-356; <em>Barry\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 408; <em>Ramondetta\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 492, 495; <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Mass. 635, 637-640; <em>Amello\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 347, 348; <em>Gramolini\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 86, 88-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">It is no bar to a finding of the fact in such cases that there is a possibility that the claimant\u2019s condition will improve, <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 528, <em>Khachadoorian\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 625, 631, <em>Gramolini\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 86, or that a risky operation may improve it. <em>Snooks\u2019s Case, </em>264 Mass. 92. <em>Sheppard\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 459,463. The death of the employee is no basis for a different rule of evidence. In either case the fact as determined by the board is conclusive for any payment then finally made. <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529 (lump sum settlement of probable future disability is final). Compare G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">There was sufficient evidence to permit the finding and award. The attending physician testified to severe burns over approximately twenty-five per cent of the body, the principal area of the burns being the lower extremities, chiefly the thighs \u201cinvolving . . . completely buttocks on both sides and up into the perineum\u201d; some third degree burns on the right hand and arm and scattered third degree burns on the chest, abdomen, flanks, and back of the knees; and second and first degree burns of lesser importance on the left hand and about the face. The skin grafting which was attempted resulted in <em>\u20181 </em>only partial take. \u2019 \u2019 The hospital records showed nine debridements and a \u201cbilateral partial mastectomy.\u201d The physicians were attempting \u201cto catch up with something that seemed to be getting ahead of them.\u201d They kept going deeper in the burned flesh in an effort to reach satisfactory tissue for grafting. While she was in the hospital the patient\u2019s legs were bandaged. On occasion the physicians would test motion, passively, and there was a certain amount of stiffness and limitation of motion; they were not concerned that she should try to move the legs herself. The two major joints of the legs were involved, hip and knee, and if grafting had been suseessful there would have been second class skin and some motion; she would not have had \u201ccompletely ankylosed joint. \u201d \u201cAs far as legs concerned she never reached medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>cal end result.\u201d The physician\u2019s opinion was based on the probabilities which he would expect on the basis of his own experience. It would be impossible for him to give an opinion as to what the functioning would be, if the grafting was successful. The principal treatment was in the posterior area; the grafts on right or left thigh or buttocks took only to a degree; the physician did not think \u201cthey reached fifty per cent take on either occasion.\u201d He had no way of knowing whether the skin grafting would have been successful. Had it been successful, the physician \u201cfeels\u201d that the employee \u201cwould have been permanent invalid and probably would have suffered from about complete disability.\u201d The loss of motion \u201cwould have been considerable and in my opinion approach total disability. \u201d \u201cQ. Isn\u2019t that speculative, doctor? A. It is speculation based on my experience with these people and knowing patient as I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The evidence supported the finding that the employee had sustained complete loss of use of her legs. It was assumed in the insurer\u2019s cross-examination of the physician that, if the grafts did not take, the employee could not make effective use of them. The fact of some motion in the legs would not be significant if large areas of burned flesh were unhealed. The speculation was not in respect of this, but whether operations which were being tried and which had not been successful prior to death would have been successful and if so whether the legs could have been used. It is the insurer who seeks the advantage of speculation, not the claimants. In any event the physician\u2019s testimony as to the probability even if the grafts were successful was sufficient to warrant the conclusion. <em>Caccamo\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 358, 359. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 534-535. <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 415,419. <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529. Compare <em>Hachadourian\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The evidence supported the finding of disfigurement. It was not necessary that the physician testify expressly that what had happened to the employee was disfigurement. At best there would be substantial areas of scar tissue. Parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of both breasts had been, removed. The evidence permitted the maximum awards. <em>Morley\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 148, 150-151. The statute specifies for disfigurement \u201cproper and equitable compensation, not to exceed one hundred and twenty-five weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The report of the single member states, \u201cIssues: Section 36 (36A) \u2014Loss of function and disfigurement. Sections 13 and 30 \u2014 Doctors\u2019 bills. Agreed: . . . Counsel for the insurer stated . . . they are . . . willing to pay the hospital bill, at industrial rates. Under sections 13 and 30 the insurer wants determination as to whether the bills of the physicians are reasonable, and whether or not these are staff physicians of the hospital, or treated her as a private patient.\u201d The issue for the separate hearing on the hospital bills was restated at that hearing in substantially the same terms. The board had before it the evidence as reported by the single member on the issue of the award, and the bills of the six doctors. The board decided that \u201cIt is the opinion of the board that this was an emergency case and that the condition of the patient was such as to require the special treatment provided. The board therefore finds that the foregoing bills are proper and reasonable . . . [with the exception of one bill which was reduced].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Included in the record was the testimony of Dr. Wall, the attending physician, that \u201csomebody called . . . [him] to come up and see Mrs. Lauble at the Lynn Hospital accident room: on March 29 he was on service at the hospital.\u201d \u201cQ. And it was in that capacity that you came to see . . . [her]? A. No, not completely.\u201d The patient was not then in shock and was conscious and rational. It is reasonably to be inferred that Dr. Wall continued as the attending physician without express engagement, and, as the case required, called in other physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">We think the board in effect made a finding that payment to the physicians was warranted under the provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30, which provides that \u201cwhere in case of emergency or for other justifiable cause a physician other than the one provided by the insurer is called in to treat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>injured employee, the reasonable cost of the physician\u2019s services shall be paid by the insurer, subject to the approval of the division.\u201d The finding that \u201cthe condition of the patient was such as to require the special treatment,\u201d read with the finding that \u201cthis was an emergency case,\u201d satisfies the statutory requirement of \u201cother justifiable cause.\u201d That the employee at the start of her hospitalization was fully rational, as the physician testified and the records show \u2014 that she could talk and think \u2014 did not mean that she was in a state to take action under the statute. She was severely injured and close to shock which was feared but averted by medication. The deteriorating state of the patient permitted the finding, implicit in the board\u2019s brief statement, that the attending physician called the other physicians \u201cfor other justifiable cause.\u201d The testimony that all but one of these physicians were on the staff of the hospital did not require the conclusion that their bills should be at industrial rates or their charges included in the hospital charges. The approval of the bills in view of the statement of the issue in respect thereof implies the finding that the services rendered were substantially more than those to be expected without charge from staff physicians at the hospital. Compare <em>Allen\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 490. The requirement of the statute for a finding that the \u201cservices were adequate and reasonable and the charges reasonable\u201d was sufficiently met by the board\u2019s finding that the bills \u201care proper and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">More specific findings would have been appropriate and helpful, but the deficiencies are not such as to require re-committal as recently ordered in <em>Herson\u2019s Case, ante, </em>402, 407, and <em>Garrigan\u2019s Case, ante, </em>413, 419-420.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">: The decree is affirmed. Costs of the appeal are to be determined by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
