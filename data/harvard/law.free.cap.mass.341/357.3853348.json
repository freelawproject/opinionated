At best the admission of such evidence was in the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Robitaille </em>v. <em>Netoco Community Theatre of No. Attleboro, Inc. </em>305 Mass. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">There is nothing in the plaintiffs \u2019 contention that the evidence was made competent by the prior testimony of the engineer to the effect that if on reapplication of the brakes they again set suddenly in emergency position he would know it was a \u201ckicker,\u201d that is, a sudden release of air upon an ordinary application of the brakes due to dirt or rust in the brake mechanism of one of the cars. The plain inference, if not the direct import, of the testimony was that the engineer was referring to an immediate reapplication of the brakes, a test under the same conditions. This was confirmed by the engineer\u2019s later testimony, after the exclusion of the question discussed below, that \u201cthe air pressure came back so he knew that there was not a kicker. \u2019 \u2019 There was and could have been no offer to show that essential conditions were the same; it did not appear that the jolts or the sudden stop on the return trip were due to an unexpected loss of air, or uncontrolled braking. Compare <em>Tremblay </em>v. <em>Harnden, </em>162 Mass. 383, 384; <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>167 Mass. 61, 63; <em>Edward Rose Co. </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. </em>262 Mass. 469, 472. At best the tendency of the offered proof was to confirm that the train was old and in poor condition; the thrust of this was away from proof of a particular defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The statement in the charge that \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>evidence as to the condition of the equipment before the stop and after the stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>at times other than at the time of the stop ... is something from which you can draw . . . any reasonable inference\u201d properly applied to such evidence as was in the cases; it did not, as the plaintiffs contend, show that the judge should have let in evidence of what happened on the return trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">There was no error in excluding the question to the engineer \u201cWell, let\u2019s assume . . . that on the return trip that night . . . the train again jerked and . . . came to an abrupt stop ... would that indicate to you what the reason for this was?\u201d Counsel asked that the question be judged in the light of his offer to prove by other evidence \u201cthat on the return trip . . . one of the cars clouded up in smoke and it was necessary to stop the train along the countryside\u201d and men worked \u201con the apparatus beneath the car,\u201d that on the return trip the train jerked when it slowed down, that when the brakes were applied in the Worcester yards \u201cthere was another jumping and jolting and that the people screamed inside the train and . . . the train stopped . . . [in] the yards.\u201d This was not an appropriate question to clarify or amplify the engineer\u2019s prior testimony in respect of the time within which a recurrence of a kicker would be significant, even if it might have served to do so. Furthermore, the engineer had been testifying in respect of a sudden emergency setting of the brakes notwithstanding that the controls did not call for that action. Neither the question nor the offered proof included this essential fact. The exclusion of the question was in the wise exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Greeley, </em>257 Mass. 21, 27. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brabason, </em>264 Mass. 276, 288-289. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noxon, </em>319 Mass. 495, 538. Compare <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Lockey Piano Case Co. </em>205 Mass. 59, 63; <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>207 Mass. 467, 477. The judge\u2019s inquiry whether any plaintiff claimed injuries because of anything occurring on the trip back shows his consideration of a possible independent ground for admission of the question; it does not lessen the propriety of the judge\u2019s ruling on the question in the aspect on which the plaintiffs rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The plaintiffs show no prejudice in the charge in respect to proof of negligence. The charge as a whole in this aspect was at least as favorable as the plaintiffs had a right to ask. The jury were told that \u201c [i]f you cannot find any particular act of negligence . . . but if you find there was this sudden stop on this private way, then that in itself is evidence of negligence, and unless the railroad has offered to you a reasonable explanation for that sudden stop, then the plaintiffs are similarly entitled to your verdict, subject to . . . [contributory negligence, which] I am coming to.\u201d The statements that the jury should determine what was the cause of the train stopping and that they could consider any acts of the railroad\u2019s negligence which they felt were established on the evidence to their reasonable satisfaction were reasonably related in context to the reiteration of the rule that inferred negligence is sufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
