J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhT\">The employee, a member of the highway department of Chelmsford, was fatally injured on March 12,1954, when the town truck he was driving was struck by a railroad train at a grade crossing in the town. At the time, as ordered by his superior, he was transporting pea stone, which had been purchased by the town, from the seller\u2019s premises to a gravel pit for storage. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member awarding compensation to his dependent widow. From a decree of the Superior Court awarding compensation, the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">Succinctly stated, the single member made these findings. The employee\u2019s death arose in the course of his employment. His injury \u201carose out of his employment, since the nature, incidents and obligations of his contract of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ment viewed in all its aspects necessarily brought the employee in contact with the risk which in fact caused his death, and his work necessitated his being where he was when fatally injured,\u201d citing <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500; <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332. The deceased\u2019s conduct in operating the truck at between seven and ten miles an hour would at worst have been negligent even if in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 15 (as amended through St. 1951, c. 557). Moreover, if \u201cthe deceased assumed a hazard because he may have been in violation\u201d of \u00a7 15, such \u201cwas not one assumed outside the scope\u201d of his employment, and \u201ceven if the deceased\u2019s conduct could conceivably have been found to be serious and wilful\u2019 \u2019 compensation would not be barred to the widow, by virtue of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 27 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 331), where the injury resulted in death, citing <em>Hamel\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The reviewing board was not required to find that the deceased\u2019s conduct was in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 15, as amended. Many of the cases relied upon by the insurer can no longer be cited for the proposition that the deceased was acting in violation of law. See <em>Borden </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>339 Mass. 266, 269-270. It is not of consequence to determine whether as matter of terminology the employee\u2019s death was, or was not, due to an injury \u201carising out of an ordinary risk of the street. \u2019 \u2019 See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (as amended through St. 1945, c. 623, \u00a7 1). His place of employment at the time of his injury was where he was, whether it be a public way, private way, or railroad right of way. <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11, 14. We observe no error of law in the findings of the board, which are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The final decree is affirmed and costs and reasonable expenses under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
