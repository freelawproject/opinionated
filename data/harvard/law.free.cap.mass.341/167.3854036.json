L. c. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13, to have their surname changed to Bryan. Appearances in opposition were filed' by Guiseppe Rusconi, Joseph\u2019s father, James Rusconi, a brother, and by Joan A. Friary, a sister. In addition, Joseph\u2019s mother, through her husband, and two brothers of Joseph opposed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">After hearing, the judge entered a decree denying the petition, from which the petitioners appealed. Pursuant to a request by the petitioners the judge filed a report of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>material facts. G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 11. The evidence is not reported,</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">1. The petitioners filed a motion to strike the appearances filed by Gniseppe and James Rusconi and Joan A. Friary and appealed from the denial of their motion. The record, however, does not disclose that the motion was ever expressly denied. If we treat the failure to act on the motion as an implied denial, there was no error. General Laws c. 210, \u00a7 13, provides, in <em>part,11 </em>The court shall, except for good cause shown, before decreeing a change of name, require public notice of the petition to be given and <em>any person may Toe heard thereon\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The motion to strike could not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">2. On the merits, the findings of the judge both in the decree and in his report of material facts present questions of some difficulty. In the decree the judge stated that the \u201cfacts in this case do not warrant an allowance of the petition.\u201d Preceding this conclusion, however, he recited the following: \u201cWhile it seems essential in these great United States of ours that we maintain a uniform language and a common tongue in order to conduct our daily enterprises whether business or social, it is nevertheless fundamentally important that we not lose sight of the fact that this country was founded and continues to function by peoples of many racial groups. This seems a proper time to renew and review the purposes of Our Founding Fathers, for many peoples from many countries to live in harmonious respect of every race. Any attempt by any of our citizens to bring disrespect or ridicule to any one of our races is un-American and cannot be justified. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Turning to the report of material facts, made after the entry of the decree, we find that considerations similar to those mentioned in the decree appear to have influenced the judge. We summarize these findings as follows: The Rusconi family is well known and respected in the community, and is prominent in Italian circles. As a result of the present proceedings \u201cinjuries to the feelings and sensibilities of the members of the Rusconi family have resulted\u201d; they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>have been \u201cheld up to ridicule and embarrassment, in this predominantly Italian community.\u201d The objecting members of the family are \u201cproud of the name Busconi, and feel that this petition is a slur to the Italian race.\u201d While the petition appears to be brought by Joseph and his wife and their two minor children, in reality it is the petition of the wife \u201cwho reluctantly bears this Italian name and scorns the heritage of her husband. \u2019 \u2019 There <em>\u20181 </em>exists no confusion or inconvenience over the use of the name Busconi.\u201d The \u201cnature and purpose of the request for the change of name in this instance [is] an affront to those bearing the name of Busconi in particular and the Italian race in general.\u201d After stating that he was \u201cguided and controlled by the principles of law and of justice\u201d the judge \u201cin the exercise of . . . [his] discretion . . . [concluded] that an allowance of this petition would bring disrespect and ridicule in this Italian community\u201d and that in the interests of a \u201charmonious respect of races, public policy is best served by a denial of this petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Section 12 of G. L. c. 210, after empowering Probate Courts to hear petitions for change of name, provides, with certain exceptions, that \u201cNo change of the name of a person . . . shall be lawful unless made by said court for a sufficient reason consistent with public interests.\u201d In two comparatively recent cases <em>(Merolevitz, petitioner, </em>320 Mass. 448, and <em>Buyarsky, petitioner, </em>322 Mass. 335) this court has discussed at some length the principles which govern a change of name both at common law and under the statute. See <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. 517. In the <em>Buyarsky </em>case it was said at page 338, \u201cA man, if acting honestly, may assume any name he desires and by which he wishes to be known in the community in which he lives or in the trade circles in which he does his business. The law does not require a man to retain and to perpetuate the surname of his ancestors. The common law recognizes his freedom of choice to assume a name which he deems more appropriate and advantageous to him than his family name in his present circumstances, if the change is not motivated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>by fraudulent intent. The statute, G. L. . . . c. 210, \u00a7 12, does not restrict his choice but aids him to secure an official record which definitely and specifically establishes his change of name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is apparent from what was said in the <em>Buyarsky </em>case that the right of one to change his name, although not absolute, is a very broad one. We are of opinion that the statute when read, as it must be, against the background of the common law, was not intended to permit, as controlling, considerations of the sort relied on by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">From a reading of the recitals in the decree and the findings in the report of material facts it is apparent that the judge denied the petition here because he thought the change was \u201cun-American\u201d and constituted an affront to persons of Italian origin. Under this reasoning a person belonging to a particular national or ethnic group in the community could rarely, if ever, change his name to that of some other group. Many, if not most, of the petitions brought under the statute could not meet this test. We decline to place such a construction on the statute. It is not open to the court to inquire into the motives that prompt one to change one\u2019s name, provided, of course, they are not for dishonest or unlawful ends. <em>Merolevits, petitioner, </em>320 . Mass. 448, 449-450. We believe that most persons are entirely content, indeed proud, to bear the names which they acquired at birth. But there may be some who for one reason or another do not care to do so. These reasons may be good or indifferent, wise or unwise, but it is not the function of the courts to pass upon them. The judge, it is true, found that the petitioner was \u201cin reality\u201d Anne Ruseoni, Joseph\u2019s wife, who \u201cscorns the heritage of her husband.\u201d But Joseph joined in the petition and pressed it both in the court below and in this court. We cannot, therefore, treat him as other than a petitioner. That the feelings of his family might be injured by his attempt to change his name is understandable. But, however appealing this attitude may be, it does not constitute a reason, good in law, for the| denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>We are mindful that the judge purported to deny the petition \u201cguided and controlled by the principles of law and of justice\u201d and \u201cin the exercise of . . . [his] discretion.\u201d But it is apparent that these conclusions were dominated and controlled by the reasons discussed above, which, as we hold, were not relevant. \u201cA report of material facts under the statute must contain every fact necessary to support the decree, from the entry of which no fact not expressly found may be implied.\u201d <em>Carilli Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>John Basile &amp; Co. Inc. </em>317 Mass. 726, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">There are no findings that reveal that the petitioners are seeking a change of name for a fraudulent or other dishonest purpose, or that such a change would not be consistent with public interests. The final decree, therefore, is reversed, and a decree is to be entered allowing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
