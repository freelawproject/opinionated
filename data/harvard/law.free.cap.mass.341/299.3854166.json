The declaration is in three counts. In the first count it is alleged that on or about August 20, 1953, the defendant broke and entered the plaintiff\u2019s close, namely the land and building thereon known as Shore House Restaurant located in Falmouth; in count 2 it is alleged that on or about August 21,1953, the defendant converted goods, the property of the plaintiff, described in an annexed schedule A; and in count 3 that on or about September 3, 1953, the defendant converted other goods described in an annexed schedule B. The defendant in his answer denies the plaintiff\u2019s allegations and further answers by way of justification that his acts were performed in his official capacity as deputy sheriff \u201cand in the furtherance of a legal levy and sale under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">There was evidence for the plaintiff that in 1953 she lived on Orkney Road in Brighton with her husband and children. From June until Labor Day she operated a restaurant in Falmouth and her husband, William Tourles, worked with her. The restaurant was located in a two story frame building, the second floor of which was used for the living quarters of the plaintiff\u2019s family and the kitchen help. The restaurant had a seating capacity of 100. The plaintiff had a lease of the building, her landlord being Annie Agbay of Worcester, and had leased the fixtures and equipment of the restaurant from one Jennie Poulack. She had operated the restaurant since 1947, but had filed no married woman\u2019s business certificate under G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">On August 20,1953, the defendant entered the restaurant premises with an execution dated January 30, 1950, on a judgment recovered by one James Byron against William P. Tourles, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, and one John P. Stolos, for the sum of $2,000. He seized the property listed by the plaintiff in schedule A as that of Tourles, told the plaintiff that the place was under attachment, and left a keeper in possession. On August 21 the plaintiff filed a married woman\u2019s business certificate. Keepers remained on the premises until the afternoon of August 24. Each day the plaintiff told the defendant to take \u201chis keeper and stuff he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>had attached and get out.\u201d On August 23, the defendant placed one of several cards, on which was typed \u201cAll personal property while contained in this restaurant, has been seized by me, by virtue of execution . . . dated January 30th, 1950,\u201d on the cash register. The plaintiff, on his demand, gave him the money in the register amounting to $151. At three o\u2019clock on August 24, the defendant put padlocks and no trespassing notices on all outside doors, nailed up one door leading from the kitchen to the upstairs tenement, and removed the keepers. At some time the plaintiff caused the locks to be broken and continued to operate her business.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On August 26 the defendant advertised the sale for cash of the following chattels, the same being listed in the plaintiff\u2019s schedule A: \u201c1 six foot gas range 2 ovens 2 friolators 1 set coffee urn 1 coffee urn stand 2 sinks 1 broiler 1 steam table 1 reach in refrigerator chest 1 walk in refrigerator chest also kitchen equipment 15 booths 8 tables 1 cash register 1 cigar and cigarette case 12 booths 1 service bar 1 sink 1 back bar 1 check stamp register,\u201d the sale to be held on the premises at 3 p.m. on August 28. The notice was published on August 26 in the Cape Cod Standard Times, a newspaper published in Hyannis which is a part of the town of Barn-stable, and was posted in Falmouth, Mashpee and Bourne. It was not published in a weekly paper which was published in Falmouth, nor in any newspaper published in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendant, having been advised on August 27 that \u201cthe advertisement of this sale was incorrect,\u201d changed the date of the sale to September 3 by writing on \u201chis original notice . . . \u2018 Sale continued until September 3rd at 3 p.m. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 \u2018 \u2018 and posted \u2019 \u2019 in the town hall in Falmouth. On August 28 the defendant was served with a temporary restraining order issued by the Superior Court in Boston (see G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 40) and thereupon released his keepers who had been reinstated in possession on August 26. The restraining order was dissolved on August 31 and on September 1 the defendant again reinstated the keepers. At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>on demand by the defendant, the plaintiff paid $15 to one of the keepers and made written demand on the defendant to \u201cremove the keeper or the property which you claim to have attached and seized under the . . . execution, without unreasonable delay.\u201d On September 2 an \u201cadvertisement was placed\u201d in the Boston Globe but not by the defendant, and on the same day there was a written demand by the judgment debtor Tourles that the defendant publish notice according to the provisions of G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On September 3, the defendant sold the advertised property for $1,000 to the judgment creditor James Byron and accepted the purchaser\u2019s check in payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant testified that \u201cthroughout this period\u201d he did not remove the property because he did not know who owned it, and that he had letters from three or four people who said that they owned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the direction of a verdict for the defendant on each count. The evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff was in possession of the premises under a lease and was there operating a restaurant with fixtures and equipment which she had \u00e1lso leased. Such possession was of a character sufficient to support her action of tort for trespass and conversion against the defendant if he deprived her of that possession without right. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Kaler, </em>106 Mass. 448, 449. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Leventhal, </em>302 Mass. 393, 394. <em>New England Box Co. </em>v. <em>C &amp; R Constr. Co. </em>313 Mass. 696, 707-708, and cases cited. See Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 13, pp. 58-59, as to trespass; Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 15, pp. 67-68, as to conversion. The burden of proving justification was on the defendant. See <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 Mass. 310, 311; <em>Harriman </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>196 Mass. 466; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>158 Mass. 357, 360; G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 147, form 40. His initial entry on the plaintiff\u2019s premises appears to have been justified. In the absence of a recorded business certificate the personal property employed by her in her separate business was liable to be taken on execution against her husband (G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 10) and the validity of the seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was not affected by the recording of a certificate on the following day. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>190 Mass. 556, 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">There was no authority, however, for continuing the custody of the seized property on the plaintiff\u2019s premises through the agency of keepers. The provision of G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 48, that an officer, \u201cif necessary, may appoint a keeper of personal property which has been taken on execution\u201d does not afford a right to keep the property on the premises of a person who is not the judgment debtor without his consent. <em>Steuer </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>182 Mass. 575, 577. See <em>Fitchburg R.R. </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>12 Gray, 401, 406. \"While the defendant in his return on the execution stated that the goods \u201cby reason of their bulk cannot be immediately removed\u201d and in his testimony suggests the difficulty of getting someone to move them, these were questions of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\"We need not pause, however, to decide whether the continuance of the keepers constituted a trespass since the defendant\u2019s act in padlocking the plaintiff\u2019s premises was unjustifiable and made him a trespasser ab initio. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>194 Mass. 317, 319. <em>Morrin </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>205 Mass. 205, 210. <em>Chetteville </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>212 Mass. 17, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">There was a lapse of time, the length of which does not appear, between the plaintiff\u2019s resumption of possession by breaking the padlocks and the reinstatement of keepers on August 26. It could be found that the plaintiff\u2019s business certificate was then on file and that the taking of possession of the goods by a keeper was a new seizure which was not justified by the absence of a certificate. \u201c [A]n officer who attaches chattels or takes them on execution cannot maintain his right, and retain his special property, without taking them into his possession and <em>keeping </em>them\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Field </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>191 Mass. 494, 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that the sale on execution was not advertised in accordance with the statutes is not supported by the evidence. It appears from the defendant\u2019s return that the notice of the sale on August 28 was posted in Falmouth, Mashpee and Bourne and in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>evidence to the contrary it may be presumed to have been posted in a public place. See G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 37. It was not necessary for the defendant to prove a further publication in a newspaper published in the town where the debtor had his last and usual place of residence without a request by \u2018 \u2018either party\u201d that such publication be made. See \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The sale, however, which was advertised for August 28 was not legally adjourned to September 3. It is provided by \u00a7 39 that the sale may be adjourned but by \u201cgiving notice ... by a public declaration thereof at the time and place previously appointed for the sale.\u201d This was not done and it must be held that the adjourned sale on September 3 was invalid. The defendant exceeded the limits of his authority and became a trespasser ab initia. Even if the plaintiff\u2019s property was lawfully seized and held, GL L. c. 209, \u00a7 10, gave the defendant no right to sell it by an illegal proceeding and the sale could be found to have been a conversion. <em>Kolas </em>v. <em>LaRochelle, </em>270 Mass. 49, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It is apparent that there was evidence for the jury of a trespass under count 1 and a conversion of the property listed in count 2. It was error to direct a verdict for the defendant on these counts. While there was no evidence that the defendant actually sold any of the items of personal property listed in schedule B of count 3, it could be found that some if not all of the items were on the premises which he padlocked on August 24 and that they were converted for reasons hereinbefore stated. See <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Cawley, </em>218 Mass. 271, 277. As there must be a new trial we need not discuss the questions raised by the exceptions to rulings on evidence as it is unlikely that the issues involved will again be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
