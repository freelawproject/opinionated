In this action of contract or tort the first count against H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., the producer, is based upon negligence. The second count against B. J. Lang\u2019s Provision Company, Inc., which sold the container of milk, is for breach of warranty of merchantability. G-. L. c. 106, \u00a7 17 (2). The case was first heard by an auditor whose findings of fact were not to be final. He found for the plaintiff on both counts. At a trial in the Superior Court the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on each count. The defendants excepted to the denial of motions for directed verdicts and to the denial of a motion to strike certain findings of the auditor. On the second count there is a contention in the alternative that the plaintiff is entitled, at most, to nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We first set forth \u201cpreliminary findings of fact\u201d of the auditor. The plaintiff was a widow residing in Pembroke. Living with her was her unmarried adult son John. On Sunday, March 14, 1954, he purchased at Lang\u2019s market a quart of Hood\u2019s milk in a cardboard container, which was sealed. The top of the container was flat, and at one corner was a round hole through which the milk could be poured. This opening had a hinged cardboard cover. The son frequently made purchases for his mother, sometimes paying cash and sometimes charging to her account. As to his testimony that he did not remember which he did this time, the auditor stated, \u201cI am convinced by further testimony, and I so find, that this purchase was for the use in the household by both John\u201d and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The container was placed unopened in the plaintiff\u2019s refrigerator. On Monday morning the plaintiff took out the carton and poured some milk in a cup of coffee, which she drank. She then replaced the carton in the refrigerator. An hour later, about 9 a.m., she took out the carton and poured a glass of milk, which she drank, and then returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the carton to the refrigerator. About 9 :'50 a.m. she again removed the carton from the refrigerator and poured another glass which she drank. As she was drinking the second glass, she felt some \u201clittle stuff\u201d go into her mouth and down her throat. Each of the two previous times when she had any of the milk \u201cshe felt that there was a \u2018funny feeling in the carton. \u2019 \u201d After pouring the second glass, she felt as if something was moving inside it. 'She poured most of the milk in the sink, and saw \u201ca lot of \u2018little things\u2019 in it.\u201d When she poured out all the milk, she saw a dead mouse in the carton.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">After a moment she started toward the telephone to call her daughter, but \u201cshe began to sweat and her stomach turned and she found that she couldn\u2019t get to the phone.\u201d She put her head on the kitchen table and slept from about ten o\u2019clock until about two o\u2019clock. She then answered a telephone call from her daughter, who came to the house in five or six minutes. The plaintiff told the daughter what had happened and fell asleep in a chair. She \u2018 \u2018 slept most all that evening and night and all the next day. During this time she broke into about fifteen or twenty sweats.\u201d On Tuesday night she itched, and on Wednesday morning there was a rash all over her body, face, and hands. The rash subsequently turned into sores. \u201cDuring the first six weeks she had fifteen or twenty sweats every day and she itched. The itching interfered with her sleep. \u2019 \u2019 iShe was nauseated. 'Since March 15, 1954, the plaintiff has had no milk. When she thinks of the incident, as she does frequently, her stomach turns.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We omit the auditor\u2019s descriptions of the expert medical opinions given on behalf of the plaintiff or the defendants. The \u2018\u2018preliminary findings\u201d lack any clearcut statement of fact based upon such testimony. These descriptions are, for the most part, couched in terms of what a doctor \u201ctestified,\u201d or are described as \u201ctestimony,\u201d or as constituting \u201cconflicting evidence.\u201d The duty of the auditor under the rule issued to him was to find facts and not to report evidence. <em>Spirito </em>v. <em>Capar, </em>337 Mass. 431, 432, and cases cited. See G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The preliminary findings go on to state that testimony was introduced to show the method of manufacture of the carton by American Can Company and the subsequent filling of the carton with milk by Hood at its East Bridge-water plant. We do not repeat the findings on these subjects because they are not material to the view we take of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u201cWhile the testimony on behalf of the defendants seems to indicate that it would be improbable for a mouse to be in the carton of milk at the time it was purchased by John Sullivan, I am satisfied that it was there at the time it was purchased. The fact that there was fecal matter within the milk confirms my feeling that the mouse was alive in the carton at some time prior to the introduction of milk into the carton. This can only lead to the inference that the defendant H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., was negligent in the packaging of its milk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Here follow \u201cUltimate findings of fact based upon the foregoing preliminary findings of fact. \u2019 \u2019 Some of these, as numbered by the auditor, are: 1. \u201c [T]he purchase of the carton of milk by John Sullivan was made for and on behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d 2. \u201c [T]here was an implied warranty of merchantability made by B. J. Lang Provision Company, Inc., in said sale.\u201d 3. \u201c [T]he milk so purchased was unmerchantable in that it contained a foreign substance, to wit: a dead mouse and fecal matter from the mouse.\u201d 4. <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>[T]here was a breach by B. J. Lang\u2019s Provision Company, Inc., of the implied warranty of merchantability.\u201d 5. <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>[A] s a result of the breach and by drinking the milk the plaintiff sustained injuries.\u201d 6. \u201c [AJs a result of drinking the milk the plaintiff suffered no deleterious effect from taking into her body the fecal matter and ... no serious bodily harm was caused her by such intake. \u201d 7. \u201c However . . . the plaintiff suffered a severe emotional shock when she saw the dead mouse in the milk, and she realized that she had drunk some of the fecal matter from a dead mouse, and ... as a result of such emotional shock she has developed a condition within her body which causes her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>break out into perspiration, which, in turn so irritates her skin that she has developed a rash over much of her body, and in addition has made her nervous and caused her blood pressure to be increased.\u201d 9. \u201c [T]he defendant H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., was negligent in filling with milk a carton containing a mouse.\u201d Findings 11 and 12 were noncumulative findings for the plaintiff in the sum of $4,000 on counts 1 and 2 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">At the jury trial the plaintiff introduced the auditor\u2019s report and evidence relating to notice to Lang of the alleged breach of warranty. There was testimony by the plaintiff\u2019s son that in a conversation he had with the president of Lang three or four days after she drank the milk he said that she had been made quite ill and that \u201cshe should bring suit because of that damage to her.\u201d A so called confirmatory letter dated April 27, 1954, from the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer to Lang was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence the defendants moved to strike the auditor\u2019s ultimate findings numbered 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, and 12 \u201cinasmuch as they are not warranted by his preliminary findings of fact\u201d on which they are based. The judge denied this motion as well as the defendants\u2019 motions for directed verdicts, and they excepted. Findings 0 and 11 relate to count 1 against Hood. The other findings which are the subject of the motion to strike concern count 2 against Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Before proceeding further, interpretation must be made of ultimate findings '5, 6, and 7. The sixth finding, read as a whole, means that the plaintiff was not harmed physically by actually drinking the milk. The first clause states flatly that she \u201csuffered no deleterious effect\u201d from ingesting the contents of the carton. The second clause refers, we think superfluously, to \u201cno serious bodily harm.\u201d If possible, the two clauses must be read as constituting intelligent consistency. If the plaintiff was not harmed, she was not seriously harmed. The sixth finding, taken in connection with the seventh, which begins \u201cHowever,\u201d shows that a distinction was intended to be drawn from the \u201csevere emo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tional shock\u201d which she suffered \u201cwhen she saw the dead mouse in the milk. \u2019 \u2019 The fifth finding has to do with breach of warranty and necessarily refers exclusively to count 2. The statement that \u201cby drinking the milk the plaintiff sustained injuries\u201d must refer to the \u201csevere emotional shock\u201d mentioned in the seventh finding, and is not to be reasonably understood as creating a conflict with the sixth finding, which immediately follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We shall not pause to discuss the question of the negligence of Hood. For purposes of this case, we shall assume that such negligence could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">This brings us to the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s recovery is prevented by the principle stated in <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R. </em>168 Mass. 285, 290: \u201cWe remain satisfied with the rule that there can be no recovery for fright, terror, alarm, anxiety, or distress of mind, if these are unaccompanied by some physical injury; and if this rule is to stand, we think it should also be held that there can be no recovery for such physical injuries as may be caused solely by such mental disturbance, where there is no injury to the person from without.\u201d This rule has been subjected to considerable refinements. In <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>180 Mass. 456, where recovery was allowed for a slight injury and an accompanying nervous shock due to the same cause, Chief Justice Holmes said (p. 457) that the <em>Spade </em>doctrine \u201cis an arbitrary exception, based upon a notion of what is practicable, that prevents a recovery for visible illness resulting from nervous shock alone.\u201d See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co. of Mass. </em>174 Mass. 576, 577-578. In <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>182 Mass. 310, 312, it was again Chief Justice Holmes who said: \u201cThe principle of the <em>Spade </em>case is confined strictly to cases where the connection of the physical illness with the fright is wholly internal. When the fright reasonably induces action which results in external injury, the defendant may be liable as well as when the impact is brought about with-I out the intervention of the plaintiff\u2019s consciousness.\u201d I<em>n Freedman </em>v. <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. </em>299 Mass. 246, recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>was permitted Tby a passenger who suddenly twisted her shoulder when she jumped from her seat to escape impending danger from a broken window. After a full citation of our cases, Mr. Justice Dolan said for the court (p. 250): \u201cWe are of opinion that it cannot be said as matter of law that a blow or impact must be shown to prove a physical injury from without. The phrase \u2018from without\u2019 as used in our cases excludes purely psychological or emotional consequences when they stand alone, but includes all physical injury not resulting solely from mental shock or emotional disturbances. The question, therefore, in each such case is whether the physical injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s negligence is in fact one which was not caused solely by mental disturbances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The last two of our cases applying the <em>Spade </em>rule were for breaches of warranty in the sale of food. In <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Balestri, 304 </em>Mass. 257, the recovery of other than nominal damages was denied in an action for breach of warranty by a purchaser of bread who became ill as a result solely of psychological and emotional disturbances caused by seeing a dead cockroach embedded in half a slice of bread she was about to eat and the other half of which she had just eaten. In <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Brockelman Bros. Inc. </em>334 Mass. 225, 227, it was held error not to grant a request for instructions to the effect that \u201cthe plaintiff cannot recover for any physical injury she sustained solely by her mental disturbance upon seeing a worm contained in the com sold by the defendant.\u201d There was evidence, by which the defendant was not bound, that the plaintiff had in fact swallowed half the worm. The request was pertinent to a state of facts which the jury might find.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We have not been asked to overrule the <em>Spade </em>case, and we are not disposed to do so. What we have been asked to do is to draw a distinction on the ground that swallowing fecal matter of a mouse constituted a \u2018 \u2018battery. \u2019 \u2019 Reliance is placed upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>114 Mass. 303, where there was an intentional act amounting to the crime of assault and battery. In modern law \u2018 \u2018 the tort of battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>is now confined to intentional invasions of the interests in freedom from harmful or offensive contact.\u201d Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 3.3, p. 216. See <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>297 Mass. 323; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 13,14. We are not dealing with a battery, and we are unwilling to hold that the plaintiff suffered an injury \u201cfrom without.\u201d No case of ours has gone to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">What we have said disposes of the Hood count. The motion of that defendant for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">There are other questions arising in the Lang count. If there was a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, nominal damages could be recovered in any event. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Balestri, </em>304 Mass. 257, 259. Consequently, there was no error in the denial of the motion for a directed verdict. <em>Nathan </em>v. <em>Tremont Storage Warehouse, Inc. </em>328 Mass. 168, 171, and cases cited. <em>Rayden Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Church, </em>337 Mass. 652, 662n. But the issue of substantial damages was presented by the motion to strike. It is clear, however, from what we have said as to the Hood count, that the plaintiff cannot recover more than nominal damages against Lang.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Under the Sales Act, which is applicable, an action for breach of warranty can be brought only by the one to whom the warranty was given. <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">317 Mass. 529, 530-531.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was an issue of fact whether the plaintiff or her son was the purchaser. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Brockelman Bros. Inc. </em>334 Mass. 225, 227. The defendant Lang contends that the auditor\u2019s ultimate finding that the son made the purchase upon behalf of the plaintiff was not correct upon the basis of the preliminary findings. Where there is nothing at stake but nominal damages, we shall not labor the point. See <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn. Inc. </em>303 Mass. 602, 603, and cases cited; <em>United Shoe Mach. Corp. </em>v. <em>Gale Shoe Mfg. Co. </em>314 Mass. 142, 143 ; 4 C. J. S., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Appeal &amp; Error, \u00a7 53. We think that the ultimate finding of agency may be upheld. See <em>Groce </em>v. <em>First Natl. Stores Inc. </em>268 Mass. 210, 213. Similarly, we do not extend discussion as to notice of breach of warranty under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The conversation between the president of Lang and the plaintiff\u2019s son could be found to be a seasonable compliance with \u00a7 38. <em>Master craft Wayside Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Sightmaster Corp. </em>332 Mass. 383, 387. The admission of the letter was at most harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The exceptions are sustained. On count 1 judgment is to be entered for the defendant. On count 2 judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-13\"><em> </em>The relevant provision of the Uniform Commercial Code is G-.
