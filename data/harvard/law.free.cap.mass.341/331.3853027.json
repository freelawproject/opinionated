See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 12). The judge\u2019s decision reversed a decision of the division\u2019s board of review denying unemployment benefits to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1. The judge correctly overruled the director\u2019s answer in abatement asserting that the petitioner had failed to comply with the statutory conditions precedent to judicial review. On January 28, 1959, the petitioner filed in the District Court a petition for judicial review. On February 10, 1959, an order of notice issued. General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 42, was amended by St. 1951, c. 763, \u00a7 18, after the decision in <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>327 Mass. 360, 362-363, to provide, \u201cUpon the filing of a petition for review by an aggrieved party other than the director, the clerk of the district court within seven days thereafter shall issue an order of notice. \u2019 \u2019 The failure to comply with the statute was that of the clerk and not of the petitioner. Nothing in the amendment deprives the District Court of jurisdiction of the petition merely because of improper delay in issuing the order of notice on the part of a public official over whom the petitioner had no control. The present case is governed by the <em>Weiner </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">2. The review examiner\u2019s decision became the final decision of the division\u2019s board of review. He approved the decision of the director disqualifying the petitioner from receiving unemployment benefits upon his claim filed on September 16, 1958, because of the provisions of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25, as amended through St. 1956, c. 719, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 25 reads in part, \u201cNo waiting period shall be allowed and no benefits shall be paid . . . for (e) The period of unemployment next ensuing . . . [subject to further provisions not here relevant] after he [the employee] has left his work . . . (2) by discharge shown to the satisfaction of the director to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The review examiner found that the petitioner, in June, 1958, \u201cwas laid off for a five-days period and was paid three days\u2019 vacation pay for which he qualified due to his length of service. \u2019 \u2019 He did not report for work on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ber 3, 4, 7, and 8, and asserted \u201cthat he had received permission from his supervisor to be absent on those days for vacation purposes.\u201d The examiner concluded, \u201cThe vacation taken ... in September . . . was one without pay and, under the union contract, he should have made a request in writing for this vacation. He did not [do so] nor did he work and he was discharged, and . . . such discharge was due to deliberate misconduct on his part in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d The discharge was clearly based on the employee\u2019s failure to report for work on four days in September. The findings of fact included in these portions of the examiner\u2019s report had substantial support in the evidence. See <em>Western Elec. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>340 Mass. 190, 192. The District Court judge reversed the board\u2019s decision on the ground that the decision \u201cwas based upon an error of law in that the [union] contract . . . does not contain a provision to the effect that an employee who desires a vacation without pay shall make his request in writing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The union contract contains the following pertinent provisions. Article V, \u00a7 2, provides, \u201cSeniority shall be lost for . . . e. Failure to report the cause of absence from work within three (3) days from start of such absence.\u201d Article VI, \u00a7 8, reads, \u201cAny employee unable to report for work shall notify the company before the start of the shift whenever possible. Repeated violations will subject the employee to disciplinary action.\u201d Article VII, \u201cLeaves of Absence,\u201d \u00a7 1, reads in part, \u201cLeaves of absence may be granted without pay on written request of an employee up to one year and no seniority shall be lost by taking such approved leave.\u201d Article X, \u201cVacations,\u201d \u00a7 1, \u201cVacation Provisions,\u201d reads in part, \u201cThe company will grant paid vacations to all employees coming under the terms of this agreement in accordance with the following provisions: [then follows a schedule of amounts of vacation allowable to employees based upon seniority and hours of work during stated periods].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Unless the matter is covered by art. VII, relating to leaves of absence, there appears to be no specific provision in the union contract governing \u201cvacation [s] without pay\u201d as distinguished (if there is, indeed, any such distinction) from \u201cleaves of absence . . . without pay.\u201d In the absence of such a provision the examiner committed no error of law in regarding the employee\u2019s September absence as one for which written application should have been made under art. VII, \u00a7 1. Even though in his decision the examiner referred to the absence as \u201ca vacation without pay\u201d he was plainly using the term as one having the same substantive meaning as \u201cleave of absence.\u201d See <em>Moen </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>324 Mass. 246, 249, where the terms \u201ca vacation without pay\u201d and \u201cleave of absence\u201d are used interchangeably as meaning the same thing. See also <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Young, </em>63 F. Supp. 890, 891 (D. Dist. Col.); <em>Dauber\u2019s Case, </em>151 Pa. Super. 293, 296-297; <em>Mattey </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>164 Pa. Super. 36, 37, 39; <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>177 Pa. Super. 49, 52. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Akron Civil Serv. Commn. </em>95 Ohio App. 385, 389-392, in which the term \u201cleave of absence,\u201d in the particular context, may have been used primarily in reference to permitted absences of substantial duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The review examiner was not required to believe (see <em>Olechnicky </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>325 Mass. 660, 662-663) or to give controlling effect to testimony tending to show (a) that the employee obtained oral approval of his September absences, or (b) that officials of the company, either habitually or in this instance, may have treated a short absence from work as different from a \u201cleave of absence\u201d and as not within the requirement of art. VII, \u00a7 1, that there be written application for a leave of absence without pay, or (c) that the employee complied with art. V, \u00a7 2, by reporting his absence within three days from its commencement and obtained approval of it, or (d) that in this instance there was some form of oral waiver of the provisions of art. VII, \u00a7 1, by representatives of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>3. Since the examiner\u2019s findings, adopted by the review board, were supported by substantial evidence and his conclusions were not based on any error of law, the board\u2019s decision should have been affirmed by the District Court. The decision of the District Court is reversed. A decision is to be ent\u00e9red adjudging the decision of the board to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> Later amendments of the section, not here applicable, are found in St. 1958, c. 677, which became effective on October 27, 1958, after the present claim was filed, and in St. 1959, c. 533, and St. 1959, c. 554.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
