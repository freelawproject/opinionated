J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1j\">In this action of contract in two counts, each by a different plaintiff to recover upon an \u201cunsecured debenture,\u201d the judge sustained a demurrer and, staying further proceedings, reported his ruling to this court. Gr. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Count 1 alleges that the defendant for a consideration executed and delivered to the plaintiff Muchnick an \u201cunsecured debenture\u201d in the principal sum of $12,500, the due date of which is June 1, 1954; and that after maturity the plaintiff demanded payment, which was not made. Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>2 alleges that the plaintiff George B. Rittenberg is the owner of the same debenture, and that it was originally issued to Muehnick and by him assigned to the plaintiff Rittenberg, who is the registered owner, and who after maturity demanded payment, which was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The debenture, bearing the identification \u201cNo. 10,\u201d is a lengthy document filling three pages in the printed record. It is entitled \u201cUnsecured Debenture Due June 1,1954 Subordinated as Set Forth Below,\u201d and is dated at Boston June 26, 1958. We quote pertinent provisions. [1] The defendant \u201cpromises to pay to Isadore H. Y. Muehnick assignee by mesne assignments of an interest in original debenture No. 2, or registered assigns\u201d at the office of the company \u201con June 1,1954, except as hereinafter provided\u201d the sum of $12,500 without interest. [2] \u201cThis debenture is one of a series of debentures originally issued August 19, 1947, aggregating $233,300 all of which are issued without priority or preference one over the other, and are being issued, received and held subject to the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter contained.\u201d [3] The debenture is redeemable at any time before maturity at the option of the defendant. \u201cExcept with the consent in writing of the registered owners of all outstanding debentures issued for said $233,300, the company shall not redeem or retire any of its debentures except on a pro rata basis among the registered owners of all of said outstanding debentures. [4] This debenture is issued . . . upon the condition that it is subject and subordinate to bank obligations of the company as maker, endorser or guarantor, now or at any time hereafter outstanding, and to the prior payment in full of principal and interest on the following notes of the company, (a) A note of $400,000 to Elias M. Lowe [sic] dated July 16, 1947. (b) A note of $100,000 to Julius L. Shack dated July 16, 1947. Said notes . . . are secured by a first mortgage of $500,000 on the land and buildings of the company situated in Foxboro, Norfolk County, Massachusetts. (c) A note dated August 18, 1947, for $200,000 payable to Norfolk County Concessionaires, Inc., and assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to Elias M. Loew, said note being secured by a second mortgage on the said land and buildings of the company .in said Foxboro. (d) A note for $50,000 and two notes for $25,000 each, all dated August 18, 1947, payable to Paul F. Bowser . . . said three notes being secured by a third mortgage of $100,000 on said land and buildings of the company in said Foxboro. [5] This debenture is also subject and subordinate to all unpaid debts incurred by the company for operating expenses, whether represented by open account, negotiable or non-negotiable promissory notes, secured or unsecured, or other form of writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">There were two identical grounds of demurrer to each count. The first ground quoted from paragraphs 4 and 5 and set forth that the count \u201cfails to allege either the performance or excuse from performance of all of the aforesaid conditions to which payment of the debenture is expressly made subject, namely, the prior payment in full of bank obligations, three mortgage notes of the defendant in the total face amount of $800,000, and all unpaid debts incurred by the defendant for operating expenses.\u201d The second ground set up legal insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The principal question is whether the language, read as a whole, merely gives certain creditors of the defendant a preference in the order of payment or whether there are words which create a condition precedent to the right of a plaintiff to maintain his action. If prior payment of any of the designated obligations is a condition precedent, its performance or the reason for nonperformance should have been alleged in the declaration, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 7, Twelfth, and the demurrer was rightly sustained. See <em>Mirachnick </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>294 Mass. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The debenture is in a form peculiar to itself. Although it is dated more than four years later, its title gives a due date of June 1, 1954, \u201cSubordinated as Set Forth Below.\u201d We are unable to attribute great significance to the difference in dates. \u201cNo. 10\u201d is one of a series \u201coriginally issued August 19,1947. \u201d We cannot be sure whether there was a new edition of a form of debenture due June 1,1954, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>or whether \u201cNo. 10\u201d was individually prepared in its entirety on June 26,1958. We reject the contentions that the retention of the date of June 1, 1954, was an acknowledgment that an overdue instrument was issued on June 26, 1958, and that the only need to retain a past \u201cdue\u201d date was for the purpose of computing interest from a maturity date which had gone by. No explanation is suggested why, on that hypothesis, the provision for redemption before maturity (paragraph 3) was retained. Certainly a more cumbersome method of stating a simple arithmetical fact could hardly be imagined. A much more reasonable inference is that all the debentures in the series were to be kept uniform so far as possible. They were \u201cissued without priority or preference one over the other\u201d (paragraph 2). The defendant, except with the consent of all registered holders, could redeem or retire the debentures only on a pro rata basis (paragraph 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Another reason why the title does not indicate an unconditional maturity date of June 1, 1954, is that such a construction would ignore the words \u201cexcept as hereinafter provided\u201d in the paragraph qualifying the efficient verb \u201cpromises to pay\u201d (paragraph 1). It would also be unacceptable oversimplification. An equally unacceptable oversimplification, looking in the contrary direction, would be to base an interpretation of a conditional maturity date solely upon the statement in paragraph 2 that the debenture is held \u201csubject to the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter contained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The plaintiffs, in effect, make the argument that the total effect of all the language is to subordinate the debenture to other obligations of the defendant. The other obligations are of three general categories. The debenture was issued \u201cupon the condition that it is subject and subordinate [A] to bank obligations,\u201d present or future, and [B] \u201cto the prior payment in full of principal and interest\u201d of six mortgage notes dated in 1947 (paragraph 4); and [C] \u201cis also subject and subordinate to all unpaid debts . . . for operating expenses\u201d (paragraph 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We assume, but\u25a0 without'deciding, that the words \u201cSubordinated,\u201d \u201csubject to,\u201d and \u201csubject and subordinate to,\u201d by themselves, in the circumstances do not create a condition precedent. But it is clear to us that \u2018 \u2018 subject and subordinate to,\u201d when read with \u201cthe prior payment\u201d of the mortgage notes, does create a condition precedent as to those notes. In this connection we are of opinion that \u201cprior\u201d clearly means prior in time and not prior in right; and, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, that it does not relate to priority in right in case of insufficiency of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The plaintiffs lay some stress upon the word \u201calso\u201d in paragraph 5. The phrase, \u201calso subject and subordinate to all unpaid debts,\u201d it is contended, shows that all three types of indebtedness are treated alike. This argument overlooks the fact that the only other use of \u201csubject and subordinate to\u201d relates both to \u201cbank obligations\u201d and to 1 \u2018 prior payment \u2019 \u2019 of the mortgage notes.- There is no repetition of \u201csubject and subordinate to\u201d as to the mortgage notes alone. We believe that this argument emphasizes the importance of the phrase \u201cprior payment,\u201d and that its absence elsewhere and its presence here are significant. After all, if in the distribution of assets there was subordination of the debenture to the three classes of indebtedness to which it was subject, the words \u201cprior payment\u201d would be meaningless surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The plaintiffs contend that since the defendant\u2019s undertaking was to pay the principal amount \u201con June 1, 1954, except as hereinafter provided,\u201d it falls within statements in <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>313 Mass. 557, \u201cwhere the exception is not stated in terms, but is mentioned ... in the clause of the contract describing the defendant\u2019s duty or obligation by reference ... to some other subsequent or prior clause of the . . . contract ...\u201d (pages 563-564), and where the defendant must plead or prove facts coming within the exception (page 565). The present case, however, more closely resembles the situation described in other language of the <em>Murray </em>case. At page 561, there is reference to a form of policy where \u201cthe words \u2018except as herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>provided\u2019 appearing in the insuring clause ... are sufficient to import into the insuring clause a description of the risks mentioned in the \u2018Hazards not covered\u2019 clause so that exclusion of such risks is made a part and parcel of the description of the coverage in the insuring clause itself to the same extent as if they were expressly and specifically written in said \u2022 clause .... In that event, the insuring clause itself would fully, completely and definitely fix the extent of the coverage, and the insured would have to prove that the loss arose from a risk included in the coverage as thus established and thus limited.\u201d Nothing contrary to our holding appears in <em>Corbett </em>v. <em>Derman Shoe Co. </em>338 Mass. 405, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The presence of a comma between \u201cJune 1, 1954\u201d and \u201cexcept\u201d is of no significance on the issue of interpretation. This is approved punctuation in giving the full date. A Uniform System of Citation (10th ed.) p. 102 (Harv. L. Rev. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">An argument would not be valid that the debenture should not be construed as containing a condition precedent because the information as to payment is better known to the defendant. Proof in the present case is less arduous for either plaintiff than would be proof of a promise to pay when able. The latter promise is conditional and enforceable only on proof that the ability exists. <em>Randidge </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>124 Mass. 361, 364. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Graham Refrigeration Prod. Co. Inc. </em>333 Mass. 181, 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The first ground of demurrer in so far as it refers to the mortgage notes is good.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">It is unnecessary to consider whether count 1 is also demurrable for failure to allege that the plaintiff in that count is the registered holder of the debenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
