Jensen was killed by an automobile operated by the defendant. In this action of tort brought by Jensen\u2019s administratrix to recover for his death, the defendant had a verdict. The case comes here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to several rulings on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">1. One of the issues was whether Jensen was intoxicated at the time of the accident. One Turner, a taxi driver called by the defendant, testified that on the day of the accident he drove Jensen from Malden to a sanitarium in Acton; that during the trip Jensen stopped at a liquor store and purchased three half pints of whiskey; and that Jensen upon returning to the cab \u201ctook one drink and it came out of his nose . . . and went all over the front of the cab.\u201d Counsel for the defendant then asked the witness whether Jensen \u201cthrew up in the taxicab after he had that drink\u201d and the answer was \u201cNo.\u201d Counsel then put before the witness two sheets of paper and said, <em>\u20181 </em>See if it will refresh your recollection.\u201d. The papers shown to the witness contained a statement made by him over his signature. The witness then testified that the statement refreshed his recollection and that Jensen \u201cthrew up\u201d in the cab. Before the witness was shown the statement counsel for the plaintiff asked to see it but the judge denied the request, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception. During the cross-examination of the witness plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no attempt to inspect the statement. There was no error. The point is governed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557, where it was said at page 581, \u2018 \u2018 There was no error in the denial of requests by the defendants that they be permitted to inspect the statements before their submission to the witnesses. While a writing which has been used to refresh the recollection of a witness may be examined by the opposing party to enable him by cross-examination to raise the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>tian whether it is a proper memorandum for the purpose, . . . he is not entitled to inspect the writing before it has been shown to the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The contention that the foregoing examination amounted to an impeachment by the defendant of his own witness, in violation of Gr. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">2. During his argument, counsel for the defendant stated, \u201cNo witnesses were brought in to show where the deceased was.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff objected, and upon being asked by the judge the ground of his objection, stated, \u201cFor commenting on the failure to bring in witnesses . . . here unless he shows some witnesses who are available to me.\u201d The judge then told the defendant\u2019s counsel to proceed with his argument, and the plaintiff excepted. The foregoing is all that the record shows with respect to this exception. The setting and context of the statement complained of do not appear. We are of opinion that no prejudicial error has been shown. The statement objected to, fairly construed, does no more than state that there were no witnesses as to the whereabouts of the deceased; it was merely a statement of fact. It did not ask the jury to draw an adverse inference because of the absence of such witnesses. Cases such as <em>McGeorge </em>v. <em>Grand Realty Trust, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 373, 377-378, and <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>Bokron, </em>337 Mass. 739, 743-744, involving comment on the failure to produce specific witnesses not shown to be available, are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">3. One Scribner, a police officer of the town of Acton, testified without objection that Route 2A (on which the accident occurred) was a \u201cposted road\u201d and that there were signs on the road indicating that the speed limit was forty-five miles per hour. In his argument counsel for the defendant stated, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, \u201cYou will see the sign here [referring to a photograph] covered as it is here by snow but the officer told us that this sign shows \u2018Speed limit forty-five.\u2019 In other words, the law says that you can drive up to forty-five miles an hour and be within the law. \u2019 \u2019 The plaintiff urges that this argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was improper because the defendant failed to establish that the road was lawfully posted. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 18. But in view of the testimony of the police officer which got into the case without objection we think that the argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">4. In his argument counsel for the defendant said, \u201cRules and regulations promulgated by the Registry of Motor Vehicles under the law has certain things to say about brakes and let me read you this.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff objected on the ground that the rules had not been put in evidence. The judge overruled the objection and, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, defendant\u2019s counsel was permitted to read the \u201cprescribed rules as to the distance within which an automobile should stop going at forty miles an hour.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that the \u201crules and regulations\u201d from which defendant\u2019s counsel read had not been put in evidence. Since they could not be judicially noticed <em>(Passanessi </em>v. <em>C. J. Maney Co. Inc. </em>340 Mass. 599, 604), it was error to permit them to be read. But we are of opinion that the error, from anything appearing in this record, cannot be said to have \u201cinjuriously affected the substantial rights\u201d of the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-13\">Although described as \u201cprescribed rules,\u201d it seems more likely that these were not in fact rules but a table showing the distance that a ear ordinarily would travel at given speeds after the brakes were applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
