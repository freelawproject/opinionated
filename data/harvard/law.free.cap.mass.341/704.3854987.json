In the Municipal Court the petition was denied, and the petitioner appealed to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">A petition to vacate judgment must be brought in the court in which was entered the judgment sought to be vacated. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 250, \u00a7 15. As the present petition was filed in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston by requirement of statute, the present appeal lay to the Superior Court. <em>Hopkinton </em>v. <em>B. F. Sturtevant Co. </em>285 Mass. 272, 275. See <em>Lynn Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Creditors Natl. Clearing House, </em>235 Mass. 114, 115. The case was to \u201cbe there tried and determined as if originally commenced there.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">In the Superior Court the following order was entered: \u201cAfter hearing petition allowed. Judgment vacated, default removed upon the filing of a sufficient surety company bond in the sum of one hundred dollars ... within ten days. \u2019 \u2019 The judge denied six requests for rulings of the respondent. The respondent filed a claim of exceptions stating that he \u201cexcepts to the finding of the court entered on April 13, 1959, allowing the petition to vacate judgment and removing the default upon the filing of sufficient surety bond in the sum of $100 within ten days.\u201d He also excepted to the denial of his requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">The exception to the finding raises no question of law. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Bottomly, ante, </em>page 701. The granting of the petition \u201crests largely although not exclusively in the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>278 Mass. 145, 148, and cases cited. There was sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement that the petitioner must have a meritorious defence worthy of a trial in court. <em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Kane, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>310 Mass. 457, 460. The judge could have based such a finding upon the pendency of a suit in equity in the Superior Court brought by the petitioner against the respondent, Ward Bayfield, and others involving the subject matter of the case at bar, in which an injunction was issued and outstanding. The judge needed to look no further than the respondent\u2019s answer filed in the Superior Court on July 7, 1958, where he alleged \u201cthat levy was made on the real estate attachments, but sale was continued because the petitioner brought a bill in equity alleging to the equity court that he could not defend this action in the law court or get the law court to give him any relief as the law court was barred by Gr. L. e. 231, \u00a7 31, petitioner making election to defend in equity court, and as a result his only defence, if any, would be in equity court. That the equity court took jurisdiction and issued a restraining order allowing levy to be made in <em>[sic] </em>the execution, but suspended sale of said parcels until the bill in equity be decided in said court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Much of the argument in the respondent\u2019s brief is too sketchy to deserve more than brief disposition. He argues only two requests by number. The first request<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resembles a request for a finding of fact. If treated as somehow a request for a ruling of law, it is a request for a ruling contrary to what we have hereinbefore said, and could not have been granted. The second request,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by way of contrast with the first, seems to ask a ruling that the defence to the original action must be certain of success. <em>Hyde Park Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Davankoskas, </em>298 Mass. 421, 422. Compare <em>Mellet </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>269 Mass. 173, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The third and fifth requests to the effect that the judge would not be warranted in finding that the petitioner had a good defence or any defence, respectively, present no new question. The fourth request based in part upon \u201cIgnorance of the petitioner or his counsel in failing to appear at the trial of the original action\u201d assumes facts which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>judge would not have been warranted in finding. The only testimony was that no notice of marking for trial had been sent the petitioner. Nor is ignorance a bar as matter of law. See <em>ManZi </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>278 Mass. 267, 273-274; <em>Kravets </em>v. <em>Lipofsky, </em>294 Mass. 80, 85. The sixth request is unintelligible, and does not appear to be argued. The requests were all rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The only exception as to which the respondent\u2019s argument consists of more than one or two sentences relates to an exception to what the respondent contends was a ruling by the judge during the cross-examination of the lawyer who had represented the petitioner in the original action. The colloquy was as follows: \u201cQ. There wasn\u2019t any question or issue as to the balance due on the note, the first mortgage note? A. I wouldn\u2019t say that. Q. What was the question \u2014 as to the amount due on the first mortgage note to the Federal Home Savings and Loan? The judge : We are not going to try the merits of that first case. I am concerned only with the entry of judgment and the appeal on it. Counsel fob the bespondent : Tour Honor, I want to offer proof that his answer would be that this bank, the Federal Home Owners Loan and Savings Association, had given to Mr. Kaufman and Anderson, who were the defendants\u2014 The judge : You can make your offer of proof. It makes no difference at all, in my final, ultimate judgment on the matter that is before me; and no other matter will be heard here at this time. Counsel fob the respondent: This is merely \u2014 I want to try to apprise Your Honor \u2014 this is merely on the question of the merits of the case. The judge : I am not hearing the question of the merits in the original case. Counsel fob the respondent: Will Your Honor save my rights, my exception? The judge: You can have all your rights you want to save. Q-o ahead.\u201d The only question asked was the amount due on the note, a matter with which the judge, as we interpret what happened, stated that he was not concerned. He did not make any general ruling when he stated that he was not hearing the merits in the original case (see <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Penn Mut. Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>222 Mass. 382, 385; <em>Grandell </em>v. Short, 317 Mass. 605, 608), although that would not have been error. Much less did he make any ruling that the petitioner did not have to show he had a meritorious defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> \u201c1.
