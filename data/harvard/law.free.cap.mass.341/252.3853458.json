A demurrer was overruled. A master\u2019s report was favorable to Construction. The Daggetts filed motions to recommit the report (a) to require additional subsidiary findings; (b) to make certain findings; (c) to report portions of the evidence ; and (d) to make further summaries of the evidence with respect to certain objections. An affidavit of counsel suggested what \u201cwould be brief, fair, and accurate summaries of evidence under Rule 90 of the Superior Court\u201d (1954). See <em>Cantor </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>325 Mass. 719, 721. By counter affidavit, Construction\u2019s counsel submitted corrections of these suggested summaries. The motions to recommit were denied, together with motions to dismiss the bill and to discharge the reference to the master. An interlocutory decree was entered overruling the Daggetts \u2019 exceptions and confirming the report. From all these interlocutory decrees, and from a final decree ordering specific performance, the Daggetts have appealed. The facts are stated on the basis of the master\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Daggett owned the real estate (the locus), described in the agreement. He operated a wholesale lobster business on ten acres of land nearby. On January 31,1957, Daggett talked with John DeMatteo of Construction and a broker and sent them to an attorney, Mr. Davis, to discuss leasing the locus, part of which was used for dumping. The next day Mr. Davis and Daggett went over the situation. On February 3, Daggett told Mr. Davis that he \u201cdid not want to lease, but rather wanted to sell.\u201d On February 5, Daggett discussed with Mr. Davis \u201cthe net [tax] result if he should sell, and whether he should sell for cash or on an instalment basis,\u201d and also the expense for brokers\u2019 commissions. Daggett stated \u201cthat he could not run two businesses, that he was extremely tired and would have to give up either the lobster ... or the dumping business.\u201d He pointed out that the \u201clobster business was so precarious no one would buy it, so he would have to stay in that and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sell the dump.\u201d He authorized Mr. Davis to sell for $1,250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Mr. Davis explained the situation to DeMatteo, who said he would prefer a lease, but when informed that \u201cit was either a sale or nothing\u201d DeMatteo offered $800,000, later raised to $1,000,000. Various matters, such as interest, were adjusted in negotiations, which Mr. Davis reported to Daggett who said, \u201cSell it. \u2019 \u2019 The agreement was drawn by Mr. Davis and counsel for Construction and \u201cwas handed to Mr. Davis to get . . . Daggett\u2019s signature.\u201d Mr. Davis on February 7 took the agreement to Daggett and his wife, who both signed it \" after they had gone over it with Mr. Davis for over an hour.\u201d The agreements were delivered on February 8 and a certified deposit check was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Prior to February 7, Daggett \u201chad been complaining about his health . . . [was] tired and in a state of depression.\u201d He had been released from a hospital on January 25, where he had been for examination by a Dr. Thorpe, who advised Daggett \u201cto see a psychiatrist.\u201d Dr. Thorpe thought \u201cDaggett\u2019s judgment was impaired.\u201d A few weeks later Daggett consulted a psychiatrist. All this was unknown to Construction\u2019s representatives on February 7 and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">On February 9 and 10, Daggett complained to Mr. Davis of the contract which he had made and \u201cwas critical of Mr. Davis for having permitted him to enter into the deal. \u2019 \u2019 On February 12, Mr. Davis, purporting to speak for the Daggetts, wrote to Construction, that \" [w]e now desire to cancel this agreement . . . without any of us having any recourse against any other party.\u201d The letter proposed return of the deposit, payment of $10,000 by Daggett to Construction as damages, and a seven day option to Construction to purchase the land on the terms of any acceptable offer later made to Daggett.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">On March 19, \u201cthere was a telephone conversation between . . . Mr. Snyder [attorney for Construction] and Mr. Davis, at which time Mr. Snyder . . . learned for the first time that . . . Daggett was ill and . . . would be unable to take part in any business discussions or transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tians for ... at least six weeks.\u201d One of the DeMatteos had been told on February 12 of Daggett\u2019s illness. On March 20, Mr. Davis wrote to Mr. Snyder that \u201cit is my suggestion that any . . . matters pending between . . . [Daggett] and your . . . client remain as is until . . . Daggett\u2019s recovery is to a point where his doctor sanctions his resumption of business matters. \u2019 \u2019 Mr. Snyder, the next day, agreed that all matters should remain \u201cin statu quo for ... six weeks [which, of course, would expire about May 1]. I assume [that] you will communicate with me on or before expiration of that time. \u2019 \u2019 In the meantime, on March 15, at a conference with Mr. Snyder and Martin DeMatteo, Mr. Davis had received from Construction three proposals for settling the matter, which Mr. Davis undertook to discuss with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Mr. Snyder \u201cwould call Mr. Davis from time to time as the date [May 7] for passing papers set forth in the agreement approached.\u201d On May 22, Mr. Davis wrote to Mr. Snyder that Daggett\u2019s \u201cdoctor forbids him to attempt to transact any business . . . for at least the next month . . .. Mrs. Daggett concurs that . . . the time for performance of the agreement . . . should be considered as . . . postponed to a date not earlier than July 7.\u201d Construction\u2019s counsel on May 27 agreed that \u201call pending matters, agreements and offers ... be postponed to July 7. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Subsequent to the May 22 letter, Mr. Snyder made inquiries from time to time of Mr. Davis and was told on each occasion that \u201cDaggett was not physically able to transact business and that he would communicate with Mr. Snyder when the time arrived for relations to be resumed between the parties.\u201d On June 7, \u201cDaggett returned to business for a half day, and thereafter\u201d increased the \u201ctime spent at his business.\u201d Further inquiries were made by Mr. Snyder on July 1 and 2. Mr. Davis could not be reached from July 3 to 7. On July 3, Mr. Snyder wrote to Mr. Davis to inquire whether Mr. Davis had completed a title search on the property which Mr. Snyder said Mr. Davis had undertaken to make for Construction and asking him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>arrange any necessary postponement. Mr. Davis received this letter on Monday, July 8, when new counsel for the Daggetts became associated with Mr. Davis. No deeds to convey the locus that day were prepared by Mr. Davis and neither Mr. Snyder nor Mr. Davis went to either of the two registries of deeds (Essex and Suffolk) to make tender, although Mr. Davis checked by telephone to see whether Mr. Snyder was there. Mr. Davis did not get in touch with Mr. Snyder on July 8, but on July 10 he notified Construction by mail of \u201cDaggett\u2019s decision to rescind this agreement\u201d and offered to return the deposit check. On July 12, Mr. Snyder replied, reciting past events and saying that Ms client was \u201cdesirous of taking title\u201d to the locus and had \u201cbeen awaiting only the results of your title examination and . . . Daggett\u2019s recovery for the actual setting of the date for passing papers.\u201d On July 24, Daggett\u2019s new counsel wrote that it was Daggett\u2019s \u201cposition . . . that the agreement dated February 7 . . . stands rescinded.\u201d The bill for specific performance was initiated on August 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">1. The Daggetts contend that Construction failed to tender performance when due and has shown no excuse for such failure. The master concluded that \u201cevery act of the . . . [Daggetts] or their attorneys . . . after February 7 . . . indicated a firm purpose to avoid the agreement even though the . . . [Daggetts] were to pay damages\u201d and that representation of Construction on July 8 at the registries of deeds would have been \u201can empty . . . gesture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Mr. Davis\u2019s letter of February 12 offered cancellation of the agreement on terms. A possible cancellation remained the subject of negotiation thereafter. On March 15, Mr. Davis informed Mr. Snyder that \u201cDaggett is now set against going through with the agreement\u201d and sought to work out \u201csome other arrangement\u201d about which Construction then made proposals. On March 20 and 21, the attorneys reasonably arranged to keep the matter in statu quo pending Daggett\u2019s recovery. The attorneys talked by telephone on April 25, May 9, May 14, and May 20. From the letter of May 22 (Mr. Davis to Mr. Snyder) and the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ply of May 27, it is reasonable to infer that Mr. Davis had informed Mr. Snyder by May 7, the day set in the agreement for conveyance, that Daggett would not then be in a position either to convey or to consider Construction\u2019s March 15 settlement proposals. The exchange of letters confirmed that performance would not be sought prior to July 7. Since July 7 was a Sunday, this meant not before July 8. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 9. By that time there had been no final indication of any action by or in behalf of Daggett upon Construction\u2019s March 15 proposals. Indeed, it was only on July 2 that Mr. Davis even told Mr. Snyder that Daggett \u201cwas back in business for an hour or two a day.\u201d Although Mr. Davis promised to call Mr. Snyder the next day after consulting his client, Mr. Snyder did not hear from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In the circumstances, Mr. Davis\u2019s conduct over the months from February 12 to July 8 reasonably led Construction\u2019s representatives to understand, at least until July 2, that Daggett was unable to transact business, that matters were to be held in abeyance until he was able to act, that he wanted to negotiate an alternative arrangement, that he was not yet ready to negotiate or to perform, and that Construction would be notified when he was ready. On the facts found, it would be inequitable, even though the agreement provided that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d (cf. <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Wiles, </em>221 Mass. 75, 81-82), to treat Construction as obliged to make tender on July 8, in the absence of seasonable notice by Daggett or Mr. Davis to Construction\u2019s representatives that performance was to take place on July 8. See <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Rule, </em>331 Mass. 664, 668-669, and cases cited. See also <em>Close </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>208 Mass. 236, 240-241; <em>Vander Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>334 Mass. 267, 270-271; <em>LeBlanc v. Molloy, </em>335 Mass. 636, 638. cf. <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>337 Mass. 170, 175. Although the Daggetts \u2019 indications of refusal to perform perhaps were not as definite as those held to excuse tender of performance in certain earlier cases (see e.g. <em>Schilling </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>328 Mass. 2, 5-6; cf. <em>Pomroy </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>2 Met. 500, 503; <em>Smith &amp; Rice Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Canady, </em>213 Mass. 122, 12A-125), the Daggetts had indicated through Mr. Davis that they definitely wished to buy their way out of the agreement. Daggett\u2019s illness and Mr. Davis\u2019s efforts to preserve the situation unchanged until Daggett himself was able to negotiate created a situation upon which Construction might properly rely until a reasonable time after Daggett was back at work and after Mr. Davis unequivocally stated his client\u2019s position on the pending proposals. Throughout the transaction Mr. Davis spoke for the Daggetts, even if he was bound to resort to Daggett for approval of substantive terms of the trade. The earliest indication that Mr. Davis was not authorized to speak for the Daggetts was on July 16 when another attorney wrote to Mr. Snyder. By that time it had been made clear that any tender by Construction would be useless. It could be concluded from the subsidiary findings already summarized that there was, in the circumstances, no necessity for Construction to tender performance on July 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">2. What has just been said disposes also of Daggett\u2019s demurrer which was properly overruled. The bill sets forth in perhaps unnecessary detail the circumstances showing that Construction was excused from any tender on May 7, July 8, or any other day. As stated below, there is no merit in the Daggetts\u2019 contention that the agreement was too indefinite to be specifically enforced. The bill adequately alleged that Construction was ready, willing and able to perform at the date of the bill, August 8. This, in the light of the facts alleged, was clearly within a reasonable time after the Daggetts \u2019 repudiation of the agreement by letters on July 10 and July 16, the contents of both of which were adequately set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">3. The master\u2019s conclusion (on conflicting medical and other testimony) that, on February 7, Daggett was competent to execute the agreement rested largely on (a) Daggett\u2019s action in referring John DeMatteo and the broker to his attorney, Mr. Davis, and his continuing \u201cactive interest in the transaction\u201d; (b) Daggett\u2019s sound shift from a lease proposal to a sale because \u201cit was getting burdensome to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>try to run two businesses\u201d; (c) Ms \u201cdiscussion about . . . commissions, cost of sale, [and] the intricacies of the capital gains tax\u201d; (d) \u201cthe fact that he was able to inform Mr. Davis of the cost base of fifty or more purchases which went into\u201d the locus; (e) his correction of \u201can error that he had made in some figures\u201d; and (f) Ms request that Mr. Davis talk with Ms (Daggett\u2019s) accountant about the accuracy of the figures. The master could reasonably conclude that these circumstances \u201cindicated a mind of more than ordinary intelligence in handling a transaction involving a million dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The master\u2019s subsidiary findings on tMs issue, although confused with inappropriate recitals of testimony (see <em>Lombardi </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>336 Mass. 587, 590-591), show that Daggett was depressed in the period before and after February 7. Also, although he \u201cordinarily had the utmost confidence in himself,\u201d he \u201chad a Mstory of periodic occasions of deep depression.\u201d He was \u201cconcerned about Ms family Mstory\u201d of psychotic ilMess and about \u201cfamily relationships.\u201d On occasion \u201che would weep in public.\u201d As stated above, he saw Dr. Thorpe in January, 1957, and received advice from a psychiatrist, Dr. Wingate, on March 8. Then Daggett was \u201cweeping and . . . depressed.\u201d Dr. Wingate prescribed shock treatments and twelve such treatments were given between March 15 and April 12. The patient showed improvement after the fourth treatment. Although Dr. Wingate suggested that Daggett \u201cmake no further major business decisions until Dr. Wingate approved,\u201d Daggett kept in touch with Ms business by telephone. On Ms own imtiative, he went on a holiday trip in late April or early May.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">These subsidiary findings do not require the conclusion that on February 7 Daggett, even if depression impaired his judgment, was \u201cincapable of transacting the business\u201d (see <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Mattapan Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>198 Mass. 306, 314) or that he \u201ccould not understand the nature ... of the transaction or grasp its significance.\u201d See <em>Sutcliffe </em>v. <em>Heatley, </em>232 Mass. 231, 232-233; <em>Meserve </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Co. </em>340 Mass. 660, 662. Daggett\u2019s discussions with the attorney who represented him (see <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>337 Mass. 98,103) justify the conclusion that he was then competent. The terms of the agreement are not shown to have been unfavorable or so unusual as to require the conclusion that Daggett, by agreeing to these terms, showed incompetence. See discussion in the <em>Meserve </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 662-668.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Daggetts contend that the master\u2019s summaries under Bule 90 show insufficient evidence to justify certain subsidiary findings about Daggett\u2019s mental condition. Two such contentions relate to statements of testimony (not constituting findings). Any failure to recite testimony with precision is immaterial, for the recitals should not have been in the report at all. Another such exception related to a subsidiary finding that Daggett insisted that Mr. Davis give him an \u201coutline\u201d of what was said in a conference prior to February 7. The finding, read in the light of the master\u2019s summary of evidence and related portions of his report, was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The Daggetts \u2019 trial counsel objected to a hypothetical question asked of a psychiatrist \u201con the grounds of omission of . . . pertinent evidence.\u201d A trial judge or master has a wide discretion with respect to hypothetical questions. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Creeley, </em>257 Mass. 21, 27. See Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 682; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 14, at p. 32. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 74. Apparently it is not disputed that there was evidence from which the facts stated in the question could have been found to be true. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hotels Statler Co. Inc. </em>327 Mass. 28, 31. Cf. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 614. If relevant facts were omitted, inquiry could have been made whether the inclusion of such facts would have changed the expert\u2019s opinion. Such omissions, of course, may affect the weight of the testimony. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Seller, </em>329 Mass. 385, 388-389.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">4. The Daggetts contend that the agreement was so indefinite that it cannot be specifically enforced. The agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ment provided that \u2018\u2018the buyer shall execute and deliver . . . a mortgage deed ... in the usual form with statutory mortgage covenants, conditions and powers of sale.\u201d It was to \u201cbe conditioned upon the payment ... of the principal sum of . . . $800,000 ... at the rate of not less than . . . $25,000 . . . per year . . . with interest . . . semi-annually on the unpaid principal balance at. . . 3%% per year.\u201d The buyer was to have the right \u201cat any time, to prepay in whole or in part, the unpaid principal balance . . . with accrued interest.\u201d These provisions fairly describe a statutory mortgage running over a maximum term of thirty-two years. Taken together with the provision that the deed from the Baggetts could be \u201cto such person or persons as the buyer may designate by written notice,\u201d the absence of any provision for a mortgage note was reasonable. A note was not necessary. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Mulloney, </em>289 Mass. 508, 515-516. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>330 Mass. 261, 263. Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms (7th ed.) \u00a7 444. The provision that the locus might be copveyed to a nominee of Construction fairly implied that a mortgage executed by the nominee (and not by the buyer) would satisfy the agreement, despite the provision that \u201cthe buyer shall execute and deliver ... a mortgage deed.\u201d In any event, Construction now seeks conveyance to it and not to a nominee. Other provisions of the agreement (relating to occupancy by the buyer before conveyance, an escrow agreement, and acceptance by the buyer of less than the whole locus with a proportionate reduction in price) have no present relevance (although they seem sufficiently definite) for Construction does not rely upon any of them. The provision that \u201cthe time for delivery of the deed shall be extended as requested by the buyer in order to permit completion of its title examination\u201d authorized a reasonable extension of time. It also reduces greatly the significance of the provision that \u201ctime is of the essence,\u201d a provision upon which the Baggetts cannot rely equitably in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">5. Certain exceptions to the master\u2019s report relate to the master\u2019s inappropriate recitals of evidence. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>these should not have been included and must be disregarded (see <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Lenox Sav. Bank, </em>322 Mass. 46, 57-58; <em>Spirito </em>v. <em>Capar, </em>337 Mass. 431, 432; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., ante, </em>216, 218), their presence did not require recommittal of the report. Exceptions to the failure of the master to make findings did not require recommittal of the report. This was a matter within the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>New England Factors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Genstil, </em>322 Mass. 36, 43. <em>DiMare </em>v. <em>Capaldi, </em>336 Mass. 497, 501. The report made adequate subsidiary findings. Cf. <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>326 Mass. 384, 386-387; <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>335 Mass. 130, 136-137, <em>S. C. </em>340 Mass 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The master\u2019s summaries of evidence were meager. Although the trial judge would have been justified in recommitting the report for more adequate summaries of evidence there was no abuse of discretion in his failure to do so. The summaries which the master made and the report itself sufficiently set forth the evidential basis of his significant findings, even if we were to assume that there was also evidence of the character described in the affidavit of the Daggetts \u2019 counsel. The master was not obliged to summarize evidence which he appears not to have believed and which he was not required to believe. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>336 Mass. 254, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The master\u2019s conclusion that Construction was entitled to specific performance we disregard as a conclusion of law for the court, not for the master. Upon the facts found, however, we reach that conclusion ourselves. See <em>Ries </em>v. <em>Rome, </em>337 Mass. 376, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">6. The interlocutory decrees and the final decree are affirmed. Construction is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
