The employee\u2019s testimony included the following: She worked at the Bridgway Hotel as a uniformed chambermaid; she bought the uniforms herself and took care of her own uniforms and those \u201cof some of the others\u201d; she wore and laundered the uniforms with the knowledge and consent of her employer; she was on her way home on August 2,1957, carrying two bags of uniforms to launder when she fell in the street about half a mile from the hotel. The board member\u2019s decision, adopted by the reviewing board, found that the employee had completed her day\u2019s work at the hotel, that she had left the employer\u2019s premises and was on her way home, and, \u201con the testimony,\u201d that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The employee contends that her claim could not be denied in the absence of a finding under the clause of the statute (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26) enacted by St. 1927, c. 309, \u00a7 3, which authorizes compensation for an injury \u201carising out of an ordinary risk of the street while actually engaged, with . . . [her] employer\u2019s authorization, in the business affairs or undertakings of . . . [her] employer.\u201d The employee asserts that the facts found by the single member do not preclude compensation for injury from street risks. <em>Ham</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>el\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 628. The insurer contended, in oral argument, that no finding could have been made under the street risk clause as the single member stated the only question (other than notice, extent of disability and dependency) to be whether the employee sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Prior to St. 1927, c. 309, \u00a7 3, which inserted the street risk clause, the view had prevailed that injuries to an employee while using the streets in the course of his employment arose, not out of his employment, but rather out of the risks peculiar to public travel, common to every traveller. <em>Colarullo\u2019s Case, </em>258 Mass. 521. There was an exception where the street was in effect the employee\u2019s workshop and hence offered risks peculiar to the employment. <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 532. <em>Egan\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 11,14. It has been suggested that the effect of the 1927 amendment was to put ordinary street risk injuries, that is those not peculiar to the employment (see <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 345, 350), into the category of compensable risks because they arise out of and in the course of employment, and that, if the statute is so construed, it is not necessary to discuss street risks at all, the only test being whether the injury arises out of and in the course of the employment. 1956 Annual Survey of Mass. Law, \u00a7 19.1. In <em>Harvey\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 300, 304, and <em>Hamel\u2019s Case, </em>333 Mass. 628, 629, street risks were said not to be compensable under the \u201cout of and in the course of his employment\u201d clause. But in <em>Harvey\u2019s Case </em>(p. 304) we said that the \u201cfacts which must necessarily have been found ... in reaching the conclusion that the employee was ... in the position of an \u2018employee\u2019 also support the conclusion . . . [of] the right to compensation for an injury arising out of the risk of the street . . ..\u201d In neither case was the outcome dependent on the concept of an independent right rather than an enlargement of the scope of the concept of injuries arising \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">It is not necessary to make a precise construction in this case. The two clauses in \u00a7 26 are, in any event, so closely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>related that in a case dealing with street risks the street risk clause is to be deemed applicable in resolving the question as stated by the single member. But, although the findings, as the employee points out, are ambiguous, there is no occasion for further findings. There is no basis in the evidence for a conclusion that the employee when injured was engaged in the employer\u2019s business. On her testimony it cannot be concluded that laundering the uniforms was significantly more related to the employer\u2019s business than the cleaning of any clothes which any employee wears to any work. The employee when injured was engaged in an independent enterprise of her own. <em>Sylvia\u2019s Case, </em>298 Mass. 27, is not in point. There the employee, and other employees, with permission, habitually used the employer\u2019s laundry, on the premises of the employment, to wash clothes soiled in the employer\u2019s service, and it could have been found that this had become an incident of the employment. Accord <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>290 Mass. 448, 451. A finding that although the employee had \u201ccompleted her day\u2019s work at the hotel\u201d and \u201cleft the . . . premises\u201d she was nevertheless engaged \u201cin the business affairs or undertakings\u201d of her employer would not have been warranted. It is insignificant therefore that the member failed to make the relevant finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
