There was no error in denying the lefendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The jury could rave found that the plaintiff sustained injuries on January 28, 1956, as a result of an assault by his cousin Robert D\u2019Brien while the plaintiff, in a group which did not include O\u2019Brien, was a patron in the defendant\u2019s bar in Dorchester. When O\u2019Brien came into the bar he at once objected to the plaintiff\u2019s presence on \u201cmy corner,\u201d and continued remarks against the plaintiff for from ten to twenty minutes, acting boisterously, and saying after some time that he was \u201cgoing to bodily throw someone out.\u201d There were \u201cwords back and forth\u201d; loud talk; \u201ca lot of commotion.\u201d The bartender heard and observed this but walked away when the plaintiff said that O\u2019Brien was under age and \u201cshould be shut off because there was going to be trouble.\u201d O\u2019Brien then immediately started yelling and charged the plaintiff\u2019s group with an ash tray in his raised hand, the plaintiff \u201cgot twisted off the stool,\u201d and O\u2019Brien \u201clanded\u201d on him. On these facts a finding of the defendant\u2019s negligence was warranted. <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Bancroft Hotel Corp. </em>313 Mass. 56. <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Wilson Line of Mass. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">2. There was no prejudicial error in the reference in the charge to \u201chighest degree of care.\u201d The judge, adopting, it appears, language in the <em>Quigley </em>case (p. 128), said: \u201cNow, as far as the tavern keeper is concerned, it\u2019s the duty of the person in control of a tavern or bar to exercise reasonable or ordinary care for the safety of a business visitor and to protect him from assault by other patrons and to use the highest degree of care in anticipation and prevention of violence by other patrons and even strangers as is consistent with the nature and the operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>business. The tavern keeper, however, is not an insurer of the safety of his patrons, nor is he required by law to foresee and guard against unlikely danger and probable harm. The test is \u2018foreseeable harm.\u2019 And if the acts of an assailant could be foreseen, then the tavern keeper owed the guest or patron the duty to furnish him protection. That is what you are to determine in this case, whether the conduct of O\u2019Brien, as testified to here \u2014 if you believe there was such conduct \u2014 whether that conduct was such that it might be foreseeable that he might cause injury to the patron Kane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The concept of \u201chighest degree of care\u201d is commonly stated in carrier cases where it reflects the circumstances of carrier control and the potentially serious consequences of an accident. <em>Donahoe </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>214 Mass. 70, 72. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>309 Mass. 32, 35. <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>321 Mass. 406,411, and cases cited. <em>Kuhlen </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; No. St. Ry. </em>193 Mass. 341, 346. <em>Glennen </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>207 Mass. 497, 498. <em>Holton </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>303 Mass. 242, 244-245.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The underlying duty in every case, however, is to exercise the care which the circumstances reasonably require. <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Operating Co. Inc. </em>328 Mass. 558, 560. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>309 Mass. 32, 35. <em>Fortier </em>v. <em>Hibernian Bldg. Assn. of Boston Highlands, </em>315 Mass. 446, 447, 450-451, and cases cited. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 348. The care to be exercised is always proportionate to the dangers to be anticipated. <em>White </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>284 Mass. 73, 76. Most cases \u2018 \u2018present a wide variation in their facts,\u201d <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Operating Co. Inc., supra, </em>and there are probably few categories of cases to which a \u201chighest care\u201d rule could rightly be applied. It may be questioned how far the statement of such rule is helpful, for substantial qualifications are necessary and leave, as the only clear principle, reasonable care in the circumstances. For example, in carrier cases, the highest degree of care is only that \u201cconsistent with the requirements of the public for speedy and inexpensive as well as safe trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Dortation and with, the practical operation of the business.\u201d <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>309 Mass. 32, 35. The better practice is to refer only to reasonable care with appropriate reference to the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The judge did not substantially misstate the law applica)le to this case, reading together all that was said as to reasonable care. Hence we pass the issue of whether the msiness of tavern keeper could justify a general highest 3are rule as suggested in <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Wilson Line of Mass. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 125, 128-129, with citation of <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Bancroft Hotel Corp. </em>313 Mass. 56, 59-60. In the <em>McFadden </em>case however it was deemed \u201cunnecessary to determine the precise extent of the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The substance of the requirement to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm was stated. The circumstances did call for special care in respect of O\u2019Brien\u2019s conduct. As in <em>Quigley </em>v. <em>Wilson Line of Mass. Inc. </em>338 Mass. 125, the business included the serving of intoxicants known to make some persons unreasonably aggressive, and the person in charge for the defendant had notice of belligerent and obnoxious acts which could be held to show that more serious action impended. We have already held that an omission to state the highest care rule in a carrier case is not reversible error where the substance underlying it is given, that is, that the jury were to consider that the \u201coccupants of . . . [the] vehicle . . . [had] no control over its operation and little opportunity for self protection.\u201d <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>321 Mass. 406, 411. \u201cThe instructions asked . . . would have added nothing substantial to what had already been said. Essentially the question . . . was the negligence of the defendant ... on which legalistic refinements would have afforded little or no assistance.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>412). Here also the basic principles were given, and the addition of the \u201clegalistic refinements,\u201d even if not strictly applicable as stated, was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">3. There was no reversible error in the ruling in the course of argument, or in the charge, in respect of damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In his closing argument the plaintiff\u2019s attorney asserted that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity was to be measured by his capacity as a bricklayer and in the water department and that he had an earning capacity of $175 a week.\u201d The defendant objected and asked the judge to instruct the jury to disregard this as there was no evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity as a bricklayer and \u201cno evidence . . . that he ever earned $175 a week.\u201d The judge said \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d The defendant excepted to the judge\u2019s failure to do so at that time. There was no error; this was in the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Rowes </em>v. <em>Grush, </em>131 Mass. 207, 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In the charge the judge said, \u201cYou may consider . . . the loss of earning capacity. The expressions in evidence of values are for you to consider. You are to determine that. Your recollection of the testimony will govern as to what the wages were, whether there were any wages in connection with any bricklaying or in connection with the water department.\u201d The defendant excepted \u201cto your Honor\u2019s saying that they may consider loss of earning capacity as a bricklayer, as there was no evidence that he had earning capacity as a bricklayer at the time of the accident or what that capacity was or what he would earn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The plaintiff had testified that he was able to return to his trade as a bricklayer at the middle or the end of May. When asked for whom he worked just prior to the accident he answered \u201cI had a $22,000 job for myself and another fellow for the city of Boston.\u201d This answer was struck. To the next question \u201cAt the last job you worked before the accident, what was your weekly pay?\u201d he answered \u201c$175 a week,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s counsel said \u201cI pray your Honor\u2019s judgment. We still don\u2019t know where he worked. I object.\u201d The judge said \u201cYou may inquire as to where he worked.\u201d Q. (by plaintiff\u2019s attorney) \u201cWhere was the site of your job?\u201d A. \u201cThe addition to the Hyland Street Garage for the city of Boston. And the job was bonded.\u201d Q. \u201cAnd you made $175 a week?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney said \u201cI pray your Honor\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ment and ask that he stricken.\u201d The judge said, \u201cIt may go out. \u2019 \u2019 The plaintiff then testified that he worked<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>\u2018 </em>forty-eight to fifty hours a week on account of I was supervising that job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The exception to the charge considered apart from the objection during argument was not well taken. There was evidence of earning capacity as a bricklayer, and in a supervisory capacity (inferentially in connection with bricklaying), and there was precise evidence of earnings of $50.50 a week in a part time job with the water department. In the absence of any request for instructions the judge was not obliged to do more than to refer the jury to their recollection of this evidence which was relevant to impaired earning capacity; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>1 Allen, 261, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendant\u2019s objection to the plaintiff\u2019s argument entitled the defendant to a more specific correction than was given in the judge\u2019s charge, if there was in fact no evidence of an earning capacity of $175 a week. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>207 Mass. 240, 250. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69. But the state of the record did not require a ruling that there was no evidence of an earning capacity of $175.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The first objection to the testimony of $175 was apparently on the ground that the place of work was not stated. The next question and answer supplied that information and the evidence then showed that the plaintiff had earned $175 a week at the Hyland Street Oarage. It is not clear how much was intended to be struck on the second objection to the answer affirming $175 a week. Reasons for striking the second reference to $175 would appear to be applicable also to the first answer. But the first answer was not in terms struck. <em>Bachand </em>v. <em>Vidal, </em>328 Mass. 97, 102. It was for the defendant to clear the record of the ambiguity in the ruling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>324 Mass. 196, 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In the circumstances it is not unjust to hold the defendant to the strict rule. Wages earned prior to the injury are admissible as pro'of of earning capacity and the plaintiff may testify to them. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>New York &amp; Boston Des</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>patch Exp. Co. </em>167 Mass. 549, 550. <em>Braithwaite </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>168 Mass. 38, 39-40. <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>268 Mass. 440,441-442. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>302 Mass. 145,147. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Walton Lunch Co. </em>305 Mass. 76, 77-78. Furthermore, the jury on the evidence of a full time bricklaying or supervisory job and a part time job in the water department could have concluded that the plaintiff had an earning capacity in the range of $175 even in the absence of specific evidence of such earnings. \u201cThe assessment of damages for such impairment rests largely upon the common knowledge of the jury . . . sometimes with little aid from evidence.\u201d <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>302 Mass. 145,147. Although instructions cautioning the jury that evidence of earnings does \u201cnot furnish any mathematical valuation of the impairment\u201d <em>{ibid.) </em>would have been appropriate, they were not required in the absence of any relevant request for instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">4. The exception to \u201cthat part of the charge referring to [G. L.] c. 138, \u00a7 69,\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was bad as too general. <em>Sylvia </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>296 Mass. 157, 164. <em>Matter of Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 191, 195. A reference to the statute was justified by the evidence, particularly by the barkeeper\u2019s testimony that he \u201csaw that . . . [O\u2019Brien] was under the influence of liquor,\u201d and that he told O\u2019Brien when he ordered a beer \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t serve you and furthermore you\u2019re too young.\u201d The judge in substance charged that if they believed the testimony that O\u2019Brien was under the influence of liquor they might consider the statute; that violation of the statute was not conclusive evidence, but might be considered on the issue; and that the test was \u201cwhether . . . [they believed] the testimony . . . that O\u2019Brien was being served beer and intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Respects in which this charge might or should have been amplified or qualified are argued by the defendant, but do not concern us in the absence of specific request or objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tian. Nothing told the judge that the defendant wished an instruction on the distinction between the state of being under the influence, and being intoxicated, and on the necessity that the violation be a contributing cause, or that the defendant believed the judge had overstated the evidence as to O \u2019Brien being served intoxicants. <em>Ristuccia </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>283 Mass. 529, 535. <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>Red Cab Co. </em>319 Mass. 64, 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">5. It was discretionary with the judge whether to strike the words \u201cboisterous\u201d and \u201cin an arrogant manner\u201d used by witnesses in describing O\u2019Brien\u2019s actions. There was other description of what O\u2019Brien said and did. These adjectives had significance in the context. The rule that witnesses in describing conduct should tell what they saw and heard does not foreclose the use of words of summary description. <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Boston, Worcester &amp; N. Y. St. Ry. </em>319 Mass. 177, 179. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 134-135. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borasky, </em>214 Mass. 313, 319. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 339. Compare <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Shain, </em>291 Mass. 506, 509-511. Trials are not to be delayed and witnesses made inarticulate by too nice objections or rulings as to the use of such descriptive words. Synonyms of \u201carrogant\u201d include \u201coverbearing\u201d and \u2018 \u2018blustering. \u2019\u2019 If the jury believed O\u2019Brien was \u201cboisterous\u201d they undoubtedly understood he was \u201crough,\u201d \u201cnoisy,\u201d or \u201cclamorous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\"> \u201cNo alcoholic beverage shall be sold or delivered on any premises licensed under this chapter to a person who is known to be a drunkard, to an intoxicated person, or to a person who is known to have been intoxicated within the six months last preceding, or to a person known to be supported in whole or in part by public charity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
