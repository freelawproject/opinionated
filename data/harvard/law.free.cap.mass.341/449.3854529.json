The defendant knew that cleaning was usually done between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. The plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from falling on the second floor corridor, then wet from mopping, on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1,1954, about 7:30 p.m. as she was about to call at her attorney\u2019s office. The trial judge found that the floor was in a dangerous condition in that it had not been mopped or dried with due care, that the independent contractor had been selected with \u201cdue care,\u201d and that \u201cthe work contracted for was not inherently dangerous. \u2019 \u2019 He also stated \u201cthe opinion that ... [a slippery dangerous condition] was a natural consequence . . . [of the defendant\u2019s contract] especially if [the floor was] not mopped or dried properly, and that the slippery condition was not a mere detail of the work.\u201d He ruled that the defendant was negligent in contracting for floor washing during business hours without requiring warning signs, or alternatively in failing to provide in the contract that cleaning would be done \u201cat times other than times when it knew the passageways would be used by persons rightfully on the premises. \u201d The Appellate Division vacated the finding for the plaintiff and ordered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Plainly a dangerous condition was a possible consequence of floor mopping. But we think it could not be found or ruled to be a likely or probable consequence within the rule on which is founded the liability of the employer of an independent contractor. Even though the work need not be \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d in the sense that it will <em>\u201cnecessarily . . </em>. [cause] harm\u201d (emphasis supplied) in the absence of precautions (see <em>McConnon </em>v. <em>Charles H. Hodgate Co. </em>282 Mass. 584, 588; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Ashhenazy, </em>307 Mass. 197; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 427) it must at least be \u201cwork . . . necessarily creating, during its progress, conditions containing an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others unless special precautions are taken . . ..\u201d Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 413. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 150. <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co. </em>276 Mass. 429, 434. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>LaCroix, </em>336 Mass. 484, 487. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Kiley, </em>153 Mass. 123, 126. See <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>314 Mass. 540, 543; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Wernich, </em>334 Mass. 624, 627; <em>Thurlow </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>337 Mass. 450, 454-455.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The defendant was not bound to conclude that the employee of a building cleaning firm, chosen with due care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>would not take reasonable precautions to limit to the area within his immediate control the extent of floor which at any time was wet to the point of slipperiness. Although it was a \u201cnatural consequence\u201d of the contract that water be placed on the floor (see <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Waldorf Sys. Inc. </em>241 Mass. 569, 571), it was not a natural consequence that this be so done that a dangerous condition result. The findings do not permit the inference that the contractor was not informed or did not learn of the tenants \u2019 practice of holding early evening office hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Under our minority rule stating the \u201csomewhat technically defined duty of a landlord\u201d in respect of common passageways (Pe<em>ay </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>321 Mass. 455, 458; 1956 Annual Survey of Mass. Law, \u00a7 1.1, n. 6; 32 Am. Jur., \u00a7 696) no invitation from the building owner to the business visitor of a tenant could be found, <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Isenberg Bros. Inc. </em>321 Mass. 170,171, and we need not determine whether the facts could be ruled to show a breach of an obligation to use due care to keep premises reasonably safe for business invitees. See <em>Judson </em>v. <em>American Ry. Exp. Co. </em>242 Mass. 269, 271; <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co. </em>276 Mass. 429, 434; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Kiley, </em>153 Mass. 123, 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">No negligence for which the defendant is responsible being shown, the order of the Appellate Division was right. Compare <em>Peay </em>v. <em>Reidy, </em>321 Mass. 455, 458; <em>Henebury </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>288 Mass. 349, 352-353; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Merchants Natl.
