(Orloff\u2019s). He asserted that these injuries were the result of an assault by the other defendant, Durocher. Rigazio brought this action originally against Durocher, alleging the assault by Durocher in count 1 of his declaration, and against Orloff\u2019s, alleging in count 2 that Orloff\u2019s failed to provide safe premises for its customers and permitted the assault, and in count 3 that Orloff\u2019s negligently permitted the assault. The present plaintiff, as administratrix, was substituted after Rigazio\u2019s death. While the action was pending, \u201ca settlement of the case was effected . . . whereby Orloff\u2019s\u201d paid Rigazio $3,500 \u201cand received [from Rigazio] a covenant not to sue\u201d it and a discontinuance, later filed, as to counts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The case against Durocher was tried before a judge of the Superior Court sitting without a jury. He ruled, among other matters, that the covenant not to sue was \u201cin effect a release of . . . [the covenantee] from liability in the subject matter of the suit.\u201d This ruling we interpret as meaning no more than that, as a practical matter, neither Rigazio nor his personal representative would thereafter be able to enforce any liability on the part of Orloff\u2019s. Durocher excepted to the refusal of the judge to give Durocher \u2019s request for a ruling that \u201cthe codefendant is likewise released and discharged in the suit.\u201d The judge found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The plaintiff sought to recover for one injury against each of two defendants. If Durocher was liable, he was liable for assault. If Orloff\u2019s was liable, it was liable for breach of duty as a restaurant owner or for negligence. Although there was but a single injury, the theories of lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>bility were separate and different. Accordingly, the plaintiff contends that, even if the covenant not to sne operated as a release of Orloff\u2019s, the original defendants were not sufficiently joint tortfeasors (see <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Edison Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>185 Mass. 547, 548) to bring them within the rule that the release of one joint tortfeasor discharges all of them. We need not deal with this contention, however, for, even if Duroeher and Orloff\u2019s were joint tortfeasors, it would not necessarily mean that the settlement with Orloff\u2019s operated to release Duroeher.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The bill of exceptions states that the document given by Bigazio to Orloff\u2019s was a \u201ccovenant not to sue.\u201d If this document was in fact given not in discharge or release of Orloff\u2019s from all liability for the injuries but merely to protect Orloff\u2019s from further litigation, it could not be ruled as a matter of law that Duroeher also was discharged. The requested ruling, which the judge properly denied, called for such a ruling as a matter of law. See <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>National Oil Co. </em>231 Mass. 20, 28. It was open to the judge to find as a fact (and his general finding for the plaintiff implies that he did so) that the covenant not to sue was not intended as an outright discharge of Orloff\u2019s, but was intended to have the usual effect of a covenant not to sue, that is, merely to give Orloff\u2019s practical protection against having to pay more but without giving formally a full release and discharge. See <em>Matheson </em>v. <em>O\u2019Kane, </em>211 Mass. 91, 94-96; Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 121, 122. See also <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Celeste, </em>303 Mass. 148, 152; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 932, 933; Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 341-342; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 46, pp. 243-246; Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 10.1, pp. 709-714. There is no suggestion in the record that the trial judge failed to give any weight, which may have been appropriate under the principles stated in <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Celeste, supra, </em>to the payment by Orloff\u2019s in assessing damages against Duroeher. In any event, no exception presents either this question or any question of the type considered in <em>Karcher </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>303 Mass. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
