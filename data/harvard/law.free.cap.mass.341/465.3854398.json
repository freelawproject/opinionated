The declaration is in four counts: (1) negligence, (2) money had and received, (3) account annexed, and (4) warranties arising from the defendant\u2019s indorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ment of the check. The case was tried to a judge who found for the plaintiff on the negligence count and declined to make findings on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The judge made careful and complete findings of fact, which included the following. On September 9, 1952, an unknown man entered the offices of the Worcester County Trust Company (hereinafter called the defendant) and presented a check to one of the defendant\u2019s tellers. The check, dated September 5,1952, was drawn on The Mechanics National Bank of Worcester (hereinafter called the plaintiff); it was payable to \u201ccash\u201d in the sum of $3,940 and was signed \u201cAnthony A. Borgatti.\u201d On the reverse side it bore the indorsement \u201cRalph Scola.\u201d The \u201cS\u201d in Scola had been written over. The person presenting the check also presented a deposit slip in the amount of $340 in the name of Ralph Scola. Although there are similarities, the name Ralph Scola on the deposit slip did not \u201cappear to be in the same handwriting\u201d as the indorsement. (The defendant had a depositor named Ralph Scola.) The defendant\u2019s teller took the check and the deposit slip from the man who was unknown to him without asking for any identification and without comparing the signature on the check with the signature of Scola in its files. The teller had heard that there was a depositor named Ralph Scola but was not familiar with his signature. Upon presentation of the check and the deposit slip, the teller by telephone asked an employee in the plaintiff\u2019s bookkeeping department whether Anthony A. Borgatti had sufficient funds in his account to cover the check. The plaintiff\u2019s employee, after investigation, told the teller that there was no such account but there was an account under the name of \u201cBr\u00edgida Borgatti, Conservator for Antonio Borgatti.\u201d The teller replied that \u201cAnthony and Antonio were the same thing in Italian\u201d and hung up. He then, as requested, credited Scola\u2019s account with a deposit in the amount of $340 and paid over $3,600 in cash to the person presenting the check. The defendant stamped the check with its indorsement, which stated that it was payable to \u201cthe order of any bank, banker or trust co.\u201d and that \u201cprior endorsements [were] guaranteed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The next day the defendant, as holder, presented the check for payment at the Worcester Clearing House and the plaintiff paid it by crediting the defendant\u2019s clearing house balance. On the same day the plaintiff erroneously charged the check to the account of Br\u00edgida Borgatti, conservator for Antonio Borgatti. The signature of the purported drawer of the check, \u201cAnthony A. Borgatti,\u201d and the signature of the purported indorser, \u201cRalph Scola,\u201d were forgeries. The plaintiff learned of the forgeries on September 19, when an overdraft occurred in the conservator\u2019s account, and it notified the defendant of this fact on the same day. The defendant, upon learning that Scola knew nothing of the $340 deposit, charged this amount to his account and paid it to the plaintiff. By this payment the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s loss was reduced to $3,600 and it is this sum that the plaintiff seeks to recover in this action. Other facts will be stated as occasion requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">1. The defendant\u2019s first contention is that the plaintiff is barred from recovery by reason of certain provisions in the constitution of the Worcester Clearing House of which both parties were members. The pertinent provisions are set forth below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant argues that these provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>sions are binding on the parties and that a forged check is a \u201creturn item\u201d within the purview of \u00a7 5 and therefore must be returned, if ever, within the time limits of that section. Admittedly, the check was not returned within these limits. The plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that \u201creturn items\u201d means \u201cmissent\u201d items and that \u00a7 5 is inapplicable. It argues, therefore, that a forged check is not a \u201creturn item\u201d under \u00a7 5, but rather comes under \u00a7 4 dealing with \u201c [e]rrors in the exchanges and claims arising from the return of checks, or other cause,\u201d and which provides that such matters \u201care to be adjusted directly between the banks which are parties therein, and not through the Clearing House.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We have no doubt that banks, through clearing house rules to which they have subscribed, may foreclose their right to return a check after a certain time. But any agreement to do so must be clear. Thus it has been held that in the absence of clear and explicit provisions barring the right of a bank to return forged items after a given time that right is not lost. <em>Merchants\u2019 Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>National Eagle Bank, </em>101 Mass. 281. <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>106 Mass. 441. <em>Merchants\u2019 Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>National Bank, </em>139 Mass. 513, 519-520. <em>Metropolitan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Trust Co. </em>232 Mass. 363. In our view of the case it becomes unnecessary to determine whether the transaction under consideration is governed by \u00a7 4 or \u00a7 5 of the clearing house constitution. If we assume that \u00a7 5 applies, the plaintiff is not barred from recovery. This is made clear by the cases just cited where somewhat similar rules were involved. Thus in <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Bangs, supra, </em>it was said at pages 443-444, \u201cThe signature of the drawer proved to be a forgery. As the discovery- of the forgery was not made in time to enable the plaintiff to return the check, as of absolute right, under the rules of the clearing-house, we think the case must stand as if the payment had been made directly at the plaintiff\u2019s counter, in the ordinary mode. The right of return, secured by the rules of the clearinghouse, is a special provision, in compensation for payment</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>without inspection. Instead thereof, the rules give opportunity for subsequent inspection. When that has been had, the special rules cease to govern; and the rights of the paying bank rest upon the general principles of law. . . . But, in applying those general principles, it was held in <em>Merchants\u2019 Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>National Eagle Bank . . . </em>that the drawee of a check, who paid it without inspection, under the provisions of the clearing-house rules [there being no funds of the drawer in the drawee\u2019s hands at the time of payment], might recover back the money, if there had been no actual loches on the part of the drawee, and no change of position on the part of the holder; notwithstanding \u2018the failure of the bank to return a check by one o\u2019clock\u2019 as allowed by the rules. The failure in that case was by accident, and involved no neglect.\u201d This principle is applicable here. The ruling of the judge that the plaintiff was not barred by the clearing house rules was right. Since this conclusion would be the same if the question put to the witness Cunningham had been allowed, we need not concern ourselves with whether its exclusion was error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">2. The general rule is that money paid under a mistake of fact can be recovered. An important exception to this rule is that, where the equities are equal, a drawee of a check bearing a forged drawer\u2019s signature cannot recover from the person who has presented the check to the drawee and has received payment. This is the doctrine of <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>3 Burr. 1354, which is law in this Commonwealth. <em>Dedham Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Everett Natl. Bank, </em>177 Mass. 392. <em>South Boston Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>249 Mass. 45, 49. The reason for the rule was stated in <em>Danvers Bank </em>v. <em>Salem </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Bank, </em>151 Mass. 280, where it was said at pages 282-283, \u201cIt is presumed that the bank knows the signature of its own customers, and therefore is not entitled to the benefit of the rule [permitting a party to recover back money paid under a mistake of fact].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">For the <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neal </em>exception to apply, however, it is necessary that the party presenting the check does not contribute to the deception of the drawee. Thus it was said in <em>Danvers Bank </em>v. <em>Salem Bank, supra, </em>at page 283: \u201cIn the absence of actual fault on the part of the drawee, his constructive fault in not knowing the signature of the drawer and detecting the forgery will not preclude his recovery from one who took the check under circumstances of suspicion without proper precaution, or whose conduct has been such as to mislead the drawee or induce bim to pay the check without the usual security against fraud.\u201d The plaintiff places great reliance on the <em>Danvers Bank </em>case and it is apparent that the trial judge considered that case to be controlling. We shall, therefore, proceed to an analysis of that decision. There a check in the amount of $188 was drawn on the plaintiff bank purportedly by one of its depositors, but in fact the drawer\u2019s name was forged. The check was payable to a named payee or bearer. It was presented to the defendant bank by an unknown person who was not the named payee. The defendant\u2019s teller, without requiring the person to identify himself, asked him to indorse the check, and he did so by writing the name of the payee on the back of the check. The teller then cashed the check. Subsequently, the drawee charged the amount of the check to the depositor in whose name it was drawn and credited the amount to the account of the defendant. Upon discovery of the forgery about two months later, the plaintiff immediately notified the defendant. The trial judge found that the defendant was negligent in cashing the check without more inquiry into its genuineness; that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was also negligent in not detecting the forgery sooner; but that this negligence had not prejudiced the defendant. He accordingly found for the plaintiff. In affirming, this court held that a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant was amply warranted. \u201cThe person who presented the check to the defendant bank was not known to either of its officers, and was not one of its customers. No attempt to have him identified was made, and without identification the money was paid over upon his indorsement .... The nominal drawer of the check, whose name was forged, was not a customer of the defendant. It is altogether probable that, if the defendant before it cashed the check had made proper inquiry, the utterer of it would not have remained to encounter any such investigation, and if he had, it would readily have been ascertained that he was not [the payee]\u201d (pp. 283-284).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The facts in the <em>Danvers </em>case are singularly similar to those in the case at bar, and we are of opinion that that decision is controlling. Here the trial judge expressly found that the defendant was negligent in cashing a check of the size of the one involved without making further inquiry. And there was the added circumstance of the defendant\u2019s teller calling the plaintiff and learning that there was no account standing in the name of the purported drawer. We are mindful that in the <em>Danvers Bank </em>case there was evidence of a general custom of banks requiring identification of a person presenting a check in similar circumstances. There was no such evidence here. Nevertheless, we are of opinion that the absence of such evidence did not preclude the judge from finding negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">3. We turn now to the question of whether the conduct of the plaintiff with respect to the check is a bar to recovery. The judge found that the plaintiff erred in \u201creceiving the check upon the clearing house balances.\u201d He found, however, that this error was not the cause of the loss, for if the plaintiff had disclaimed the check the defendant \u201cwould have been the party damaged by the . . . [conduct] of its own teller.\u201d The judge also found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the plaintiff erred in debiting the amount of the check to the conservator\u2019s account. He found, however, that this \u25a0 mistake was not harmful to the defendant. In support of this conclusion the judge said, \u201cIt is true that upon discovery of the fraud . . . the plaintiff would be under a duty to notify indorsers and all other persons interested of its discovery to reduce any loss that they might entail. But the plaintiff . . . performed this duty with immediate dispatch to the defendant .... As to the claim that if the plaintiff had returned the check to the clearing house instead of debiting it to the conservator\u2019s account, the defendant would be in a better position to more quickly investigate and ascertain who the impostor was for any possible recovery, it appears that this is only in the realm of possibility and not of probability since the teller could only give a very inadequate description of the impostor . . . [who] has never been located despite much effort . . .. The damage was done . . . when the impostor walked out of the bank with the money.\u201d The judge \u201cconcluded that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff,\u201d and, \u201cparticularly, there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff . . . that had any causal relation with the acts that eventually led to the damages sustained.\u201d Whether the defendant was prejudiced by the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was essentially a question of fact. We cannot say that the conclusions of the judge on this issue were erroneous or tainted by error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">4. Although not raised by the parties, a question of pleading should be noticed. The judge found for the plaintiff on the first count, which sounded in tort for negligence. The true basis for recovery in a case such as this is for money paid under mistake of fact. <em>Dedham Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Everett Natl. Bank, </em>177 Mass. 392, 396. Recovery in such a case is in contract for money had and received. <em>Gloucester Bank </em>v. <em>Salem Bank, </em>17 Mass. 33. <em>Boylston Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>101 Mass. 287. <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>106 Mass. 441. <em>Merchants\u2019 Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>National Bank, </em>139 Mass. 513. <em>Danvers Bank </em>v. <em>Salem Bank, </em>151 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>280. <em>Atlas Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>National Exch. Bank, </em>176 Mass. 300. See <em>South Boston Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>249 Mass. 45, 46. The second count of the declaration seeks recovery on this ground. As the facts necessary to recovery on this ground have been established, we are of opinion that the finding on the first count should be vacated and that judgment in the same amount should be entered on the second count. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 124; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>322 Mass. 114, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u201c Section 4.
