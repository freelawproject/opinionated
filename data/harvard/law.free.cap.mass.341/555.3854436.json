This excise is imposed by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 20 (as amended by St. 1941, c. 509, \u00a7 5, and as affected by St. 1943, c. 531, \u00a7 2), at the rate of \u201cone quarter of one per cent upon the net value of all policies in force on December thirty-first of the year preceding that in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the tax is payable, issued or assumed by such company on the lives of residents of this commonwealth . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The company is a Massachusetts life insurance company. In its excise return filed in 1957, it excluded from the net value of its policies in force on December 31, 1956, $25,601,551, representing \u201cthe Massachusetts portion of . . . [the company\u2019s] reserve liability for its assumption of cost under\u201d an \u201cinstrument . . . called a group annuity contract, numbered 6 GAC,\u201d which had been issued in 1938 by the company \u201cas insurer\u201d to itself \u201cas employer\u201d in order to establish \u201ca retirement pension benefit plan for its [own] employees.\u201d On June 21,1957, a deficiency was assessed \u201cbased entirely upon the inclusion of the . . . $25,601,551 in the net value of\u201d the company\u2019s policies in force at the end of 1956. The company paid $65,411.96, the additional excise stated on the deficiency assessment bill to be due, and applied for a correction of the excise. It later appealed to the Appellate Tax Board when the commission failed to abate the additional excise. The case was heard on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">By St. 1943, c. 531, effective (see \u00a7 7) on January 1,1944, the excises upon life insurance companies were revised to provide (see \u00a7 1) a new measure based upon premiums.

By St. 1938, c. 218, \u00a7 1, effective ninety days after April 14, 1938, the substance of the third and fourth paragraphs had been inserted in \u00a7 36 to permit the. payment of pensions \u201cunder a group contract issued by it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">6,GAG provides that \u201cthe . . .. company . . . agrees to pay to each of its employees entitled thereto, under the . . . provisions of this [c]ontract, a [r]etirement [a]nnuity for life in an amount based on the rates and schedules contained herein, and to pay such amounts as may become due in case of death or termination of employment of an employee covered hereunder . . ..\u2019\u2019 and recites that it is issued \u201cto set forth the terms, the benefits, and the conditions of the pension system.for its employees established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>[c]ompany under\u201d \u00a7 36.

Each employee\u2019s certificate recites that, \u201csubject to the . . . provisions of ... 6 GAC,\u201d he \u201cwill be entitled to a [r]etirement [a]nnuity for life\u201d if he remains covered until retirement, and summarizes the provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\u201c[A] portion of the cost . . .

This amount has been in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>eluded in the net value of policies on the . . . excise tax return. The amount of tax paid on this (at % of 1%) amounted to $11,651.71.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The excise \u201cis not a property tax although measured by property,\u201d see <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>328 Mass. 404, 408, but is imposed \u201cfor the privilege of doing business in this Commonwealth.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.

Co. </em>308 Mass. 385, 387. Under c. 63, \u00a7 28 (as amended through St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 55), \u201c [l]iability for the taxes imposed by\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 20 to 23 or by St. 1943, c. 531, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, \u201cshall be incurred by . . . the transaction of business . . . within the calendar year preceding\u201d the year of assessment. The excise measure of \u00a7 20 has borne a close relation to the volume of business. This has been true equally whether the measure has been \u201ctwo per cent upon all new and renewal premiums received,\u201d as in the 1943 act, or \u201cone quarter of one per cent upon the net value of all policies in force,\u201d as in the 1941 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The Appellate Tax Board concluded that the company\u2019s \u201cannuity contracts issued ... to carry out its pension plan\u201d revealed an \u201cabsence of profit motive,\u201d that the transactions \u201cdid not constitute the carrying on of an insurance business with respect to which the excise ... is imposed,\u201d and that \u201cthe tax is limited ... to those policies which stem from the doing of such business.\u201d The board pointed out the absence of an \u201cexpress [statutory] provision . . . which levies a tax on the net value of an employees\u2019 retirement pension plan as such.\u201d This, says the board, \u201craises a . . . doubt . . . whether the Legislature intended to tax the net value based on the annuity contract under the pension plan.\u201d The board then, in granting the abatement, applied the well established principles (see <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>335 Mass. 431, 435, 437; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>337 Mass. 502, 504; <em>State Tax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Commn. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>340 Mass. 535, 540) that tax statutes are to be strictly construed and that all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The board\u2019s view is supported- by the only closely relevant decision which has come to our attention. See <em>California-Western States Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>151 Cal. App. 2d 559. The employees \u2019 retirement plan there considered resembled the company\u2019s plan in general outline. California imposed an annual excise (similar in some respects to that found in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 20. as amended in 1943) based upon the amount of gross premiums, less return premiums, received from each company\u2019s business done in California. The court recognized (at p. 560) that the \u201cretirement plan . . . contains . . . many features . . . generally found in group annuity policies . . . regularly issued by. insurers.\u201d As the court remarked, \u201cThe same could be said of any comprehensive retirement plan.\u201d Nevertheless, the court concluded that the plan was not within the tax measure since \u201cthe retentions ... of a part of wages due . participating employees were not premiums received . . . upon its business done\u201d as the term was used in the tax statute and \u201cthat . . . [the] retirement plan did not . . . constitute an insurance policy or an annuity contract.within the meaning\u201d of the statute. The court said (at p. 561), \u201cRegardless of the noted similarities in so many of the [plan\u2019s] provisions . . . to those found in annuity policies regularly sold by insurers, the great dissimilarity which inheres in the total absence of profit motive . . . compels a conclusion that the . . . employees\u2019 retirement plan cannot be classified as insurance business ... in this state. Such was not its purpose and such was not its nature. Had this plan been . . . maintained by an employer who was not an insurer ... no one would contend that it was an insurance contract or that its . . . maintenance constituted the doing of insurance business. . . . [T]hat respondent is an insurer is not competent to alter either the purpose.or the nature of its employees\u2019retirement plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Little light is shed by examination of the history of the statutes relating to life insurance company pensions. Statute 1907, c. 576, \u00a7 27, forbade insurance companies to \u201cpay any pension whatsoever.\u201d By St. 1913, c. 613, \u00a7 1, pensions were permitted, subject to the requirement, among others, that any company paying pensions of $10,000 or more in any year should \u201cestablish an employees\u2019 savings fund or contributory pension system ... to which fund or system the employees shall contribute . . . not less than the amount contributed by the company.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No language of the 1938 act suggests that the Legislature had taxation in mind at all nor does its legislative history indicate (see 1938 Sen. Doc. No. 324) whether more was intended by the 1938 amendment of \u00a7 36 than to allow insurance company pensions under group contracts in a manner which would be administratively feasible and would also protect company solvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The history of c. 63, \u00a7 20, is equally unrevealing. The basic principles of the insurance excise (a percentage excise upon \u201cthe aggregate net value of all policies in force on\u201d the preceding December 31) enacted by St. 1880, c. 227, \u00a7 1, have continued except to the extent that the premium tax basis was introduced by St. 1943, c. 531, \u00a7 1. The 1880 excise was soon held not to be unconstitutionally unequal. See <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>133 Mass. 161. This court said (at pp. 163-164), \u201cmaking contracts of insurance and . . . paying losses\u201d do not constitute \u201cthe only important function exercised by life insurance corporations. . . . [A] nother . . . function has been engrafted upon the system, that of receiving, . . . investing and managing property for the benefit of the policy holders.\u201d Then after reviewing the method by which the existence of \u201cnet values\u201d of policies comes about, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>proceeded (at pp. 164-165), \u201cThe fund thus accumulated is . . . held by . . . [the insurer] as a quasi trustee, for . . . the policy holders. It has the legal title . . . but holds the property in the exercise of a franchise ... to receive . . . it for the benefit of others. . . . Companies doing business upon this plan thus resemble savings banks, exercising the franchise ... of receiving, investing and managing the money of numerous.policy holders. It is this franchise . . . which is taxed . . ..\u201d The opinion continues (p. 165), \u201cRegarding the statute as intended to tax the . . . privilege of holding and managing the property of others, the method adopted to ascertain the value of this privilege is not unreasonable. The net value of a policy represents approximately the . . . payments ... by the holder in excess of the yearly cost of insurance, and thus the aggregate net values which furnish the basis of this tax represent approximately the amount of money of [Massachusetts] citizens . . . which the company ... is investing and managing by virtue of its franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This language, of course, had no relevance to any employees \u2019 retirement fund of a company subject to the excise. It was written over fifty years before the 1938 amendment of c. 175, \u00a7 36, made such a fund possible. Even if some of the language may seem broad enough to include the holding of such funds as within the privilege taxed, the only reserve funds really considered by the court must have been those held by a taxed company for persons who had bought policies or annuities in the regular course of business. The 1941 and 1943 amendments (see 1943 House Doc. No. 546) of c. 63, \u00a7 20, the only ones passed after the amendment of c. 175, \u00a7 36, contain no explicit imposition of a tax measured by such employees\u2019 retirement funds, and shed no light on the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The question before us under \u00a7 20 cannot be determined merely by saying that the company as insurer cannot contract with itself as employer and that, therefore, 6 GAC cannot be a policy within the excise measure. Cf. <em>Yosemite Portland Cement Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>59 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>App. 2d 39, 43. We have no doubt that, at least between the company and its participating employees, contracts do exist which incorporate by reference the provisions of 6 GAC. These contracts, apart from the circumstance that the company has paid a great part of their cost, are in many respects similar to what the employees would have received under commercial annuity contracts. 6 GAC, however, is not a product of the company\u2019s solicitation of the purchase of insurance policies by the general public. Instead, it is one aspect of the company\u2019s employer-employee relations, a method by which it assumes an expense to facilitate its business and compensates its employees for services in its usual insurance operations. This is indicated by the circumstance that the company pays such a large part of the cost and that the employees \u2019 contributions vary in relation to the character of employment and salary of the covered employees, respectively. The net values created by the company\u2019s contribution do not represent directly premiums paid by the company\u2019s customers for their coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Some analogy may be found in the situation considered in <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>317 Mass. 612, 615. There it was held that payments to retired employees under a retirement plan were not taxable as income from annuities under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 5 (a), but were retirement allowances taxable as business income under \u00a7 5 (b). This court, looking at the substance of the situation, said that the payments had \u201ctheir source in the employer and employee relationship and are in the nature of further compensation for services\u201d and hence retirement allowances, even though the employee \u201chad made contributions in order ... to join the plan\u201d and despite the fact (see p. 616) that the \u2018 \u2018 allowances were paid through an insurance company.\u201d Although the <em>Everett </em>case is not a direct precedent, it is an example of testing the applicability of a tax by the true nature of the property taxed or constituting the measure of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The commission argues that the use of the words \u201ccontract,\u201d \u201cpremium,\u201d and \u201cgroup policy\u201d in the third para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>graph of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 36 (see footnote 3, <em>supra), </em>indicates a legislative intention that these arrangements be treated as \u201cpolicies.\u2019\u2019 It relies upon the stipulation that the insurance commissioner would testify that, in his \u201copinion,\u201d it is his duty under c. 175, \u00a7 9, to \u201ccompute the reserve liability ... of ... 6 GAO\u201d in computing the year-end \u201creserve liability or net value ... of every life company . . . with respect to . . . policies or contracts.\u201d In interpreting the insurance excise provisions of c. 63, on occasion we have looked to c. 175 for clarification. See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>328 Mass. 404, 407-408. Indeed, c. 63, \u00a7 20 (see footnote 1, <em>supra), </em>expressly refers to c. 175, \u00a7 9, as governing the computation of the \u201caggregate net value\u201d of policies constituting \u201cordinary business\u201d of the company. The insurance commissioner\u2019s views about his duties under \u00a7 9, even if admissible, are not controlling, nor does c. 63, \u00a7 20, purport to make c. 175, \u00a7 9, conclusive of what constitutes a policy for purposes of the excise. Each of these sections should be interpreted in a manner consistent with its separate purpose. Section 9 is designed to make certain that each insurance company (see par. 8 already quoted) \u201chold[s] funds of an amount equal\u201d to its reserve liability \u201cabove all its other liabilities.\u201d Company solvency obviously thereby will be promoted. The liability under 6 GAO, even if it arises out of the employer-employee relationship rather than from usual insurance policy sales, is a liability of a type which should be protected in the public interest by adequate reserves. That, for the purposes of \u00a7 9, the reserves behind 6 GAG may be included in determining the company\u2019s financial position, does not necessarily mean that 6 GAO is a. policy for the different purposes of c. 63, \u00a7 20. That is a question of what the Legislature meant the measure of the excise to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">It was agreed that from \u201cthe inception of 6 GAG through . . . 1955, the . . . [company] included in its net value of policies (and paid its . . . excise measured thereby) the Massachusetts portion of its reserve liability for its as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>sumption of cost under . . . 6 GAG.\u201d The company is not bound in 1956 and 1957 by its practice in earlier years under an ambiguous statute. The stipulation falls short of showing any published tax regulation uniformly adopted with respect to all insurance companies similarly situated and contemporaneous with the 1938 statute amending c. 175, \u00a7 36. Cf. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>321 Mass. 31, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We have attempted to give due weight to all the considerations mentioned above bearing upon the proper interpretation of the 1941 version of c. 63, \u00a7 20, read in connection with the relevant provisions of c. 175. Having done so, we conclude that there is no clear expression of legislative intention to include within the measure of the excise at least so much of the reserves behind an employees\u2019 retirement fund like 6 GAG as is based on company contributions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are impressed by the reasoning of the California court in the <em>California-Western States Life Ins. Co. </em>case (151 Cal. App. 2d 559) already quoted differentiating between a company\u2019s own employees\u2019 retirement fund and a group annuity or policy commercially issued in the ordinary course of the insurance business. We think serious doubt exists whether the Legislature had any intention to classify the retirement fund for taxation with policies issued in normal course. Because real doubt as to the legislative intention exists, under the familiar principles mentioned by the Appellate Tax Board such doubts are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. Were we to decide otherwise, we would improperly lay undue emphasis on a possible \u201cliteral meaning\u201d of the word \u201cpolicies\u201d in the 1941 version of \u00a7 20 and include within the scope of \u00a7 20 reserves which \u201cdo not fairly come within its spirit and intent.\u201d See <em>Kenney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295; <em>Hodgerney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>324 Mass. 703, 706. If the result reached is \u201cunintended,\u201d we assume that \u201cthe Legislature will he able to enact a clarifying amendment.\u201d See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins.

[Par. 4] The term \u2018-employee,\u2019 as used in this section, shall include an officer.\u2019\u2019 The second and third sentences of the third paragraph were revised by the 1954 statute from their original 1938 form in respects which do \"not s\u00e9em t\u00f3 be materia) here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> These provisions, later embodied in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 36, were further relaxed, in minor respects not now relevant, by St. 1931, c. 290, St. 1935, c. 140, and St. 1936, c. 61. Amendments after 1938 by St. 1951, c. 125, and St. 1954, c. 75, do not affect .the present problem. We do not find the later adopted provisions of c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 36A and 36B, inserted by St. 1948, c. 496, and St. 1954, c. 247, of assistance in interpreting what was done in 1938.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\"> The company has raised no question with respect to that part of the net value of 6 GAG created by employee contributions and we do not deal with it. Although the tax statute provides (see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>337 Mass. 502, 507) no method of segregation of values arising under a contract like 6 GAG, the portion of the company\u2019s liability based upon its own contributions seems to us to be outside the scope of \u00a7 20, whatever may be the situation with respect to the remaining liability of the company under 6 GAO.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
