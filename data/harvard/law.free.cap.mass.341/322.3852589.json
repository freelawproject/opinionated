G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended by St. 1957, c. 155. The purpose of the petition is to quash the action of the respondent school building commission of the city of Springfield in treating as valid a subbid of West Side Heating Co. Inc. for heating and ventilating work on the North Branch Parkway School.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The case was heard upon the petition and return. The respondent was the awarding authority under the procedure provided in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, as appearing in St. 1956, c. 679, \u00a7 1. The subbid of West Side in the amount of $92,200 was the lowest. That of the petitioner in the amount of $96,768 was the second lowest. The specifications required that a price be submitted for the omission of certain work as \u201cAlternate B.\u201d West Side submitted a deduction of $6,236 for \u201cAlternate A,\u201d and left blank the space immediately below for use for \u201cAlternate B. \u2019\u2019 \u201cAlternate A\u201d applied only to a subcontract for electrical work and was intended for an addition to the bid price for certain work. The petitioner submitted a deduction of $7,100 for \u201cAlternate B\u201d and wrote \u201cNone\u201d for \u201cAlternate A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The respondent included both names in the list of sub-bidders required by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, inserted by St. 1956, c. 679, \u00a7 1, to be mailed to general contractors who were \u201con record as having taken a set of plans and specifications,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and showed the West Side deduction as one for \u201cAlternate B.\u201d The respondent later voted to award the general contract to the low bidder, J. Gr. Boy &amp; Sons Co., and to eliminate \u201cAlternate B\u201d in the subcontract for heating and ventilating work.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Section 44H also provides that the awarding authority \u201cshall reject every sub-bid . . . which is on a form not completely filled in, or which is incomplete, conditional or obscure, or which contains any addition not called for.\u201d The petitioner contends that the West Side subbid was \u201cincomplete\u201d in having no figure for \u201cAlternate B\u201d and in containing an \u201caddition not called for\u201d by reason of the presence of a figure for \u201cAlternate A.\u201d This argument inherently carries its own refutation. There was an obvious clerical error which deceived no one. As \u201cAlternate A\u201d had no application to the heating and ventilating subcontract, and was intended as an addition on another subcontract, the submission of a deduction for it was meaningless. With the space left blank opposite \u201cAlternate B\u2019\u2019 the figure submitted as a deduction was reasonably understood to have been for that alternate which was alone pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The legislative intent to protect the public <em>(Grande &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>School Housing Comm, of No. Reading, </em>334 Mass. 252, 258) does not require that \u00a7 44H be given the harsh and unreasonable construction which would be necessary to strike down the West Side subbid. Our earlier decisions do not support the petitioner. In <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>328 Mass. 608, the general contractor changed a subbid. In <em>East Side Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>329 Mass. 347, the subbidder selected, the general contractor, had filed no subbid. In the <em>Grande </em>case the subbid was for a different performance from that described in the specifications. See <em>Loranger </em>v. <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Regional High Sch. Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>338 Mass. 450; <em>John D. Ahern Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Acton-Boxborough Regional Sch. Dist. </em>340 Mass. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
