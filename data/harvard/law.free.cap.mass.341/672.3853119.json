Golden in the Probate Court for the county of Hampden for adjudication of recovery of competence. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 94A, inserted by St. 1947, c. 681, as amended by St. 1959, c. 293. The petitioner was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity in the Superior Court for the county of Hampden on September 5,1953. Pursuant to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 101, he was ordered committed to the Worcester State Hospital during the term of his natural life.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that (1) the Probate Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition, and (2) the petitioner\u2019s rights are governed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 101. The judge took the motion under advisement and heard the petition on the merits. Three competent psychiatrists testified in substance that the petitioner was sane and had been sane during the past seven years. No evidence was offered to the contrary, and the judge found that the petitioner is sane and entitled to be discharged if the Probate Court has jurisdiction. The case is here on report. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">The petitioner contends (1) that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 101, is unconstitutional, and (2) that G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 94A, provides an alternative method for obtaining the release of one who has been found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 123, \u00a7 101, reads: \u201cIf z person indicted for murder or manslaughter is acquitted bj the jury by reason of insanity, the court shall order him tc be committed to a state hospital or to the Bridgewater state hospital during his natural life. The governor, with the advice and consent of the council, may discharge such <em>\u00bf </em>person therefrom when he is satisfied after an investigation by the department that such discharge will not cause dangei to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">As we construe \u00a7 101, it is not unconstitutional. Objection is founded upon the undoubted premise that one acquitted by reason of insanity has been found guilty of no crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, 7 </em>Met. 500, 501. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>325 Mass. 510, 515. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>318 Mass. 584. Contention is then made that this section in murder and manslaughter cases deprivez a person, who has been so acquitted, of a judicial remedy for his discharge. This conclusion we are unwilling tc reach unless it is completely unavoidable, and'we think tha1 it is not. We are referred to <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>West Boylston </em>136 Mass. 489, decided in 1884, which held that a town was not liable to the Commonwealth for the support of a person committed to a \u201clunatic hospital\u201d pursuant to St. 1873. c. 227, a predecessor of \u00a7 101. In the course of the opinion there can be found language, giving a very literal reading to the statute, which not only does not find favor with us today, but is somewhat inconsistent with the opinion oi Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We are unwilling to hold that release by the Governor and Council is the only method available to the petitioner. We are of opinion that he stands committed subject, if proved sane, to discharge by any other appropriate legal procedure. We are of the further opinion, however, that \u00a7 94A, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not such a procedure. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>regard a person who has been indicted for murder or manslaughter, and who is acquitted by a jury by reason of insanity, as being a \u201cperson adjudicated by any court to be a mentally ill person. \u2019 \u2019 The jury decided only that the person lacked criminal responsibility on the date of the killing. Section 94A relates to an adjudication of mental illness as of the time of its making. See, for example, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 50 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">We are not faced with a present determination whether a petition under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 91, as amended through St. 1950, c. 684, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the proper remedy. See <em>Gentile, petitioner, </em>339 Mass. 319. If it is not, and no other remedy is found, habeas corpus will lie. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 248, \u00a7 1. See <em>O\u2019Leary, petitioner, </em>325 Mass. 179,184.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> St. 1959, c. 293: \"Any person adjudicated by any court to be a mentally ill person, whether or not in custody, may petition for adjudication of his or her recovery and competence.
