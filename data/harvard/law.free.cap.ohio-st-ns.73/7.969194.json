A legacy reciting that it is \u201cin consideration of her care for my invalid mother many years preceding her death, and also her care of my infant son\u201d does not imply a debt but a bounty. It is not an acknowledgment of a legal obligation and when pleaded in an action, barred by the statute of limitations, to recover for such services, does not remove the bar of the statute.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b67-7\">2. A legacy given in payment of a debt, by the express terms of the will, does not lapse by the death of the legatee before the testator, but when by the terms of the will it appears that the intention of the testator was to confer a bounty it is not competent to show a different intent and to prevent a lapse by proof that the -legacy was given in payment of a debt. ,</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b67-9\">(No. 9235</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AQ\">Decided October 31, 1905.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\">Error to the Circuit Court of Marion county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-11\">The tenth item of the will of William P. Hazen, executed in 1896, is as follows: \u2018 \u2018 Tenth. I give and bequeath to my niece, Miss Mary Pierce, daughter of my sister, Emily Pierce, of Middlefield, Geauga county, Ohio, $5,000.00, the same being in consideration of her care of my invalid mother many years preceding her death, and also her care of my infant son, Martin L. Hazen, after the death of his mother. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-12\">The legatee died without issue in the lifetime of the testator. Suit was brought by the administrator of the legatee against the executor to recover the. amount of the legacy. It is averred in the petition that in 1858 the testator was indebted to the legatee for services then and theretofore rendered by her at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>his request in the care of his invalid mother and of his infant son, which were of the value of $5,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">The tenth item of the will is then set out as an acknowledgment of the debt in writing and signed by the p\u00e1rty to be charged to remove the bar of the-statute of limitations. The court of common pleas sustained a general demurrer to the petition. The circuit court reversed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\"><em>Messrs. J. F.

The facts pleaded do not show a written acknowledgment of a debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-8\">This is true, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-9\">\n<em>(a) The acknowledgment relied on and pleaded is a legacy, a bequest, a gift, and not an acknowledgment of a debt or a promise to pay a debt.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-10\">The definition of the word \u201clegacy\u201d should be sufficient to sustain our proposition: \u201cA legacy is a bequest, or gift, of goods and chattels- by will or testament.\u201d <em>Orton </em>v. <em>Orton, 3 </em>Key. (N. Y.), 488;. 2 Williams\u2019 Executors, 947; 5 T. R., 716; 1 Burr., 268; 7 Ves., 391; 2 Bouv. Dic., 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-12\">\u2022 <em>(b) The language used is insufficient to constitute an acknowledgment.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-13\">The acknowledgment must be clear and explicit in admitting that there is an indebtedness, the particular debt, and that it is due and unpaid. We cite a few authorities as to the elements necessary in an acknowledgment of a barred debt: <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Newbold, </em>82 Am. Dec., 487 (41 Pa. St., 482); <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>95 Am. Dec., 170 (36 Cal., 180); <em>Harlan </em>v. <em>Bernie, </em>76 Am. Dec., 428 (22 Ark., 219). Among the very late cases are the following: <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Braedner, </em>1 Am. St., 829 (107 N. Y., 346); <em>Macrum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>v. <em>Marshall, </em>14 Am. St., 730 (129 Pa. St., 506); <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Jack, </em>51 Am. St., 744 (172 Pa. St., 416); see also note, 24 Am. St., 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-5\">2. No recovery can be had of the legacy, as a legacy, because it lapsed. In Ohio, <em>legacies lapse under statutory provision therefor </em>(sec. 5971, Rev. Stat.), <em>and not under the rules of common Icm.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-6\">The foregoing is the fiat, judgment, decree of the legislature on the subject of the lapse of legacies, and the fact that certain pecuniary legacies did not lapse, under the rules of the common law, can not change the same in the smallest degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-7\">If the legislature intended there should be exceptions, other than that provided for, to the application of its rule as to the lapsing of legacies, it would have provided for the exceptions. The case at bar not falling within the exception, it can not well be made an exception by a court. <em>Earnfit </em>v. <em>Winans, </em>3 Ohio, 135.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-8\"><em>Mr. N.

P. Hazen was legally bound to pay, whether he contracted to do so or not the law puts that burden upon him, and if Mary Pierce cared for his child, and especially if she did it at his request and on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>promise to pay therefor, he is legally hound to pay for the same what it is worth. The fact that she rendered the service raises the implied obligation to pay. <em>Linn </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>10 Ohio, 412; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Gotleib, 2 </em>Circ. Dec., 109; 3 C. C.

Rep., 657.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-5\">A.nd if he fixes the prices himself, that he is to pay, after the lapse of many years or at his death, who has a right to dispute it, or claim they were not then of the value he placed upon them? I think no one will seriously deny that the petition states facts sufficient to show that Vm. P. Hazen was indebted to Mary Pierce, and that the debt was never paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\">Now, has the administrator a right to recover the amount of that indebtedness?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-7\">The defendant says no, because the petition shows his right of action is barred by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations on which he .relies is section 4979, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-8\">But say Mary Pierce\u2019s right of action did accrue at the time she rendered the services and by lapse of time had become barred. Revised Statutes, section 4992, provides that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-9\"><em>First. </em>When payment has been made upon a,ny demand founded on contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-10\"><em>Second. </em>Or a written acknowledgment therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-11\"><em>Third. </em>Or promise to pay the same has been made and signed by the party to he charged; an action may be brought thereon within the time herein limited after such payment, acknowledgment or promise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Under the above section an action may be brought on the original demand by averring the acknowledgment. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Secor, </em>40 Ohio St., 637.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">And there is no doubt but that we have a right of action on the new promise to pay, founded upon the original consideration. <em>Haymaker </em>v. <em>Haymaker, </em>4 Ohio St., 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>There can be no doubt </em>that Wm. P. Hazen <em>intended </em>this <em>acknowledgment </em>of his indebtedness to Mary Pierce that he so solemnly made in his will <em>should be communicated </em>to Mary Pierce; <em>it was pat there in the ivill for that picrpose.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">An acknowledgment 'made to a stranger, in the absence of the plaintiff, will take a demand out of the statute. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>12 Metc., 470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">To take a demand out of the statute of limitations, direct and positive proof of an acknowledgment or new promise in any set form of words is not required, but they may be inferred from facts without words. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>4 Pick., 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-9\">Where debts are barred by the statute of limitations a specific provision in the will for their payment would seem to have the effect to revive them, and make them payable by the executor, notwithstanding the creditor might decease before the testator. 2 Redfield on Law of Wills, 161; Page on Wills, sec. 797; Jackson\u2019s Succession, 47 La., 1089. Under our code we do not have to elect in a law suit, but may set forth all the facts. <em>Gartner </em>v. <em>Corwine, </em>57 Ohio St., 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">We have a right to recover the legacy in this action. The legacy became due in one year after the executor qualified. Section 6128, Rev. Stat., amended 93 O. L., 93; sec. 6211, Rev. Stat.; Page on Wills, sec. 803. Assets in hands of executor. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Bible </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Soc., </em>50 Ohio St., 1; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Case School, </em>62 Ohio St., 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-4\">The legacy has not lapsed; at common law a legacy will lapse hy reason of the death of the beneficiary before the testator. But a legacy given in payment of a debt will not lapse because of the death of the legatee before the testator. 18 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.), 749 and note; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>45 Atl. Rep., 534. When a legacy was given upon a valuable consideration in payment of a debt of testator it did not lapse at common law. Page on Wills, sec. 739.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">If a barred demand is sufficient consideration to support a promise to pay, it is also a good consideration for a legacy. 2 Redfield on Law of Wills, 161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">Our statute does not enlarge but modifies the common law doctrine of lapse. Page on Wills, sec. 742 ; sec. 5971, Rev. Stat.; <em>Woolley </em>v. <em>Paxson, </em>46 Ohio St., 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">There can be no abatement of this legacy, and although we have alleged it, we do not have to prove that there are sufficient assets in hands of executor 'to pay it, for the legacy is in satisfaction of a debt. Page on Wills, sec. 776.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-8\">There is no doubt but what there is a right of action on the new promise or acknowledgment, founded upon the original consideration. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>17 Ohio, 9.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-9\">Summers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">Two questions are presented: first, whether the will removed the' bar of the statute of limitations, and, second, whether the legacy lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The claim for services is barred unless the will is an acknowledgment. The natural and ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>meaning of the words \u201cin consideration of\u201d in the connection used is not compensation but a mark or token of affection or appreciation. The testator does not acknowledge that there ever was any liability, debt, or claim. He acknowledges merely the fact that his niece did care for his invalid mother and for his infant son, and feeling grateful therefor, in recognition or consideration of the fact, he gives her $5,000.00. The services may have been paid for or rendered gratuitously. He acknowledges a debt of gratitude, not a legal obligation, and he does not direct the payment of a debt but confers a bounty. In <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Franklin Township, </em>43 N. J. Eq., 143, where the item of the will under consideration read as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath to Henry Benson Duncan, for his services in assisting me at different times, the sum of $2,000.00,\u201d it is said in the opinion (145) \u201cthe expression \u2018for his services in assisting me at different times,\u2019 does not, standing alone, import an indebtedness from her to the legatee for which payment may be exacted by process of law.. For aught that appears to the contrary, the services may have been rendered gratuitously and the legacy may have been given in grateful recognition of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The second question is whether the facts set out in the petition state a cause of action for the recovery of the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u2022 It is conceded that the general rule is that a legacy lapses when the legatee dies before the testator and that section 5971, Revised Statutes, enacted to prevent mischief from the operation of the rule, does not apply; but it is contended that a legacy does not lapse when it is given to pay a debt, citing <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>59 N. J. Eq., 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The cases that hold that a legacy given in payment of a debt does not lapse do so for the reason that such is the manifest intention of the testator. That is the ground of the decision in <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>3 Younge &amp; Coll., 208. There it is held that certain creditors, whose claims were barred but who were named in the will which provided that a certain part of the estate should be divided among them, should not be considered as legatees but rather as creditors and consequently that the representatives of such as died in the testator\u2019s lifetime were entitled to the benefit of the will. In the note to that case, it appears that Lord Lyndhurst, C. B., in disposing of the matter when it was before him said: \u201cI cannot consider this as a mere voluntary bounty on the part of the testator, but we must consider that the testator meant this money to be applied in satisfaction, or part satisfaction, of an obligation in reduction of his debts, which though they could not be enforced against him at law, were, nevertheless, subsisting debts.\u201d * * * \u201cIn this case, the testator has manifested an anxious desire to fulfill his just obligations ; and it was plainly his intention not to make a gift to the persons named in the schedule but to waive the legal bar to the recovery of his debts.\u201d In <em>Philips </em>v. Philips, 3 Hare, 281, where the testator gave the residue of his estate to trustees, upon trust, to divide the same among certain creditors, it is held that: \u201cThe shares attributed to the debts of creditors who uied in the lifetime of the testator do not lapse by their death.\u201d Again, \u201cthat the testator must be considered as proceeding upon a mixed principle of bounty and obligation; that the will must be read as, to some extent, directing payment.of debts.\u201d The vice chancellor says (292): \u201cIn coming to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>conclusion that the representatives of the creditors who died in the testator\u2019s lifetime are entitled to claim, I consider that I follow the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>that I am giving effect to the trusts of the will, and that I am doing that which the conscience of the testator led him to do, in discharging <em>pro tanto </em>his obligations to his creditors, notwithstanding the bar of the statute. If that were his intention, which, on the face of the will, and on the authority of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>I will assume, I cannot suppose that the testator contemplated the depriving of the benefit given by the will those creditors who might happen to die between the date of his will and his death.\u201d Again (300), \u201cAnother observation strongly in favor of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Naylor </em>is this: if the claimants had been treated as legatees, and not as creditors, the rights of the creditors to the benefit of the trust might have lapsed by his death in the lifetime of the testator. This could not have been in accordance with the intention of the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>7 DeG. M. &amp; G., 429, 432, the Lord Chancellor says: \u201cThe object of the testator was to do that which was honest and just, namely, to pay those creditors in full who had proved against the joint estate of his father and <em>himself; </em>that object could not have been attained if his intended bounty was to be limited to those creditors only who might happen to survive him, he having lived twenty-nine years after the debts were proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In the present case the claim is barred. The testator does not acknowledge it. In law it is no debt and it cannot be said that the intention of the testator was to discharge an obligation and not to confer a bounty. The intention of the testator must be given effect according to what appears upon the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>will. There is no ambiguity, and evidence to prove an intention different than that implied in the terms of the will would be incompetent. <em>Comfort </em>v. Mather, 2 W. &amp; S., 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u2022 The judgment of the circuit court is. reversed and that of the common pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-7\">Davis, C.
