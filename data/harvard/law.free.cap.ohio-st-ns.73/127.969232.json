L., 371), it reads as above, omitting the words in italics and substituting the word [and] for <em>or </em>and [five] for <em>ten.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The circuit court held the petition defective for want of averment that the notice was served also on the owner or lessor of the premises or an averment that the seller was also the owner of the premises. Prior to the amendment, upon the filing of the notice with the clerk or giving notice to both the seller and the owner or lessor, the seller and owner or lessor were jointly and severally liable, and the seller or giver was liable in the event of notice to him alone. Did the legislature by the amendment intend so to change the law that the seller' is not liable unless notice is served both upon him and the owner? The apparent intention of the legislature was to withdraw permission to file the notice with the clerk and to do away with the requirement that the notice be given before a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Section 23, Revised Statutes, provides that in the interpretation of part second, which includes section 4358, unless the context shows that another sense was intended, the word \u201cand\u201d may be read \u201c or, \u201d and \u201c or \u201d read \u2018 \u2018 and, \u2019 \u2019 if the sense requires it.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">If the sole change made by the amendment had been to substitute \u201cand\u201d for \u201cor\u201d it may be conceded that it could not be read \u201cor,\u201d but the apparent purpose of the amendment having been to make the important changes already noticed and no good reason being apparent why the legislature should intend to make the right of action against the seller depend upon notice to the owner in addition to him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>self, the copulative \u201cand\u201d may be read \u201cor\u201d now, just as prior to the amendment \u201cand\u201d might have been substituted for the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d if the sense required it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">If we are to stick in the bark it might have been before the amendment just as forcibly contended that an action would lie against the seller if notice had been given either to him or the owner as now that it will not unless it is given to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>The judgment of the circuit court is reversed and that of the common pleas affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-8\">Davis, C.
