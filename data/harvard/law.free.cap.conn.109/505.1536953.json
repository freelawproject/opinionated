Practice Book, pp. 308, 309 and 313. Consideration of the reason given for the correction claimed would compel us, contrary to our proper function, to review the evidence to determine where the weight lies. <em>Dexter Yarn Co. </em>v. <em>American Fabrics Co., </em>102 Conn. 529, 129 Atl. 527; <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 383, 119 Atl. 341. None of the claimed facts were admitted or undisputed facts. Upon the evidence attached to appellant's motion we could not hold that the court could not reasonably have reached the conclusions it did. The addition claimed under reason five would not, if made, affect the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Reasons of appeal one, that the facts established by the evidence prove a fraudulent mortgage by the guardian, and two, that the guardian should be allowed no compensation against either estate for his services, are conclusions which must be drawn from the subordinate facts. These facts wholly fail to support the conclusions as claimed by the appellant, but do, logically and reasonably, support the conclusions reached by the trial court. These reasons are not framed in accordance with the Rules of Practice; they also assume to require us to review and weigh evidence, which we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
