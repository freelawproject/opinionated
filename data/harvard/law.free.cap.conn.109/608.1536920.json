Nickerson, </em>State Referee, and a single finding of facts was made, and a copy filed in each court. The same remonstrance was interposed and was overruled by the Court of Common Pleas; judgment upon motion was thereupon entered for the plaintiff for $1013.13, from which the defendant De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Leonardo appealed.
