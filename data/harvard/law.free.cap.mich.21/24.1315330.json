He had come from England several years previously, and had resided in Detroit for several years, pursuing the occupation of a baker. About the year 1816 he removed from Detroit, and in 1819 or 1820 went to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and died there in the year 1825. He had a wife in Detroit, whom he had married in this country, but no children. His wife went to Jeffersonville with him, and died there in 1823. After the death of his wife he sent to England for a daughter, Maria Yorke Harvey, whom he had left there, as he claimed, upon his emigration to this country. She came out, and went to Jeffersonville to reside with him. She was considered his only heir. , .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">In 1801, Harvey acquired the tract, of which <em>thelocus in quo </em>is a portion, by deed from Todd &amp; McGill. This deed is dated Oct. 31, 1801, and is of record in Wayne county. This tract was confirmed to Harvey by the Hnited States, by patent dated April 20, 1811, and was then, and has been since, known as Private Claim No. 39. On April 27, 1823, Harvey conveyed the tract to Maria Yorke Harvey, by deed executed in the State of Indiana, and acknowledged there before a justice of the peace. This deed had no attesting witnesses. It was recorded in Wayne county in 1826. In 1826, Maria Yorke Harvey intermarried with Edwin Reeder, devisor of defendants in error. She died in 1827, having had no children. Soon after her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>death, Reeder visited Detroit, ostensibly for the purpose of looking after the tract in question. In 1831 he took possession of the tract, and resided upon it down to the time of his death, in 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">The plaintiff in error relied upon a grant from the State of Michigan, made in 1868. He claimed that the tract in controversy escheated to the Government, either in 1825, on the death of John Harvey, or in 1827, on the death of Maria Yorke (Harvey) Reeder; that, upon the death of John Harvey, he left no heirs except Maria Yorke Harvey; that she was an alien, and could not, under the law, as it existed in 1825, inherit the property. But he also claimed that the deed from John Harvey was invalid . for want of witnesses, as required by the law of Michigan' 'in force at the date of the execution of the deed, regulating .the execution of conveyances. If the deed was invalid, he claimed that- an escheat arose upon the death of John Harvey. But, if the deed was valid, or even if she could inherit, Maria Yorke (Harvey) Reeder was seized of the premises upon her .death in 1827, and plaintiff claimed that an escheat then arose because she left no heirs. He' claimed, also, that the escheat was either to the United States or the Territory of Michigan, and whether to the one or the other, the State of Michigan succeeded to the title by escheat and could grant the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">No claim of title was relied on by defendants in error, except that which arose from Edwin Reeder\u2019s long possession of the property,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">Two questions are presented for review in this Court upon the admissibility of evidence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-8\">1.

The plaintiff further requested that if the Court should refuse to give the instruction above marked \u201cfirst,\u201d the following instructions should be given:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\"><em>Third, </em>That, assuming the validity of the deed from John Harvey to Maria Yorke Harvey, the evidence tends to show that Maria Yorke Harvey died seized of the premises in the summer of 1827, and, so dying seized, that she left no heirs on her death. If she did die so seized, the question of fact for the consideration of the jury will be whether she left any heirs surviving her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\"><em>Fourth, </em>If she left such heirs the land descended to them; if not, it escheated to the Government.

The first question to be considered is the validity of the deed of John Harvey to Maria Yorkc Harvey. Wo insist that this conveyance was void for want of witnesses. <em>Laws of 1820, p. 156 et seq.; Galpin v. Abbott, 6 Mich., 37, 43; Wiswall v. Ross, 4 Port. (Ala.), 324; Clark v. Graham, 6 Wheat., 577; Parrott v. Shaubhut, 5 Minn., 323-8-30; Meighen v. Strong, 6 Minn., 180</em>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">II. If the deed from John Harvey to Maria Yorke Harvey is adjudged invalid, it \u2022 is necessary to consider, in the next place, whether, if he left no heirs surviving him, except aliens, they could inherit. We maintain that alien heirs could not inherit, under the law of Michigan, as it stood in 1825, the date of John Harvey\u2019s death; and if ho left no heirs except aliens, the lands escheated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">1. By Article 2d of the Ordinance of 1787, for the government of the territory of the Hnited States northwest of the river Ohio, the common law was recognized as of force in said territory, then including tire present State of Michigan. And the common law has been the law of the land in Michigan, except so far as repugnant to or inconsistent with our Constitution and <em>statutes.</em>\u2014Stout <em>v. Keys, 2 Doug., 188-9; Lorman v. Benson, 8 Mich., 25.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\"><em>2. </em>No rule of the common law is more, fundamental than that alien heirs cannot inherit <em>land.</em>\u20142 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., 53-4, 61; 2 Black. Com., 249; 1 Coke (Thomas), 90; Orr v. Hodgson, 4 Wheat., 453.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">3. From 8th of May, 1821, to 31st March, 1827, the common law rule as to alien heirs prevailed in Mi chi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>gan in the absence of any legislative enactment to the contrary, and during this period, in 1825, John Harvey died. The first law enacted in this Territory, permitting aliens to hold and transmit lands, was passed July 15,1805.\u2014<em>Woodward Code, p. 16. </em>This was followed by another act, passed 12th August, <em>1805.</em>\u2014Ib. <em>p. 45. </em>These acts were in force until May 8th, 1821, when a repealing act was <em>passed. </em>\u2014 Latos <em>of 1820, p. 450. </em>Section 1 of the repealing act repeals the act of 15th July above mentioned, by its title. Section 2 repeals the act of 12th of August under a general clause of repeal. So that there was no law of this kind in force in 1825, when Harvey died.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">4. It may be urged that, although no statute was in force in 1825 permitting aliens to inherit, the proviso in the repealing act preserves all rights acquired under the repealed statutes, and that, therefore, alien heirs of John Harvey could inherit. To this we reply : <em>(a.) </em>The lands were not acquired by Harvey under the act of 1805, but in 1801. (5.) If acquired under the act, the proviso in the repealing act could not give alien heirs capacity to take. \u00a5e concede that lands acquired after the act of 15th July, 1805, took effect, would descend to alien heirs while it was in force. The terms of the act are very broad. But not under the act of 12th August, 1805. This, act, however, was void, because not adopted from the laws of one of the original States. Harvey acquired no vested right to transmit, and while he lived there were no heirs who could have any interests, vested or otherwise. <em>Nemo est licores viventis</em>.\u2014Butler <em>v. Palmer, 1 Hill, 335. </em>And even entails may be cut down by repeal of <em>statutes.</em>\u2014Den <em>v. Dubois, 16 N. J., 285.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">5. Another act, similar to the acts of 1805, was passed March 31, 1827, and was, in effect, a re-enactment. The benefit of this act is claimed by defendants in error, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>charge <em>sixth, (a.) </em>If it is insisted that by some kind of retrospective action this enactment confirmed a title in Maria Yorke Harvey, it is sufficient to reply that Harvey, having died in 1825, while no law permitting aliens to inherit was in force, the estate escheated at once upon, his death, because it could not be in abeyance. This act could have no more force, to give her capacity to take, <em>ex post facto, </em>than subsequent naturalization. When an estate is cast by descent, subsequent naturalization does not give title, although it does when the estate is taken by purchase. <em>The People v. Conklin, 2 Hill, 67. </em>(A) Nor does the provision of section 2 of this act, that title shall not be questioned by reason of the alienage of any person through whom it is claimed, apply in this case. Here no title is claimed <em>through </em>Maria Yorke Harvey. The defendants in error are not defending under a title, one link of which is defective on the ground of alienage. That \\yas the defect which this section was designed to cure. Eeeder did not, nor do the defendants, claim <em>through </em>or <em>from </em>anybody. Their title is only possessory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">6. The patent from the United States confirming the lands to John Harvey and his heirs had no power to enable aliens to inherit lands while the common law rule excluding aliens prevailed. Under the rule that no one is heir to a living person, until the death of John Harvey, in 1825, no one was heir to him; and when he died, the common law, excluding aliens from inheriting, was the law of Michigan. The w'ord \u201c heirs,\u201d in - the patent, must be construed to mean such heirs as could inherit by the laws of the <em>locus in quo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">III. The next inquiry is, to whom the escheat accrued, if there Was an escheat in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-9\">The evidence tended to show that Maria Yorke (Harvey) Eeeder died without heirs, in 1827, and the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>in. error insisted that even if the deed from John Harvey to her was held valid, there was an escheat upon her death in 1827. If the deed was invalid, then the escheat arose on the death of John Harvey in 1825. But whether the escheat accrued in 1825, or 1827, we insist that it accrued to the Territory of Michigan. The Court charged the jury, in the <em>eighth </em>charge given in favor of the defendants, that the escheat was to the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">Escheat is one of the several different ways in which title to land may be acquired, mentioned and classified by common law writers. The title to land accrued in this way for two causes [1] lack of inheritable blood <em>[propter defectum </em>sanguinis], and [2] as penalty of crime of the landholder <em>[propter delictum tenentis].</em>\u20143 <em>Comyn\u2019s Dig., 596; Cruise Dig., 437; Crabbe\u2019s Eng. Law, 79. </em>For lack of heritable blood, under the complicated system of land tenures prevailing in England, partly feudal and partly not feudal, escheats might accrue to the crown or to private persons. But in the absence of any other person entitled thereto, it always accrued to the king as the ultimate heir <em>[ultima </em>hceres].</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">In the United States the State governments have this undoubted prerogative of title by escheat, to all lands of persons who die seized, leaving no heirs by law entitled and competent to inherit the same.\u20144 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., 424 et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-7\">At the date of the patent of the United States to John Harvey, as well as at the date of 'the death both of John Harvey and Maria Yorke (Harvey) Reeder, the government in what is now the State of Michigan was Territorial. This Territorial government enacted certain laws in respect to escheats.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">The first was the act of the Governor and Judges, of July 27,1818, section 1 of- which provided (after prescribing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the descent of intestate estates) that \u201cfor want of heirs the estate shall accrue to the <em>Territory.</em>\u201d\u2014Laws <em>of 1820, p. 29. </em>This provision was re-enacted <em>verbatim </em>by the Governor and Legislative Council, April 12, <em>1827. </em>\u2014 Laws <em>of 1827, p. Of </em>Under one or the other of these enactments the escheat in this case accrued, if there was( an escheat. As the terms of the enactments are explicit, the only question which can be made is as to their validity. This involves an inquiry into the extent and validity of Territorial legislation in 1818 and 1827.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-5\">A. <em>As to act of July 27, 1818. </em>In 1783, the State of Virginia was proprietor of the <em>locus in quo, </em>and by deed of March 1, 1784, conveyed the same to the United States upon certain <em>trusts.</em>\u20141 <em>Land Laws, 585-8.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-6\">This was followed by the celebrated Ordinance of 1787,. for the government of the territory northwest of the river Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">By this Ordinance a rule of descents was prescribed which was to remain in force \u201cuntil altered by the Legislature of the <em>District.\u201d </em>\u2014 Laws <em>of 1827, p. 23</em>. The Ordinance also provided that the Governor and Judges should adopt and publish such laws as should be necessary and suited to the circumstances of the District, which laws were to be in force \u201cuntil the organization of the General Assembly therein, unless disapjrroved of by Congress; but afterwards the Legislature shall have authority to alter them as they shall think <em>fit.\u201d </em>\u2014 Laws <em>of 1827, p. 24. </em>By Art. IV. of the Ordinance, it was provided that the Legislatures of the Districts, or new States, \u201cshall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States,\u201d and that * * \u201cNo tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United <em>States.\u201d</em>\u2014Laws <em>of 1827, p. 27-8.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">It appears from these provisions that the only restrictions upon the legislative power of the Governor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Judges, contained in the Ordinance, as to lands, were: that they must adopt laws from the original States, and that these laws were subject to the disapproval of Congress; and the Legislature were restricted only as to lands of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">By an act of January 11, 1805 <em>(Laws of 1827, p. 81), </em>the Territory of Michigan was organized expressly on the basis of the Ordinance of 1787, and so continued (except as to Delegate in Congress), until the Act of March 3, <em>1823.</em>\u2014Laws <em>of 1827, p. 35. </em>This act of January 11, 1805, in section 2, not only provided that in the Territory of Michigan there should be established a government in all respects similar to that provided for the Northwest Territory, by the Ordinance of 1787, but also adds, for fuller assurance, that \u201c the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to enjoy all and singular, the rights, privileges, and advantages granted and secured to the people of the territory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio by the said Ordinance.\u201d It was, as we claim, under the broad and (except as\u2018 above stated) unrestricted powers of the Governor and Judges under the Ordinance of 1787, that this Law of July 27, 1818, providing that escheats should be to the Territory, was enacted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">The conclusions in respect to its validity are as follows: (1.) It was adopted and published by the Governor and Judges. (2.) It was adopted from Massachusetts, one of the original States. (3.) It was never disapproved by Congress. <em>(4.) </em>The legislative powers conferred on the Governor and Judges by the Ordinance are fully confirmed by the act of Congress of January 11, 1805. (5.) The Ordinance so confirmed by said act of Congress declares that laws enacted as this was \"shall be in force in the District\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>Territory).</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">B. <em>As to act of April 12, 1827. </em>The act of March 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>1823, for the government' of the Territory of Michigan <em>(Laivs of 1827, p. 85), </em>provided for a Legislative Council, and bestowed on it all the powers of the General Assembly under the Ordinance, but no act was to be valid after disapproval of the same by Congress. The powers of the General Assembly, under the Ordinance, were <em>(p. 25) </em>\u201cto make laws in all cases for the good government of the district, not repugnant to the principles and articles in this Ordinance established and declared.\u201d The assent of the Governor was requisite to their validity. There was no restriction on the legislative power of the Governor and Legislative Council, except that mentioned above, that laws were not to be valid after disapproval by Congress, and this was not in the Ordinance, but enacted in the law of 1823.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">It appears, therefore, that the act of April 12, 1827, providing that escheats should be to the Territory, was authorized by Congress, and within the legislative powers of the Governor and Legislative Council.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">C. <em>General considerations as to loth acts. </em>That the Territorial Legislature was authorized to make enactments in respect to escheats, seems apparent when we consider that these enactments related to the subject of land tenures, a matter peculiarly local in its character. This making escheats accrue to the Territory and not to the sovereign power was not a new thing. As early as 1646, in the Province of- Massachusetts, and 1650, in Connecticut, there were similar provisions. In New 'Hampshire, escheats accrued to the towns for the use of primary <em>schools.</em>\u2014Stat. <em>of Conn., 261; Stat. of N. H., 292. </em>After the primary 'disposal of the soil by the United States, the sovereign power, the trust confided to the United States by Virginia, in respect to all lands in this Territory, was exhausted, and thenceforth the United States had no interest in the proprietorship of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u25a0these lands, and the local Legislature had full and ample power to legislate in respect to all the features and incidents of land titles, heirship and escheats included. In respect to the land in controversy the power of the United States over the primary disposal was exhausted by the confirmation and grant by patent to John Harvey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">\u25a0 But the unlimited power of the local Legislature over lands has been asserted by judicial authority. The act of the Governor and Judges of April 2, 1821 <em>(Laws of 1827, p. 261), </em>which assumed to exercise one of the highest and most questionable acts of legislative powei\u2019 \u2014 that of abolishing entails \u2014 was held valid by this Court in <em>Fraser v. Chene, 2 Mich., 92. </em>See also <em>Swan v. Williams, 2 Mich., 430; Mercer v</em>. <em>Williams, Walk. Ch., 86; Bank of Michigan v. Williams, 5 Wend., 475; 7 Wend., 539.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">As we have seen, the terms of both the acts in question are explicit. The language is the same in both, that \u201cfor want of heirs the estate shall accrue to the Territory.\u201d If their validity is upheld, one or the other of these acts \u25a0governed the escheat in this case, whether it arose on the death of John Harvey or Maria Yorke Seeder. In the former case it arose in 1825, and was governed by the law of July 27, 1818; in the latter it arose in 1827, and was governed by the law of April 12, 1827.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">IV. The next question to be considered is whether the State of Michigan succeeded to the title by escheat, if there was any escheat in this case. Our position is, that whether the escheat accrued to the United States or the Territory, the State of Michigan, upon the organization of the State government, succeeded to the title by escheat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">No argument need be made that if the escheat accrued to the Territory, the title passed to the State, upon its admission into the Union as a sovereign State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-9\">But if the charge of the Court is upheld, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>escheat was to the United States, we still insist that upon the admission of Michigan into the Union, the escheat passed, as an incident of sovereignty, and accrued to and vested in the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-5\">1. Whatever title or interest the United States had in the premises in controversy they acquired exclusively from the State of Virginia through the deed of cession of March 1, <em>1784. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Land Laws, 585.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\"><em>2. </em>The United States accepted the lands ceded by Virginia, \u2014 of which' the premises in controversy are a portion, \u2014 upon and subject to the trusts expressed and stipulated for in the deed of cession, and not otherwise. One of these conditions was that the Territory thus ceded should be laid out and formed into States, \u201cand that the States so formed shall be distinct republican States, and admitted members of the Federal Union, having the same rights of sovereignty, freedom, and independence as the other States.\u201d <em>\u20141 Land Laws, 586.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-7\">3. Under this deed of cession, sovereignty and all its incidents, which had previously existed in the State of Virginia, was transferred to the United States, in trust, and for certain temporary purposes, and to be determined and ended as to the territory within a State when such State should be admitted into the Federal <em>Union.</em>\u2014Pollard\u2019s <em>Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. S. C., 212.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">4. In case the escheat of the premises in controversy was to the United States as an incident of sovereignty, it vested in the United States only in trust and for temporary purposes, and passed, with all other incidents of municipal sovereignty, to the State of Michigan, when she was organized and admitted into the Federal Union as a sovereign and independent <em>State. </em>\u2014 Pollard\u2019s <em>Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. S. C., 212.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-9\">.5. The position taken in the <em>ninth </em>charge for defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ants in error, that if an escheat occurred, the United States took the premises in fee simple absolute, and held said land as proprietors, and not for purposes of political or governmental use or jurisdiction, is untenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-5\">If the land escheated on the death of John Harvey, by reason of the alienage of his heirs, then, undoubtedly, both the title and possession vested at once in the United States, but even then only temporarily and in trust for the State of Michigan to be formed. But if the escheat accrued on the death of Mrs. Beeder, for want of heirs, the United States never held the lands, but only became entitled to assert their right under the escheat. But in neither case could the United States have held the lands absolutely, as if purchased by the United <em>States.</em>\u2014Pollard\u2019s <em>Lessee v. Hagan, ubi sup.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>6. </em>Even under the feudal tenures of England, an escheat, though closely analagous to, was never identical with, a <em>reversion.\u20143 </em>Cr<em>uise\u2019s Dig., 408-9.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">But the modern doctrine of escheat is radically different from the principle of a reversion. It is a legislative declaration as to who shall take the title of the land, upon the happening of the contingency of a lack of heirs, or of heirs incompetent to take,, for reasons of public policy and good order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-8\">Y. It is claimed that in the case of escheat, for want of heirs, no title vests in the State until the fact that there are no heirs is judicially determined by \u201coffice found,\u201d or some other proceeding o*f like nature, and that until the title so vests, the State cannot make a valid conveyance of the land; and hence, that the deed of the State to Crane conveyed no title which will enable him to maintain ejectment, and the Court below so ruled, in effect. We insist that the contrary doctrine is fully sustained by the authorities: <em>Montgomery v. Dorian, 7 N. H., 475; O\u2019Hanlin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Den, 20 N. J., 31-36; Den v. O\u2019Hanlin, 21 N. J., 582; Colgan v. McKeon, 24. N.

Peebles, 1 Tex., 673 (10 Dig., 191); Farrar v. Dean, 24 Mis., 16; Hinkle v. Shadden, 2 Swan (Tenn.), 46.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">Without here criticising, in detail, the authorities which will be principally relied upon by the defendants, <em>viz: Doe v. Redfern, 12 East; Fairfax v. Hunter\u2019s lessee, 7 Cranch, 603; Jackson v. Adams, 7 Wend., 367; and Wilbur v. Tobey, 16 Pick., 177, </em>we remark:</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">1. In England, Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts, the rule of the common law prevails, that no person can make a valid conveyance of lands of which he has not possession either in law or in fact; or, in other words, that a deed of lands in the adverse possession of another is void. The doctrine these cases tend to establish is in harmony with this rule of the common law, and may be considered as forming part of it. It is, substantially, the application to conveyances by the State or sovereign, of the same rule which is applied to the conveyances of private persons. In this State all traces of this ancient rule of the common law have long ago been swept away, and an individual may convey whatever interests he has or claims to have in real estate, whether the same is in his possession or not. And when this is the case, there is no \u25a0 valid cause for holding that the State may not do likewise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">2. The decision in <em>Doe v. Redfern </em>is based solely upon the statutes of.Henry VI., which are notin force here, because not in harmony with our jurisprudence or institutions. Again, the \"case concedes that the king may, without office found, convey lands escheated which appear, of record, to be holden immediately of the crown, because in that case it appears, with certainty, that the escheat is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the king, and not to some intermediate lord. Here there can be no uncertainty of this kind, for all escheats are to the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">The American cases cited by defendants are all based upon statutes -which imply that the State cannot convey until office found, and provide for a remedy of this nature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">No statute containing any such implication was ever enacted in this State. The only statute ever in force, either in the State or Territory, providing any remedy of this kind, was <em>Chap. 9, Pt. 3, Title 3, of Rev. Stat. of 1838, </em>and this was repealed by the revision of 1846, and has never since been re-enacted. <em>Rev. Stat. of 1846, p. 593, </em>\u00a7 <em>2 (Comp. Laws 1395, </em>\u00a7 <em>27), </em>provides for information by the Attorney General in case of forfeiture; but an escheat is not a forfeiture, in any sense of the word.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">The only remedy known to our law, which could be used as a substitute for office found, is ejectment. But ejectment is a proceeding <em>inter partes, </em>and can only be' maintained against some person in possession, or who claims <em>title.</em>\u2014Comp. <em>Laws, </em>\u00a7 <em>4557. </em>Hence, in the case of escheat for want of heirs, the right of the State can never be judicially determined; and, according to the doctrine contended for, it cannot convey the same until some person has wrongfully claimed title to, or intruded upon the possession of, the lands escheated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-8\">3. If the law of Michigan ever required that the title of the State to lands escheated for want of heirs, should be judicially established before the State could convey, this rule was abrogated by the act of <em>1846. </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>Laws, </em>\u00a7 <em>280. </em>This act authorizes the trustees therein referred to <em>to talc\u00e9 charge of </em>lands so escheated, to sell or otherwise dispose of them, and to convey by deed to the purchaser thereof all the rights of the State therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-9\">The power to sell and convey is unqualified. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>nothing in the act which indicates that the trustees are required to cause the title to be judicially established, and to take possession before sale and conveyance of the rights \u25a0of the State. If such had been the intention, it would have been distinctly expressed. No intent of that kind can be fairly deduced from the direction to \u201ctake charge of\u201d such lands. Certainly that is not the meaning of similar language in the preceding section 277 of Comp. Laws. These words are used in their ordinary and popular sense, and do not necessarily or naturally imply any more than they would import in a power of attorney of a private owner, authorizing another to take charge of and sell his real property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">4. It is claimed that the act of 1846 extends only to escheats to the State since its organization. This construction of the act is so clearly erroneous as to require no comment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">5. The Court also charged that the act of 1846 related only to lands escheated for want of heirs. But the words of the statute are \u201clegal heirs,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>heirs competent to take.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">YI. The right of the plaintiff to recover is not affected by the lapse of time since the escheat accrued, or since Edwin Eeeder took possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-8\">1. Statutes of limitation do not run against the State, except by express statutory <em>provisions</em>.\u2014Sedgwick <em>on Stat. and Const. Law, 106; 2 Washburne on Real Prop., 499, 525; People v. Gilbert, 18 Johns., 227.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-9\">This is only an application to the States of the unquestioned rule of the common law, <em>1 Coke, 74; 1 Blackst., </em>247; <em>Broome\u2019s Leg. Max., 247, </em>which rule also prevails as to the Government of the United <em>States.</em>\u2014Lindsey <em>v. Miller, 6 Pet., 666.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-10\">Before the statute of 1846 there was no statute of limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ation which affected the rights of the State of Michigan as to land. The first statute which extended its provisions to the rights of the State took effect March 1, <em>1847.</em>\u2014Rev. <em>Stat. of 1846, 600; 2 Comp. Laws, 1405. </em>Section 11 of this act would be fatal to the claim of plaintiff but for the express provision of section 9 of the same act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">This provision coincides with what has been adjudged to be the general policy of our limitation acts, viz: that all causes of action should be governed, as to limitations, by the law in force when the cause of action accrued.\u2014Joy <em>v.

It is important, therefore, to inquire whether the law of escheat then in force here, if any existed, depended on statute or common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-9\">I. The first provision on this subject is embraced in an act adopted by the Governor and Judges, \u201cdirecting the descent of intestates\u2019 estates,\u201d dated the 27th of July, 1818, in the Code of 1820, page 29, which declares that \u201cfor the want of heirs the estate shall accrue to the Territory;\u201d and the same enactment is repeated in the Cod.e of 1827, page 64, section 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-10\">1: In reference to both of these provisions, we insist that they were illegal, incompetent, and in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>provisions of the Ordinance of 1787, which then constituted the organic law of the Territory. The first of them, was not only not authorized by that instrument, but was against its express terms. The powers and duties of the Governor and Judges are very clearly set out, and so are those of the Legislative Council; both are circumscribed. The government was intended to be dependent, temporary, limited, and subject to the will of Congress, and the Ordinance was afterwards adapted to the federal Constitution. The Governor and Judges were not only restricted as to the subjects and objects, but to the sources of legislation; they were to \u201cadopt such laws of the original States, civil and criminal, as may be necessary and best suited to the circumstances of the district,\u201d hut they could not repeal them. And although the canons of inheritance were placed beyond their reach by the terms of their powers, they did not hesitate to change them in very important particulars, and to superadd the clause creating an escheat, as we have seen. The powers of the Legislative Council were also defined, qualified, and restricted; they had \u201cauthority to make laws in all cases for the good government of the district, not repugnant to the principles and articles in the Ordinance, established and declared.\u201d It cannot be doubted for a moment, therefore, that the act of the Legislative Council, so far, at least, as it creates or prescribes a law of escheat, is equally incompetent and invalid. It was the exercise of a power which had never been delegated to those local bodies, \u2014 an attribute of sovereign power, \u2014 the assumption of a prerogative of an independent State. It must be conceded that these temporary, local legislatures, had erred and usurped power like their successors in the Northwest <em>Territory. </em>\u2014 1 <em>Chase\u2019s L. of Ohio,. 20, 25, 26.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">2. These (wo acts were illegal and incompetent in another point of view, \u2014 the property could not <em>escheat to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>the Territory </em>under any state of facts, and must, if it were escheated, have escheated to the United States, who alone could have enforced it. They then held and exercised the sovereignty of Michigan, from which this property had been originally <em>derived.\u20142 </em>B<em>lack. Com., 56 (73); 2 Greenlf. Cruise, 188</em>\u20149; <em>2 Washb. R. P., 436, sec. 3, and note; 4 Kent Com., 424, 256, note; Williams v. Wilson, 1 Martin and Yerger, 248.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">The Territory being a mere temporary organization under the general government, and not possessing any of the attributes of sovereignty, the title could not possibly vest in it, nor had it the capacity to enforce, take, or hold it. The United States was the only sovereign power that could maintain these proceedings, if, as is alleged, an escheat occurred while Michigan was a Territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">3. In order to maintain this suit, it is indispensably necessary to show <em>that the property in question escheated directly to the State, </em>and not to the Territory. It is in respect to such property only that the trustees have any power: \u201c <em>they shall talce charge of all lands or other property which may have escheated, or which may hereafter escheat, to the State.\u201d </em>This language admits of but one construction. The deed granted by the trustees, therefore, falls to the <em>ground. </em>\u2014 1 <em>G. L., 170.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-7\">The statutes, therefore, cannot be the foundation of an escheat. We are, therefore, necessarily referred to the common law as furnishing the only rule and course of proceeding on this subject, the nature of which it is now proper to consider.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-8\">II. The legal right of escheat arises from the law of enfeoffment \u2014 lies when the tenant in fee dies seized, without heirs, that the lord may have the lands in <em>lieu of his services; </em>but if another, by the implied assent of the tenant, obtained and continued in possession, that prevented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>escheat, if he had actual seizin, although he had no right to the tenements. From these cases and authorities, it must be allowed to be settled that the law did not regard the tenant\u2019s want of title as giving the lord a right of escheat. The escheat could only arise when there was a defect of a tenant, and when there was a feoffee that was a <em>tenant.</em>\u20141 <em>Wm. Black., 174-5, Burgess v. Wheate; 1 Eden\u2019s R., 144-5, 152, 170 to 181, S. C.; F. N. B., 337 (144). </em>Cases of this nature have not been favored in courts of law or equity, either in England or in this country. It has been repeatedly held that even voidable deeds shall bind the escheat; an infant\u2019s deed shall bind the lord; so a lease by a husband of his wife\u2019s lands, without her joining. So, for the purpose of binding the lord in escheat, deeds have been held good against him, that would have been held void in other respects, because they excluded the lord while there was a <em>tenant.</em>\u20141 <em>Eden, 150, 152, 171, 172; 8 Bacon, 16; 5 Rawle R., 111.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">III. If we assume that the doctrine of escheat, .either by statute or common law, existed here at the period alluded to, and that the property in controversy escheated, on any ground, an inquest of office was essentially necessary to be executed, in order to give seizin to 'the sovereign power;' and as the property was not vacated it was necessary also to seize it before the government could be considered in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">1. This proceeding was devised by law as an authentic means to give the king his rights by solemn matter of record, without which he in general can neither take nor pai\u2019t with anything. For it is a part of the liberties of England, and greatly for the safety of the subject, that \u201c the king may not enter or seize any man\u2019s possessions, upon bare surmises, without the intervention of a jury.\u201d And until the sovereignty be in possession, in due form, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cannot dispose of the property either by patent, legislative act, or otherwise.

It must be borne in mind that when the American Government obtained the possession of Michigan, nearly all her population were aliens, and a large number of them the subjects of two successive and rival sovereigns. New American citizens were of the number. It was in view of this state of things that the most liberal .provisions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>incorporated into Jay\u2019s Treaty for the protection of the rights, all the rights, of British subjects or American citizens, and more especially the rights of property in Michigan.\u2014<em>Vide Jay\u2019s Treaty, in 8 U. S. Laws, pp. 117, 122, Arts. 2 and 9; 1 Mart. &amp; Yerger, Silver v. Ladd, 7 Wallace, </em>219; <em>Vide also Opinion of Cushing, Atty. Genl., Vol. 8, 411.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">By the former of these articles, all settlers were assured that they should continue to enjoy unmolested \u201call their property of every kind, and be protected therein;\u201d that they might remain here or remove, and might sell their lands, houses, and effects, or retain them; and might continue to reside here and still remain British subjects. By the latter article British subjects who held real estate here were not, so far as regarded the same and the legal remedies incidental thereto, to be deemed as aliens. It is worthy of notice, too, that the 4th Article of the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was adopted by the Congress of the Confederation, in anticipation of the surrender of the country under the Treaty of Paris, draws a clear line of distinction between \u201cthe citizens of the United States and the inhabitants and settlers of the Territory.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">2. The policy thus indicated by the General Government was early carried out by the Governor and Judges of this Territory, in the adoption of two laws in 1805, conferring capacity on aliens to purchase, hold, and sell real estate, in the same manner as a citizen of the United States; they might take by \u201cdevise or <em>descent.\u201d </em>\u2014 Woodward <em>Code, pp. 16, 45. </em>These acts were preserved and continued, by their titles, in the <em>Cass Code of 1816, p. 82. </em>In the Code of 1820, at p. 450, one of these acts is repealed by its title, and the other fell under a general repealing clause, at page 451, but it is most manifest that this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>inadvertently done. The unintentional repeal of <em>both </em>of the alien acts, instead of one, seems to have escaped observation until the 31st of March, 1827, when the Legislative Council not only <em>restored </em>the law in its most comprehensive form, but also declared that the title of any person <em>\u201cshould not be questioned or impeached by reason of the alienage of any person or persons </em>from or through whom such title may have been derived.\u201d And these or similar provisions have been incorporated in all succeeding Codes up to the present day; and also qualifiedly introduced into the Constitution of <em>1850.</em>\u2014Code <em>of 1827, pp. 272, 223; Of 1833, pp. 282, </em>385; <em>Of 1838, pp. 268, 467; Of 1846, p. </em>271; <em>Of 1857, p. 857; 1 C.

We insist that it was in harmony with these principles that Congress passed the \u201cAct regulating the grants of land\u201d in this Territory, of the 3d of March, 1807.\u2014<em>Vide Land Laws, 545. </em>By its provisions, grants were to be made <em>\u201cto every person </em>or <em>persons </em>in the <em>actual possession, occupancy, </em>or <em>improvement </em>of any tract or parcel of land, on or before the first day of July, 1796,\u201d or by any person under whom they should claim, \u201cif such possession had been continued to the date of the act; and such person, it is declared, shall be confirmed in the title to such tract as an estate of inheritance in fee simple.\u201d It seems the property in question was confirmed and patented to one John Harvey under this act; and the defendants insist, with confidence, that the act in question (which was adopted while the alien laws above referred to were in force here) conferred upon him, if an alien, the capacity and power of receiving, holding, and transmitting, by hered<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>itary descent, to his heirs, even if aliens, the real estate thus granted, or, as the Supreme Court of the United States said in reference to the terms of Jay\u2019s Treaty, \u201cthe treaty enlarged the <em>capacity </em>to take by descent free from the taint of alienage.\u201d That such would be the effect of the grant in question, is abundantly established by author<em>itie</em>s.\u20144 <em>Peters\u2019 Cond., 511, Orr v.

The patent issued in 1811. Harvey, whom the testimony tended to show to have been an Englishman, married here, but with no children born in this country, removed in 1816 to Indiana, where he died in 1835. At that time a person, \u2022described as his daughter, was living with him, she being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>English, by birth,. and having reached this country some years before his death, but after her majority. She died in 1826 or 1827, leaving a husband, Edwin Reeder, but never having had any child. On the 27th of April, 1823, a deed was executed by John Harvey to this person, named Maria Yorke Harvey, purporting to be acknowledged, but not witnessed. It is claimed that Harvey was an alien, and that his daughter was an alien and could not inherit from him, in case the deed was void. It is also claimed that Maria Yorke Harvey died without heirs. Reeder went into actual possession some time after his wife\u2019s death, and continued so until his death, in 3869. Defendants claim under him. He set up no title,' except by possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The questions presented upon the record are both new and important, and the very thorough and elaborate arguments on both sides have given us all the aid we can expect to get in the discussion from any source. We are, therefore, assured that in examining the questions involved, we have at least, heard all that is likely to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The first question presented is, whether the deed from John Harvey to Maria Yorke Harvey was valid to convey title to her. It is claimed by defendants to have been a good common-law deed. It is not claimed that it would be good under the statute without the aid of the common law. The Ordinance of 1787 provided that, until otherwise declared, lands might be \u201c conveyed by lease and release, or bargain and sale, signed, sealed and delivered by the person being of full age in whom the estate may be, and <em>attested by two tvitnesses, provided </em>such conveyances be acknowledged, or the execution thereof duly proved, and be recorded within one year after proper magistrates, courts, and registers shall be appointed for that purpose.\u201d The law of 1820, which governed the deed in question, was the same, so far as witnesses are concerned. We think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tbis statute was designed to coyer the whole subject until further legislation, and that it cannot be supposed any common law was to prevail over it, even if there had been any such law in force when the Ordinance became operative. A deed at common law was not sufficient without some enrollment, or some act <em>in pais, </em>to transfer title, and under the Ordinance, which recognized the fact that in this country there must be many non-resident owners, and much unoccupied land, a new rule was devised to take the place of all forms and ceremonies not mentioned there, and which would have been onerous and impracticable. It has been held, and we think correctly, that under such statutes, the witnesses are essential to the validity of the convey<em>ance.</em>\u2014French <em>v. French, 3 N. H., 234;</em> <em>Courcier v. Graham, 1 Ham., 330; Patterson v. Pease, 5 Ham., 190; Merwin v. Camp, 8 Conn., 35; Clark v. Graham, 6 Wh., 577.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">It is true that the common law has been practically recognized here in most things, ever since the' American authorities assumed complete control, or at least, ever since the Territory of Michigan was organized. But in 1810 it was found necessary by express legislation to abolish the custom of Paris, and the English, French, Canadian, and Northwest Territory, and Indiana statutes, and other ordinances, for the reason that they did not exist in any attainable form, and the people were liable to be ensnared by their <em>ignorance.</em>\u2014L. <em>1821, p. 459. </em>But we are bound to know, as matter of legal history, that the law which governed this Territory in civil matters, prior to the taking effect of the Ordinance, and when Jay\u2019s Treaty was negotiated, was the French.law, including the custom of Paris, as modified by royal edicts. Under that law, deeds always required the attestation of a notary and one or more wit<em>nesses.</em>\u2014 Parfait <em>Notaire, Bk. 1, Ch. 14. </em>And for some time after the organization of Michigan, it was customary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>for the French settlers to convey by deed in the, same form which had been used under the old system, bv what purports to be a notarial contract, made before a notary and one or more additional witnesses. Some of these conveyances are preserved in the records of the commissioners who acted upon Harvey\u2019s <em>claim.</em>\u2014See <em>Am. St. Papers, vol. 1, Pub. Lands, 420, 430, 446, 455, 456, etc. </em>It would have been unsafe and productive of great injury, if the laws had not undertaken to settle the formalities of deeds in a region where there wore no adequate means for determining what the former written or unwritten law was.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">John Harvey must be regarded as having died seized of the land in controversy. He had no heirs, who were American citizens, or who were born after-he acquired his title. And the question arises whether his alienage, or the alienage of any supposed - heirs, or the death of Maria Yorke Harvey (or Eeeder) without any heirs at all, operated, and if so, when and how, to create an escheat. And a further question then arises, whether the escheated estate has come lawfully into the plaintiff, Crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">There is no serious question raised in regard to the capacity of Harvey to transmit to any lawful heirs, if he had any. The statute of 180?, under which he obtained his patent and confirmation, provided that the grantee should take an estate in fee simple. It would be contrary to the plain intent of this statute to allow the grantee himself to be ousted for alienage. The law was passed to carry out the equities of Article 2- of Jay\u2019s Treaty of 1791. It having been ascertained that there were but six valid titles in the district, it became necessary to do something to protect those who had been honestly in possession, but had not been able to procure titles of any kind, complete or inchoate, before the country came into our hands. Congress, in a very liberal spirit, decided to recognize all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>wbo were in actual possession, occupancy, and improvement, and who, or whose grantees, had been continually so since prior to July 1, 1796, as entitled to receive a grant in fee simple. Many of these were presumably. aliens, but the treaty had removed the objection of alienage as to lands held by good title at that date, and in <em>Forsyth v. Reynolds, 15 How., 364, </em>it was held that the act of 1807 was intended to reach the actual settlers under Article <em>2, </em>who could not be expected to have obtained valid titles whieh would be covered by Article 9. These s\u00e9ttlers were, by Article <em>2, </em>allowed to remain and dispose of their effects without becoming citizens, if they should in writing elect to continue British subjects. Article 9 provides expressly that the alienage of those owning valid titles shall not interfere in any way with sale, devise, or inheritance. Article 2 contains no such provision as to settlers not having such titles, because they had no estates of inheritance, but leaves them at liberty to go or stay, and to sell such property as they have, or keep it. It was held as a rule of public law, applicable to such cases, in <em>U. S. v. Repentigny, 5 Wall., 211, </em>that the privileges thus secured by a treaty could not be claimed by any persons not accepting a new allegiance, except in strict accordance with the treaty provisions. And the act of Congress, proceeding on this theory, did not attempt to extend its privileges to any who were not, when they presented their claims, in actual settlement and occupancy, which had been continuous; while as to claims under Article 9, neither occupancy nor residence was <em>essential.</em>\u2014Orr <em>v. Hodgson, 4 Wheat., 453. </em>And in this latter case it was held that although Article 9 declared positively 'that, as to lands owned at the date of the treaty in 1794, neither the owners nor their heirs or assigns should be regarded as aliens, yet this did not reach heirs or assigns who were not British subjects or American citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>zens, and did not protect descendants who were subjects of Venice. And, inasmuch, as the treaty did not provide, and the act of Congress covering the case before us does not in terms declare, that aliens of any kind may inherit from the settlers, whose possessory rights were confirmed and enlarged into freeholds, the question arises whether there is any other rule or provision from which such protection can be deduced. For if under this statute of 1807 any alien heirs could take, the result must be that all could take; and those who had no actual rights under the treaty, except to equitable consideration, would have privileges extended to their relatives which would be broader than those secured to perfect titles under the treaty, which extended only to British and American heirs, and not to heirs without reference to nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It is clear that no such right could be deduced from the Territorial statutes adopted by the Governor and Judges in 1805, allowing aliens to take and hold lands. Those laws Avere repealed before the death of John Harvey, and before any rights could vest in any supposed heirs. But his title Avas not derived under those acts, even if they could bear the construction that an estate taken by an alien, while they Avere in force, operated at once and irrevocably to confer exemption from the disabilities of alien-age for all time to come upon his descendants and relatives. The title obtained under the act of Congress of 1807 was held in <em>Forsyth v. Reynolds </em>to be only a confirmation of the original purchase, which Avas prior to the passage of those statutes. And as hinted in <em>U. S. v. Repentigny, </em>if he had purchased from Government in the usual Avay, it is at least doubtful whether such statutes could confer upon aliens any such indefeasible right to purchase Government lands and transmit them to alien heirs without Congressional permission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>But all that can be claimed under any such statutes is. that they protect rights which' become vested while they are in force. They cannot operate to prevent future legislation from barring the vesting' of any new interest. This question was settled under <em>a </em>treaty, \u2014 which is the most solemn form of a law; combined with' a compact,\u2014in <em>Chirac v. Chirac, 2 Wheat. R., 259. </em>The treaty provided expressly that heirs should inherit without being naturalized; and a person who, as a French citizen, had purchased lands under it, died after the treaty had expired, seized in fee of those lands, leaving heirs who were French subjects. It was held that although his title remained good while he lived, yet they could not take under the treaty, and that their rights depended on the local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It is claimed, however, that under the Ordinance of 1787, the intention existed' to do away, in the rules of inheritance, with all questions of alienage, and that the-policy of the Government has always been to put aliens on as good a footing as citizens. But we have not been able to trace any such intention in the action of the United States. There has always been a policy aimed at inducing aliens to become citizens, but none which would render it indifferent to them whether they became citizens or not. On the contrary, there are no courts, in the country which have enforced the disabilities of aliens who do not seek citizenship more uniformly than the courts of the United States. And the laws and treaties speak the same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The only color for claiming such a construction for the words of the Ordinance, is because it does not say, when declaring the rules of descent, that the relatives must be American citizens, and because it applies the same rules t\u00f3 the 'estates of \u201c resident and non-resident proprietors.\u201d But there are probably very few statutes which undertake to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>mention specifically the citizenship of those who are' to be affected by them. It is implied in all statutes that they shall be read in accordance with the recognized rules of interpretation, and apply to such persons or things as fall naturally within their scope. It is not customary in passing acts to express such disabilities as should be implied. And alienage has been recognized in all common law, and in most, if not all other countries, as a disqualification to hold land in fee. Citizenship gave the same rights to residents and non-residents, and the law did not require aliens to be included in order to satisfy its terms. Moreover, at the time this Ordinance was passed, it is a matter of history that the State authorities were very tenacious in refusing to enforce even the treaty fights of Englishmen, and had confiscated and appropriated many estates which were afterward restored. We had also several treaties, \u2014 some of which were with nations to whom we desired to extend special favor, \u2014 which had provided for rights in real estate on the theory that' aliens could not otherwise have the rights of citizens, and all our treaties required reciprocity of rights in the people of both countries. We never had a treaty with Great Britain which gave protection to future purchases of land, or which allowed British subjects to inherit any lands, \u00e9xcept such as were owned by British subjects prior to 1794. At the date of the act of Congress of 3807 the policy of the Government had become settled. The treaty of peace protected estates then <em>owned.</em>\u2014Orr v. <em>Hodgson, 4 Wh. 463. </em>The treaty of 1794 protected titles lawfully existing at that <em>time.</em>\u2014Id. <em>Blight\u2019s lessee v. Rochester, 7 Wh., 535; Craig v. Radford, 3 Wheat., 594. </em>But titles accruing after the treaty of 1783, to British subjects dying before the treaty of 1794, were not protected, and did not pass to heirs under the latter treaty, but escheated.<em>\u2014Blight's. lessee v. Rochester. </em>The treaty with Spain, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>1795, <em>(8 L. U. S., 144) </em>allowed one who would have taken by descent, if he had not been an alien, a reasonable time to sell\u2014 <em>Art. XI. </em>The same clause is found in Article X. of the treaty of 1799 with <em>Prussia.</em>\u2014 8 <em>L. U. S., 166. </em>The convention of 1800, with Prance, provided more expressly that where aliens could not inherit they might sell to citizens.\u20148 <em>L. U. S., 182. </em>These treaties did not allow the heir to hold indefinitely. No such qualified privilege was ever extended to British subjects after 1794, and the treaties referred to with the continental powers at first, were temporary. And we have already seen their language was not enlarged so as to apply to descents cast after they expired, even though the estates originally vested under them.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">There was no occasion for any such interpretation, in order to secure the benefits of the law. The naturalization laws in force at the time, and wdaich continued in force after the death of John Harvey and Maria Reeder, provided that aliens, who had been in the country prior to April 14, 1802, might become citizens at any time, without the necessity of waiting three years after declaring their intention <em>(2 L. U. S., 154, 292), </em>and when any alien who had declared his intention, and who had caused himself to be properly registered, died before actual naturalization, his widow and children were to be considered citizens and entitled at any time, without preliminary declaration, to take the oath and become entitled to the rights and privileges of <em>citizens.</em>\u20142 <em>L. U. S., 293. </em>There was nothing to prevent a sale at any time, and every disability could be removed by act of the parties concerned, if they chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The laws of Congress manifest a disposition to open the door as wide as possible to induce aliens to become citizens. But they show as plain an intent not to give any special privileges to aliens who do not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the statutes. And- it is imposible to give a statute, which simply declares that certain persons who are in actual possession, occupancy, and improvement, and who have succeeded to the claims of others who were in, under similar circumstances, shall be entitled &gt; to an estate in fee, such a construction as would transmute it into a statute for making aliens entitled to receive and transmit by inheritance, without doing violence to all rules, and assuming an intent at variance with the known policy of the times. The disability of- alienage had never any dependence on .feudal tenures, but always rested on the broader principle that .States are organized for the benefit of their own people, and that those who arc not within the allegiance can have no clgim beyond what the law sees fit to give them. In <em>Dawson\u2019s Lessee v. Godfrey, 4 Cr., 321, </em>the United States Supreme Court expresses the true doctrine on this subject. They say: \u201cMuch of the difficulty in satisfying the mind on this subject vanishes upon a just view of the nature of the right of inheritance. G-entlcmen have argued upon it as if it were a natural and perfect right; whereas it has its origin in, and is modified to infinity by the laws of society, in .exercise of the right of territorial jurisdiction. To be entitled to inherit in the State of Maryland, a right should be made out under the laws of that State. As the common law, which is the law of Maryland on this subject, deprives an alien generally of the right of inheriting, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish some exception in favor of his case. But I know of no exception, -at common law, which gives the right to inherit distinctly from the obligation of allegiance existing either in fact or in supposition of law.\u201d In <em>Orr v. Hodgson, 4 Wh., 453, </em>the language of the Court is equally emphatic. In that case the American nieces of an intestate, who was a British subject holding la,nds held to be protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>treaties of 1783 and 1794, were allowed to inherit to the exclusion of her own descendants, who were Italians. The Court say: \u201cIt cannot be presumed, that the treaty stipulated for benefits to any persons who were aliens to both \u25a0governments. Such a construction would give to this class of cases privileges and immunities far beyond those of the natives of either country; <em>and it would also materially interfere with the public policy common to both. </em>We have, therefore, no hesitation to reject any interpretation which would give to persons, aliens to both governments, the privileges of both; and in this predicament are the children of the Countess Barziza. The rule, then, of the common law, which gives the estate to the next heirs having inheritable blood, must prevail in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">If non-resident aliens came within the statute for any purpose, so as to receive the benefits which enlarged a tenancy without title into a freehold of inheritance, it was not chiefly for their benefit that the laAV was passed. It was evidently designed chiefly to protect settlers who had become citizens by not electing to remain British subjects, or whose children, at all events would be native citizens. It has been held in some cases, where a legislature has confirmed rights to an alien and his heirs by name, a design to give them heritable blood must be inferred. But an act that names no one, and says nothing about aliens at all, and requiring no such construction to give it operation, does not stand on the same footing. At common law the king could grant authority to an alien to take land and have it descend to his after-born heirs; but it was held that a patent to such a person and his heirs could have ho such double operation as to pass a fee and create the power to inherit also. <em>Brooke\u2019s Abr. \u201cPatent\u201d 63; 4 Cond. R., 339, 340. </em>A law may have such an effect where the intent is apparent, but - the construction, put by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>United States Supreme Court upon the treaties providing exceptions to the disabilities of alienage, shows that this statute cannot fairly be so construed. See also <em>Brown v. Sprague, 5 Denio, 545, and Governeur\u2019s Heirs v. Robertson, 11 Wh., 332, </em>for a construction of New York and Virginia statutes. In <em>Colgan v. McKeon, 4 Zabr., 566, </em>a statute allowing aliens to purchase and hold lands, to themselves and their heirs, was confined in its effect to such heirs as might have inherited from a natural-born citizen, and that alien heirs could not take under it.' See further <em>Stemple v. Herminghouser, 3 Iowa [Greene), 408.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">If John Harvey was an alien he could have no heirs. If he was a citizen no alien could inherit his estate. \u2022 In either case the title escheated on his death. And if Maria Yorke Harvey had any interest in the land, that also escheated; for at the time of her death there was no law in force authorizing aliens to hold or inherit lands. The statute of March 31, 1827, did not take effect until January 1, 1828, which was some months after her <em>death.</em>\u2014R. <em>L. 1828, p. 614, sec. 2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u2022 The question then arises, whether the title by escheat passed to the Territory or to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">There are various methods, whereby, at common law and under the English statutes, property is said to escheat, that word being used to signify every failure to pass title in the ordinary course of descent to legal heirs or representatives, whether for realty or personalty, and whether for breach of condition, crime, or default of inheritable qualities. And the person or authority entitled to escheated property was not always the same, \u2014 some escheats going to private persons, and some to public persons. A glance at the leading features of the English law of escheats will show the difficulty of finding exact -analogies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">First, there were escheats for felony, whereby the inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>itable blood was destroyed, and whereby the fee of the land passed to the lord of the manor to which it was attached, except where land was held directly of the king, when it. went to him. But in all attaints of felony, the king took the land for a year and a day, with unlimited power of waste, and the lord took the inheritance <em>thereafter.</em>\u20142 <em>Inst., 37; 3 Inst., 392. </em>And personal estate was in all cases forfeited to the crown, as well as chattels <em>rea</em>l.\u20144 <em>Bl. Com., 387. </em>But the forfeiture for felony (unlike that for treason) is a branch of the feudal law, and relates directly to the condition of feudal tenures. It did not depend solely upon the character of the crime, and was not inflicted merely as punishment on behalf of the sover<em>eignty.</em>\u2014Tomlyn <em>L. Dic. \u201cForfeiture, II.;\u201d 2 Com.

We </em>have no forfeitures for crime which divest the freehold; but the case of lands to which no-lawful heir exists, must arise in every country. We have no tenures which would stand between the Government and the estate, and it becomes, therefore, a very narrow inquiry, where the escheat shall go.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It would seem to be an obvious answer, that it must go where the law directs. Tenures and their incidents and the rules of inheritance are all the creatures of law, and except as to rights already vested, may be changed and modified at pleasure. And it was for the law-making power, that could control lands and their enjoyment in Michigan, to direct where lands should go for default of heirs, as it was to direct who should be regarded as heirs at all. For there is no such thing as a natural line of inheritance independent of the <em>law.</em>\u20142 <em>Bl. Com., 11; Bacon\u2019s Maxims of the Law, Rule 11.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">If Congress had seen fit to provide for such cases, we think it had power to do so. We are not prepared to question its authority on any theoretical grounds arising out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of the conditions of cession; although those conditions are significant in construing the Ordinance. . This region was acquired by treaty, and did not come into the actual possession of the United States until after the Constitution was adopted, and it was held in <em>U. S. v. Repentigyiy </em>that the United States succeeded directly to the. rights of the French and British governments, which had complete supremacy. But the Articles of Confederation made no provision for the direct legislation of Congress over the local affairs of any part of the country, and such direct government, while possibly it might have been lawful, would have been at variance with the whole theory of local government, which had been acted upon both by States and colonies. The delegation of legislative powers to the Territories was practically a necessity, and the Ordinance of 1787, while retaining a right of veto or disapproval of the acts of the Governor and Judges, provides expressly that such laws as are not disapproved shall only be repealed by the local authority. No one can read the Ordinance without perceiving that it was intended to throw the whole regulation of local affairs upon the local government. The public lands were not to be interfered with till they had been severed from the public domain by primary disposal. But when they had become private property, they came, like all private rights, under local <em>regulation.</em>\u2014Carroll <em>v. Safford, 3 How. R., 441.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Immediately after the government of the United States was organized under the Constitution, a brief statute was passed to adapt the Ordinance to the Constitution; \u2014 not to change its nature, \u2014 but, as stated in the preamble, in order that it \u201c <em>may continue to have full effect.\u201d </em>And so long as the system should continue, the whole local regulation was clearly delegated to the Territory, as it was afterwards to Michigan when separately organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Even under the old. common law notions the creation of such a government would be at the least an equivalent to the erection of a county palatine, and would transfer all necessary sovereign prerogatives. But under this ordinance the Territory only differed from a State in holding derivative instead of independent functions, and in being subject to such changes as Congress might adopt. But, until revoked or annulled, an act of the Territory was just as obligatory as an act of Congress, and for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The Ordinance of 1787 undertook to regulate the law of descents to a certain extent, but did not exhaust the subject. It adopted neither the common nor the civil law rule entire. It varied from the common law in abolishing primogeniture, and in putting females on the same-footing ,of heirship with males, and in not distinguishing between kindred of the whole and of the half blood. It was defect- ' ive also in not declaring, beyond a certain point, when heirs should take <em>per stirpes, </em>and when <em>per capita, </em>and in not directing by which law the collateral kindred and next of kin should be ascertained. As there was no common law of the United States to supply these defecls, further supplementary legislation was necessary. The Ordinance also was silent concerning failure of heirs and its consequence, and the common law of England was entirely inapplicable to many cases, even if it could then be regarded as in force, as it certainly was not in Michigan. Accordingly the Ordinance, in providing this imperfect rule of descents, declared that it should be operative until <em>altered by the Legislature of the district.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">It was argued on the hearing, that this legislature meant the popular assembly provided for in the distant future, and not the legislative board of Governor and Judges, authorized to adopt laws in the first instance. Wc do not think it would change the case at all if this should be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>construction, for it 'would still be competent to supply the defects of the Ordinance, and to cover wbat it had omitted, and if there had been no new legislation, the failure of heirs must of necessity \u2014 in the absence of any statute\u2014 bring the land within the regulation of the Territory. Congress never legislated upon the subject, and there has never been an instance of an escheat claimed to have accrued to (he United States since they came into existence. In the <em>Repeniigny </em>case the forfeiture occurred before the country came into the hands of the British government, and was therefore a part of the domain acquired by treaty; and the Supreme Court declared that, by the treaty, our government succeeded to the rights of its foreign predecessors. When resort is had to <em>office-found, </em>\u2014 a subject which will'be referred to presently, \u2014 that process is not in that class of cases the origin of the title, but it relates back to the forfeiture. In that case there was no office-found, beyond a legislative-disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">There are parts of the Ordinance providing for the distribution of taxes, and prohibiting interference with the public lands, where the term \u201cLegislature of the district\u201d must include the Governor and Judges. And this was the practical construction from the beginning. The law of descents and intestacies as adopted by that body was never disapproved by Congress, and has been regarded from its date as the law of -the Territory. It is too late now to raise any such question. But in regard to escheats the Ordinance was entirely silent, and the act passed October 1, 1818, declaring that they should \u201c <em>accrue to the </em>Territory,\u201d was not in conflict with the Ordinance. The succession act April <em>12, </em>1827, was in this respect identical. The act of Congress, of June 15, 1836, preliminary to the admission of the State into the Union, accepts, ratifies, and confirms the Constitution; and the Constitution <em>(Schedule, section S) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>provides that \u201call fines, penalties, forfeitures, and <em>escheats </em>accruing to the Territory of Michigan, shall accrue to the use of the State.\u201d We think the State of Michigan became thereby entitled to the premises in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The next question presented is whether the title is affected by lapse of time. The first act of limitations made to operate against the State, was passed in 1846, and took effect March 1, <em>1847. </em>\u2014 R. <em>S. 1846, 600. </em>The statute does purport to be retrospective, and the general saving clause provides that all actions and rights concerning land shall be governed by the statutes in force when they accrued. Section 9. This has always been our policy, and the fact that the sections are not in regular order, and that Section 9 precedes the State limitation, cannot affect its operation, .for Section 9 qualifies the whole chapter. The reason why limitations against the State should not operate without express statute, is vindicated in <em>Lindsey v. Miller\u2019s lessees, 6 Pet., 666, </em>where it is said that otherwise \u201cthe public domain would soon be appropriated by adventurers. Indeed, it would be utterly impracticable, by the use of any power within the reach of the government, to prevent this result.\u201d And the difficulties of such a case as the present, show the propriety of adhering to the rule, for the Territory was very thinly settled, and even now the State has no officers who have- authority or facilities to make such investigations as would enable them in such a case as this to ascertain, without much difficulty, whether Edwin Reeder was rightly or wrongfully in possession. The doctrine of presumption of title from ancient grant is quite as inadmissible. If such a presumption can ever be allowed to dispute the accuracy of the public acts and records, it cannot be permitted when there is in the case positive and unquestioned evidence showing that no title existed or was ever set up on behalf of Reeder beyond-his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>assumption of possession. The claim is inapplicable to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">It remains to be considered whether the right of the State could be transferred to the plaintiff before proceedings in the nature of office found. The doctrine relied upon is supposed to have required this as a preliminary to obtaining a right of entry, and an actual or constructive entry was by the common law very generally required to complete the operation of a title. The doctrine is briefly stated by <em>Comyn Dig., \u201c Prerogative,\u201d D. 6, </em>as follows: \u201c In all cases when a subject shall not have possession in deed or in law, without entry, the king will not be entitled without office found, or other matter of record.\u201d The examples given are all cases of forfeiture. And in title headed \u201cPrerogative,\u201d D. 70, <em>\u201cwhen an office is not necessary,\u201d </em>it appears very clearly that it never was necessary in such cases as this. \u201cIf a possession in law be cast upon the king, no office is necessary, but the king may seize without it; as if the king has a title by descent in remainder, or reverter; for the freehold is cast upon the king by law. <em>Stamf. Praer. R.. 54 a; 4 Co. 58, or is entitled by escheat\u201d </em>And under \u201cPrerogative,\u201d D. 71, it is said that it shall be an intrusion in a man \u201cif he enters upon a possession cast upon the king by descent, <em>escheat, etc., </em>before entry by the king/\u2019 and that \u201cAn intruder upon the king does not gain any free hold in the land.\u201d And <em>\u201c </em>at common law, upon an information of intrusion, the king by his prerogative might put the defendant upon showing his title specially.\u201d <em>D. 74-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">There was an obvious propriety in requiring some preliminary ascertainment of the fact, in all cases where the escheat is from a forfeiture for misconduct, or for breach of conditions. But where the estate devolves upon the government in a natural way by what is in fact only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>canon of inheritance, there could be no sound reason for holding such a proceeding necessary. And accordingly it was never necessary when the freehold came <em>to </em>the king directly by act of law and not by reason of the act of the party. Upon this there is no conflict or uncertainty among the authorities. Thus in <em>Brooke\u2019s Abridgement: \u201c Office devant eschetour,\u201d 84, </em>it is said \u201cThat in divers cases the king shall be seized without office, as when the king\u2019s tenant dies without heir, or if a man be attainted of treason, or if the king\u2019s tenant grants in tail and the donee dies without issue; and the same law when the king grants land for a term of life and the lessee dies, for freehold cannot be in suspense. <em>Contra </em>of alienation in mortmain or alienation by the king\u2019s tenant without license. And it seems that an entry by a stranger in the former case does not alter the case, for if the king is seized by the law without office, a stranger by his entry cannot divest the freehold out of the king; but <em>quaere </em>if the king\u2019s grant be good in such cases without office, because <em>by statute 18, H. 6., Cap. 6, </em>grant before office shall be void.\u201d So Lord Hale, referring to the distinctions created by statute in regard to forfeiture of entailed estates for treason, says that until the 33 H. 8., which vests all in the king without office, if tenant in tail had been attainted of treason, and died in that interval, the land would have descended' to his son till office found; 'but otherwise in case of tenant in fee simple attainted and dying without office, the freehold is cast upon the king without office, because none could take it else. <em>1 Hale P. C., 242. </em>And since office found had been required by statute for certain purposes, the distinction has always been recognized between those cases where it gives title, and those where it is merely for information of title already passed. In the one case the king was entitled to the mesne profits after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tlie escheat, while in the other he was hot. <em>Tomlyn Dic., \u201cOffice Found;\u201d Com. Dig., \u201cPrmrogative. D. 68.\u201d </em>For in case of forfeiture, properly so called, the forfeiture was not \u2018complete before seizure. <em>1 T. P., 252; 3 T. R., 730, 734.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">If during the life of an alien it is sought to divest him of the freehold, it can only be done by legal proceedings, but upon his death, not having any heirs, the freehold at once vests in the king. <em>Co. L., 2 b.; Com. Dig., \u201c Alien,\u201d </em>C. 2, <em>C. 4.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The freehold must always vest somewhere, and it is on this account that the authorities uniformly hold that whenever there is a defect of heirs, the title passes at once. This rule is clearly stated in <em>Mooers v. White, 6 J. C. R., 360; Slater v. Nason, 15 Pick., 345, 349; Fairfax v. Hunter\u2019s lessee, 7 Cr., 603; Montgomery v. Dorion, 7 N. H., 475; Rubeck v. Gardner, 7 Watts, 455; O\u2019Hanlin v. Den., Spencer, 20 N. J., 31, 21 N. J., 582.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">If, then, the title of the State did not pass to the plaintiff, it was not because it was imperfect or inchoate, but for some other reason. And it is claimed that grants of land, out of possession and not actually seized into the custody of the State, are void at common law, as against public policy. The cases cited to sustain this proposition find nothing in the common law to maintain them. It was only by statute that such grants were forbidden. The king \u201cmay grant lands which come to him by descent or escheat before office found; for the freehold is cast upon him by <em>law.\u201d </em>\u2014 Com. <em>Dig., \u201cGrant, G. 1.\u201d </em>\u201cSo if lands forfeited for treason are vested in the king by the <em>Statute 88, H. 8, </em>or any particular statute, the king may grant them before office found, notwithstanding the statute <em>18 H. 6, 6, 2 Rol. 184 l. 40.\u201d </em>\u2014 Id. And while at common law the right of entry against one in by adverse title did not escheat for treason, yet a right of entry against a mere disseisor or abator did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and although an inquisition or seizure was necessary in such case to put the king in actual possession, yet it appears that in spite of the statute <em>18 H. 6, 6, </em>he could grant the right before such seizure; only in making such a grant it must have been special, not of the land, simply, but of the right to the land, otherwise neither land nor the right of entry <em>passeth.\u20141 </em>H<em>ale P. C., </em>243, citing <em>Dowty\u2019s case 3 Co. R., 10 b.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The English statutes were repealed entirely by the Governor and Judges in 1810, They arose out of a state of things which never existed in this country, and in connection with doctrines concerning titles to land which were entirely inapplicable to any but a densely settled region, and a system of feudal tenures. Immediately after the Conquest the whole realm of England was so thoroughly surveyed by the orders of William, for the purpose of ascertaining the tenures of lands and their occupants, and every estate was noted in Domesday Book, with all matters concerning it. As the Saxon Chronicle declares: \u201c So diligently did he</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">direct the land to be surveyed, that there should not be a single hyde or perch of land, nor an ox or cow or hog, passed over which should not be brought into the census.\u201d <em>1 Rec. Com. Rep., 384. </em>Escheators were appointed annually in every county to make inquests of titles by escheat, and it would have been practically almost impossible for an estate to lapse without discovery. There were few vacant lands, and the owners were in possession in many, if not most cases by tenants, whom it would have been a hardship to disturb without some showing. And the nature of the tenures led to a policy disfavoring any dealing with titles by those out of possession. Accordingly an entry was usually necessary to enable the owner to deal with his property. And where land 'was held adversely the same policy avoided any conveyance of it by the party out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>possession. The whole system is a relic of feudalism, and while there may be some foundation for such a policy in order to prevent litigation, that is not the legal basis of it-</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">But, be this as it may, there was no such obstacle at common law to the operation of a royal grant of escheated lands. Nor, under the statutes of this State, can there be room for any such doctrine. Under the law regulating the action of right, in force when both Harvey and Mrs. Reeder died, it was provided expressly that actual entry should \u201c not be necessary to have and maintain the action of right, or any other action to recover the title or possession of land;\u201d and \u201cthat actual livery of seizin, nor any particular words, symbols, forms, or ceremonies, indicative thereof, shall not, in any case or proceeding, be <em>requisite.\u201d </em>\u2014 L. <em>1821, p. 885. </em>In a country where nine-tenths of the lands were unoccupied and owned by non-residents, and where it was a very easy thing to take wrongful possession without detection, the rule requiring entry was as inapplicable as the ancient remedy, by battle or by grand assize, and the attendance of four knights girt with swords, \u2014 all of which antiquities were dispensed with by this same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The case of <em>Bruckner\u2019s Lessee v. Lawrence, 1 Doug. R., 19, </em>laid it down as common law that land held adversely could not be lawfully conveyed. The decision did not strike the profession very favorably, and in the subsequent case of <em>Stockton v. Williams, 1 Doug. R., 546, </em>it was practically nullified, by holding that the deed was good by way of estoppel, and that the grantee could sue in the grantor\u2019s name to recover the land. The attention of the Legislature being called to the matter, a provision was inserted in the revision then under discussion, whereby the whole doctrine was swept <em>away.\u2014R. </em>S<em>., 1846, p. 268, </em>\u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We think, therefore, that there is no foundation for the claim that the land was not lawfully granted by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>It is not very important to spend much time in discussing the points of evidence raised. As against a mere intruder, without color of right, the English rule at common law seems to have allowed the Government, upon information of intrusion, to require him to disclose and plead his title, as a corporation is called upon to set up its franchises on an information for usurpation. But the theory of our action of ejectment seems to require the plaintiff to make out a <em>prima facie </em>title before the defendant can be compelled to answer it. In cases of escheat, however, the proof cannot be required any more than in other cases, to exhaust all the possibilities. Death of the tenant and no appearance of the persons claiming as heifsat-law, was held, in <em>The People v. Fulton Fire Ins. Co., 25 Wend., 205, </em>to be sufficient to put the defendant to his proofs. In cases like the present, where aliens were disqualified, proof of the alienage, and of the American marriage and death without' issue, was enough, because no heirs were possible on that hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The same remark will apply to Eliza Eeeder\u2019s statements. The persons referred to could not have inherited, and the evidence could not be received to affect, the plaintiff\u2019s case. But we also think it was inadmissible under any circumstances, until persons were shown to be in existence who could be connected, by the declarations, with the deceased. While hearsay is admissible for many purposes connected with pedigree, there is no authority holding that the existence of living persons can be proved by it, still less that it can be received to prove such existence when it furnishes no means of finding or identifying them. Even if persons were known to have been in existence in 1827, that presumption would not exist now without more recent proof.\u2014<em>3 Phil. Ev.
