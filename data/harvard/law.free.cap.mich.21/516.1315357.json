Kellogg, in the Circuit Court for the County of Branch against William K. Delashman, Franklin L. Warren, and Tbomas J. Bridge upon a bond executed by Delashman as principal and the other two defendants as sureties. The declaration recites a proceeding before a Circuit Court -Commissioner, by the plaintiff\u2019s testator against the defendant Delashman to obtain restitution of premises under chapter 150 of the Compiled Laws, a judgment against Delashman, and an appeal to the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Court, on which the bond declared on was given, the condition of which was: \u201cThat in case the said George A. Kellogg shall obtain restitution of the premises described in the said complaint, in said suit, upon the said appeal, if the said William N. Delashman shall forthwith pay all the rent due or to become due to the said George A. Kellogg, complainant, for the said premises up to the time when the said George A. Kellogg, complainant, shall obtain possession thereof, together with costs of suit, in prosecuting said complaint and obtaining restitution of the said premises, then the said obligation to be void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The breach of the bond was assigned in these words: \u201c On the 4th day of April, 1868, such proceedings were then and there had in the said appeal of the said William N. Delashman' in the Circuit Court for the County of Branch, that by the consideration and judgment of the said Court it was amongst other things ordered and adjudged that the said complainant in said suit have restitution of the premises described in the said complaint in said cause, and that the said complainant in said cause do recover against the said William N. Delashman, his costs and charges by him about his suit in that behalf expended to be taxed, and that he have execution thereof; \u2014 of all which the said defendants afterwards, to wit: on the day and year' 'last aforesaid, had notice. And the said plaintiff further-says that the said William N. Delashman did not forthwith pay the rent due, or to become due, to the said George <em>A. </em>Kellogg, complainant, for the said premises up to the time-when the said complainant obtained restitution of the. same, as aforesaid, together with the costs of suit-, in, prosecuting, said complaint and obtaining restitution of the. said premises,, which were by the said Court awarded and adjudged against; the said William N.

The bond was conditioned to \u201c pay all the rent due and. to become dud the complainant for the premises described in the complaint <em>up to the time said complainant should obtain possession thereof? </em>It does not appear that he ever obtained <em>possession </em>of the premises, but only a judgment for their restitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-8\">III. The declaration alleges for one breach of the bond' that Delashman did not \u201cpay the rent due or to become due \u201d the complainant. The rent by the act is to be paid <em>\u201c </em>up to the time the complainant shall obtain possession <em>\u201d of </em>the premises.- This of course may be before or after the' trial on the appeal and rendition of judgment of restitution, but the computation of the rent ceases at the time such possession is obtained, whether this be before or after the judgment. This contemplates and renders it a necessity that the breach should show how long the appellant continued in possession, and when the complainant obtained possession, as well as the amount of rent due. Nothing of this appears in the declaration; indeed it does not appear that any rent whatever was \u201c due \u201d or had \u201cbecome due \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the complainant. This is bad pleading, according to all rules. The declaration should show the extent of the <em>breach.</em>\u2014Lynch <em>v. </em>Murray, <em>M How.

L., Sec. 4509), </em>undertook to assign a breach of the condition. The only breach alleged, however, is in these words: \u201cNevertheless the said plaintiff in fact says that, after the making <em>of </em>the said writing obligatory, to wit: on the 4th day of April, 1868, such proceedings were then and there had, in the said appeal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>said Delashman, in the Circuit -Court for the County of Branch, that by the consideration and judgment of the said Court, it was, amongst other things, ordered and adjudged that the said complainant in said suit have restitution of the premises described in the said complaint in said cause, and that the said complainant in the said cause do recover against* the said Delashman his costs and charges, by him about bis suit in that behalf expended, to be taxed, and that he have execution thereof; of all which the said defendant afterwards, to wit: on the day and year last aforesaid, had notice. And the said complainant further says that the said Delashman did not forthwith pay the rent due, or to become due, to said George A. Kellogg, complainant, for said premises, up to the time when the said complainant obtained restitution of the same, <em>as afore</em>said., together with the costs of suit in prosecuting said complaint and obtaining restitution of said premises, which were by the said Court awarded and adjudged against the said Delashman in the lifetime of the said George A. Kellogg, nor to the said plaintiff, as executor as aforesaid, since the death of the said Kellogg, by moans whereof,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">By reference to the statute <em>(Comp. L., Sec. 4998), </em>and the bond, which is in exact compliance with it, it will be seen that the condition was to pay any rent, due or to become due, up to the time the complainant should \u201cobtain possession of the premises,\u201d with costs of suit in prosecuting said complaint and obtaining restitution of the premises. The declaration does not allege that any rent had become due, nor that complainant had obtained the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The pleader evidently understood that the obtaining of the judgment for restitution and for costs, was the obtaining of restitution and possession referred to by the statute and the condition of the bond, and that no execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the judgment or actual restitution of the possession was necessary to give a cause of action upon the bond. This is clear from the fact, that the delaration alleges the nonpayment of rent \u201cup to the time when the said complainant obtained restitution of the same as <em>aforesaid,\u201d </em>referring back to the judgment only, as giving a present right of action on the bond; thus, not only omitting to allege an actual restitution of possession, but leaving an implication that there had been 'none, and claiming that the cause of action accrued upon the rendition of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">It is clear, we think, from the language of the statute and of the bond, that no right of action accrues upon the bond until actual restitution and possession have been obtained. The judgment might be taken to this Court and reversed, in which case there would be no breach of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Such actual restitution or obtaining of the possession not being alleged, the declaration shows no cause of action, admitting the truth of all its allegations and of all the inferences warranted by the facts stated in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">But, a trial having been had before the Court below, and a judgment obtained for the plaintiff, all defects are cured which would have been cured by a verdict. And it is insisted by defendant in error, that this declaration would be good after verdict, on the ground that we are to presume that all the facts were proved on the trial which were necessary to support the action. But the rule at common law certainly was not so broad as this. And we think our statute <em>(Comp. L., </em>\u00a7 <em>4419, sub. 8) </em>was intended to adopt the common-law rule. We so held in <em>Kean v. Mitchell, 13 Mich., 207, 212, and 213.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The facts, we are to presume after verdict, to have been proved, depend upon the issue made by the pleadings. If a declaration in <em>assumpsit </em>does not formally or informally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>or even argumentatively, allege any consideration whatever, but the issue is upon a mere <em>nudum pactum, </em>no consideration will be presumed, because none appears to have been claimed to exist; and the verdict will not cure this \u25a0defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">But if it contain any allegation from which the Court can see that the plaintiff claimed the existence of such consideration; in other words, if the consideration is informally, or only argumentatively, or inferentially alleged; then, if the defendant do not demur, but choose to go to trial upon the facts, a verdict against him properly authorizes the presumption that a consideration was proved on the trial; and so of any fact omitted to be stated in the declaration; if it be one which is fairly inferable from other facts stated in, or the case made by the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Thus Mr. Chitty lays it down <em>(1 Chitty\u2019s Pl., 7 Amer. ed., p. 713) </em>that \u201cthe particular thing which is presumed to have been proved must always be such as can be implied from the allegations on the record, by fair and reasonable intendment.\u201d The case of <em>Kean v. Mitchell, ubi supra, </em>explains both branches of the rule, though the case itself furnished an illustration of but one. The present case furnishes an example of both. Thus, it is clear from the allegations in the declaration, that the pleader did not intend to allege, or base his right of action upon, the actual restitution or obtaining of possession; and the declaration affirmatively shows, that he claimed that tbe judgment, of itself, constituted the restitution and obtaining of the possession required, as the basis of his action, or breach of the bond. This was the theory of the declaration, and it is quite as reasonable to infer that the Court acted upon this theory and found in favor of the plaintiff upon proof of the judgment alone, as that he required or received proof of the actual restitution or restoration of the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>sion, which, upon the whole theory of the declaration, was not even inferentially claimed to have occurred. To infer the fact would be to go outside of the declaration and to depart from the theory of the action presented by it. No inference, \u00a1therefore, can be warranted that this tact was proved. This omission is not, therefore, cured by the verdict nor by the trial before the Court and the'judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u25a0On the other hand the case furnishes an example of the proper application of the rule, in which a fact, omitted or only.argumentatively to be inferred from the declaration, is to be presumed, after verdict, to have been proved. The declaration omits to state that any rent had become due; but in alleging the breach, it asserts that the said Delashman \u201cdid not forthwith pay the rent due' or to become due/\u2019 This may be said to be an argumentative statement that some rent was due, or at least an intimation that some rent was claimed to be due, and proof of this fact might therefore be presumed after verdict, had the declaration in other respects been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The judgment, therefore, must be reversed with costs in both courts, but no new trial should be awarded,' as no cause of action is stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">But as the Circuit Court might, in its discretion, permit an amendment of the declaration, the record should be remitted to that Court to enable it to exercise that- discretion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b523-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
