Gonzalez-Rivas first argues that his 24-month above-guidelines sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not provide adequate reasons for the sentence variance. He also asserts that the written judgment conflicts with the oral pronouncement at sentencing because the district court, in imposing the $2,500 fine, stated that he did not have to pay the fine if deported, but that the qualification is not reflected in the written judgment. As an initial matter, the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to supplement the record on appeal with the sealed sentencing memorandum is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-22\">Gonzalez-Rivas\u2019s assertion that the district court articulated insufficient reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>for the variance from the guidelines range of imprisonment fails. The district court explained that it was imposing a sentence based on Gonzalez-Rivas\u2019s personal characteristics and history and the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors, particularly the need to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public. The district court\u2019s oral pronouncement adequately explained its reasons for its sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.Bd 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Gonzalez-Rivas\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Our review of the record confirms that there is a conflict between the written judgment and the oral pronouncement of sentence regarding the imposition of the f\u00edne. Accordingly, the case is REMANDED FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE of allowing the district court to conform its written judgment to its oral pronouncement of sentence to reflect the qualification that payment of whatever balance remains on his fine following his release from imprisonment is subject to Gonzalez-Rivas\u2019s deportation. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
