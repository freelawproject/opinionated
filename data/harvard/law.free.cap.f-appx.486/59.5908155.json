Pierre challenges the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, the admission of testimony and other evidence, and evidentiary rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Three standards of review govern this appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a judgment of acquittal, and we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Pena, </em>684 F.3d 1137, 1152 (11th Cir.2012). We review the admission of testimony and other evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. </em>Woods, 684 F.3d 1045, 1062 &amp; n. 17 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 854 (11th Cir.2006). Objections or arguments that are not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">The district court did not err by denying Pierre\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Sufficient evidence established that Pierre, a native and citizen of Haiti, was involved in a conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine. Pierre and his girlfriend were discovered in the master stateroom of a boat used to smuggle them and three other aliens from the Bahamas into the United States. Inside the master stateroom, agents discovered four weighty pieces of luggage containing 78 kilograms of cocaine, which testing later revealed was 74 percent pure cocaine and could be diluted to increase the quantity to distribute. Agents seized from Pierre a set of keys that opened locks on the luggage, $2,600 in U.S. currency, and a Blackberry cellular telephone. Pierre\u2019s telephone contained text messages that Pierre had sent to his wife and a contact list programmed with speed dial numbers for four coconspira-tors: Widline Vaughn; a person identified as Manno; Guy Derilus; and Pierre\u2019s cousin, Luckson Morin, who was a taxicab operator living in Florida. Agents arrested Derilus and Morin after they met the boat at a dock on the St. Lucie River in Stuart, Florida. Agents also arrested Pierre and recorded a telephone call that he made from jail instructing his wife to contact Vaughn using the telephone number programmed into Pierre\u2019s cellular telephone. During trial, Morin testified that Pierre had agreed to pay the cost of leasing Morin\u2019s taxi for one week in exchange for transportation from the dock; Pierre had arranged a meeting at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant between Morin and the captain of the boat, William Roberts, to select a site to dock the boat; Pierre had given Vaughn\u2019s telephone number to Morin; and Vaughn had introduced Morin to Derilus, who intended to collect the cocaine from the boat. Captain Roberts testified about meeting Morin at McDonald\u2019s; sailing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the aliens from the Bahamas; and cooperating with agents to make a controlled delivery of the cocaine. Morin and Agents Jeffery Deslauriers and John Rees corroborated Roberts\u2019s story about the controlled delivery. And Daniel Malone, a forensic examiner for the Department of Homeland Security, testified about toll records of telephone calls preceding the arrival of the boat between Morin and Roberts, Morin and Derilus, Derilus and Vaughn, Vaughn and Roberts, Vaughn and Manno, Vaughn and Pierre\u2019s wife, Vaughn and Pierre, and Manno and Pierre. A jury reasonably could find that Pierre conspired to import cocaine into the United States for distribution. <em>See United States v. Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 721-22 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted testimony from Agent Deslauriers about Pierre\u2019s girlfriend or when it permitted the prosecutor to use leading questions. Deslauri-ers testified about Pierre\u2019s girlfriend to establish the identity of the aliens on board the boat and to establish that Pierre also had a wife, which was relevant to a recorded telephone call to her in which Pierre instructed her to contact Vaughn for assistance in hiring an attorney. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401. Pierre argues that \u201cMorin\u2019s testimony was totally lead [sic] by the prosecutor,\u201d but the district court sustained Pierre\u2019s objections to the prosecutor\u2019s leading questions. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir.2005). Pierre also argues that Agent Eddie Melton \u201cplayed off of leading questions,\u201d but Melton was a defense witness who could be asked leading questions during cross-examination. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 611(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The district court did not plainly err by admitting other testimony from Agent Deslauriers, Agent Melton, or Roberts or by permitting the prosecutor to comment on Morin\u2019s testimony. Pierre argues that the testimony and comments \u201c[b]olstered and [v]ouch[ed] for the [credibility of [witnesses,\u201d but no reversible error occurred. To constitute plain error, the admission of the statements must have affected Pierre\u2019s substantial rights and \u201c \u2018seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation\u2019\u201d of his trial. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). Deslauriers\u2019s brief statement that he perceived Roberts as being truthful when he admitted smuggling aliens into the United States and denied any knowledge about the cocaine concealed in the luggage did not affect Pierre\u2019s substantial rights. And Roberts was entitled to testify that he had been a \u201cfan guy, straight shooter\u201d with persons in the \u201cHaitian community\u201d to explain why he had been \u201cdumbfounded,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d and believed he had been \u201cset up\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d when he learned about the cocaine. Fed. R.Evid. 701. After Pierre called Melton as a witness and questioned him about his credentials, the prosecutor was entitled to ask Melton about his experience, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 611(b), which was relevant to his credibility, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402. And the prosecutor was entitled in summation \u201cto point[ ] out features of [Morin\u2019s] testimony that supported [his] credibility,\u201d <em>United States v. Johns, </em>734 F.2d 657, 663 (11th Cir.1984), which included Morin\u2019s unease in having to confess his crimes in the presence of his family and to testify against Pierre.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The district court also did not plainly err when it admitted eight statements made by Agent Deslauriers, Agent Rees, Agent Malone, and Roberts that Pierre now contends was inadmissible hearsay. Pierre\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by the admission of three hearsay statements by Deslauriers that Rees had said that he found contraband in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the luggage; Officer Benjamin Caudill had said that he found the keys to access the luggage in Pierre\u2019s pocket; or Roberts had said that each alien had boarded carrying a piece of luggage. <em>See Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276. These statements were cumulative in the light of Deslauriers\u2019s testimony that he had tested the white powder to verify the presence of cocaine and that Pierre had admitted possessing the keys; Caudill\u2019s testimony that he had found the keys in Pierre\u2019s pocket; and Roberts\u2019s testimony that the aliens had brought luggage on board the boat. Deslauriers\u2019s fourth statement that Rees had told him that Morin had arrived at the dock was admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule for present sense impressions. Fed.R.Evid. 803(1). And Pierre fails to identify any hearsay in Deslauri-ers\u2019s fifth statement about signing evidence forms; Rees\u2019s statement that he did not know the \u201cacquiring agent\u201d who had labeled the cocaine; Agent Malone\u2019s testimony; or Roberts\u2019s \u201cwandering narrative of his contacts and conversations with\u201d another smuggler.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Pierre\u2019s hearsay objections to questions posed to Roberts and Agent Rees. Roberts\u2019s testimony about why the owner of the boat insisted on giving Roberts a bill of sale was not hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c)(1). No error occurred during Rees\u2019s testimony because Pierre objected before Rees could repeat a statement by the boarding crew that they had found keys to the luggage in Pierre\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The district court did not plainly err when it admitted testimony from Agent Deslauriers that Pierre \u201cwasn\u2019t cooperating,\u201d \u201che wasn\u2019t going to be truthful,\u201d and it was \u201cpointless to continue questioning him.\u201d There is no merit to Pierre\u2019s conclusory argument that Deslau-riers\u2019s statements violated the due process and self-incrimination clauses of the Fifth Amendment under <em>United States v. Miller, </em>255 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir.2001), and <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), which prohibit the government from eliciting testimony that a defendant invoked his right to remain silent after being advised of his right to counsel. Deslauriers testified that Pierre waived his right to counsel and then told agents that he did not see anyone bring luggage aboard the boat and had no idea how the keys got in his pocket. Deslauri-ers was entitled to testify that he perceived Pierre as being uncooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The district court also did not plainly err when it allowed Agent Randy Matschner to testify as an expert witness or when it asked Matschner to \u201cexplain to the jury what the percentage of [quality] is of street level [cocaine] or use quantity typically.\u201d When the prosecutor offered Matschner as an expert witness, Pierre stated that he \u201cdid not have any objections,\u201d and waived his challenge to Matsch-ner\u2019s qualifications. <em>See Lindsey v. Navistar Int\u2019l Transp. Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1307, 1315 n. 2 (11th Cir.1998). The district court acted within its \u201cwide discretion in managing the proceedings,\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), when it asked Matschner to explain the value of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The district court did not plainly err when it admitted into evidence the cocaine, keys, luggage, and Deslauri-ers\u2019s \u201cpaperwork.\u201d Pierre argues that an insufficient chain of custody existed to support admission of these items, but his \u201c[c]hallenge to the chain of custody goes to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>758 F.2d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1985). Deslauri-ers\u2019s paperwork was offered into evidence by Pierre, and \u201c \u2018where the injection of allegedly inadmissible evidence is attribut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>able to the action of the defense, its introduction does not constitute reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>604 F.2d 361, 366 (5th Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Pierre argues about cumulative error based on the admission of testimony and evidence, but his argument fails. Because Pierre fails to identify any reversible error, there can be no cumulative error. <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Pierre also argues, for the first time, about the admission of testimony that connected him to smuggling aliens into the United States and an alleged constitutional violation, but these arguments fail too. Evidence about the conspiracy to smuggle aliens was inextricably intertwined with the conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine. Testimony about the aliens was integral to establish how Pierre concealed and transported the cocaine to the United States. <em>See United States v. McLean, </em>138 F.3d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1998). Pierre argues that the \u201c[s]eizure, [b]oarding, and [s]earch of the boat ... and the [s]earch of [his] person[ ]\u201d violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but Pierre waived any alleged constitutional violation by failing timely to move to suppress the evidence before trial or to request a waiver from the timeliness requirement. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e); <em>see United States v. Slocum, </em>708 F.2d 587, 600-01 (11th Cir.1983). And Pierre provides no good cause to excuse his failure to comply with Rule 12(b)(3)(C). <em>See United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1190 (11th Cir.2011). The district court did not plainly err by admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We AFFIRM Pierre\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
