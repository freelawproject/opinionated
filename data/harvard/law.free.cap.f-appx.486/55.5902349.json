After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AZR\">A. Conviction and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">In 2005, Green pled guilty to: (A) three counts of distribution of at least five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) (Counts 1, 2 and 4); (B) one count of distribution of at least fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) (Count 3); (C) one count of possession with intent to distribute at least fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) (Count 5); and (D) one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D) (Count 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-22\">Although Green had multiple prior convictions, the government did not file a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) notice indicating reliance upon those prior convictions to seek an increased punishment. Accordingly, as to Counts 3 and 5, Green was subject only to the mandatory minimum ten-year sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and not the enhanced mandatory m\u00ednimums of either twenty years (for one prior felony drug offense) or life (for two or more prior felony drug offenses). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). However, Green\u2019s statutory maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) was a life sentence, even without an \u00a7 851(a) notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) designated Green a career offender because he had at least two prior felony drug convictions. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, a career offender\u2019s base offense level is determined based on the \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum.\u201d Because Green\u2019s statutory maximum sentence was life, the PSI set Green\u2019s offense level at 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). With a criminal history category of VI, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Green did not object to the PSI\u2019s fact findings or guidelines calculations. At the November 2005 sentencing, the district court imposed a 262-month sentence. Green did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">B. First \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In 2008, Green filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for some crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Green was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and thus Amendment 706 did not lower Green\u2019s sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">C. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In January 2010, Green filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Green\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and then challenge the validity of a search warrant and Green\u2019s criminal complaint, but did not raise any sentencing issues. The district court denied Green\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred. The district court and this Court denied Green\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability, and his appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">D.Second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">On November 15, 2011, Green filed his second \u00a7 3582(c)(1) motion, which is the subject of this appeal. This time, Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion cited Amendments 506 and 567 and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997),</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Amendment 506, effective November 1, 1994, changed the definition of \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s commentary to mean only the basic statutory maximum and excluded any sentencing enhancements based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 506. In <em>LaBonte, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Amendment 506 violated the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(h), which requires the guidelines to \u201cspecify a sentence ... at or near the maximum term authorized\u201d for defendants who had certain prior felony convictions. <em>LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. at 757-62, 117 S.Ct. at 1677-79. The term \u201cmaximum term authorized\u201d in \u00a7 944(h) includes any relevant statutory sentencing enhancements. <em>See id. </em>at 753, 117 S.Ct. at 1675. In response, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 567, effective November 1, 1997, which amended the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.1 to specify that \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d included sentencing enhancements based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">The government misconstrued Green\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as one asking for a reduction based on further amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines provisions. The government argued that, as a career offender, Green remained ineligible for a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">The district court denied Green\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, concluding that he was not entitled to a sentence reduction. The district court found that Green\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>tencing range was not lowered by any amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines because his guidelines range was based on the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1. In a footnote, the district court found that relief under Amendments 506, 567 and <em>LaBonte </em>was unwarranted because those amendments and <em>LaBonte </em>all <em>predated </em>Green\u2019s June 20, 2005 entry of his guilty plea and thus could not have \u201csubsequently\u201d lowered his sentencing range, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Green\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term only when the defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, if a retroactively applicable guidelines amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range, a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">On appeal, Green argues that at his original sentencing the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to calculate his offense level because the government did not file a \u00a7 851(a) information. According to Green, under the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>LaBonte, </em>applying \u00a7 4B1.1 to him violated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(b)(2). Green explicitly states that he does not rely upon Amendments 506 and 567 as the bases for his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Indeed, Green does not contend that either amendment had the effect of lowering his sentencing range. Instead, Green says he relies solely upon <em>LaBonte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The problem for Green is that Supreme Court decisions by themselves do not provide \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because they are not retroactively applicable guidelines amendments. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, Green does not identify any subsequent, retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines, much less one that lowered his sentencing range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (requiring a defendant\u2019s sentencing range to be \u201csubsequently ... lowered\u201d by a guidelines amendment). Green disavows any reliance upon Amendments 506 and 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">In any event, as the district court noted, Amendments 506 and 567 were promulgated in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and they, along with <em>LaBonte </em>decided in 1997, predate Green\u2019s 2005 convictions and sentences. In fact, the district court used the 2004 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, which contained the version of \u00a7 4B 1.1 modified by Amendment 567. Thus, Green received the benefit of <em>LaBonte. </em>In short, neither amendment could apply retroactively to Green or subsequently lower his sentencing range, and neither amendment is a proper basis for Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">To the extent Green attempts to argue that, in his 2005 original sentencing, the district court erroneously sentenced him as a career offender, his claim falls outside the \u201climited scope\u201d of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>resentencing, and the defendant is not permitted to challenge original sentencing determinations not implicated by a retroactively applicable guidelines amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2690-91; <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">For all these reasons, the district court properly concluded that it lacked authority to grant Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d and review for abuse of discretion its decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v.
