The BIA declined to reopen her proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>and determined that her motion was untimely because she failed to show changed country conditions sufficient to excuse her late motion. In her petition for review, she presents two issues that we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">First, Anchico Obando argues that we should reconsider our decision in <em>Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2008)\u2014which held that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority\u2014in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). Anchico Obando argues that, under <em>Kucana, </em>because no statute expressly states whether the BIA\u2019s decision to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority is discretionary, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not bar judicial review of such decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">We must first address whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1292. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), the BIA may <em>sua sponte </em>reopen or reconsider any case in which it has rendered a decision at any time, including upon a party\u2019s written request. <em>Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1293 n. 6; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision concerning whether to grant a motion to reopen based on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) provides no meaningful standards against which to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See Lenis, </em>525 F.3d at 1292-94. Under the prior panel precedent rule, \u201cwe are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">In <em>Kucana, </em>the Supreme Court examined 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any decision or action by the Attorney General where the authority for the decision or action is specified \u201cunder this subchapter\u201d to be in the discretion of the Attorney General. 558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 831; INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The Court held that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars only judicial review of discretionary decisions where Congress itself sets out the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority in the INA. <em>See Kucana, </em>558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 836-37, 839. The Supreme Court, however, \u201cexpress[ed] no opinion on whether federal courts may review the [BIA\u2019s] decision not to reopen removal proceedings <em>sua sponte,\u201d </em>noting that \u201cCourts of Appeals have held that such decisions are unreviewable because <em>sua sponte </em>reopening is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 130 S.Ct. at 839 n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Because neither this Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>nor the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kucana, </em>has overruled <em>Lenis, </em>we are bound to follow our prior precedent. Therefore, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen Anchico Obando\u2019s removal proceedings, and we dismiss her petition for review to the extent that it raises such a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">Second, Anchico Obando asserts that she showed \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d and changed country conditions sufficient to excuse the untimely filing of her motion to reopen. She contends that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>since she left Colombia, the government has continued to fight with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) and that the FARC has become stronger than before. Anchico Obando further asserts that, because she showed changed country conditions, the BIA abused its discretion by failing to evaluate her motion to reopen as a new application for asylum. She also contends that the BIA failed to properly consider the evidence she presented and denied her motion without rational explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen a petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">An alien may file one motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the \u201cfinal administrative order of removal.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). However, the time and number limitations for filing motions to reopen do not apply where: (1) the motion seeks asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief; (2) the motion is predicated on changed country conditions; and (3) the changed conditions are material and could not have been discovered at the time of the removal proceedings. <em>Jiang, 568 F.3d </em>at 1256; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(e)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). \u201cAn alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence that demonstrates that, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57. A change in personal circumstances does not authorize the untimely filing of a motion to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 1258. Although the BIA is not required to discuss every piece of evidence presented, it is required to give reasoned consideration to all the evidence submitted by the petitioner. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1376 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing the denial of an application for withholding of removal); <em>see also Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258 (noting that the BIA overlooked or inexplicably discounted evidence in adjudicating a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Contrary to Anchico Obando\u2019s assertions, a showing of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d does not apply in our analysis of whether a late motion to reopen is excused because of changed country conditions. Further, we conclude from the record that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Anchico Obando\u2019s motion to reopen because she failed to show that Colombia\u2019s conditions have changed, much less that they have materially worsened, since her 2008 removal proceedings. Finally, the BIA did not arbitrarily or capriciously overlook or discount any of Anchico Obando\u2019s evidence in denying her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">For the above-stated reasons, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">. Although Anchico Obando indicates that she previously raised a due process claim before the BIA, she does not raise any due process argument in her brief before us. Thus, it is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228, n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (providing that, where an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, the court considers the issue abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
