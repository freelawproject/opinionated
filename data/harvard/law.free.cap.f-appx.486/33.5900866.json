At her plea hearing, Johnson stipulated to the Government\u2019s factual proffer. The proffer revealed that Johnson received personally identifiable information (\u201cPH\u201d) from a person employed by the Broward County School Board. Using this information, she added her co-conspirators to the victims\u2019 credit card accounts as \u201cauthorized users\u201d and had duplicate credit cards mailed to addresses under her control. She agreed to four specific instances \u2014 occurring in October and November 2010 and January 2011 \u2014 in which she added authorized users in this way. Co-conspirators used the credit cards to purchase retail items and obtain cash advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The District Court sentenced Johnson on Count 1 to a prison term of 120 months, which was within the sentence range the Sentencing Guidelines prescribed, and on Count 2, a concurrent prison term of 60 months. Johnson now appeals the court\u2019s \u201cjudgment,\u201d arguing that the prison term of 120 months is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Johnson argues that the 120 months\u2019 prison term is procedurally unreasonable because the District Court provided meaningful consideration only to her criminal history, an undisputed Category VI, while ignoring all other relevant factors. She argues that the prison term is substantively unreasonable because the court failed to account for her \u201csevere\u201d mental health issues and 120 months\u2019 confinement is more severe that the sentence a co-conspirator received.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">A \u201cdistrict court must impose a procedurally and substantively reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the court fails to calculate or improperly calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lates the Guidelines sentence range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the purposes of sentencing set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the sentence range. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). A district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing purpose. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d which occurs when a court unjustifiably relies on any single \u00a7 3553(a) factor, \u201cselects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, or fails to consider pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191-92 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely, reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, and protecting the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). A disparity that arises between the sentence that a cooperating defendant receives and the sentence that a non-cooperating defendant receives is not necessarily \u201cunwarranted.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1367 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1540, 179 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) purposes of a sentence, unless the district court has made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d under the facts of a particular case. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. A sentencing court should still \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] ... has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Johnson to a prison term within the Guidelines sentence range of 110 to 137 months\u2019s confinement. Procedurally, the court considered on the record Johnson\u2019s criminal history along with the purposes sentences serve, as indicated in \u00a7 3553(a), including the seriousness of the offenses and the need to deter the defendant from committing further crime. Substantively, 120 months\u2019 confinement reflects the court\u2019s reasoned consideration that, despite any mental health problems that she suffered, other factors existed such that a variance below the Guidelines sentence range was not required. Finally, we note that, because the co-conspirator she names in her appeal cooperated with the Government, any disparity that resulted between his sentence and Johnson\u2019s sentences was not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">For the forgoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
