Reyes-Mercado petitions this court for review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) order that he be removed from this country. Similar to his filings with the BIA, Reyes-Mercado argues that he is entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision with respect to asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Reyes-Mercado has not met this standard, as he has not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the BIA. <em>See id. </em>Insofar as he argues that the BIA erred by determining that he should have submitted evidence to corroborate his claims, this argument fails. <em>See Rui Yang v. Holder, </em>664 F.3d 580, 585-587 (5th Cir.2011), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2772, 183 L.Ed.2d 638 (2012). To the extent Reyes-Mercado contends that the IJ and BIA should not have relied upon the Department of State Country Report in assessing his claims, he is wrong. <em>See Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 190 n. 1 (5th Cir.1991). Reyes-Mercado\u2019s argument that he is entitled to adjustment of status misses the mark because that relief is not available from this court. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1); <em>De Hoyos v. Mukasey, </em>551 F.3d 339, 341 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 376 (5th Cir.2007). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
