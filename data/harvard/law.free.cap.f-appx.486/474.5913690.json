Heth, </em>596 F.3d 255, 258-59 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2010), which held that (1) the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause and (2) the defendant\u2019s conviction under SORNA did not violate his due process rights even though (a) the states in which he traveled had not yet implemented SORNA and (b) he had not received actual notice of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. <em>See United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 258-62 (5th Cir.2009). The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to <em>5th </em>Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
