The district court found, and Mantz herself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>concedes, that Mantz failed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to bringing suit in the district court. Mantz, who has previously been unsuccessful seeking disability benefits, stated that she was circumventing the administrative appeals process because she \u201cfelt she would get justice this way and not get any justice going through the Disability appeal process .... \u201d The district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Mantz had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1255 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Federal courts may not review administrative decisions except as provided for in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir.1983), and to obtain review under \u00a7 405(g), a Social Security claimant must have presented a claim for benefits to the Commissioner and exhausted her administrative remedies, <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.1997). Because Mantz failed to exhaust her remedies and she does not raise a constitutional claim, the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
