United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-24\">Duran and four others were charged with conspiring to act, and acting, as agents of Venezuela in the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 951 respectively. Duran was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to forty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-25\">In October 2011, Duran filed a motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Criminal Procedure 33, alleging a <em>Giglio </em>error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the motion, Duran had discovered that Carlos Kauffmann, his former business partner and a co-conspirator who testified against him, had filed an application for asylum before trial, and that the government knew of the application and failed to correct Kauffmann\u2019s trial testimony to the contrary. Specifically, Kauffmann testified at trial that, as part of his plea agreement, the government had promised that Kauffmann and his family would not be deported to Venezuela after Kauffmann served his prison sentence, but that instead he would be deported to any other country that would accept him. The plea agreement made no mention of Kauff-mann seeking asylum in the United States, and Kauffmann testified that no other promises had been made in exchange for his testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But Kauffmann did, in fact, apply for asylum in the United States, and after Duran\u2019s trial was over, the prosecutors in Duran\u2019s case supported Kauff-mann\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Along with his motion for a new trial, Duran filed a discovery motion, requesting that the government produce Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application, the prosecutors\u2019 files concerning Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application, and any communications between the prosecutors, the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials regarding Kauffmann\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The district court instructed the parties to submit affidavits related to Duran\u2019s allegations. Duran submitted an affidavit from the immigration attorney who represented him in his deportation proceedings after his conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The affidavit explained that Kauffmann could have been motivated to testify for the government at Duran\u2019s trial to support his asylum application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The government submitted affidavits from the prosecutors, Kauffmann\u2019s attorneys, and the FBI agents involved in the case. The prosecutors and the FBI agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>confirmed that they had no knowledge of Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application at the time of trial. The prosecutors also stated that there was no agreement with Kauff-mann other than the plea agreement. Kauffmann\u2019s attorneys stated that they had not informed the prosecutors or FBI agents that Kauffmann had, or planned to, file an asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The district court denied the motion for a new trial, finding that there was no evidence Kauffmann\u2019s testimony was false and that Duran had not met his burden to show any <em>Giglio </em>violation. The court also noted that, even if the testimony had been false, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the overwhelming evidence and recordings of Duran\u2019s own conversations admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On appeal, Duran argues that the information about Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application would have substantially impeached Kauffmann\u2019s credibility, and that the government\u2019s affidavits alone were insufficient to establish that the prosecutors and investigators involved in Duran\u2019s case lacked knowledge of Kauffmann\u2019s application. He asserts that the district court should have allowed discovery and conducted an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Isaac Marquez, </em>594 F.3d 855, 859-60 (11th Cir.2010). Under Rule 33, a \u201ccourt may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(a). When the resolution of a motion for a new trial is clear, the district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]he acumen gained by a trial judge over the course of the proceedings\u201d makes the same court \u201cwell qualified\u201d to rule on the motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 994 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotations marks omitted). We have declined to order discovery based upon mere speculation as to whether material would contain exculpatory evidence. <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1189 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">A <em>Giglio </em>error occurs when undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution used perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury. <em>Ford v. Hall, </em>546 F.3d 1326, 1331 (11th Cir.2008). To prevail on a motion for a new trial claim based on a <em>Giglio </em>claim, the defendant \u201cmust establish that the prosecutor \u2018knowingly used perjured testimony, or failed to correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony,\u2019 and that the falsehood was material.\u201d <em>Tompkins v. Moore, </em>193 F.3d 1327, 1339 (11th Cir.1999). For the purposes of a <em>Giglio </em>claim, \u201cthe falsehood is deemed to be material if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony <em>could </em>have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">At issue here is whether the government knew, or should have known, of Kauff-mann\u2019s asylum application at trial and failed to disclose it. Duran contends that the government failed to disclose this information, which was material because it would have shown the jury that Kauff-mann had a motive to fabricate his testimony against Duran. And because Kauff-mann\u2019s testimony was the \u201clynchpin\u201d of the government\u2019s case, Duran argues, the failure to disclose the government\u2019s support for Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">We conclude that the district court properly denied the motion for a new trial because Duran has not shown that the government knowingly used, or failed to correct, false testimony. None of Kauff-mann\u2019s testimony at trial regarding his plea agreement was false or unsupported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>by the agreement. Further, the government\u2019s affidavits and declarations submitted in response to the motion for a new trial demonstrated that the prosecutors were unaware of Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application at the time of Duran\u2019s trial. Duran has not offered any proof that suggests otherwise, and Duran has given this court no reason to think they should have known about the application. Because the evidence showed that the prosecutors did not know about Kauffmann\u2019s application, Duran has failed to show that a <em>Giglio </em>violation occurred. Additionally, Duran has offered only speculation about possible exculpatory evidence. Thus, the district court, which had presided over Duran\u2019s trial, properly denied his new trial motion without a evidentiary hearing and discovery. <em>See Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d at 1189; <em>Schlei, </em>122 F.3d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-16\">. A full recitation of the evidence at trial is presented in our prior opinion and we do not recount them here except as relevant to the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-4\">. Duran\u2019s new trial motion is timely because it was filed within three years of his conviction. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\">. Kauffmann testified to various kickback schemes he and Duran engaged in during their business dealings with the Venezuelan government. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Kauffmann, \u201cAnd there is a provision in your plea agreement ... that calls for the Government to recommend that you would not be deported from the United States. Correct?\u201d The government objected, asserting that the question misstated the terms of the plea agreement. Defense counsel corrected the question and then asked Kauffmann if, based on this deal, he was free to say whatever he wanted about the Venezuelan Government. Kauffmann replied that this was correct. In his motion for a new trial, Duran contends that the government's objection enabled Kauffmann\u2019s false testimony to stand and, had the government not interrupted, counsel would have shown the falsity of Kauffmann's testimony. But Duran is mistaken because counsel\u2019s question actually misstated the terms of the plea agreement. Thus, the government\u2019s objection did nothing to allow the alleged perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\">. Duran submitted a second affidavit from another immigration attorney involved in his case. This affidavit did not address Kauff-mann's testimony or asylum application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-11\">. According to the immigration attorney's affidavit, the merits of Kauffmann\u2019s asylum application involved Kauffmann\u2019s fear of the Venezuelan government, which was established and supported by his testimony at Duran\u2019s trial. Providing support for his asylum application would have motivated Kauffmann to lie at Duran\u2019s trial. The immigration attorney also stated that Kauffmann would have been ineligible for admission to the United States because he had committed fraud when he entered the United States using false documents. Thus, Kauffmann's only avenue to obtain residency was a waiver of inadmissibility from the government, giving him an additional motive to lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
