Smith, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-26\">In 2005, Smith was indicted for possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine within 1000 feet of an elementary school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 860(a) (Count 1); possession with intent to distribute cocaine within 1000 feet of an elementary school, in violation of the same (Count 2); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 3). The government filed notice of its intent to rely on Smith\u2019s prior convictions to seek an enhanced sentence, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-27\">Following a jury trial, Smith was convicted of possession with intent to distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>ute less than 5 grams of crack cocaine within 1000 feet of an elementary school, a lesser included offense of Count 1, and the Count 2 charge of possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine within 1000 feet of an elementary school. He was acquitted of the firearm offense in Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">At sentencing, the district court determined that Smith\u2019s offense level was 26 based on the amount of drugs involved, but this level was increased to 34 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because Smith qualified as a career offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s status as a career offender also increased his criminal history category from III to VI, and placed him in a guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. At Smith\u2019s request, the court departed downward in the criminal history category to level V, which yielded a guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Smith to concurrent terms of 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. This court affirmed Smith\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>209 Fed.Appx. 906 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In 2012, Smith filed the instant motion to correct sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines, which changed the quantities of crack applicable to the specific offense levels under the drug quantity tables, entitled him to a lesser sentence. He further asserted that he was eligible for the reduction because he was not sentenced as a career offender after the district court had departed downward in his criminal history category. He requested that he be resentenced in accordance with Amendment 750 and that he be given consideration for his rehabilitative efforts while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">The district court denied the motion, first finding that Amendment 750 did not apply to Smith\u2019s case because Smith\u2019s sentence was controlled by his career-offender status. Alternatively, the court explained that even if the amendment applied, the court would nevertheless sentence Smith to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Smith now appeals, arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), granted the district court authority to reduce his sentence in light of Amendment 750 despite the fact that he was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). But we review sentencing issues not raised before a district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cPlain error occurs if (1) there was error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">Under \u00a7 3582, a district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>line amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Specifically, a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactively-applicable amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range due to the operation of another guideline provision, such as the career-offender provisions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Smith\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 did not lower Smith\u2019s guideline range. Although the district court departed downward in Smith\u2019s criminal history category, Smith\u2019s ultimate sentence was based on his status as a career offender and not the guideline that would otherwise have applied to his drug offenses. Because Amendment 750 did not alter the career-offender guideline, and, therefore, did not have the effect of lowering Smith\u2019s guideline range, Smith was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent plurality opinion in <em>Freeman </em>does not alter our analysis. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Court concluded that defendants who enter into plea agreements that recommend a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) were not precluded from relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Freeman, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. This court recently rejected the <em>Freeman </em>argument Smith makes here and held that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Accordingly, the district court properly denied Smith\u2019s motion to correct sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\">. Smith conceded that he qualified as a career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. This is Smith's second \u00a7 3582(c) motion, and he also filed a motion to vacate sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, before filing the instant motion. Neither Smith's previous \u00a7 3582(c) motion nor his \u00a7 2255 motion provided him with any relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
