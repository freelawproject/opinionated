The district court calculated a total offense level of 38 \u2014 which included a 2-level increase under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) (Nov.2009) and a 2-level increase under \u00a7 3B1.3 because Stephen abused a position of trust \u2014 and a criminal history category of I. His offense carried a statutory maximum of 240 months imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, so the resulting guidelines range was 235-240 months imprisonment. The court sentenced Stephen to 240 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">Stephen appealed his sentence, and in an unpublished decision, we held that the district court did not clearly err in applying the sophisticated-means enhancement but that it had clearly erred in applying the abuse-of-trust enhancement. <em>United States v. Stephen, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 824, 828-30 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished). We vacated Stephen\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 830. At resen-tencing, the district court again applied the sophisticated-means enhancement, calculating a new total offense level of 36 and a new guidelines range of 188-235 months imprisonment. It sentenced Stephen to 188 months in prison. Stephen appeals, contending that the district court erred in applying of the sophisticated-means enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">This case is controlled by the law of the case doctrine, which provides that \u201cthe district court and the court of appeals are bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996). There are three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine: (1) the evidence in the later sentence hearing is substantially different; (2) there is a change in controlling law; or (3) the earlier decision was \u201cclearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. Stephen argues that the first exception applies here, but he presented no new evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>dence relating to the sophisticated-means enhancement when he was resentenced. The first exception to the law of the case doctrine, therefore, does not apply, which forecloses our review of the district court\u2019s application of that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
