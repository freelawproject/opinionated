Morris further contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">Morris argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which enhanced his applicable guidelines sentencing range from 110 to 137 months to 210 to 240 months. He claims that the district court incorrectly determined that his previous convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer and obstructing a law enforcement officer were \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d He urges that remand is additionally proper because the court below did not specify under which clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 these offenses' qualified and failed to conduct its analysis pursuant to the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Whether a particular conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career-offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines is ordinarily a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2011). However, where, as here, the defendant failed to object to his prior convictions being designated crimes of violence, we review that aspect of the sentencing calculation for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The career-offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant is a career offender if, among other requirements, he has two prior felony convictions involving either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The career-offender enhancement changes the applicable base offense level and the criminal history category, usually resulting in an increased guidelines imprisonment range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">Under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the guidelines, any state or federal offense that is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment can be a crime of violence if it fits within one of three categories. The first category includes crimes that have \u201cas an element the use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). The second category includes the enumerated crimes of \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion\u201d and those involving the \u201cuse of explosives.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The third category, sometimes referred to as residual clause crimes, includes those that \u201cotherwise involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-9\"><em>United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 977 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">We generally employ the categorical approach to determine whether a crime is a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253-54 (11th Cir.2010). \u201c[W]e consider the offense generically ... in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 187, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, if this analysis is ambiguous, or where \u201cthe crime for which the defendant was convicted encompasses both conduct that constitutes a crime of violence and conduct that does not,\u201d we use the modified categorical approach. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842-44 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1273, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Under this approach, a court may conduct a limited review of so-called <em>Shepard </em>materials to determine if the offense is a crime of violence. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). If the conviction is based on a guilty plea, courts may look to the statutory definition, the terms of the charging document, the terms of a written plea agreement or transcript of plea colloquy in which the defendant confirmed the factual basis for the plea, or explicit factual findings by the judge to which the defendant assented. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">A. Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Under Florida law, when a simple battery is committed on a law enforcement officer, it becomes the separate offense of battery on a law enforcement officer. An individual commits the Florida offense of battery when he (1) \u201c[ajctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other,\u201d or (2) \u201c[i]n-tentionally causes bodily harm to another person.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a). This offense is ordinarily a first-degree misdemeanor, <em>id. \u00a7 </em>784.03(l)(b), but is elevated to a third-degree felony if it is committed on a law-enforcement officer, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 784.07(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Morris\u2019s argument hinges on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.2010). The thrust of that decision is that \u201cthe fact of a conviction for felony battery on a law enforcement officer in Florida, standing alone, no longer satisfies the \u2018crime of violence\u2019 enhancement criteria as defined under the \u2018physical force\u2019 subdivision of section 4B1.2(a)(1) of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1169-70. In <em>Williams, </em>we explained that, pursuant to Florida\u2019s battery statute, a person commits a battery by engaging in any of the following acts: \u201cactually and intentionally touching],\u201d \u201cintentionally causing] bodily harm,\u201d or \u201cintentionally strfiking]\u201d the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1170. Significantly, however, there was \u201cno evidence in the record, that we [could] consider ... to clarify under which\u201d prong of the battery statute Williams had been convicted; that is, the battery conviction could have been based on nothing more than the mere touching of an officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, to the extent the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>court found that the battery on an officer was a crime of violence under the \u201cphysical force\u201d clause, we set aside the district court\u2019s career-offender designation and remanded for a new sentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">However, as the Government posits, battery on a law enforcement officer has the potential to create a confrontation leading to violence, thereby arguably qualifying as a crime of violence under the residual clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At least two of our sister circuits that have addressed similar battery on an officer offenses have held that they qualify under the residual clause because they involve a sufficient potential risk of serious injury and confrontation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>559 F.3d 1143, 1149 (10th Cir.2009) (holding that Oklahoma conviction for battery on a police officer qualified as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s residual clause because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[s]uch battery involves an overt act against the police officer \u2014 thereby not only <em>initiating </em>a confrontation, but risking a serious escalation in violence\u201d); <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>640 F.3d 455, 469-70 (1st Cir.2011) (concluding that Massachusetts conviction of assault and battery on an officer qualified under the residual clause of the ACCA, because it \u201cnearly always poses a serious risk of actual or potential physical force and the likelihood of physical injury,\u201d and because the serious risk of injury is heightened by the fact that \u201claw enforcement officers usually carry weapons when on duty\u201d) (quotations omitted). In any event, Morris has cited no binding precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court resolving this issue. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). The district court did not commit plain error in finding Morris\u2019s conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer constituted a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">B. Obstruction of a Law Enforcement Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The Georgia felony offense for obstructing or hindering a law enforcement officer is defined in pertinent part as follows: \u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any law enforcement officer ... in the lawful discharge of his official duties by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ... is guilty of a felony.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-24(b). The Court of Appeals of Georgia has confirmed that \u201coffering to do violence\u201d or \u201cdoing violence to the person of such officer\u201d is an element of the offense, and the statute implies \u201cforcible resis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tance.\u201d <em>Fairwell v. Georgia, </em>311 Ga.App. 834, 717 S.E.2d 332, 338 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We recently held that a similarly worded offense for resisting an officer with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, constituted a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2010). In Nix, we expressly adopted the rationale set forth in our unpublished opinion in <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 277, 278-79 (11th Cir.2010). 628 F.3d at 1342. Significantly, in <em>Hayes, </em>we concluded that a violation of \u00a7 843.01 \u201cfalls squarely within ACCA\u2019s residual clause.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 409 Fed.Appx. at 278-79. We reasoned that common sense dictates that the act of resisting arrest \u201cposes a threat of direct confrontation between a police officer and the subject of the arrest, creating the potential for serious physical injury to the officer and others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279 (quoting <em>United States v. Wardrick, </em>350 F.3d 446, 455 (4th Cir.2003)). Noting that the statute\u2019s plain language made clear that the offense of resisting arrest with violence is \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive,\u201d we had \u201cno difficulty concluding that one who commits the crime of resisting arrest by knowingly and willfully offering or doing violence to an arresting officer has committed a \u2018violent felony\u2019 for purposes of ACCA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\"><em>Nix </em>cannot be distinguished on the basis of the statutory language analyzed, as the text of the Florida statute at issue there was nearly identical to that of the Georgia statute in the instant case. Both provisions require that a defendant \u201cknowingly and willfully resist[], obstruct!], or oppose!]\u201d an officer \u201cby offering or doing violence to the person of such officer.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-24(b); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Although we need not rule definitively, pursuant to <em>Nix, </em>Morris\u2019s obstruction of an officer conviction would likely qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s residual clause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Equally important, Morris cites no binding precedent to the contrary. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We discern no plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>in the district court\u2019s designation of the obstruction of a law enforcement officer conviction as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In sum, the district court did not plainly err when it classified the battery of a law enforcement officer conviction and the obstruction conviction as crimes of violence for Morris\u2019s career-offender enhancement. Nor did the district court commit plain error by failing to specify under which clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) Morris\u2019s prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence or by failing to perform a modified categorical analysis. Even assuming there was error that was plain, Morris cannot show a reasonable probability of a different outcome because \u2014 for the reasons set forth above\u2014 both predicate convictions would likely qualify as crimes of violence under at least one of the clauses of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Morris also argues that his 210-month sentence of imprisonment, imposed at the low end of the career-offender-adjusted applicable guideline range, was substantively unreasonable. He posits that the court did not adequately consider evidence regarding his troubled childhood and the nature of the predicate convictions resulting in his career offender status, rendering a sentence that was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it was unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The \u201cweight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). We will not reverse unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">We hold that the district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While the mitigating factors pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>sented by Morris may have allowed the district court to vary downward from the applicable guideline range, nothing required it to do so here. Morris has failed to show that the sentence imposed, at the low end of the career-offender-enhanced guideline range, was outside the reasonable range of sentences dictated by the facts of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-11\">. More specifically, the jury concluded that Morris possessed with the intent to distribute 520.18 grams of benzylpiperazine (\"BZP\u201d) and 28.26 grams of a mixture of MDMA and BZP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. The doctrine of invited error arguably applies here. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that when a party induces or invites a district court to commit error, this Court is precluded from reviewing that error on appeal). Morris\u2019s counsel not only failed to object in the court below, but also expressly agreed that Morris\u2019s prior convictions qualified as crimes of violence. <em>See, e.g., </em>District Court order, Docket No. 49 at 2 (\"The two priors are Battery on a Law Enforcement Officer and Obstruction of Officer. <em>These offenses are crimes of violence, </em>but neither offense involved a weapon nor did the officers sustain injuries.\u201d) (emphasis added); District Court order, Docket No. 69 at 5-6; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9 (\"[Defense] Counsel argued that though Mr. Morris\u2019s prior convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer and obstruction of an officer ... fall under the broad crimes of violence definition for career offender purposes, each nevertheless over-represents the seriousness of his criminal history....\u201d). Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, and because neither party has addressed the invited error doctrine, we apply plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Under plain error review, a challenging party must show there is \"(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citation omitted). \"It is the law of this circuit that, at least where the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">. In analyzing whether a conviction is a crime of violence, we can rely on cases interpreting the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because this Court has repeatedly read the definition of \"violent felony\u201d under the ACCA as \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the definition of \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">. The <em>Williams </em>decision relied upon <em>Johnson, </em>wherein\" the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \"physical force\u201d in the ACCA to \"mean[] <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1271. <em>Johnson </em>holds that a Florida battery conviction could not be categorically labeled as a \"violent felony\u201d because the offense required only slight, incidental physical contact. <em>See id. </em>at 1269, 1274. The Court declined to consider whether the battery conviction would have qualified under the residual clause; evidently, \u201c[t]he Government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon [that] clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">. We note that the only information available regarding Morris's battery on an officer conviction comes from paragraph 37 of his Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSI), which provides that Morris \"swung at one of the officers with a closed fist and struck another officer about the face,\u201d and that he had to be tackled by an officer because he was resisting arrest. Because of the statutory ambiguity and because Morris did not object to the PSI\u2019s factual account, under the modified categorical approach, the district court likely could have relied on these facts \u2014 that were undisputed and deemed admitted \u2014 to find that the battery on a law enforcement officer conviction was a crime of violence under the \"physical force\u201d clause. <em>See United States v. Bennett, 472 </em>F.3d 825, 832-34 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that \"challenges to the facts contained in the PSI must be asserted with specificity and clarity\u201d and holding that \"the district court did not err in relying on the undisputed facts in Bennett\u2019s PSI to determine that his prior convictions were violent felonies under the ACCA\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 843 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that \"where ambiguity exists and the underlying conviction may be examined,\u201d in addition to <em>Shepard </em>materials, the district court \"also may base its factual findings on undisputed statements found in the PSI, because they are factual findings to which the defendant has assented\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b884-5\">. That Florida statute provides: \"Whoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ... is guilty of a felony....\u201d Fla.

The <em>Hayes </em>panel did not reach the question of whether the Florida offense would additionally qualify as a violent felony under the \"use of force\u201d clause, because it was \"satisfied that it falls well within the residual clause.\u201d 409 Fed.Appx. at 278.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. We reject Morris\u2019s position that <em>Nix </em>improperly relied only on common sense, and not statistical data, to determine whether the offense posed a risk of injury. <em>See United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 981 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that, even though \"the Supreme Court and this Court have relied on statistics when determining whether offenses are crimes of violence ... we have never held that statistical evidence is required,\u201d and \"when, as here, we are without the benefit of empirical evidence, we rely on our own common-sense analysis of whether [the] conduct poses a serious potential risk of physical injury\u201d) (quotations omitted). Morris\u2019s argument that <em>Nix </em>was otherwise wrongly decided does not warrant extended discussion. Under the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by <em>Nix </em>\"unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v.

Finally, even assuming <em>Nix </em>is not technically binding with respect to the instant analysis, Morris would still be unable to demonstrate plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">.It is further possible that the obstruction conviction could qualify as a crime of violence under the \"physical force\u201d clause. We emphasize that the offense includes as an element the use or threatened use of violence. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16\u201410\u201424(b) (requiring that an individual resist, obstruct, or oppose an officer \"by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer\u201d); <em>Stryker v.

Morris characterizes his position on appeal as a substantive, as opposed to a procedural, challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence.
