Pursuant to a removal order, Oliveros was removed from the United States in January 2007. Later that year, he illegally reentered the United States. Oliveros now argues that: (1) the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen due to a lack of jurisdiction because the regulatory post-departure bar improperly contracts the BIA\u2019s statutory jurisdiction to consider motions to reopen and contravenes the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d); and (2) the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen violated the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cUN Convention\u201d), and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cUN Protocol\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">I. Regulatory Post-Departure Bar</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion, and any underlying legal determinations <em>de novo. Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007). Review of the denial of a motion to reopen is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether that exercise was arbitrary or capricious. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>If an alien reenters the United States illegally after having been removed pursuant to a removal order, the removal order is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened. INA \u00a7 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1231(a)(5)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>; See De Sandoval v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1276, 1279-81 (11th Cir.2006). In De Sandoval, we noted that \u00a7 1231(a)(5) applies to all aliens who reenter illegally. <em>Id. </em>at 1279. We upheld the Attorney General\u2019s authority in promulgating 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8, which provides that an alien who reenters illegally has no right to a hearing before an immigration judge and delegates the determination of removability to an immigration officer. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Because the INA and its interpreting regulations deprives the BIA of authority to reopen removal proceedings where an alien has illegally reentered the United States after being removed under a removal order, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Oliveros\u2019 motion to reopen was mandated by statute. Accordingly, its denial of Oliveros\u2019 motion to reopen did not improperly contract its statutorily conferred jurisdiction to consider motions to reopen or contravene the INA, and it did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion. We, therefore, deny this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">II. UN Convention and UN Protocol</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We do not have jurisdiction to consider any claims that an alien has not first presented to the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Because Oliveros failed to raise his UN Convention and UN Protocol claim before the BIA, we do not have jurisdiction to consider it. Accordingly, we dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">After careful and thorough review of the administrative record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Oliveros\u2019 petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">PETITION DENIED, IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">. Section 1231(a)(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
