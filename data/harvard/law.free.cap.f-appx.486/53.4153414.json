Gomez argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior conviction under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-4(a) for \u201cchild molestation\u201d qualified as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and therefore, was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). He contends that, using the categorical approach, the elements of his prior child molestation conviction cover conduct broader than this court\u2019s definition of sexual abuse of a minor, as explained in <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-25\">In considering whether a 16-level enhancement was proper based on a previous deportation following a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we review <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>whether the prior conviction qualifies under the Guidelines as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">A 16-level enhancement is imposed under the Guidelines if the defendant has been previously deported following a felony conviction for \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined by the Guidelines as an offense that includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor ... or any other offense ... that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.l(B)(iii)). Guidelines commentary \u201cthat interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). The Guidelines were amended in 2003 to clarify that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d incorporated specific enumerated offenses, including \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d \u201cregardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical violence against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 658 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">When determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense, we use \u201ca categorical approach to determine whether the convicted crime falls within the generic, federal definition of the enumerated offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.) <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 595, 181 L.Ed.2d 436 (2011). Using the categorical approach, \u201cwe consider the offense as defined by the law, rather than considering the facts of the specific violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, in analyzing the nature and risk of the offense, we consider the ordinary case to determine how the crime is usually committed, and do not inquire into the specific conduct of the particular offender. <em>United States v. Proch, </em>637 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cIf the scope of acts criminalized by the statutory definition of the prior offense is broader than the generic definition of the enumerated offense, then, under the categorical approach, the prior conviction does not fall within the enumerated offense.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d at 782-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Our generic, federal definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was first stated in <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>which addressed whether a defendant\u2019s previous conviction in Florida for \u201clewd assault\u201d was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d which qualified for the 16-level enhancement. 247 F.3d at 1162. We interpreted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to mean \u201ca perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1163. We recognized that violations of the Florida \u201clewd assault\u201d statute might not involve any physical contact with the victim, but concluded that all possible violations involve the misuse or maltreatment of a child for sexual gratification and, thus, constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Ramirez-Garcia </em>reaffirmed the definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d set forth in <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>646 F.3d at 783-84. At issue was a North Carolina statute which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">A person is guilty of taking indecent liberties with children if, being 16 years of age or more and at least five years older than the child in question, he either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">(1) Willfully takes or attempts to take any immoral, improper, or indecent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>liberties with any child of either sex under the age of 16 years for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">(2) Willfully commits or attempts to commit any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body or any part or member of the body of any child of either sex under the age of 16 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-202.1. We noted that the <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>definition \u201cfocused on the perpetrator\u2019s intent in committing the abuse, to seek libidinal gratification.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d at 782 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Because \u201cmisuse\u201d or \u201cmaltreatment\u201d are expansive words that include many different acts, the definition is not limited \u201cto instances where the perpetrator is present in front of the minor, where the minor is aware of the abuse, or where the perpetrator makes contact with the minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784. Accordingly, we found that the <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d was \u201cat least as broad and inclusive as \u00a7 14-202.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Georgia\u2019s child molestation statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">A person commits the offense of child molestation when such person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">(1) Does any immoral or indecent act to or in the presence of or with any child under the age of 16 years with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of either the child or the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16 \u2014 6\u20144(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">The Georgia child molestation statute tracks the language of the <em>Padillctr-Reyes </em>definition of sexual abuse of a minor. Like the <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>definition, \u00a7 16-6-4(a) focuses on the intent of the perpetrator to achieve sexual gratification. The \u201cmisuse or maltreatment\u201d requirement of <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>is expansive and is contemplated by the \u201cimmoral or indecent act\u201d language of \u00a7 16-6-4(a). Moreover, this language is almost exactly the same as the \u201cimmoral, improper, or indecent liberties\u201d language of the North Carolina statute that we held was no broader than the <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>definition. Gomez has failed to point to any Georgia cases involving facts that do not fit within the contours of the broad <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>definition. Accordingly, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err in finding that Gomez\u2019s previous conviction for child molestation constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and, therefore, was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Gomez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
