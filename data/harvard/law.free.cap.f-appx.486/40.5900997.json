Rivera received concurrent sentences of four years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the first two counts. His sentence was suspended as to Counts 3 and 4, each of which carried a maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. After violating his probation for a second time, the Southern District of Florida revoked probation and sentenced Rivera on April 26, 2011, to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Rivera contends that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653 by imposing a prison sentence that exceeds the prison sentence imposed for the underlying offense. Rivera also argues that our decision in his appeal of an earlier sentence imposed following his first probation revocation binds us to conclude that the district court violated \u00a7 3653. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>324 Fed.Appx. 811, 815 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Rivera\u2019s contentions are without merit, and thus, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">We ordinarily review pre-Guidelines probation revocation decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam). However, at sentencing, Rivera did not raise his objections to the length of his sentence. If a defendant does not raise timely objections in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>Id. </em>We exercise plain error review sparingly and only \u201cin those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). For this reason, the plain error test is difficult to meet. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. To prevail under the plain error standard of review, a defendant must prove that there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). If a defendant proves all of these elements, we \u201cmay then exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631, 122 S.Ct. at 1785 (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. at 1549).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">Rivera is unable to show error \u2014 plain or otherwise \u2014 because pre-Guidelines law permits his sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment. In 1987, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>vided a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years for each count of knowing possession of stolen goods valued at more than $100 from a foreign shipment. Under \u00a7 3653, upon finding that the defendant violated probation, the district court may \u201crevoke the probation and require him to serve the sentence imposed, or any lesser sentence, and, if imposition of sentence was suspended, may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653 (repealed Nov. 1, 1987). While \u201c[\u00a7 ] 3653 was repealed by the Sentencing Reform Act, Pub.L. 98-473, \u00a7 212(a)(2), 98 Stat.1987 (1984) ... the repeal applies only to offenses committed after November 1, 1987.\u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>874 F.2d 1470, 1472 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989). In <em>Parrish, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s imposition of eight years\u2019 imprisonment following probation revocation where the original sentence for two counts of mail fraud was suspended, and each count carried a statutory maximum of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Parrish, </em>427 F.3d at 1349. We held that under \u00a7 3653, the district court may impose any sentence that might originally have been imposed and noted that \u201cthe district court ... could have imposed up to five years\u2019 imprisonment as to each count, to run consecutively, for a total 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, under the pre-Guidelines framework, if a court imposes a sentence within the statutory limits, the severity of the sentence is insulated from appellate review. <em>United States v. Reme, </em>738 F.2d 1156, 1167 (11th Cir.1984). Rivera\u2019s underlying conviction from August 1987 precedes the effective repeal of \u00a7 3653, and thus, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in following pre-Guidelines law when sentencing Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Additionally, Rivera argues that our decision in his prior appeal following his first revocation of probation requires that the instant sentence not exceed four years. <em>See Rivera, </em>324 Fed.Appx. at 815 (concluding that \u201cthe district court did not violate the terms of ... \u00a7 3653, because the eighteen-month sentence it imposed is less than the original forty-eight month sentence\u201d in Rivera\u2019s underlying criminal case). \u201cUnpublished opinions are not considered binding precedent, but they may be cited as persuasive authority.\u201d 11th Cir. R. 36-2. We \u201cmay cite to [unpublished opinions] ... to ascertain the law of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I.O.P. 7. Under the law of the case doctrine, \u201cthe resolution of an issue decided at one stage of a case is binding at later stages of the same case.\u201d <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The law of the case doctrine \u201coperates to preclude courts from revisiting issues that were decided explicitly or by necessary implication in a prior appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The doctrine has \u201cdeveloped to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing lawsuit.\u201d <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In the instant appeal, the law of the case doctrine and our prior decision has no bearing on the district court\u2019s imposition of this seven-year sentence. Our prior comment in <em>Rivera </em>on the reasonableness of that 18-month sentence does not require us to find this 84-month sentence unreasonable. In fact, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the district court had the authority under \u00a7 3653 to sentence Rivera to a longer term. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653. Consequently, we reject Rivera\u2019s contention that our holding in his prior appeal constrains us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Rivera has not demonstrated that the district court committed plain error in im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>posing a seven-year prison sentence after revoking his probation where the seven-year sentence is less than the statutory maximum prison sentence for the two counts that were suspended in his original case. Additionally, Rivera has not shown that the law of the case compels us to conclude that the district court violated \u00a7 3653. Accordingly, we affirm Rivera\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
