Morgan alleged that the defendants engaged in narco-ter-rorism against the United States and its citizens. Morgan sought a total of three trillion dollars on behalf of all victims of the \u201cfinancial economy meltdown\u201d and all incarcerated individuals and their immediate families from the defendants in compensation for their losses as the result of the narco-terrorism. The district court reviewed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) because Morgan was seeking redress from government officials and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Morgan argues that the district court erred in screening his complaint under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) because he was not seeking redress from the government or any of its officials. Morgan is correct that his claim did not seek redress from the government and should not have been reviewed under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l); however, we may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any basis supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The district court found that Morgan\u2019s complaint was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. A prisoner\u2019s civil action may be dismissed at any time if it is frivolous or fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Our review of the district court\u2019s dismissal order is de novo. <em>Hutchins v. McDaniels, </em>512 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). An action may be dismissed for failure to state a claim if no relief could be granted as a matter of law even if the plaintiffs alleged facts are accepted as true. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Morgan has failed to present any factual matter, which accepted as true, would support his claims. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Harriss v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s dismissal of the action under \u00a7 2333 was not error under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The dismissal of Morgan\u2019s civil complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Morgan is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g)</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
