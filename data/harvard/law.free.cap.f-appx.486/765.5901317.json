He also challenges the denial of his Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment. No reversible error has been shown. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-27\">Jallali attended Nova Southeastern University\u2019s School of Osteopathic Medicine from 1998 to 2005, but never obtained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>degree. In 2011, Jallali sued Nova Southeastern University, Inc. under the FCA, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) &amp; (2) (1994), <em>amended, by </em>the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, Pub.L. No. 111-21, \u00a7 4(a)(1), 123 Stat. 1621. After several months of litigation, Jallali filed his Third Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Jallali\u2019s Third Amended Complaint alleges that Nova Southeastern submitted payment requests for federal student aid that falsely asserted compliance with certain federal regulations. The complaint identifies two regulations, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 602.22 and 668.14, that Nova Southeastern allegedly violated between 1999 and 2009. The complaint also explains that, to receive federal student aid payments, Nova Southeastern must submit claims for them to the federal government. Federal regulations require each claim for payment to certify an institution\u2019s compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations. Therefore, the complaint theorizes, Nova Southeastern must have submitted claims for federal student aid which falsely asserted compliance with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 602.22 and 668.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Nova Southeastern moved to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that the complaint failed to meet the particularity requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). The district court agreed with Nova Southeastern and dismissed the Third Amended Complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Jallali then moved to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e). The motion asserts that the district court erred when it refused to consider documents attached to his response to Nova Southeastern\u2019s motion to dismiss. The district court denied Jallali\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion. Jallali now appeals the court\u2019s judgment dismissing his case and its order denying his Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We review a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>See Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1012 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). We review a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Shuford v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Jallali first contends the district court erred in dismissing his Third Amended Complaint for failure to comply with Rule 9(b). A complaint alleging a violation of the FCA must meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>See Corsello, </em>428 F.3d at 1012. To satisfy this requirement, \u201cthe complaint must allege facts as to time, place, and substance of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud, and the details of the defendants\u2019 allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who engaged in them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1310 (11th Cir.2002)) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Additionally, the complaint must contain \u201csome in-dicia of reliability\u201d that a fraudulent claim was actually submitted to the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1012, 1014. \u201cLiability under the False Claims Act arises from the submission of a fraudulent claim to the government, not the disregard of government regulations or failure to maintain proper internal policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1012 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\"><em>Klusmeier v. Bell Constructors, Inc., </em>469 Fed.Appx. 718 (11th Cir.2012), is a case similar to this one. In that case, a government contract required the defendant to build certain facilities according to the contract\u2019s specifications. The contract also required the defendant to request payment under certain federal regulations. These regulations required the defendant to certify compliance with the contract\u2019s specifications each time he requested payment. The complaint in <em>Klusmeier </em>alleged that the defendant failed to build the facilities to specifications, and that the defendant submitted invoices under that contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The relator then theorized that \u201cfalse claims must have been submitted, were likely submitted or should have been submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721 (quoting <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">We held that the complaint failed to comply with the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>Id. </em>at 721-22. We declined to assume that the defendant actually billed for any noncompliant work and described the relator\u2019s claim as mere speculation. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we noted that the relator lacked \u201cthe type of knowledge that normally will support an FCA complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though the relator had personal knowledge that the defendant violated the contract, the relator lacked any knowledge of the defendant\u2019s billing practices. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In this case, Jallali alleges that Nova Southeastern failed to comply with 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 602.22 and 668.14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further alleges that federal regulations required Nova Southeastern to certify compliance with \u00a7 \u00a7 602.22 and 668.14 each time it requests federal student aid payments. Finally, he alleges that Nova Southeastern did request federal student aid payments. But, these allegations do not satisfy Rule 9(b) under our precedent. Jallali\u2019s complaint does not allege facts identifying the time, place, or substance of the allegedly fraudulent claims for payment. The complaint does not allege facts showing that Nova Southeastern actually certified compliance with \u00a7 \u00a7 602.22 and 668.14. Nor does the complaint allege that noncompliance with these regulations renders Nova Southeastern ineligible to receive federal student aid payments. Nor does Jallali possess personal knowledge of Nova Southeastern\u2019s billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We see no substantive distinction between <em>Klusmeier </em>and this case. Of course, <em>Klusmeier </em>is an unpublished opinion and not binding precedent. But, we find it persuasive and have no reason to reach a different result here. Thus, we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Jallali\u2019s Third Amended Complaint for failure to comply with Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Jallali next contends that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his Rule 59(e) motion. In that motion, Jallali asked the court to consider certain documents not attached to his Third Amended Complaint. But, as the district court pointed out, a party cannot amend a complaint by attaching documents to a response to a motion to dismiss. <em>See Fin. Sec. Assur., Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Finally, Jallali contends the district court erred when it dismissed his Third Amended Complaint without the Attorney General\u2019s consent. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(1). We disagree. The consent requirement in \u00a7 3730(b)(1) applies only to voluntary dismissals. <em>See United States ex rel. Shaver v. Lucas W. Corp., </em>237 F.3d 932, 934 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Health Possibilities, P.S.C., </em>207 F.3d 335, 344 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Minotti v. Lensink, </em>895 F.2d 100, 103 (2d Cir.1990); <em>Richardson v. Capital Health Care, </em>2008 WL 3471777, at *1 (N.D.Fla.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">Jallali has not shown reversible error. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">. Nova Southeastern contends that \u00a7 602.22 does not apply to it, and therefore, it has not violated that regulation. Because we con-elude that Jallali\u2019s complaint failed to comply with Rule 9(b), we need not decide this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
