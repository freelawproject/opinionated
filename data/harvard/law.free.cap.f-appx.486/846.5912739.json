On appeal, Jackson argues the district court erred by failing to reduce his sentence pursuant to Amendment 750 and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also argues the district court had authority to vacate his life sentence because the Government\u2019s 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice failed to list constitutionally valid convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant whose \u201csentencing range ... has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d may move the district court to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement explains that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with th[e] policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if ... an amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (Nov.2011); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (providing that a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) if an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">Here, the district court determined it lacked authority to revise Jackson\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582 because Jackson was subject to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) based on his \u201cprior convictions for a felony drug offense.\u201d Because Jackson\u2019s statutory minimum sentence was greater than his otherwise applicable guideline range, the statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment became his guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Thus, Jackson\u2019s guideline range of life was unaffected by Amendment 750, such that the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>11th Cir.2012, 686 F.3d 1203 (No. 12-10580, July 11, 2012) (\u201cThe law is clear that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, even when an amendment would lower the defendant\u2019s otherwise-applicable Guidelines sentencing range, when the defendant was sentenced on the basis of a mandatory minimum.\u201d) (quotations and alteration omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Moreover, Jackson\u2019s arguments regarding the deficiencies in his \u00a7 851 information are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2) (limiting proceedings under this statute to cases where a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guideline range); <em>see also United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that a proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a full re-sentencing, and the district court must maintain all original sentencing determinations with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range). Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-11\">. Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, made permanent an amendment lowering the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-16\">. Jackson also filed supplemental authority contending that <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), renders the changes under the FSA applicable to his resentencing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Dorsey </em>did not decide whether the FSA applies to a defendant, like Jackson, who was sentenced before the FSA went into effect and who files a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion after the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See United States v. Liberse, </em>11th Cir.2012, 688 F.3d 1198 (No. 12-10243, July 30, 2012). We note that <em>Glover </em>is a post <em>-Dorsey </em>case. Regardless, because Jackson was responsible for 287.2 grams of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851 would still subject Jackson to a mandatory minimum life term of imprisonment because his offense involved at least 280 grams of cocaine base. While Jackson contends he was responsible for a lower amount, he submitted no evidence of this amount, and did not object to the portion of the PSI holding him responsible for 287.2 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-21\">. Although Jackson contends the district court has authority to reduce his sentence in light of <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct, 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), we recently rejected this argument where a defendant was sentenced as a career offender, such that his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>11th Cir.2012, 686 F.3d 1317 (No. 11-15912, July 13, 2012). Likewise, <em>Freeman </em>does not apply here, where Jackson was sentenced based on a statutory minimum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
