The presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of 22 under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) (Nov.2010). The PSR added 2 levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) because the offense involved four firearms; 4 levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because Ber-nal-Perez had engaged in firearm trafficking; and 4-levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because he possessed a firearm in connection with drug distribution. The PSR subtracted 3 levels under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 29, and it determined that he had a criminal history category of III. For that reason, it recommended a guidelines range of 108 to 120 months in prison. Bernal-Perez did not file any objections to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">At sentencing the government asked the district court to remove the 4-level drug-distribution enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The court asked Bernal-Perez\u2019s lawyer if he wanted to make any argument on his client\u2019s behalf, and Ber-nal-Perez\u2019s lawyer said, \u201cNo, Your Honor. We would ask that you accept the guideline recommendation as proposed by the United States with the adjustment.\u201d The court removed the 4-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) and calculated a total offense level of 25, a criminal history category of III, and a guidelines range of 70 to 87 months in prison. The court sentenced Bernal-Perez to 84 months in prison, followed by 36 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Bernal-Perez appeals, contending that the district court miscalculated his guidelines range. He argues that there was not enough evidence to support the 4-level enhancement for firearm trafficking under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). At sentencing, however, Bernal-Perez asked the court to \u201caccept the guideline recommendation as proposed by the United States with the adjustment,\u201d and the court did as Bernal-Perez asked. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted). If a \u201cparty induces or invites the district court into making an error,\u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>139 F.3d 822, 838 (11th Cir.1998), \u201cit precludes a[n appellate] court from ... reversing,\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). Because Bernal-Perez invited the district court to apply the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement, we do not reach the merits of his argument that court erred in doing so. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
