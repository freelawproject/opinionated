Because the Tax Court did not clearly error in finding that the purported $400,000 loan was income nor in finding that the Todds had failed to prove their affirmative defense to the penalty, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Frederick Todd is the sole shareholder, director, and president of Frederick D. Todd II, M.D., P.A. (the \u201cCorporation\u201d), a Texas professional association for Frederick\u2019s neurosurgery practice. In August 1995, the Corporation became a member of a union, which allowed the Corporation to participate in a death-benefits-only plan through the American Workers Benefit Fund Trust (\u201cAWBF\u201d). The death-benefits-only plan provided death benefits of up to eight times an employee\u2019s annual salary with a cap at $6 million. To fund these obligations, AWBF took out life insurance policies in the same amount of the death benefit for each of the Corporation\u2019s employees from Southland Life Insurance Company (\u201cSouthland\u201d). Finally, to continue the eligibility for the death benefits, the Corporation had to make annual payments to AWBF roughly equal to the amount AWBF owed to Southland in combined premiums for the Corporation\u2019s employees. Frederick had a $6 million death benefit with his \"wife Linda named as the beneficiary. In December 2000, the Corporation changed local union affiliation and resultantly transferred its AWBF plan to United Employee Benefit Fund Trust (\u201cUEBF\u201d) on the same terms and with the same relationship with Southland.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Under the terms of the UEBF plan, UEBF trustees could, upon a showing of serous financial hardship, make loans to a plan participant up to the accrued equity in his plan. After Frederick inquired to UEBF and after UEBF consulted with Southland, UEBF informed Frederick that his maximum available distribution from the plan was $400,000. In July 2002, Frederick formally applied to UEBF for a $400,000 loan/distribution from his plan due to \u201cunexpected housing costs.\u201d UEBF approved Frederick and secured a $400,000 loan from Southland, but after realizing that Southland was going to charge UEBF nearly 5% interest on the loan, UEBF decided that such an arrangement was unacceptable. Instead, UEBF with Frederick\u2019s consent decided to reduce the value of the life insurance on Frederick by $400,000 (i.e., a partial surrender), which left UEBF\u2019s policy on Frederick\u2019s life with a $5.6 million face value. In September 2002, UEBF issued Frederick a cheek for $400,000 with \u201cparticipant loan\u201d noted on the memo line. The issuance of the $400,000 check coincided with the last payment to UEBF that the Corporation would make.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Under the terms of the UEBF\u2019s trust agreement with the Corporation, UEBF was supposed to secure any loan to a plan participant before making any distribution. Such a note was also required to establish a quarterly payment schedule and bear a reasonable rate of interest. In February 2008, UEBF decided that it needed a promissory note from Frederick. In March 2003, Frederick signed a note for $400,000 to UEBF. That note bore a 1% interest rate and provided for quarterly payments by Frederick of approximately $20,500 until the note was paid off. The note also provided a \u201cdual repayment mechanism,\u201d which allowed UEBF to deduct any outstanding balance on the note from any later distribution to Frederick. In practice, that mechanism allowed UEBF to deduct any remaining balance owed on the note from any death benefits owed to Linda upon Frederick\u2019s death. As noted above, the Corporation ceased its payments to UEBF in late 2002; similarly, Frederick never made any payments on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The Todds filed their 2002 and 2003 tax returns with the IRS in July 2005. The IRS noted unrelated deficiencies in the Todds\u2019 returns for 2002 and 2003, which the Todds challenged in the Tax Court. During the course of its investigation, the IRS discovered the $400,000 distribution from UEBF to Frederick and amended its deficiency charges to include deficiencies caused by the non-reporting of the $400,000 as income. The Tax Court applied a multi-factored approach to the determination of whether the $400,000 constituted a loan and determined that it did not. It therefore concluded that the Todds were deficient in 2002 and found a penalty applicable for the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">We review decisions of the Tax Court under the same standard as district court decisions: legal conclusions are reviewed de novo; factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Terrell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>625 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2010). Both \u201cwhether a certain transaction constitutes a loan for income tax purposes\u201d and whether taxpayers \u201cacted with reasonable cause and in good faith in making a substantial understatement of tax liability\u201d are factual issues reviewed for clear error. <em>Green v. Comm\u2019r, </em>507 F.3d 857, 871 (5th Cir.2007) (reasonable cause); <em>Moore v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 974, 978 (5th Cir.1969) (loan). Clear error only exists where we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Ter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>rell, </em>625 F.3d at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">A. The $400,000 \u201cLoan\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A loan does not \u201cconstitute income [under the Internal Revenue Code] because whatever temporary economic benefit the borrower derives from the use of the funds is offset by the corresponding obligation to repay them.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>412 F.2d at 978. The central inquiry for determining if a transaction is a bona fide loan for tax purposes is whether it is \u201cthe intention of the parties that the money advanced be repaid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we noted in <em>Moore, </em>this inquiry is one that \u201cinvolv[es] several considerations.\u201d <em>Id. Moore, </em>however, failed to delineate what those considerations were.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Tax Court below looked to seven factors laid out by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Welch v. Commissioner, </em>204 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir.2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">(1) whether the promise to repay is evidenced by a note or other instrument;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">(2) whether interest was charged; (3) whether a fixed schedule for repayments was established; (4) whether collateral was given to secure payment; (5) whether repayments were made; (6) whether the borrower had a reasonable prospect of repaying the loan and whether the lender had sufficient funds to advance the loan; and (7) whether the parties conducted themselves as if the transaction were a loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1230 (citing <em>Crowley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>962 F.2d 1077, 1079 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Frierdich v. Comm\u2019r, </em>925 F.2d 180, 182 (7th Cir.1991); <em>Piedmont Minerals Co. v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 560, 563 (4th Cir.1970)). The <em>Welch </em>Court noted that these factors were \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d and merely provided a \u201cgeneral basis upon which courts may analyze a transaction.\u201d <em>Welch, </em>204 at 1230. The Tax Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\">1. Although there was a promissory note executed, the process through which it was executed did not conform with UEBF\u2019s policies and \u201cfail[ed] to correspond with the substance of the transaction.\u201d It therefore afforded the existence of the note \u201clittle weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">2. Although UEBF charged 1% interest, the significantly-below-market-rate interest demonstrated that the transaction was not intended as a loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-14\">3. Although a payment schedule was established, Frederick\u2019s non-payment and UEBF\u2019s non-enforcement demonstrated that the transaction was not intended as a loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-15\">4. The \u201cdual repayment mechanism\u201d could serve as collateral and therefore the fourth factor cut in favor of the Todds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-16\">5. The \u201cdual repayment mechanism\u201d was too contingent upon future events to evince an unconditional obligation to repay, citing <em>Midkiff v. Commissioner, </em>96 T.C. 724, 734-35 (1991), and therefore lack of any repayment by Frederick was controlling to demonstrate that the transaction was not intended as a loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-17\">6. Frederick had the means to repay the loan and therefore this factor cut in favor of the Todds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-18\">7. Overall, the parties did not conduct themselves in manner evincing an intention to establish a debtor-creditor relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">The Todds contend that the Tax Court clearly erred because they formally satisfied the first three categories, which were three of the central pieces of evidence that the Tax Court used to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>$400,000 was not a loan. While we recognize that Frederick and UEBF executed a note and payment schedule, the fact that the note and schedule were only adopted after the fact, in contravention of UEBF policies, suggests the possibility that doing so was merely \u201ca formalized attempt to achieve the desired tax result while lacking in necessary substance, ... merely parading] under the false colors\u201d of a bona fide loan. <em>Tomlinson v. 1661 Corp., </em>377 F.2d 291, 295 (5th Cir.1967). When the <em>post hoc </em>note execution is coupled with the fact that Frederick never repaid any of the so-called loan despite his clear means to do so, we cannot say that the Tax Court clearly erred in concluding that the $400,000 payment was not a bona fide loan and therefore should have been included in the Todds\u2019 2002 income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">B. Reasonable Cause Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Where there is an underpayment that results from negligence or disregard of the rules or that was substantial, the Internal Revenue Code imposes a penalty equal to 20% of the underpayment. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a)-(b). However, the penalty shall not be imposed \u201cif it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for [any portion of an underpayment] and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to such portion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6664(c)(1). The Todds argue that the penalty should not apply because they had a certified public accountant prepare their 2002 return. Our precedent mandates that the taxpayers show that they \u201c[r]eli[ed] on the advice of a professional tax adviser\u201d and additionally that such reliance was valid due to \u201cthe quality and objectivity of the professional advice which they obtained.\u201d <em>Bemont Invs., L.L.C. ex. rel. Tax Matters Partner v. United States, </em>679 F.3d 339, 349 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Todds have put forth no evidence, other than the fact that a C.P.A. prepared their taxes, that they validly relied on the C.P.A.\u2019s advice. <em>Klamath Strategic Inv. Fund v. United States, </em>568 F.3d 537, 548 (5th Cir.2009) (The taxpayer bears the burden of proof on a \u201creasonable cause\u201d defense.); <em>see also Neonatology Assocs. P.A. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>115 T.C. 43, 100 (2000) (\u201cThe mere fact that a certified public accountant has prepared a tax return does not mean that he or she has opined on any or all of the items reported therein\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>299 F.3d 221 (3d Cir.2002). Therefore, we find no clear error in the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of the \u00a7 6662 penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\">. The Todds also contend that the stipulations of fact entered into by the parties establish that the $400,000 payment was a loan. The parties stipulated: \"Dr. Todd\u2019s unpaid principal balance on the note was $400,000 on December 31, 2002\u201d and \"As of December 31, 2003, Todd owed a principal balance of $400,000 to UEBF.\" From these stipulations, the Todds posit that by acknowledging that $400,000 was \"owed,\u201d the Commissioner was acknowledging genuine indebtedness. Our inquiry under <em>Moore </em>is whether it is \"the intention of the parties that the money advanced be repaid.\u201d 412 F.2d at 978. Neither of these stipulations resolves this question. <em>See also Saviano v. Comm'r, </em>765 F.2d 643, 645 (7th Cir.1985) (Commissioner\u2019s stipulation that taxpayer executed a \"Loan Agreement\u201d did not bind court as to appropriate characterization of the transaction for tax purposes); <em>cf. Estate of Maceo, </em>23 T.C.M. (CCH) 258, 356 (1964) (\u201c[A] stipulation presupposes a meeting of the minds covering the facts which are the subject of consideration.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
