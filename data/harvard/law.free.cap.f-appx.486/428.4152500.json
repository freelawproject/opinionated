Ford filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 arguing that the evidence regarding the actual substance involved in her offenses was insufficient in light of <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and that the district court erred in applying the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines under the recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The district court dismissed Ford\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because she did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The Respondent has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for a dismissal as frivolous or for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Ford\u2019s argument that her <em>DePierre </em>claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition is without merit because <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize her criminal conduct and has not been held to be retroactively applicable. Ford\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>argument that her actual innocence claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition is foreclosed by <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000), which held that a petitioner\u2019s argument that he is actually innocent of being a career offender is not the type of argument that warrants review under \u00a7 2241 because the petitioner is not asserting that he is actually innocent of the underlying crime for which she was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED; its alternative motions for dismissal as frivolous and for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
