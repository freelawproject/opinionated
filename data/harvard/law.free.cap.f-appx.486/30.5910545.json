Schultz, Karen Olivia-Marie Stewart, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-9\">Marc David Settles, Law Offices of Marc David Settles, PA, Miami Beach, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b57-11\">Before WILSON, FAY, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b57-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">Adonys Reyes Rodriguez pled guilty to possession of fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3); possession of device-making equipment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(4); and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Accordingly, he was sentenced to 144 months of imprisonment. He now appeals his sentence, arguing that it was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-15\">First, Reyes Rodriguez asserts that his 144-month total sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to recognize the advisory guideline range as a benchmark and impermissibly varied upward for his recidivism. He also argues that his total sentence was substantively unreasonable, claiming it was arbitrarily imposed and impermissibly weighed his recidivism. Lastly, Reyes Rodriguez contends that the district court improperly directed the government to seek a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">We review the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s sentence under a two-step deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). The first step is to \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-17\">A district court should begin the sentencing analysis by determining the correct guideline range \u201c[a]s a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 128 S.Ct. at 596. The district court should also give each party the opportunity to request a specific sentence and then \u201cconsider all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596. Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each individual factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Furthermore, the district court has the discretion to consider factors that were previously included in the calculation of the advisory guideline ranges. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). If a district court applies a variance from the guidelines, the \u201cjustification for [it] must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011); <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The second step of the inquiry is to consider the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness by taking into account \u201cthe totality of circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If a sentence \u201cdoes not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d then it may be substantively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). However, we \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, the amount of weight given to any of the individual \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Under this deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, we will remand for re-sentencing when \u201cleft with the <em>definite and firm, conviction </em>that the district court committed a <em>clear error </em>of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In this case, Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was proeedurally reasonable because the district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range, adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sufficiently explained its rationale for an upward variance. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Although the district court referenced the statutory maximum penalty, it did not use that sentence as a benchmark, as Reyes Rodriguez asserts. Rather, the district court\u2019s acknowledgment of the statutory maximum penalty was to indicate that the penalty could have been a reasonable sentence. The district court first considered the advisory guideline range and verified the accuracy of the range with both parties before referencing the statutory maximum penalty. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 53, 128 S.Ct. at 598 (finding no procedural error when the district judge first considered the guidelines, then other factors like those under \u00a7 3553(a)). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s concern in protecting the public from credit card fraud and its desire to deter others from committing similar offenses demonstrate sufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court also adequately explained its reasoning for the upward variance \u2014 upon Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s release from prison, he immediately committed the same type of crime and therefore needed a stricter sentence for future deterrence. Thus, Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was proeedurally sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Likewise, Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. A sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tence can be reasonable even when, as here, the sentence represents a significantly upward variance because the guidelines are \u201conly one of the factors to consider when imposing [a] sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 59, 128 S.Ct. at 602. In addition to the guidelines, the court considered the statutory maximum, Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s immediate recidivism, his cooperation with the government, his forfeiture of fraudulently obtained assets, and other \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191-92. Even though it appears that greater emphasis was placed on Reyes Rodriguez\u2019s recidivism than other factors, that determination was within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Finally, the district court did not improperly rely on and direct the government to seek a Rule 35(b) motion. Instead, the court offered its view that if Reyes Rodriguez provided additional information to assist the government, then the government could file a sentence-reduction motion. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). The court\u2019s suggestion to potentially file a motion is not a direction to file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> Additionally, the court did not impermissibly take Reyes Rodriguez's nationality into account. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.10 (stating that national origin is not relevant to a sentencing determination). Rather, the district court expressed its displeasure with Reyes Rodriguez's justification that everyone from his hometown in Cuba commits credit card fraud when they arrive in the United States. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191-92.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
