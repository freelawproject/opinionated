Although this court ordinarily reviews revocation sentences under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011), we review for plain error because Serna failed to object to his sentence in the district court. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Although he argues that his sentence should be vacated because, inter alia, his violations were due to extenuating circumstances, Serna\u2019s sentence was fully consistent with the primary goal of a sentence on revocation, which is to sanction the violator for failing to abide by the terms of supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. \u00b6 3(b); <em>see Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843 (\u201c[T]he goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d). He fails to show that his sentence is plainly erroneous. <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
