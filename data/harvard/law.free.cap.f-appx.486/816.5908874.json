The presentence investigation report recommended a guidelines range of 84-105 months imprisonment. Carter did not object to the PSR, and the district court sentenced him to 105 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">In October 2011, Carter filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), asserting that Amendment 750 to the sentencing guidelines had reduced his guidelines range to 37-46 months imprisonment. The government opposed the motion, arguing that the district court should deny it because of Carter\u2019s extensive criminal history and because he had three disciplinary referrals while in prison \u2014 one for fighting, one for assault, and one for possessing a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">Carter had until November 17, 2011, to reply to the government\u2019s response, but the district court denied his motion for a reduced sentence on November 14, 2011, before Carter filed a reply. The court\u2019s order stated that it had \u201cconsidered [Carter\u2019s] motion, and [took] into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d The court did not provide any further explanation for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Carter appeals the denial of his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion, contending that the district court improperly denied the motion before he had an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s assertion that he had received three disciplinary referrals while in prison. We review only for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe district court abuses its discretion if it fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making its determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2010) (alteration and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">In <em>Jules, </em>we held \u201cthat each party [in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding] must be given notice of and an opportunity to contest new information relied on by the district court in [the] proceeding.\u201d 595 F.3d at 1245. We explained that \u201cnew information\u201d is information that was not available at the original sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Carter\u2019s three disciplinary referrals are \u201cnew information\u201d because they were not available\u2014 they did not exist \u2014 at his original sentencing. The district court did not give Carter an opportunity to respond to that new information because it denied his motion before he had replied to the government\u2019s response and before his time for doing so had expired. The question, then, is whether the district court relied on those referrals in denying Carter\u2019s motion. <em>See Jules, </em>595 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We cannot answer that question because the district court\u2019s order does not provide us with enough information to do so. The court\u2019s order states only that it considered Carter\u2019s motion, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; it does not mention the disciplinary referrals. Even so, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors include \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(C). So, in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court may have considered Carter\u2019s disciplinary referrals, which are evidence of his \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d and are relevant to the court\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes.\u201d Because we cannot tell from the record whether the district court relied on the disciplinary referrals, we must vacate its order and remand for further proceedings consistent with the requirements of the <em>Jules </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">.
