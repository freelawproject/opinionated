We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">Connie King purchased a health insurance policy from Freedom Life, which issued in 2000. The policy covered Connie, her husband Aubert, and their three children. In 2007, the Kings\u2019 seventeen-year-old son, C.K., was severely injured in a single-vehicle accident. A police report indicates that the accident occurred when C.K. attempted to overtake a slower moving vehicle. In doing so, C.K. drove his vehicle off of the left side of the road and oversteered in response. As a result, his vehicle rolled over several times and came to rest off of the right side of the road. The police report reflects a witness\u2019s statement that C.K.\u2019s vehicle was traveling in excess of 100 miles per hour immediately prior to the accident. Medical records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>from the hospital where C.K. was treated indicate that he had a blood-alcohol level of 176.9 mg/dL, which equates to an blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1769%.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In Mississippi, the legal limit is 0.08% for those over twenty-one years of age and 0.02% for those under twenty-one years of age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The medical records also show that C.K. tested positive for benzodiazepines and cannabinoids.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Freedom Life policy purchased by the Kings excludes coverage of a \u201closs caused or contributed to by a Covered Insured\u2019s being intoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic, unless administered on the advice of a Provider\u201d and \u201cany loss to which a contributing cause was the Covered Insureds [sic] being engaged in an illegal occupation or illegal activity.\u201d In order to determine whether the policy covered the charges resulting from the automobile accident, Freedom Life requested copies of C.K\u2019s medical records as well as the police report. After reviewing these documents, Freedom Life sent the information to the Medical Review Institute of America (MRIoA) for evaluation. The physician who reviewed the information and authored the MRIoA report concluded that C.K.\u2019s BAC \u201cwould have resulted in a lack of motor skills and impaired his ability to operate a motor vehicle\u201d and \u201ccould have caused or contributed to his motor vehicle accident on 7/25/07 because of impaired judgment and ability to operate a vehicle.\u201d The physician also indicated that the \u201chigh levels of benzo-diazepines and cannabinoids\u201d in C.K.\u2019s blood \u201ccan aggravate the effects of alcohol.\u201d As a result of its inquiry and the MRIoA report, Freedom Life denied coverage based on the intoxicating-substance and illegal-activity policy exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">The Kings responded by filing suit in Mississippi state court. Freedom Life removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Eventually, Freedom Life filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The district court determined that C.K.\u2019s medical expenses were excluded from coverage pursuant to the intoxicating-substance and illegal-activity policy exclusions and therefore Freedom Life did not breach the policy. The Kings argued that Freedom Life either waived its right to deny coverage or was estopped from doing so because it paid expenses from this accident as well as prior excludable losses, but the district court determined that these arguments were without merit because, according to Mississippi law, waiver and estoppel \u201cmay not operate to create coverage or expand existing coverage to risks which, by the terms of the policy, are expressly excluded.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court also concluded that the rest of the Kings\u2019 claims were without merit. Following the grant of summary judgment, the Kings filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWe view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We apply the substantive law of Mississippi because our jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Kings argue that Freedom Life\u2019s denial of coverage constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that summary judgment was inappropriate. The Kings base this argument on payments that they assert Freedom Life made. First, the Kings assert that Freedom Life paid some of C.K.\u2019s medical expenses related to the current automobile accident before and after issuing a denial letter and invoking the exclusions. Second, the Kings assert that Freedom Life previously paid C.K\u2019s medical expenses related to a suicide attempt and a drug-related incident despite the fact that policy exclusions applied to those expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">According to the Supreme Court of Mississippi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">In order to prevail in a bad faith claim against an insurer, the plaintiff must show that the insurer lacked an arguable or legitimate basis for denying the claim, or that the insurer committed a wilful or malicious wrong, or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the insured\u2019s rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The Kings do not argue that the policy exclusions do not apply to their son\u2019s automobile accident, and therefore it is undisputed that Freedom Life had a legitimate basis to deny the claims arising from the accident. Furthermore, even if Freedom Life made the payments on which the Kings\u2019 argument relies, the Kings fail to show how Freedom Life\u2019s payment of claims that it could have denied based on policy exclusions rises to the level of \u201ca wilful or malicious wrong\u201d or \u201cgross and reckless disregard\u201d for the Kings\u2019 rights. Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Although the Kings do not challenge the applicability of the policy exclusions, they do argue that Freedom Life either waived, or should be estopped from denying coverage based upon, the exclusions. The Kings base this argument upon the same payments discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">In <em>Employers Fire Insurance Co. v. Speed, </em>the Supreme Court of Mississippi explained the limitations on the extent to which waiver and estoppel can be applied in the context of insurance policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">This Court follows the general rule that waiver or estoppel can have a field of operation only when the subject matter is within the terms of the policy, and they cannot operate radically to change the terms of the policy so as to cover additional subject matter. Waiver or estoppel cannot operate so as to bring within the coverage of the policy property, or a loss, or a risk, which by the terms of the policy is expressly excepted or otherwise excluded. An insurer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>be estopped by its conduct or knowledge from insisting on a forfeiture of a policy, but the coverage or restrictions on the coverage cannot be extended by the doctrines of waiver or estoppel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auk\">Because it is undisputed that the policy exclusions applied to C.K.\u2019s automobile accident, and because application of the doctrines of waiver or estoppel would change the terms of the policy so as to bring within coverage a loss or risk that was expressly excluded, the district court properly applied Mississippi law in concluding that the Kings\u2019 waiver and estoppel arguments were without merit. The Kings have not cited a precedential decision that would alter this conclusion. This is not a case in which the insurer issued or renewed a policy knowing that the insured was, or would for certain in the near future be, in violation of a policy provision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Kings fail to cite any case in which waiver or estoppel is invoked based upon an insurer making a payment that it could have denied based on a policy exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The Kings also assert that the issue of Freedom Life\u2019s liability for the alleged negligence of its agent, Mary Wilson, in failing to mention the policy exclusions when she sold the policy should have been left for the jury to decide at trial. Summary judgment was appropriate on this claim because the Kings could have learned of the exclusions by simply reading their policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, this claim is barred by Mississippi\u2019s three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The policy was sold and issued in 2000, but the present lawsuit was not filed until 2009. Because the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>language of the policy would have put the Kings on notice of the existence of the exclusions, the Kings\u2019 claim accrued on the date of the sale and expired in 2003.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We also conclude that none of the Kings\u2019 other arguments warrant reversal. First, the Kings claim that C.K. \u201cdid not have the legal capacity to \u2018contract away* \u201d his coverage because he was a seventeen-year-old minor at the time of the accident is plainly without merit because Connie King contracted with Freedom Life, not C.K. Second, the Kings argue that the district court granted summary judgment based on inadmissible hearsay,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but they did not raise this issue before the district court, so we will not consider it on appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Third, although in their reply brief the Kings respond to Freedom Life\u2019s assertion that the exclusions were consistent with Mississippi public policy, we need not address this issue because the Kings did not raise it in their opening brief.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, we need not address the district court\u2019s denial of the Kings\u2019 motion to compel discovery responses because even if the motion to compel were granted and documents were produced reflecting the payments that the Kings allege Freedom Life made, based on the above analysis of the significance of those payments, Freedom Life would still be entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
