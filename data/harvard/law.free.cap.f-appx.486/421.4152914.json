Mackey, III, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action against the Texas Department of Assistive Rehabilitative Services (DARS) and Miche\u00e1l J. Astrue, Commissioner of Social Security. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">In 2008, Mackey applied for a period of disability and for disability insurance benefits, pursuant to Title II of the Social Security Act. The Commissioner denied Mackey\u2019s application, initially and upon reconsideration. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) held a hearing on Mackey\u2019s application and held that Mackey did not qualify for disability insurance. The ALJ\u2019s decision became the Commissioner\u2019s final decision after the Appeals Council denied Mackey\u2019s request for review. This action, in which Mackey seeks $972,000 in past benefits and $1,000,000,000 in punitive damages, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Mackey\u2019s action: (1) seeks judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability benefits, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); (2) claims criminal conspiracy against his constitutional rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241; and (8) claims the denial of disability benefits as discrimination against him, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 405(g) claim against the Commissioner, finding the Commissioner applied the proper legal standards and substantial evidence in the record supported the decision to deny benefits. See <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447 (5th Cir.2007). The court dismissed the \u00a7 405(g) claim against DARS on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds. The court dismissed the \u00a7 241 claim against both parties because it is a criminal statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and does not provide for civil remedies. Finally, the court dismissed the \u00a7 1988 claims, against the Commissioner because he was a federal official acting under color of <em>federal </em>law, not state law, and against DARS on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On appeal, Mackey does not address the merits or reasoning of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims. Rather, he recounts his past failed attempts at obtaining disability insurance and generally accuses defendants of discriminating against him by not granting his requests. He also complains of not having counsel appointed to him for this appeal, a request we previously denied because Mackey failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Although we \u201cliberally construe\u201d the filings of <em>pro se </em>litigants and \u201capply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to parties represented by counsel,\u201d <em>pro se </em>appellants must still comply with the principles of appellate procedure. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). The appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); see <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). General arguments without citations to any error are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (stating that failure to identify any error in district court\u2019s analysis is as if appellant had not appealed judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Because Mackey fails to address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his claims, he has abandoned all issues on appeal. Furthermore, even if Mackey had not abandoned these issues, a review of the district court\u2019s order and its reasoning shows that his claims were properly dismissed. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
