According to the Plaintiffs, this rezoning made it impossible for them to complete a planned development project on the property. The complaint asserts four counts against the City and other Defendants who are not parties to this appeal. Count One alleges that the Defendants violated Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process rights. Count Two alleges a procedural due process violation. Count Three claims that a municipal policy violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights and Count Four claims that the Defendants conspired to violate the Plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and entered judgment in favor of the Defendants. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">As we construe the Plaintiffs\u2019 brief, it presents four issues: (1) whether the district court erred by concluding that the Plaintiffs did not assert a ripe takings claim under the Fifth Amendment; (2) whether the district court erred by deciding that the Plaintiffs failed to put forth evidence to support a regulatory takings claim; (3) whether the district court erred by finding that the City never issued the Plaintiffs a building permit for the development project; and (4) whether the Plaintiffs had a vested right to develop the property protected by the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">We note at the outset that the Plaintiffs have waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Counts One, Three, and Four of the complaint. The Plaintiffs\u2019 brief makes passing reference to the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on the Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process claim. This reference appears in the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument regarding regulatory takings and the brief does not develop any arguments regarding the substantive due process claim. Therefore, any challenge to the entry of summary judgment on the substantive due process claim has been waived. <em>See Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1242 n. 10 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). Similarly, Plaintiffs do not make any argument regarding their claim of conspiracy or their claim that there was an unconstitutional municipal policy. <em>(See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 1-2.) So these arguments are also waived. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1242 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">The district court also properly rejected the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment takings claim. We doubt whether any takings claim was properly alleged, but in any event, a takings claim was not ripe for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>(See </em>Dkt. 93 at 7, 8 &amp; 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 brief also argues that they had a vested right to develop the property because the City had issued a construction permit for the development.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the Plaintiffs have failed to cite to any portion of the record to show that they held a construction or building permit for the development. Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that the City never issued the Plaintiffs a building permit. Furthermore, a procedural due process claim under \u00a7 1983 requires an allegation and proof of constitutionally inadequate process. <em>See Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994)). Thus, even if the Plaintiffs had a vested property interested protected by Georgia law, their claim fails because they did not show that they received inadequate process. The district court did not err by entering summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Finding no error in the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">. To the extent the Plaintiffs seek to use Georgia's vested rights doctrine as a basis for injunctive relief independent from their \u00a7 1983 claims, they failed to assert this claim in their complaint. Therefore, we will not consider the doctrine as an independent basis for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
