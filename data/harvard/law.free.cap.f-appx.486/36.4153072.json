Stinson is a Florida state prisoner. On February 4, 2005, a jury found him guilty of the sale of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(c). Because he was an habitual felony offender, the trial court sentenced him to prison for life. The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>Stinson v. State, </em>935 So.2d 17 (Fla.App. 4th Dist. 2006) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">On September 19, 2006, Stinson moved the trial court to vacate his conviction pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, alleging, among other things, that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The court held an evidentiary hearing and denied the motion. The District Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>Stinson v. State, </em>13 So.3d 484 (Fla.App. 4th Dist. 2009) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">His pursuit of state remedies having failed, Stinson petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He sought relief on several grounds, including ineffective assistance of counsel. He argued that, among other things, counsel was ineffective (1) in failing to investigate the actual distance between the cocaine sale and the school, particularly since the actual address of the school was apparently set forth, at one point, incorrectly; (2) in failing to move the trial court to suppress a suggestive identification made by an informant based on an out-of-court photographic lineup presented by P\u00b0^ce&gt; an&lt;^ \u00ae in failing to request and review his sentencing score sheet before or after trial and failing to get a plea offer. The District Court, relying on the state court records, denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-13\">We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-14\">Whether, in light of the incorrect address contained in the police report for the location of the cocaine sale, [counsel\u2019s] failure to investigate the statutory element of the actual distance between the cocaine sale and the school amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 [80 L.Ed.2d 674] (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-15\">Whether Stinson sufficiently raised his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a motion to suppress a suggestive identification, such that the district court\u2019s failure to address it amounted to error under <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-16\">Whether the district court adequately addressed, and Stinson properly exhausted, the claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain his state sentencing score sheet so that one of the convictions could be disputed at sentencing, satisfying the requirements of <em>Clis-by. </em>And, if so, whether the state court\u2019s decision regarding the sentencing score sheet was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L.No. 104-132,110 Stat. 1214 (1996), a federal court may not grant a state prisoner habeas relief on a claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision: (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Section 2254(d) \u201cimposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings.... \u201d <em>Hardy v. Cross, </em>565 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 490, 491, 181 L.Ed.2d 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Felkner v. Jackson, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1305, 1307, 179 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011)). This standard is \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d when a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is evaluated under the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) standard. <em>Knowles v. Mirzayance, </em>556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1420, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009) (quotations omitted). \u201cThe question is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the <em>Strickland </em>standard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable \u2014 a substantially higher threshold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">This deference applies whenever a claim was adjudicated \u201con the merits.\u201d <em>Loggins v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1204, 1218 (11th Cir.2011). For \u00a7 2254 purposes, a claim is presumed to be adjudicated on the merits if the federal claim is presented to the state court and the state court has denied relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. To succeed on an ineffective assistance claim under <em>Strickland, </em>a Stinson must show that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">Under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, the Supreme Court has continuously reiterated that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient only if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and \u201c[a] court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s representation was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 733, 739, 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011) (quotations omitted); <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Prejudice occurs when there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. With these principals in hand, we address in turn the issues set out in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">Stinson claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the distance between the cocaine sale and the school. All he argues in his brief, though, is that the District Court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim; he doesn\u2019t challenge the District Court\u2019s rejection of the claim. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. He does not argue that we should issue the writ of habeas corpus because the Florida District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision is not entitled to AEDPA deference\u2014 that the decision is deficient for one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>both of the reasons set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2). In that Stinson failed to address the merits of his constitutional claim on appeal, the claim is abandoned. <em>See Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1268 n. 9 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>132 U.S. 158, 10 S.Ct. 44, 33 L.Ed. 298 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Were we to hold that the claim is not abandoned, Stinson still would not prevail because he could not show <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. A law enforcement officer testified at trial that he was personally familiar with the school and knew it to be a school, and more importantly, he personally walked from the crime scene to the school and measured the distance using a measuring device. His calculations determined that the school was 516 feet away. In sum, we affirm the District Court on the first issue. We now turn to the second issue, which involves counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress a suggestive identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">To raise a claim, a plaintiff, here a habeas petitioner, must state it \u201cin such clear and simple language that the [district] court may not misunderstand it.\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006). When the statement is not clear enough to inform the district court of the legal basis for the objection, the objection is not properly preserved. <em>Id.; see also Smith v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1352 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that the petitioner did not properly preserve argument when he mentioned it in only one sentence of his 116-page petition for habeas corpus, cited no authority for it, and never alluded to it in his memorandum in support of the petition). To be sure, <em>pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will be liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">In <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>we expressed concern over the number of habeas cases that we had to remand for consideration of issues the District Court had not resolved, and we instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief presented in a habeas petition, regardless of whether the court was going to grant or deny relief. <em>Id. </em>at 935-36. If a court fails to address all of the claims for relief in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">We have defined a \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. Nevertheless, on other occasions, we have confirmed that the burden for properly identifying a claim, or alleging facts, rests with the petitioner. <em>See, e.g., Chavez v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>647 F.3d 1057 (11th Cir.2011) (noting that district court was not required to \u201cferret out\u201d facts in a case with a \u201cmassive record\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1018, 181 L.Ed.2d 752 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">In his appellate brief, Stinson, represented by counsel, does not argue that he raised his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (for failing to file a motion to suppress) so clearly that the District Court should have addressed it. Rather, he argues that <em>Clisby </em>requires remand simply because the District Court failed to determine whether the claim had been exhausted in state court. An argument that the habeas court failed to determine whether a claim was exhausted is not, under <em>Clisby, </em>a claim for relief; thus, Stinson\u2019s argument fails. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">Moreover, since Stinson does not address the issue presented in the COA\u2014 whether he \u201csufficiently raised his claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d based on the failure to file a motion to suppress\u2014 the issue is abandoned. <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1268 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The District Court did address, pursuant to <em>Clisby, </em>Stinson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failing to obtain his sentencing score sheet so that one of his convictions could be disputed at sentencing. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety, which agreed with the State\u2019s assertion that Stinson had not pointed to anything in the score sheet or presentence report that would have preju-dicially affected his sentencing, nor did he allege that there was a plea offer or that he would have pled guilty if he had seen the score sheet. In the end, the District Court properly concluded that District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision regarding the sentencing score sheet was based on a reasonable determination of the facts and a proper application of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">For the forgoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
