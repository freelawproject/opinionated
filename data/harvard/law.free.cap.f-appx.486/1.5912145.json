After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-23\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, if the retroactively applicable amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range, a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>In 2008, a jury convicted Jones of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of powder cocaine, 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and 100 kilograms or more of marijuana. At sentencing, the district court found that Jones\u2019s offense involved 15 kilograms of <em>powder </em>cocaine. Under the then-applicable guidelines, Jones\u2019s 15 kilograms of <em>powder </em>cocaine converted to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 10, Drug Equivalency Tables (2002). In addition, Jones\u2019s 50 grams of crack cocaine converted to 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See id. </em>At sentencing, Jones was held accountable for a total of 4,100 kilograms consisting of: (1) 3,000 kilograms equivalent for the powder cocaine; (2) 1,000 kilograms equivalent for the crack cocaine; and (3) 100 kilograms of marijuana. The district court set Jones\u2019s base offense level at 34, because the offense involved a marijuana equivalent of at least 3,000 kilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(3) (2002). Thus, the powder cocaine and marijuana alone triggered the level 34 even without regard to the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In 2011, Amendment 750, among other things, changed the marijuana equivalency for 1 gram of crack cocaine from 20 kilograms of marijuana to 3,571 grams of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 750, Reason for Amendment (noting that Amendment 750 made permanent Amendment 748\u2019s temporary, emergency amendment that modified the marijuana equivalency for crack cocaine). Jones then moved for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 750, and the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of Jones\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Amendment 750 changed the marijuana equivalency for crack cocaine, it did not change the marijuana equivalency for <em>powder </em>cocaine. Nor did Amendment 750 alter the base offense level of 34 applicable to a defendant who is accountable for at least 3,000 kilograms of marijuana. Both at the time of Jones\u2019s 2003 sentencing and now, 1 gram of powder cocaine is equal to 200 grams of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 10(D) (2012). Therefore, the marijuana equivalency of the powder cocaine involved in Jones\u2019s offense remains 3,000 kilograms. And, both then and now, this 3,000 kilogram amount, alone, qualified Jones for a base offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (2012). Thus, even though Amendment 750 changed the marijuana equivalency for Jones\u2019s crack cocaine amount, it had no effect on Jones\u2019s base offense level and did not lower his applicable guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">To the extent Jones challenges the district court\u2019s finding at sentencing that Jones\u2019s offense involved 15 kilograms of powder cocaine (converted to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalency), his argument is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings to cases in which a retroactive guidelines amendment affects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the applicable sentencing range); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.Sd 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that, because \u00a7 8582(c)(2) does not provide a basis for a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, Supreme Court decisions by themselves do not provide \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because they are not retroactively applicable guidelines amendments); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>208 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged except the guideline range affected by the amendment. Likewise, Jones\u2019s claim that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory minimum should apply retroactively to him is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In any event, Jones\u2019s sentence was not based on a statutory mandatory minimum, but was calculated under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">For all these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jones\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-15\">. We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>\"de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <em>Id. </em>(quotation mark omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\">. This is not Jones\u2019s first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In 2008, Jones filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, based on Amendment 706, which reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. Under the mistaken belief that Jones\u2019s base offense level was derived from the amount of crack cocaine involved, the district court granted Jones\u2019s motion and reduced his 300-month sentence to 243 months. Jones appealed the new sentence on other grounds. While Jones\u2019s appeal was pending, the district court discovered its mistake and held a hearing on the issue, but ultimately concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to rectify its mistake.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
