Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we conclude that there is no dispute as to any material fact, and Public Service is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-22\">Where, as here, an employee attempts to prove discriminatory intent by circumstantial evidence, the claims are subject to the burden shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the initial burden to establish a prima fa-cie case of disparate treatment. To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to adverse employment action; (3) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside of her class more favorably; and (4) she was qualified to do the job. <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.Sd 1370, 1373 (11th Cir.2008). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then the employer must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging the employee. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004). If the employer meet its burden, then the plaintiff must offer evidence that the alleged reasons for the employer\u2019s actions are a pretext for illegal discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u201c[T]o determine whether employees are similarly situated, we evaluate \u2018whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999)). The comparator\u2019s misconduct must be \u201cnearly identical.\u201d <em>Maniccia, </em>171 F.3d at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Summary judgment was proper on Stinson\u2019s disparate treatment claims because she cannot establish that Public Service treated similarly situated employees outside of her class more favorably. Public Service says that it fired Stinson because it believed she falsified bank records. No comparator falsified bank records. Public Service\u2019s controller checked all of the customer service representa-fives\u2019 records for the month of January 2008 \u2014 records created by white and black employees. He investigated any discrepancies he found, and observed that only Stinson had non-matching records. Even though other customer service representatives had used Stinson\u2019s password to enter payments into the computer system, Stin-son had signed the deposits on the records that did not match. Stinson produced no evidence that she was treated differently then similarly situated white employees, and therefore she cannot make out a prima facie case of race discrimination. Additionally, Public Service\u2019s stated reason for the discharge is legitimate and nondiscriminatory, and Stinson has not produced evidence to dispute that the concern about falsified bank records was a pretext for discrimination. We do not find sufficient evidence to create a jury question in her claims of disparate treatment, and summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Public Service was also entitled to summary judgment on Stinson\u2019s retaliation claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII requires the plaintiff to show that: (1) she engaged in an activity protected under Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008). Here, there is no causal connection between the filing of Stinson\u2019s complaint with the EEOC and any adverse employment action. According to Stinson, the adverse action occurred when Public Service reported her to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on October 20, 2008 \u2014 six months after Stinson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>filed her charge of discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Causation may be inferred by close temporal proximity between a protected activity and the adverse employment action, but under the circumstances, a six month gap is insufficiently proximate to establish causation. <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). Stinson did not present any other evidence of causation. Therefore, she failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII or \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-13\">. \"The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>scheme for the allocation of burdens and the order of presen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tation of proof also applies in \u00a7 1981 cases involving discriminatory treatment in employment situations.\u201d <em>Turnes v.
