On appeal, Tatum challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions and the district court\u2019s application of a dangerous weapon enhancement at sentencing. Tatum also contends that the district court erred when it refused to apply the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) as amended by the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d). After review, we affirm Tatum\u2019s convictions and the dangerous weapon enhancement, but vacate and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b819-19\">At trial, the following evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">A. Search of 2472 Bragdon Avenue House</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">Police investigated drug activity at a house on 2472 Bragdon Avenue in Mobile, Alabama. On March 30, 2010, four Mobile County Deputy Sheriffs \u2014 John Thornton, John McLain, Jeffery Sullivan, and Steve Leger \u2014 attempted a controlled buy from Defendant Tatum through a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d). The deputies\u2019 Cl was to stop by the Bragdon Avenue house while under surveillance by the four deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number><em>The Cl went to and </em>entered the Brag-don Avenue house while the deputies watched from the street inside their vehicles. While the Cl was inside the Bragdon Avenue house, an unknown vehicle stopped in front of the house. Defendant Tatum came out of the house to speak with the two men who emerged from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The deputies then exited their vehicles and approached Defendant Tatum and the other two men. The deputies announced that they were sheriffs deputies with a search warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Deputy McLain approached Defendant Tatum, Tatum put his hand into his sweatshirt. The deputies ordered Tatum and the other two men to the ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deputy Thornton went into the Bragdon Avenue house to ensure no one else was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Meanwhile, Deputy McLain searched Defendant Tatum and removed a clear plastic bag containing 27.31 grams of powder cocaine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from Tatum\u2019s sweatshirt pocket and some currency. Deputy McLain dropped the bag and currency on the ground. Tatum was not armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">After Deputy Thornton checked the inside of the house, he returned outside and searched Defendant Tatum himself. Deputy Thornton found 1.73 grams of crack cocaine and more currency in Tatum\u2019s pants pockets, including $880 in prerecorded bills given to the Cl to make the controlled buy. Additionally, Deputy Thornton found a pistol permit in Tatum\u2019s wallet. The address on the permit was 2472 Brag-don Avenue, and the expiration date was September 17, 2010. Deputy Thornton testified that a pistol permit is good for one year in Mobile County. After Deputy Thornton searched Defendant Tatum, Tatum stated, \u201cAnything you find in the residence belongs to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Deputy Thornton went back inside the Bragdon Avenue house to search it. In the kitchen, Deputy Thornton found powder cocaine, two crack cocaine \u201ccookies,\u201d and a baking soda box on the kitchen counter. The kitchen had a microwave, which tested positive for cocaine residue in a field test. Deputy Thornton explained that crack cocaine can be manufactured by combining powder cocaine and baking soda in a microwave and that crack cocaine is normally \u201ccooked\u201d in a Pyrex glass or a cup, making it resemble a cookie. According to Deputy Thornton, the two cookies of crack cocaine were sitting on a napkin on the counter to dry.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">In a bedroom closet, Deputy Thornton found a shoe box that contained digital scales, a marijuana grinder, a small amount of marijuana,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> $1,000 in currency and some prepackaged cocaine. The shoe box also contained a bag with some Lortab pills. Next to the shoe box was another set of scales, another marijuana grinder, a Pyrex cup and a box of sandwich bags. Deputy Thornton testified that in his experience as a narcotics investigator, scales are often employed to measure out cocaine, and sandwich bags are used for packaging illegal narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Deputy Thornton also discovered in the closet a bulletproof vest and neck collar, a \u201crifle-type gun,\u201d and a suitcase that had a tag marked \u201cTatum/Russell.\u201d Deputy Sullivan also found a vehicle registration and college application in Defendant Tatum\u2019s name, both listing the 2472 Bragdon Avenue address. The vehicle registration was dated February 25, 1999, and the college application was dated May 22, 1998. The deputies found four guns in the bedroom: a Remington shotgun and a Browning scoped rifle, both in cases, and a pistol grip shotgun and a black and silver shotgun hidden under the mattress. Subsequent testing by the Alabama Department of Forensic Science indicated that the deputies recovered 233.89 grams of powder cocaine and 27.56 grams of crack cocaine during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The defense called Willie Pettway, Defendant Tatum\u2019s stepfather. Pettway testified that he owned the house on Bragdon Avenue and that Defendant Tatum had never lived there. Instead, Pettway maintained that, at the time of the search, Tatum lived on Tucker Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">At the close of the evidence, the district court denied Tatum\u2019s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal. The jury convicted Tatum on both counts and found that Tatum\u2019s offense in Count 2 involved five grams or more of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated Defendant Tatum\u2019s advisory guidelines range using the pre-FSA November 2010 Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The PSI assigned an offense level of 26 based on the 233.89 grams of cocaine powder and 27.56 grams of crack cocaine involved in the offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(7). The PSI increased Tatum\u2019s offense level by two levels for possession of a dangerous weapon, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and by two levels for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, for a total offense level of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The PSI assigned Tatum a criminal history category of I. The PSI listed Tatum\u2019s prior Alabama drug conviction, but assigned no criminal history points for that conviction. Specifically, in 1998, Tatum pled guilty in Alabama state court to second degree marijuana possession and was given a one-year suspended sentence. With Tatum\u2019s total offense level of 30 and criminal history category of I, the PSI initially calculated Tatum\u2019s advisory guidelines range as 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">Later on, the PSI concluded that crack cocaine offense in Count 2 carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. If a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 841(a) offense involved 5 or more grams of crack cocaine and the defendant had a prior felony drug conviction, he was subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2006). The PSI stated that Tatum\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 120 to 121 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tatum\u2019s Alabama drug conviction was the basis for the PSI\u2019s conclusion that, as to Count 2, Tatum was subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Defendant Tatum\u2019s written objection to the PSI did not dispute the PSI\u2019s factual allegations. Tatum did object to the PSI\u2019s two-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon. Tatum argued that he did not possess a weapon at the time of his arrest, and that the weapons found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Bragdon Avenue house were hunting weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Further, Tatum argued that he was not subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence because the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s amendments to \u00a7 841(b)(1) applied. In 2010, Congress enacted the FSA, which changed the penalties in \u00a7 841(b) for crack cocaine offenses. The FSA, among other things, raised the amount of crack cocaine in \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) to 28 grams or more, thus eliminating the ten-year mandatory minimum for \u00a7 841(a) crack cocaine offenses involving less than 28 grams. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The FSA became effective on August 3, 2010. <em>See id. </em>Tatum committed his \u00a7 841(a) crack cocaine offense on March 30, 2010. However, Tatum was not sentenced until January 18, 2011, after the effective date of the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">C. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"At_\">At the January 18, 2011 sentencing hearing, Defendant Tatum objected to the two-level increase for obstruction of justice. The government conceded that it could not prove the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and the district court did not impose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Tatum also argued that the two-level increase for possession of a dangerous weapon was unwarranted because he was not armed and did not have access to any guns when he was arrested. The district court overruled the objection because it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the guns were connected to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Tatum then argued that the FSA applied to Tatum\u2019s sentencing, and, thus, Tatum was not subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. Noting that Tatum\u2019s offenses were committed prior to the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date, the district court concluded that the FSA did not apply and overruled the objection. Alternatively, Tatum contended he was eligible for safety-valve relief from the mandatory minimum sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court disagreed because of the firearms found at the Bragdon Avenue residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The district court found that, without the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, Tatum\u2019s total offense level was 28, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in an advisory range of 78 to 97 months. However, due to \u00a7 841(b)(i)(B)\u2019s mandatory minimum ten-year sentence, the district court determined that the guidelines sentence was 120 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1. Before sentencing Tatum, the district court stated, \u201cFor your family\u2019s sake, I\u2019m sorry that the law requires that I give you the mandatory minimum. Because that\u2019s what I believe the law does require me to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">The district court sentenced Tatum to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, to be served concurrently. Tatum filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">We first conclude that the government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on both counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To convict a defendant of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government must prove: (1) knowledge, (2) pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>session, and (3) intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1076 (11th Cir.2008). Knowledge, possession and intent can be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391-92 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cConstructive possession is sufficient for the possession element, and can be established by showing ownership or dominion and control over the drugs or over the premises on which the drugs are concealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1392.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Here, the government introduced ample evidence to establish all three elements of the \u00a7 841(a) offenses. The trial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government and the jury\u2019s verdict, showed that when Tatum left the Bragdon Avenue house, he had on his person cocaine and the prerecorded bills the Cl used to conduct the controlled buy. In the kitchen of the Bragdon Avenue house, from which Tatum exited immediately prior to the search, deputies found both cocaine powder and two recently \u201ccooked\u201d cookies of crack cocaine. The cookies were sitting out on the kitchen counter top, along with a box of baking soda, which was used to convert the powder into crack. The deputies also found in the house other materials used to cook crack cocaine and package it for sale, such as a Pyrex cup, plastic baggies and scales, as well as some cocaine already prepacked. Tatum told the deputies at the scene that everything in the house was his, and the deputies found documents listing the Bragdon Avenue house as his address. These circumstances were more than sufficient for a jury to reasonably find that Tatum had either actual or constructive possession of the crack and powder cocaine, that his possession was knowing and that he intended to distribute the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">B. Dangerous Weapon Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Tatum argues that the district court improperly applied a two-level dangerous weapon enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a defendant\u2019s offense level increases by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The two-level increase applies \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). Once the government demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable. <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Here, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1)\u2019s two-level enhancement. Based on the trial evidence and the undisputed facts in the PSI, the deputies found multiple firearms in various locations in the same house as Tatum\u2019s drugs and drug distribution paraphernalia. One of the firearms was found in the closet with some of the drugs and drug paraphernalia. Several other firearms, including one reported stolen from the Mobile Police Department, were found under a mattress in a bedroom. These facts are sufficient to carry the government\u2019s burden to show that the firearms were present at the site of Tatum\u2019s charged drug offenses. <em>See United States v. Hunter, </em>172 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir.1999) (concluding firearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>were present at the site of the charged drug trafficking because they were found in defendant\u2019s home along with plastic baggies, glass vials, mixing spoons, diluting agent and transaction records); <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct because defendant\u2019s loaded gun was found in an office adjacent to the area where the cocaine was discovered).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Tatum, in contrast, did not carry his burden to show that the connection between the firearms and his drug offenses was clearly improbable. Although Tatum argued the firearms were hunting weapons, he did not present any evidence to support his claim at either his trial or sentencing. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the two-level dangerous weapon enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">C. Fair Sentencing Act</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">At sentencing, the district court declined to apply the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) as amended by the FSA because Tatum\u2019s \u00a7 841(a) crack cocaine offense in Count 2 was committed on March 30, 2010, before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date. The Supreme Court recently held that the FSA\u2019s \u201cmore lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3, 2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). We therefore vacate Tatum\u2019s sentence and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. As a result of their investigation, the deputies already had a search warrant for the house, which they planned to execute during the course of the controlled buy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">. At this point, the Cl, who had remained inside the house, left through a side door and was secured by a fifth deputy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">. On direct examination, Deputy McLain testified that the bag contained crack cocaine. On cross examination, however, Deputy McLain clarified that the bag contained powder cocaine, not crack cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-14\">.Deputy Thornton did not submit the marijuana for forensic examination. However, he testified that based on his experience as a narcotics investigator, he recognized the material as marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">. The PSI further stated that the statutory maximum was 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for Count 1 and life imprisonment for Count 2. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), (C) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of the evidence grounds. <em>United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2011). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and we review <em>de novo </em>the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts. <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">. Because we vacate Tatum's 120-month sentences, we do not address his argument that his sentences were unreasonable. Furthermore, even after the FSA, a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum increases if he has a prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c) (providing for a statutory maximum of thirty years, rather than twenty years, when a defendant has a prior felony drug conviction). On remand, the parties also should address Tatum's 1998 marijuana possession conviction and whether the government satisfied the notice requirements in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). The district court should make a finding as to what the statutory maximum is on each count and why.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
