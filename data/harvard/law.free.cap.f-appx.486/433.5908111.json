He currently is serving a life sentence for conspiring to commit money laundering and conspiring to possess with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base and five or more kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">The district court determined that Odom was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction in his sentence because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guidelines range of imprisonment. Odom acknowledges that fact but argues that the district court should have granted his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Citing the \u201cunique circumstances of [his] case,\u201d he contends that \u201cfailure to reduce his sentence resulted in the district court\u2019s sanctioning of a draconian and discriminatory punishment [that violated his] rights to equal protection and due process.\u201d Odom asserts that his sentence was unduly harsh because it was calculated in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), based on an amount of crack cocaine that was neither alleged in the indictment nor established beyond a reasonable doubt and because he was sentenced at a time when the Guidelines unjustly applied a 100:1 ratio in calculating sentences for defendants convicted of crimes involving crack cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Odom\u2019s applicable guidelines range, Odom was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as a matter of law. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, the district court had no cause to determine whether a sentence reduction would be appropriate in light of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Moreover, Odom\u2019s arguments challenged aspects of his original sentence that were not affected by Amendment 706 and were not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 711-12 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">Odom has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Odom\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
