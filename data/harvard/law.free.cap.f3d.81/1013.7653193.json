Normally, a defendant cannot appeal a district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure. Where, as here, a defendant argues that the district court believed it did not have discretion to grant such a departure, however, we may consider the appeal. <em>United States v. Fossett, </em>881 F.2d 976, 979 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">McFarlane\u2019s counts of conviction contained a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. The district court, however, imposed a sentence of 57 months (the low end of the Guideline range), three months below the mandatory minimum through application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, a Guideline section reflecting congressional legislation set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). Section 5C1.2 allows courts to sentence those defendants who meet certain criteria without regard for any statutory minimum sentence. It is not disputed that McFarlane met the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">McFarlane argues that the district court erroneously concluded that it did not have authority to sentence him below the Guideline range after applying \u00a7 5C1.2. McFarlane contends that because a straightforward application of \u00a7 5C1.2 has little effect on his sentence (reducing it by only three months), the legislative intent of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) is not reflected in his resulting sentence and the statute is rendered meaningless in his case. Specifically, McFarlane argues that in passing the part of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which is codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), Congress intended courts to give those first-time offenders who meet the statutory criteria a two-level reduction in their Guideline offense levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">In support of this argument McFarlane notes that after the incorporation of \u00a7 5C1.2, the Guideline Commission proposed an amendment to the Guidelines now in existence at \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(4). The amendment directs sentencing courts to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two if a defendant meets the criteria listed in \u00a7 5C1.2 and has an offense level of 26 or greater. McFarlane argues that the Commission\u2019s proposal supports his contention that Congress intended courts to give offenders a two-level reduction in their Guideline offense levels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">MeFarlane\u2019s argument lacks merit. Nothing in the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) indicates that Congress intended a two-level decrease for any defendants who meet the statutory criteria, even for those who might benefit only marginally from the Act. The intent, clear from the face of the Act, is to provide a \u201csafety valve\u201d so that less culpable offenders are not subject to mandatory minimums. The statute does not indicate, in any way, that Congress sought to prescribe departures below or decreases in the otherwise applicable Guideline offense levels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s decision to propose what is now \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(4), which provides for a two-level decrease in offense levels for certain defendants, does not speak to the congressional intent behind \u00a7 5C1.2. Rather, it indicates only that the Commission has discretion to propose changes to the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>when it sees fit and where statutory limits allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">McFarlane further argues that a discretionary downward departure would be available in this case pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0, which authorizes downward departures for mitigating circumstances of a kind or to a degree not adequately taken into account by the Commission in formulating the Guidelines. He specifically claims that a discretionary departure would be justified in this case due to the Commission\u2019s failure to reflect congressional intent to provide for a two-level reduction for first-time offenders whose offense level was 26 or greater. As noted above nothing on the face of the statute indicates such congressional intent. Thus, the basis for a discretionary downward departure offered by McFarlane was not available to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The government acknowledges that were the Sentencing Commission to make \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4) retroactive, McFarlane could seek to be resentenced pursuant to the new Guideline. The Commission did not make the amendment retroactive, as indicated by the amendment\u2019s absence from \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s retroactivity provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">For the foregoing reasons, McFarlane\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">. McFarlane notes that in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>51 F.3d 980 (11th Cir.1995), this court held that proposed amendments to Sentencing Guidelines could be considered subsequent legislative history in the analysis of prior Application Notes. Thus, this court, according to McFarlane, should consider \u00a7 2D1.1(b) as subsequent legislative history with respect to \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Smith </em>does not apply here; <em>Smith </em>involved a case where a proposed amendment was an attempt to clarify an earlier portion of the Guidelines. Section 2D1.1(b) does not purport to clarify \u00a7 5C1.2; rather, it adds an entirely new substantive provision to the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1092-11\">.
