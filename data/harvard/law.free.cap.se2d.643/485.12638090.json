KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Anthony L. Washington was convicted of felonious obstruction of justice in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). Washington now claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. Because the Commonwealth failed to prove an element of the offense, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia upholding Washington's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Washington was indicted for \"feloniously and unlawfully, by threats of bodily harm or force, knowingly to attempt to intimidate or impede a law enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty\" in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). At Washington's bench trial in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond on this charge, Matthew Mazoni and Mark Bailey, each of whom was employed as a deputy sheriff with the City of Richmond Sheriff's Office, were witnesses for the Commonwealth. Deputy Mazoni testified that, on June 19, 2003, after escorting Washington to the \"lockup\" area in the courthouse following Washington's trial on unrelated charges, Washington repeatedly asked the deputies when the transportation unit would arrive to transport him back to the jail. According to Deputy Bailey, Washington told the deputies that he needed to return to the jail to make a telephone call so that \"he could get that shit finished tonight\" and because \"he wanted that mother fucker gone.\" Deputy Bailey testified that he informed\n   Washington that the transportation unit had been called and instructed Washington to stop asking about it. Washington responded, \"[F]uck you. I will kill you, too.\" When Washington made that statement, Deputy Bailey was sitting at a desk, waiting on the transportation unit to arrive. A wall separated him from the lockup cell where Washington was confined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Washington did not present any testimony but, at the close of the Commonwealth's evidence, he moved to strike, arguing that the evidence failed to prove the statutory requirements relating to the nature of Deputy Bailey's duty at the time of the alleged offense. The trial court denied Washington's motion, found him guilty as charged, and sentenced Washington to ten years of incarceration. Washington appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals of Virginia and again challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) with regard to Deputy Bailey's discharge of his duty. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Washington v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1325-05-2 (May 2, 2006). This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Washington challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction for felonious obstruction of justice. Washington argues, as he did in the trial court and the Court of Appeals, that the evidence failed to establish the required element of the law-enforcement officer's discharge of a duty at the time of the offense as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). While Washington focuses upon the particular physical activity in which Deputy Bailey was engaged at the moment Washington uttered the threatening statement, the dispositive question concerning the law-enforcement officer's duty in this case is whether the Commonwealth had to prove, as an element of the offense, that Deputy Bailey was discharging a duty \"relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate\" one of the felony offenses specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"`It is elementary that the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.'\"\n   <em>\n    Dowdy v.

If any person without just cause knowingly obstructs a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, attorney for the Commonwealth, witness or any law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duties as such or fails or refuses without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so by such judge, magistrate, justice, juror, attorney for the Commonwealth, witness, or law-enforcement officer, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. If any person, by threats or force, knowingly attempts to intimidate or impede a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, attorney for the Commonwealth, witness, or any law-enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in his duties as such, or to obstruct or impede the administration of justice\n   in any court, he shall be deemed to be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C. If any person by threats of bodily harm or force knowingly attempts to intimidate or impede a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, witness, or any law-enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty, or to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate \u00a7 18.2-248 or subdivision (a)(3), (b) or (c) of \u00a7 18.2-248.1, or \u00a7 18.2-46.2 or \u00a7 18.2-46.3, or relating to the violation of or conspiracy to violate any violent felony offense listed in subsection C of \u00a7 17.1-805, he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the factual context of this case, a violation of subsection A occurs if a person, without just cause, knowingly obstructs a law-enforcement officer in the performance of his duties. In contrast, a person violates subsection B by using threats or force to knowingly attempt to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer lawfully engaged in the performance of his duties. A violation of either of these subsections is deemed a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The elements of the offense set forth in subsection C are not, however, as straightforward as the elements of the offenses in subsections A and B. With regard to subsection C, the question we confront is whether the Commonwealth must prove only that a person used threats of bodily harm or force to knowingly attempt to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer lawfully engaged in the performance of his duties or whether the Commonwealth must also prove that the law-enforcement officer's duties being discharged \"relat[ed] to a violation of or conspiracy to violate\" one of the various felony offenses listed therein. Unless this additional element pertains not only to the second clause of subsection C, dealing with \"obstruct[ing] or imped[ing] the administration of justice in any court,\" but also to the first clause, regarding the use of threats of bodily harm or force to attempt to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer, there is no significant difference between the elements of the offenses set forth in subsections B and C. Yet, a violation of subsection C is a Class 5 felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As the Commonwealth argues, subsection B uses the general term \"threats,\" while subsection C is limited to \"threats of bodily harm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, if the phrase \"relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate\" one of the specified felony offenses modifies only \"obstruct[ing] or imped[ing] the administration of justice in any court,\" is a person who uses only \"force,\" as opposed to \"threats of bodily harm,\" to knowingly attempt to intimidate or impede a law-enforcement officer in the discharge of his duties as such guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor under subsection B or a Class 5 felony under subsection C? The Commonwealth does not address this question but, instead, points out that a prosecutor always has the discretion to select how to charge an individual when the conduct at issue violates several statutes. We do not disagree with that statement, but it does not answer the question before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court has never addressed the elements of the offense set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), but the Court of Appeals has done so twice and reached different conclusions in each case.\n   <em>\n    Compare Turner v.

Turner argued that proof of the underlying felony drug offense was an element of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C) and that, since the Commonwealth did not establish that he violated Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A), the Commonwealth\n   could not convict him of obstructing justice under Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). The Court of Appeals rejected Turner's argument, concluding that \"[Code] \u00a7 18.2-460(C) requires only that the law enforcement activity\n   <em>\n    `relat[e]\n   </em>\n   to a violation of ...

Yet, there is no meaningful distinction unless the two phrases, \"relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate\" one of the listed felony offenses, modify not only \"obstruct[ing] or imped[ing] the administration of justice in any court,\" but also the use of \"threats of bodily harm or force to knowingly attempt[] to intimidate or impede a ... law-enforcement officer[] lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty.\" Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). It is this additional element that makes the proscribed conduct in subsection C more serious than the conduct prohibited in subsection B and separates a misdemeanor from a felony. We agree with the Court of Appeals' observation in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   that subsection C \"evinc[es the] legislative intent to make the punishment for obstructing justice as to certain ... offenses more severe than for obstructing justice generally.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2313928\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/20/713/\">\n    20 Va.App. at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2313928\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/20/713/\">\n    460 S.E.2d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of our conclusion regarding the elements of the offense of felonious obstruction of justice, it is clear that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Washington violated Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). The Commonwealth presented no proof that, at the time Washington made the threatening statement, Deputy Bailey was engaged in the discharge of any duty \"relating to a violation of or conspiracy to violate\" one of the felony offenses listed in that subsection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Commonwealth produced no evidence to establish one of the elements necessary to constitute the offense of obstructing justice under Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), Washington was convicted of a \"non-offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2109315\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/241/244/#p251\">\n    241 Va. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20S.E.2d%20678\">\n    402 S.E.2d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (1991). Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in upholding Washington's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Also, it is incumbent upon this Court to resolve the conflict in the decisions of the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   and to correct an erroneous interpretation of a penal statute.\n   <em>\n    See Volkswagen of Am.
