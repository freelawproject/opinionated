KOONTZ, JR.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In these appeals, we consider whether the Court of Appeals of Virginia correctly determined that an environmental conservation organization has standing to appeal the approval of a wastewater discharge permit affecting the James River issued by the State Water Control Board. Specifically, the issue presented in these appeals is whether the organization has representational and individual standing to request judicial review to challenge the issuance of the permit pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Philip Morris USA Inc. (Philip Morris), with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, is the nation's largest cigarette manufacturer. Philip Morris' Park 500 facility in Chester, Virginia is used to produce a reconstituted tobacco product. Since 1972, the Park 500 facility has held a discharge permit allowing the disposal of treated wastewater into the James River at a point below Richmond. On October 28, 2002, Philip Morris filed a permit renewal application under the Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The discharge of pollutants into public waterways is regulated by the federal Clean Water Act of 1977, 33 U.S.C \u00a7 1251\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2000 &amp; Supp. IV 2004). The Clean Water Act allows states to administer the issuance of wastewater discharge permits within their territories. The State Water Control Board\n   administers the wastewater discharge permit program in Virginia under the State Water Control Law. Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.2 through 62.1-44.34:28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (the Foundation), a non-profit corporation registered with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and dedicated to protecting the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, participated in the public comment process regarding the renewal of the Park 500 facility permit. The Foundation contended that the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the wastewater discharged by the Park 500 facility would impair the river's designated uses and kill or injure fish and aquatic plants. Following a public hearing, the State Water Control Board approved the renewal of Philip Morris' Park 500 facility permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the Foundation timely filed a petition for appeal in the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County. The petition alleged that the State Water Control Board's decision to issue the permit violated various provisions of the federal Clean Water Act and the State Water Control Law, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1342 and Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.2, 62.1-44.4, and 62.1-44.15. The Foundation based its assertion of legal standing in an individual capacity to seek judicial review of the board's decision upon fifteen educational, recreational, and Chesapeake Bay restorative programs on the James River that the Foundation operates downstream from the Park 500 facility and that would be harmed by the permitted discharge. The Foundation further asserted that it had representational standing based upon injury to unidentified members of the Foundation who regularly use and enjoy the James River for swimming, boating, kayaking, canoeing, sport fishing, and other aesthetic, educational, and recreational pursuits. The Foundation alleged that, as a result of the unlawful issuance of the discharge permit, it had \"suffered and will continue to suffer actual and/or imminent injury\" and that it \"represents members and citizens of the Commonwealth who have suffered and will continue to suffer actual and imminent injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Philip Morris and the Commonwealth, acting on behalf of the State Water Control Board, filed demurrers asserting that the Foundation had failed to plead sufficient facts to establish its standing in an individual capacity. Philip Morris and the Commonwealth further asserted that the Foundation's claims of representational standing were not authorized under any relevant statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following a hearing on these demurrers, the circuit court issued an opinion letter dated January 4, 2005 in which it concluded that the Foundation had neither individual nor representational standing to pursue an appeal of the decision of the State Water Control Board to issue the renewed permit. In the opinion letter, subsequently incorporated by reference into a final order entered on April 28, 2005, the circuit court found that the Foundation had \"suffered no particularized injury in fact and does not have the authority to sue on behalf of a class as required by the legislature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Foundation appealed the judgment of the circuit court to the Court of Appeals. In that appeal, the Foundation asserted that the circuit court incorrectly ruled that Virginia does not recognize representational standing and contended that it had pled sufficient facts to establish both representational and individual standing under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Philip Morris and the Commonwealth contended, based on prior Court of Appeals precedent, that representational standing is not recognized in Virginia unless it is specifically authorized by statute.\n   <em>\n    See Pearsall v. Virginia Racing Commission,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1232321\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/26/376/#p381\">\n    26 Va.App. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1232321\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/26/376/#p381\">\n    494 S.E.2d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (1998). They contended that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 does not\n   expressly authorize representational standing and that such standing may not be implied from the statute. They further asserted that the Foundation's claims of injury were merely allegations of harm to the environment which do not establish a basis for individual standing.\n   <em>\n    See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Additionally, the Court of Appeals noted that it had already resolved the issue of whether Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 provided for representational standing in a decision announced after the circuit court had entered final judgment in this case. Under nearly identical circumstances, the Court of Appeals had determined that \"Virginia recognizes representational standing . . . and that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 confers this representational standing in cases meeting its requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478566\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478566\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/35/\">\n    at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478566\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/35/\">\n    628 S.E.2d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc. and Citizens for Stumpy Lake v.

A demurrer admits the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading to which it is addressed, as well as any facts that may be reasonably and fairly implied and inferred from those facts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Mattaponi Indian Tribe v.

Accordingly, in reviewing the judgment of the circuit court, an appellate court looks solely to the allegations in the pleading to which the demurrer was sustained.

With regard to the provisions of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 entitling \"any person\" under specific circumstances to judicial review of a State Water Control Board decision, they maintain that the language of the statute tracks the requirements for finding individual standing to challenge an administrative agency's action and, thus, they conclude that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 does not grant representational standing to seek judicial review of the decision of the State Water Control Board in this case. Accordingly, they maintain that the Court of Appeals erred in its previous holding in\n   <em>\n    Stumpy Lake\n   </em>\n   that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 grants representational standing in cases meeting its requirements and in reiterating that holding in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Initially, we think it helpful to clarify the procedural history regarding\n   <em>\n    Stumpy Lake.\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals noted in its opinion in the present case that \"[a]lthough a petition for appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Stumpy Lake\n   </em>\n   decision was filed, the Supreme Court ultimately\n   <em>\n    refused to consider the appeal on the merits.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Bay Foundation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478566\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/35/\">\n    48 Va.App. at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3478566\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/35/\">\n    628 S.E.2d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The Court of Appeals based its holding in\n   <em>\n    Stumpy Lake,\n   </em>\n   that the Commonwealth recognizes representational standing generally, on its prior determination of that issue in\n   <em>\n    Concerned Taxpayers of Brunswick County v.

In appropriate cases civil penalties may be used to \"encourage defendants to discontinue current violations and deter them from committing future ones.\"\n   <em>\n    Laidlaw,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p181\">\n    528 U.S. at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p181\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A complete solution to the alleged injury is not required. It is enough to be able to address the harms of the named defendants.\n   <em>\n    See American Canoe Ass'n v. Murphy Farms, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313414\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/505/#p520\">\n    326 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 (4th Cir.2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Foundation seeks to have the discharge permit set aside and for the discharge into the James River to cease until such time as Philip Morris demonstrates that it is able to comply with the state designated use for the waterway. This result is a civil remedy that is available to an appropriate court of review. As such, the injury is redressable through a favorable decision by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on the preceding analysis, we hold that the Foundation has sufficiently pled an\n   injury to at least one member that would grant Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The additional two prongs for representational standing described in\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   are not significant issues in this case. Philip Morris and the Commonwealth have not contested that the interests the Foundation seeks to protect are germane to its purpose or that the relief requested requires the participation of the individual members. The Foundation is an organization established to protect the waterways of the Chesapeake Bay, of which the James River is one. An action to protect the James River from wastewater discharge that may be harmful to the river and bay is within that organizational purpose. Additionally, the remedy sought by the Foundation will address the asserted injury and will not require the participation of individual members. Accordingly, we hold that the second and third prongs of the test for representational standing have been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having concluded that the petition filed in the circuit court has met, under the criteria of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, all the requirements that would grant Article III standing for an organization seeking representational standing, we hold that the statute authorizes representational standing to a corporate person to seek judicial review of a decision of the State Water Control Board and that the Foundation's petition was thus sufficient to survive the demurrers of Philip Morris and the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We emphasize that our holding in this case is limited to instances where representational standing is provided for by a statute requiring Article III standing to seek judicial review of an action by a state agency under delegatory authority from the federal government. We are not called upon to consider under the facts of this case whether Virginia would recognize representational standing under any circumstances other than those presented by the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Individual Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We turn now to consider the assertion of Philip Morris and the Commonwealth that the Foundation lacked individual standing to seek judicial review in this case. Code 62.1-44.29 allows \"any person who has participated, in person or by submittal of written comments, in the public comment process related to, a final decision of the Board\" to obtain judicial review where there is Article III standing. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.3 defines a \"`Person'\" as \"an individual, corporation, partnership, association, governmental body, municipal corporation or any other legal entity.\" The Foundation is a registered corporation and therefore falls within the relevant definition of person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to have Article III individual standing, the Foundation must have pled facts sufficient to meet the test in\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   and Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 as previously described. The analysis is substantially similar to the analysis for individual standing of the organization's members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Foundation has alleged injury to itself as an organization separate and apart from any injury to its members. In its petition, the Foundation alleges that it \"operates fifteen (15) educational programs, which include projects in and around the segment of the James River impacted by the unlawful nutrient discharges authorized by the challenged Permit. Among the [Foundation's] programs that are and will continue to be adversely affected by the unlawful nutrient discharges ... is the replenishment of underwater aquatic grasses in the vicinity of and downstream from the Philip Morris facility.\" The Foundation's petition further alleges that the excessive nitrates and phosphates in the wastewater discharge cause algae blooms that impact the usefulness of the James River for the Foundation's educational and recreational programs. The wastewater discharge also harms aquatic plants such as the ones included in the Foundation's planting activities. Based on these allegations, we hold that the Foundation has alleged sufficient facts to establish an \"injury in fact\" to itself as an organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The harms alleged on an individual and representational basis are similar. The reasoning in the previous discussion of causal connection and redressability also applies to the Foundation's assertion of individual standing and does not need to be repeated here. The facts alleged in the Foundation's petition, if true, establish a causal connection\n   with its injury and that the relief sought is redressable by the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, we hold that Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 provides for representational standing, by an appropriate entity, to seek judicial review of a case decision by the State Water Control Board, as well as for individual standing. We further hold that in the present case the Foundation's petition adequately establishes, for purposes of surviving the demurrers filed by Philip Morris and the Commonwealth, its representational and individual standing to seek judicial review of the State Water Control Board's decision to renew the permit with regard to Philip Morris' Park 500 facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The circuit court further found that the Foundation would not be able to cure these defects by amending the petition for appeal and, accordingly, although the Foundation had not yet requested leave to amend, prospectively opined that such a request would not be granted. The Foundation subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration and request for leave to amend. On April 8, 2005, the circuit court issued a second opinion letter reiterating its findings from the January 4, 2005 opinion letter and rejecting further authority cited by the Foundation. In denying the motion for reconsideration in the final order, the circuit court incorporated by reference this second opinion letter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As in this case, both the Commonwealth and the permit-holder, Aegis Waste Solutions, brought independent appeals from the decision of the Court of Appeals in\n    <em>\n     Concerned Taxpayers of Brunswick County.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3.\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Carol M.
