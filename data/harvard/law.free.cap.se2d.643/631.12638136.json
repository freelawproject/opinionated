The majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Jones I\n   </em>\n   concluded that plaintiff's claims as regards obstruction of public justice and constitutional violations were rendered \"moot\" by virtue of its conclusion that plaintiff's claim for gross negligence failed.

In the instant case, the evidence would allow a jury to conclude that a camera in Kelly's police car had made a videotape recording of the accident, and that the videotape was subsequently misplaced or destroyed. We affirm the trial court's denial of defendants' motion for summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We next address plaintiff's complaint alleging that defendant City of Durham (the City) violated her rights under N.C. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 19 \"by their assertion of the defense of governmental immunity to the Plaintiff's first two claims for relief in this civil action[,]\" and her contention that the City's \"assertion of governmental immunity as a legal defense to the Plaintiff's first two claims for relief constitutes an unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious governmental action.\" We reverse the trial court and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff's constitutional claim. We reach this conclusion for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Preliminarily, we observe that the trial court's order mistakenly characterizes plaintiff's suit as presenting a challenge to the facial constitutionality of the City's practices for handling claims against it. Plaintiff's complaint is strictly limited to allegations that defendants violated her state constitutional rights by asserting sovereign immunity\n   <strong>\n    \"in this cause\"\n   </strong>\n   as a defense to \"Plaintiff's first two claims.\" Thus, plaintiff challenges the manner in which the city's policies have been\n   <strong>\n    applied to her,\n   </strong>\n   rather than making the separate and distinct claim that the City's customs are facially unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See Maines v. City of Greensboro,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8559865\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/300/126/#p130\">\n    300 N.C. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20S.E.2d%20155\">\n    265 S.E.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (1980) (discussing the two types of claims where plaintiff \"first contends that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face . . . alternative[ly], plaintiff argues that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied\"). However, the trial court's order repeatedly refers to plaintiff's having brought claims against the city's assertion of sovereign immunity \"in this\n   <strong>\n    and other cases.\"\n   </strong>\n   This is an erroneous characterization of plaintiff's complaint, which properly should be analyzed as a challenge to the City's policies for handling claims as applied to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We conclude that plaintiff failed to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on her constitutional claim. The core of plaintiff's argument is her allegation that the City has a policy or practice of \"waiving\" sovereign immunity in some cases but not in others. She further alleges that the City's determination of when to \"waive sovereign immunity\" resides in the \"unbridled discretion\" of certain city employees, and that the City's waiver of sovereign immunity for certain \"similarly situated\" claimants violates her rights to due process and equal protection. Plaintiff's argument rests on the erroneous premise that the City has a practice of selectively \"waiving\" the defense of sovereign immunity. The uncontradicted record evidence establishes that claims against the City are never denied on the basis of sovereign immunity, and that claims are paid or denied on the basis of their legal merits, based on evaluation of whether (1) the claimant asserts a legally cognizable cause of action; (2) investigation shows the claim to be meritorious; and (3) the damages have been documented. Plaintiff presents no evidence that defendant ever\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   a claim based on sovereign immunity. However, if sued by a claimant, the City always raises the defense of sovereign immunity when appropriate. Thus, the City\n   <strong>\n    never\n   </strong>\n   denies claims based on sovereign immunity, but\n   <strong>\n    always\n   </strong>\n   asserts the defense if it is sued. Accordingly, there is no evidence that defendants have a practice of \"selectively waiving\" this defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nor does the City's practice of executing settlement contracts with certain claimants constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity in those cases. \"`Whether denominated accord and satisfaction or compromise and settlement, the executed agreement terminating\n   or purporting to terminate a controversy is a contract, to be interpreted and tested by established rules relating to contracts.'\"\n   <em>\n    Bolton Corp. v.

The representative settlement form in the record does not waive sovereign immunity or any other defense. Further, it specifically states that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This release expresses a full and complete settlement of a liability claimed and denied, . . . and the acceptance of this release shall not operate as an admission of liability on the part of anyone\n   <strong>\n    nor as an estoppel, waiver, or bar with respect to any claim the party or parties released may have against the undersigned.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (emphasis added). Thus, should a tort claimant violate the settlement agreement by suing the City after executing the settlement contract, the City would be entitled to raise any applicable defense, including satisfaction and accord or sovereign immunity. Plaintiff presents no evidence that the City ever executed a settlement contract\n   <strong>\n    waiving\n   </strong>\n   the right to assert sovereign immunity in the event that the claimant tried to sue the City after executing the settlement contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, plaintiff has not presented evidence that the City's settlement practices violated her due process or equal protection rights under the State constitution. \"`[T]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,'. . . .

In the instant case, defendants presented ample evidence supporting their decision that plaintiff's claim was not meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, we disagree with plaintiff that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   controls the result in the instant case.

[The City] classifies claims . . . into two different categories-(1) immunity is\n   <strong>\n    asserted with no exception,\n   </strong>\n   or (2) immunity is\n   <strong>\n    asserted but the claim is paid in settlement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11078355\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/138/1/#p14\">\n    138 N.C.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   12-13 and 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20S.E.2d%20590\">\n    530 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   598-99 and 601 (emphasis added). This contrasts sharply with Durham's policy of never asserting sovereign immunity as a basis for denial of a claim, and of always asserting it in response to a lawsuit. Further, unlike defendant City in\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska,\n   </em>\n   Durham does not leave decisions about settlement of cases to the unfettered discretion of city employees. As discussed above, the uncontroverted evidence is that claims against the City are resolved by determination of whether the claimant (1) presents a legally cognizable claim, that (2) is meritorious, as shown by investigation into the facts, and (3) has documented injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[Plaintiff's] position results from the assumption that the [City of Durham] may purposely and wilfully abuse the discretion with which the law invests it. It is hard to see how any administrative body can function without exercising discretion; but even then the discretion must not be whimsical, or capricious, or arbitrary, or despotic.\"\n   <em>\n    North Carolina State Highway Com. v.

A party's determination of whether to settle a claim will\n   <strong>\n    always\n   </strong>\n   require exercise of discretion and the weighing and assessment of largely subjective factors, such as the credibility and demeanor of prospective witnesses, or the likely response of a jury to certain evidence. It also requires evaluation of legal issues such as a claim's validity, the impact of relevant precedent on trial issues, or the availability of affirmative defenses. Accordingly, the determination of how to respond to a claim brought against the City is akin to other discretionary judgments that cannot be reduced to a mathematical formula, such as decisions about hiring, firing, or resource allocation. The process is very different from that involved in decisions about zoning, permitting, or eligibility for public services, because such determinations can be reduced to an objective set of criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Indeed, the gravamen of plaintiff's claim is in reality a challenge to the inequality in bargaining strength between a tort claimant and the City. Ordinarily, if parties cannot settle a civil dispute, a plaintiff has the option of filing suit. However, if sovereign immunity is available as a defense, then the plaintiff has no recourse if a settlement cannot be reached. Thus, plaintiff seeks to redress the reality that the City can decide whether or not to settle claims, while plaintiff lacks the usual power to bring suit if the claim is not settled. During the hearing on these motions, plaintiff's counsel conceded as much, stating to the trial court that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   . . .

Under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160A-485(a) (2005), \"[a]ny city is authorized to waive its immunity from civil liability in tort by the act of purchasing liability insurance. . . . Immunity shall be waived only to the extent that the city is indemnified by the insurance contract from tort liability.\" However, the statute also provides that \"no city shall be deemed to have waived its tort immunity\n   <strong>\n    by any action other than\n   </strong>\n   the purchase of liability insurance.\" (emphasis added). Our appellate courts have consistently held that \"N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160A-485 provides that the\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   way a city may waive its governmental immunity is by the purchase of liability insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwelder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2503328\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/332/319/#p324\">\n    332 N.C. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20S.E.2d%20432\">\n    420 S.E.2d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Blackwelder,\n   </em>\n   defendant City formed a corporation to handle claims against the City of less than $1,000,000.

We therefore affirm the trial court order in this regard. We also conclude that the trial court correctly dismissed the claim alleging ordinary negligence, and that defendant's motion for summary judgment on the claim for obstruction of justice was properly denied. We further conclude that defendants are entitled to assert sovereign immunity to the extent that they have not waived the defense by purchase of liability insurance. Finally, we reverse the trial court's order to the extent it denied defendant's motions for summary judgment on the constitutional claims because plaintiff has failed to present evidence that the City's decision not to pay her claim violated her constitutional rights. On remand, the trial court is directed to enter summary judgment in favor of defendant as to the constitutional claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and ELMORE concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
