Ross to Rosalia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>A. Ross, the present plaintiff, dated December 9, 1896, and recorded March 2, 1898, in deed book 123 at page 511. It is admitted upon the record that Eleanor B. Ross is the same person named upon the records of this court as Eleanor Ross. It is further admitted, for the purposes of this case, that the common source of title to the land in controversy was in Eleanor B. Ross.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">Now this, upon the face of it, uncontradicted, would make a good title in the plaintiff, but the defendants defend upon the ground that they, or one of them, Edwin C. Dewey, is the owner of the premises in dispute, having derived title thereto by virtue of a deed made by Geo. II. Barnett, sheriff of Erie county, to Dyer Loomis, acknowledged in open court, November 17, 1898, and recorded in sheriff\u2019s deed book No. 5 at page 4, and recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Erie county in deed book 125 at page 447.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">That this sheriff\u2019s deed was made and executed in pursuance of a sale made by the sheriff of these premises, by virtue of a fieri facias issued out of this court September 28, 1898, which fieri facias was issued upon a judgment of Dyer Loomis v. W. L. Ross and Eleanor Ross, entered May 20, 1895, for $731.74, which judgment was based upon an original judgment entered in this court to No. 407, November Term, 1867, entered December 26, 1867. That was revived by amicable scire facias to No. 240, May Term, 1874, on April 13, 1874. That the judgment entered May 20, 1895, was entered for an amount admitted to be due by the defendants, or one of them at least, in an affidavit of defense, filed July 8, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">The plaintiff contends that the judgment had been entered for want of an affidavit of defense, and the record so shows, on July 1, 1890, upon alias scire facias 104, May Term, 1890, issued upon judgment No. 240, May Term, 1874, and that the judgment of May 20, 1895, is not sufficient foundation for the fi. fa. issued in this case, on which the sheriff sold these lands, but rather that the judgment of May 20, 1895, was a mere liquidation of the judgment entered July 1, 1890. [While so far as the records in this ease show this judgment of May 20, 1895, may have been, and probably is, irregular, yet upon its face it purports to be, and is, the solemn judgment of this court and this lien was upon all the real estate owned by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>fendants at the time of its entry, by virtue of the statutes of Pennsylvania, to wit: from May 20, 1895, and it is of no consequence, so far as the purposes of this case are concerned, whether there was a judgment entered July 1, 1890, \u2014 whether there were two judgments entered for the same cause of action, or more than two judgments.] [1] [This judgment upon its face was regular; it was entered by leave of this court, and hence became the solemn judgment of this court, and its effect was to bind all of the real estate owned by the defendants at the time of its entry. Hence it followed that it was a lien upon the premises in controversy in this case, and the sale by virtue of the fi. fa. issued upon this judgment passed to the purchaser a good title to the premises in controversy; at least a good title as against the defendants in the judgment, or any person claiming title under the defendants.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">[The present plaintiff, Rosalia A. Ross, purchased the premises in controversy December 9, 1896, from Eleanor B. Ross, and against whom the original judgment was entered, and against whom the judgment of May 20, 1895, stood, unimpeached, upon these records. She therefore purchased those premises with notice that Dyer Loomis held a judgment which was a lien upon the premises which she so purchased, for the amount of the judgment, namely, $731.74, and she having notice of the entry of this judgment cannot now, in this action, void the effect of the judgment by setting up this irregularity.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">There is no dispute as to the facts in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-7\">.

Ross for the sum of $731.74. The title to the land which is here in dispute, was then in her, and the judgment therefore became a lien against the land. On December 9,1896, Eleanor B. Ross conveyed the property, for a nominal consideration, to Rosalia A. Ross, the plaintiff in this case. She took it with notice of the judgment. Shortly afterwards, oil December 21,1896, Eleanor B. Ross made an application to have the judgment which had been entered against her on May 20,1895, opened and stricken off. A rule to show cause was granted, and depositions were taken, and after hearing the rule was discharged. No appeal was taken. Execution was issued under which the land was sold, and deed delivered to the purchaser by the sheriff. By subsequent conveyance, the title became vested in the defendant, Edwin C. Dewey. In the present action of ejectment, Rosalia A. Ross, who was not a party to the original action, has attempted to question collaterally, the validity of the judgment against her grantor; she has no standing to attack the judgment in this way. There is no question as to the jurisdiction of the court over the parties, and the subject-matter, nor as to its right to adjudicate the particular matter which was decided. The judgment is admitted to have been irregular in its entry, but it cannot upon that account be attacked in a collateral pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>c\u00e9eding. Nor can <em>the title acquired under </em>a sale upon a judgment which, is merely erroneous be impeached collaterally. There is no suggestion of collusion between the parties in the entry of the judgment, and the whole course of procedure shows that it was adverse, and that the validity of the judgment was vigorously attacked, and strongly contested in the common pleas court. Presumably the result of the litigation was accepted as final by the defendant in the judgment. At least no appeal from- the refusal to open the judgment was taken by her, and when the time for taking the appeal passed, the question of the validity of the judgment became res adjud\u00edcala.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The trial ]udge was entirely right in giving to the jury binding instructions in favor of the defendant. No other course was properly open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
