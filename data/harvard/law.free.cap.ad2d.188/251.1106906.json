Appellant is entitled to a new trial because several jurors were called to sidebar for examination during voir dire, with counsel present, but in appellant\u2019s absence. Some jurors were excused after the sidebar conferences, but others were impanelled. Prospective jurors were questioned about the prevalence of drug traffic in their neighborhoods and how they felt about it. This questioning went beyond the general, administrative pre-voir dire screening approved in <em>People v Velasco </em>(77 NY2d 469). Here, the questioning involved the attitudes of prospective jurors to drugs, and directly related to their impartiality in a drug case. Appellant had a right to be present to assess the expressions and attitudes of prospective jurors on these relevant issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In a recent decision, <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247, 250), the Court of Appeals reaffirmed the principle that a juror can be questioned without the presence of the defendant if the questioning relates only to basic qualifications \"such as physical impairments, family obligations and work commitments\u201d. In language dispositive of this appeal, the Court described the limits beyond which a court may examine prospective jurors without the defendant being entitled to be present as follows: \"The court may not, however, explore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>prospective jurors\u2019 backgrounds and their ability to weigh the evidence objectively unless defendant is present. Defendants are entitled to hear questions intended to search out a prospective juror\u2019s bias, hostility or predisposition to believe or discredit the testimony of potential witnesses and the venire person\u2019s answers so that they have the opportunity to assess the juror\u2019s 'facial expression, demeanor and other subliminal responses\u2019.\u201d <em>(Supra, </em>at 250, quoting <em>People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d 386, 392.)
