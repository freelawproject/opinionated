Blake, in -the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and removed, by the defendant, by certiorari, into the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, on the ground that the suit was brought against him on account of acts done by him under the revenue laws of the United States, and as collector of internal revenue for the second .collection district of the State of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-7\">The complaint in the suit, which- was put in in the state court, contained six paragraphs, setting forth (1) the status of the plaintiff; (2) the status of the defendant, and an allegation that the banking house of the plaintiff ivas situated, and its business was carried on, in said second collection district; (3) that, on- December 24, 1881, the plaintiff received from the defendant a notice stating that the tax assessed against it, from July 1, 1864, to May 31, 1881, amounting to $121,215.34, was due and payable on or before the last day of December, 1881, and that, unless it was paid' by that time, it wTould become his duty to collect it, with a penalty of five.per cent additional, and interest at one per cent per month, the tax being one upon deposits; (4) that the plaintiff, apprehending .that if it did not pay the tax on or before December 31, 1881, the defendant would levy upon its property to satisfy the tax, paid to him on that day the sum of $113,085.62, being the amount of the tax without including any penalty, but that, before paying such amount, the plaintiff delivered -to the defendant a written protest against the payment of the tax on deposits during the period from July 1, 1864, to November 30, 1879, because- a portion of that tax was assessed upon moneys transmitted to the plaintiff by the treasurer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>State of New York, for the payment of debts of the State, and which were not \u201cdeposits,\u201d within the meaning of the statute of the United States, and because the remainder of such tax was assessed upon moneys deposited with the plaintiff by the United States Trust Company of New York, on which the latter company had already paid to the United States a tax as upon deposits, but that the defendant, notwithstanding such protest, insisted upon the payment of the tax and required the plaintiff to pay it; (5) that said tax was in part unlawfully assessed against the plaintiff, and it was not legally liable to pay the same, for the reason that $31,021.25 of said tax Tras assessed against it on account of moneys transmitted to it by the treasurer of the State of New York, and received by the plaintiff as the agent of the State, to be applied by the plaintiff to the payment of the debts of the State, and the moneys were not \u201c deposits,\u201d within the meaning of the revenue laws of th\u00e9 United States, and for the further reason that $61,518.73 of said tax was assessed against the plaintiff on account of moneys received by it from the United States Trust Company of New York, upon which the latter company paid to the United States a tax as deposits; and (6) that, before the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff appealed to the Commissioner of Internal Eevenue of the United States, and claimed that $95,539.98 of said tax was erroneously assessed and paid, for the reasons before mentioned, and that the plaintiff was entitled to have that sum refunded, and that said commissioner rejected said appeal and claim, for the reason, as stated by him; that the amount was legally assessed and collected.

That plaintiff has for more than forty years' maintained a transfer office within its banking house in 40 \"Wall street, in New York, as provided by a contract made by the commissioners of the canal fund and the canal board with the Manhattan Company and pursuant to an act passed by the legislature of the State of New York authorizing such contract, passed May 13, 1840. (See Session Laws of 1840, p. 229.) Said agreement or contract is contained in document 5 of Assembly Reports of the State of New York for the year 1841, and said act and said contract as contained in said volumes may be referred to by either party herein and are admitted to be in evidence for the purpose of- this action. It has also, during the period above mentioned and long prior thereto, acted as a depositary of moneys of the State of New York committed to its keeping by the treasurer of the State of New York under the authority vested in that officer by the statute of this State. Title 4, c. 8, part 1, of the Revised Statutes, (1 Edmonds, 177,) Exhibit B, <em>post, </em>and any and all acts in reference to the relations of the plaintiff to the State as a depositary of moneys of the State may be referred to by either party herein and are admitted to be evidence for all the purposes of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">\u201c Third.

That the tax assessed against the plaintiff, as stated in the third article of the complaint herein, was assessed upon deposits in plaintiff\u2019s bank, which included the amounts so received by the plaintiff from the treasurer of the State of New York to satisfy the interest or principal .of said stocks; that'the tax upon the amounts so received from the treasurer of the State of New York by the plaintiff was the sum of $31,021.25; that the course of business between the plaintiff and the treasurer of the State of New York in reference to the money so transmitted bj^ him, for -the purpose aforesaid, to the plaintiff was as follows: The interest upon said canal loan and volunteer bounty loan and the principal thereof falls due upon the first day of certain specified months. At some time during the week preceding the first day of the month when such principal or interest would fall due, the treasurer of the State would remit by mail to plaintiff drafts drawn by various country banks upon their respective correspondents in the city of New York to an amount equal to the payments to be made on the first of the ensuing month, the receipt of which drafts would be acknowledged by mail in a letter addressed bjr the plaintiff to the treasurer.

These drafts were collected by the plaintiff through the New York clearing house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and their proceeds mixed with the general deposits of the plaintiff. Plaintiff had on hand at the close of each day\u2019s business sufficient deposits to meet all claims of the State. Upon the receipt by the treasurer of the State of a notification from plaintiff that such drafts had been received by it the treasurer has drawn drafts upon the plaintiff to the order of the cashier of the plaintiff, enclosed and mailed in a letter addressed to the plaintiff, in which was indicated the purpose to which the funds were to be applied. The draft relating to canal loan, upon its reqeipt by plaintiff, was charged against the account entitled \u2018Treasurer of the State of New York, account of canal fund,\u2019 and credited to a new account called \u2018Interest New York State stocks, canal loan, July 2, 1881.\u2019 The draft relating to bounty loans was in like manner charged against the account entitled \u2018Treasurer of the State of New York,\u2019 and credited to a new account entitled \u2018 Interest loan for payment of bounties to volunteers due January 1, 1877.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\">\u201c The mode in which the money was actually paid out by plaintiff was as follows: The book containing the names of the parties entitled to be paid with receipts for them to sign was placed in the hands of the transfer clerk of the plaintiff \u25a0 at its- banking house, and to him the parties were directed in the first instance to apply.

The contract, under the provisions of which the money in question was sent by the state treasurer to the bank, and tk\u00e9 manner in which the money was credited and disbursed .by the bank, show plainly that the ordinary relation of banker and depositor never arose, and that Congress could never have contemplated the. inclusion of. such moneys for purposes of taxation under the' general title of <em>\u201c </em>deposits \u201d as used in the act. On the contrary, it seems that the bank, as to the funds in-dispute,-was merely the salaried disbursing agent of. the State and a trustee for the State\u2019s creditors. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 </em>Bank, 6 Met.

In construing a statute,' it-is always permissible to consider the motives which actuated 'the' law makers and the object for which the act was passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">It seems quite inconceivable that Congress intended to charge with taxation such deposits as those in question, which were sent to the bank, not to remain indefinitely and to be loaned out at usury by the bank, for its own profit, but to be immediately paid out to certain specified creditors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>State. The authorities in this, as, indeed, in all courts, have held, from time immemorial, that the intent of the law makers must be looked for and followed in the construction of the statute, though it limit or even contradict the literal wording of the statute, and that if the language will admit of it, a construction must be given conformable to reason, justice Qand '\u2022the public convenience and welfare. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Blougher, </em>14 Pet. 178; <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>136 U.

A tax of one twenty-fourth of one per centum each month . upon the average amount of the deposits of money, subject to payment by check or draft, or represented by certificates of deposit or otherwise, whether- payable on demand or at some future day, with any person, bank, association, company or corporation, engaged in the business of banking.\u201d Although this ta,x on deposits in banks was repealed by the act of Congress ,of March 3, 1883, c.'121,.22 Stat. 488, yet the latter act expressly excepted \u201c such taxes as are now due and payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It was contended for the plaintiff (1) that the contract before set forth, made July 13, 1840, under the provisions of which the ,..pioney in question was sent by the treasurer of the State td the-plaintiff, and the manner in which that money was \u2022 credited and disbursed by ti^e plaintiff, show that the ordinary relation of banker and depositor never arose; that Congress did not contemplate the including of such money for purposes of taxation, under the general title of \u201cdeposits\u201d <em>S', </em>-used in \u00a7 3408; and that the bank, as to the funds in question, was-merely the salaried disbursing agent of-.the State and a trustee for the creditors of the State; (2) that the money paid by the plaintiff, which it now seeks to recover, was the proceeds of a tax collected by the agent of the United States and levied upon all the money in the hands of the plaintiff, including money of the State of New York, then in the possession of an agent of that State and held for immediate disbursement by that agent to the creditors of the State, such agent receiving a salary to effect such disbursement; that such tax was,, to that extent, a tax upon the revenues of the State in-the hands of its disbursing agent; and that such money could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>be included constitutionally in tbe term \u201c deposits,\u201d as used in the statute of tbe United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Tbe money in question was deposited with tbe plaintiff by the treasurer of tbe State of New York, to be afterward disbursed by tbe plaintiff, as agent of tbe State, for certain purposes designated in tbe statute of the State and in tbe contract of July 13, 1840. The money, when so deposited, became tbe property of tbe plaintiff, and was credited by it to tbe treasurer of tbe State in account, and was thereafter drawn for by drafts made by the treasurer of tbe State and sent to tbe plaintiff. If such money bad been lost or stolen while in tbe bands of tbe plaintiff, tbe plaintiff, and not tbe State, would have borne tbe loss. Tbe identical money received by tbe plaintiff from tbe treasurer of tbe State was not to be returned to tbe treasm\u2019er,- or paid to his drawee, or kept distinct from tbe other funds of tbe plaintiff. It was not only a deposit of money, but was subject to payment by check or draft, and was payable either on demand or at some future day, all within tbe terms of tbe 'taxing statute of tbe United States. That statute covered general deposits, and not special deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">There is no foundation for the contention on tbe part of tbe plaintiff that a trust was oreated in its bands in favor of each creditor of tbe State intended to be paid through tbe plaintiff, as a consequence resulting from each deposit of money made by the treasurer' of tbe State with tbe plaintiff. Tbe money so deposited was not placed, by the mere fact of tbe deposit, irrevocably beyond tbe control of tbe State. Neither the money credited to tbe account called \u201cInterest New York State stocks, canal loan,\u201d nor that credited to tbe account entitled \u201c Interest loan for payment of bounties to volunteers,\u201d became, by such respective credits, the property of tbe holders of the securities for tbe respective loans, so as to create a title in them to tbe money as interest money. ' If the money bad been withdrawn by tbe State from tbe plaintiff, tbe latter could not have been liable therefor to tbe creditors bolding such securities. ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">By tbe contract of July 13, 1840, tbe plaintiff agreed to act as agent of tbe State in paying out from tbe deposits made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>with it by the State sums of money in favor of the holders of the obligations of the State, to pay such holders the interest on such obligations. The plaintiff occupied two relations to the State, one that of debtor \u00e1s a bank for the money deposited with it by the State, and the other. that of agent of the State to pay out from the money deposited, if it remained on deposit, money for certain specified purposes. The tax was assessed on deposits of money \u201c subject to payment by check or draft, or represented by certificates of deposit or otherwise, whether payable on demand or at some future day'\u201d'; and the clear purpose of the statute was to tax deposits of money in the situation \u25a0 of those in question. There is nothing in the contract of July .1.3, 1840, to relieve the plaintiff from its liability as a bank for the money deposited with it by the State. The plaintiff did not hold the money as an agent of the State, but was such agent only to disburse the money. The theory that the plaintiff was a trustee of the money deposited, for certain <em>cestuis que trust, </em>on the ground that the right to the money had become vested, by the mere fact of the deposit, in the creditors of the State, would make it necessary that it should be impossible for the State to withdraw the deposit, which was not the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>We </em>see nothing to affect these views in the cases cited by the plaintiff, of <em>Mechanics' Bank </em>v. <em>Merchants' Bank, </em>6 Met. (Mass.) 13; <em>Sharpless </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>4 Dall. 279; <em>Van Alen </em>v. <em>American Bank, </em>52 N. Y. 1; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Funk, </em>75 N. Y. 134; <em>Locomotive Works </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>88 N. Y. 234; <em>People </em>v. <em>City Bank, </em>96 N. Y. 32; <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>104 U. S. 54; <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>104 U. S. 303; <em>Pennell </em>v. <em>Deffell, </em>4 De G., M. <em>&amp; G. </em>372; <em>Frith v. Cartland, </em>2 Hem. &amp; Mill. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">It is distinctly provided, by \u00a7 8 of Title 4, chapter 8, part 1, of the Ee vised Statutes of New York, that \u201call moneys directed by law to be deposited in the Manhattan bank, in the city of New York, to the credit of the treasurer, shall remain in said bank, subject to be drawn for as the same may be required.\u201d This shows clearly that the money put into the plaintiff\u2019s bank by the State is \u201c deposited\u201d there, and is to lie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>there,' to the credit of the treasurer of the State, and may be drawn at &lt;my time when required by the State. Section 9 also shows that the money so deposited is considered by the State as \u201c deposits.\u201d It thus becomes \u201c deposits of .money, subject to payment by check or draft,\u201d within the meaning of the statute of the United States imposing the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\\ Nor dq we perceive any soundness in the view that the. money on which the tax in question was assessed was a part of'the revenue of the State in the hands of its agent for immediate disbursement, and so not liable for the tax.. \u00a5e cannot regard the money in question as the money of the State in the hands' of its agent. After it was deposited with the plaintiff it was the money of the plaintiff, and no tax was put upon the \u2022plaintiff as respected its function as agent of the State. It might as well be said that a tax upon the business of the plaintiff would have been invalid because such business embraced transactions with the State. Even regarding the tax as a tax upon the plaintiff as a bank, it was not a tax upon it as agent of the State, but as a bank receiving deposits. \u2022 The account of the State was not charged by the plaintiff, with the amount of the tax, nor was that amount deducted from the deposits made by the treasurer of the State with the plaintiff. So the tax did not fall upon the State in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The contention is, however, that if the tax was not on the function of the plaintiff as agent of the State, it was on the revenue of the State. It might as well be contended that a federal tax assessed on, and collected from, the money of a citizen of New York, who was in arrears.to the State in respect of his taxes, was laid on the.revenues of the State, and, therefore, illegal. The cases cited by the plaintiff in this connection, of <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>City of Charleston, </em>2 Pet. 449; <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Erie County, </em>16 Pet. 435; <em>Veazie Bank </em>v. <em>Fenno, </em>8 Wall. 533; <em>Collector </em>v. <em>Day, </em>11 Wall. 113; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Railroad Company, </em>17 Wall. 322; <em>Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New York </em>City, 2 Black, 620; <em>National. Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em>101 U. S. 1; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Taxes, </em>90 N. Y. 63, have no application to the case in hand. The plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the present case was not required to withhold, and did not withhold from the State anything that would otherwise be due to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
