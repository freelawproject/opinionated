Your petitioners further aver that said judgment and the said order of commitment, and the said detention of petitioner Schneider by the said warden, pursuant thereto, was, and each of them is, unlawful and void, and that your petitioner is now restrained of his liberty under or by color of the authority of the United .States, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, in this, that the right of petitioner, secured and guaranteed him by the Constitution of the United States, to a trial by an impartial jury was denied him, as will more fully appear by reference.to the record of said case, and all the proceedings in said trial, and of the hearing before the said general term, as announced by Mr. Justice Cox, all of which are filed herewith and prayed to be taken and read as a part of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\"><em>i. </em>Your petitioners further say that, among other reasons why said petitioner Schneider is unlawfully detained, in'Yiolation of his rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States, are the following, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">(\u0430) That the said petitioner Schneider, by the proceedings of said court (as will more fully and at large appear by reference to said record), was deprived of his constitutional right to be tried by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">(\u0431) That by the laws of the District of Columbia, under and pursuant to which the said proceedings were had, your petitioner Schneider was entitled to have twenty peremptory challenges, to be exercised at his will and according to his own discretion in respect to persons who were legally competent to sit as jurors in said case, of which right he was deprived, as in said record more fully appears, and to which reference is hereby made.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">(c) That during the course of the selection of the jury in said case the following named jurors, who had been summoned as such and examined on their <em>voir dire </em>were severally challenged for cause by your petitioner [here follow the names] each one of which said several challenges for cause was by the court overruled, and exception noted by the petitioner to tlie action of the court in holding said several so challenged for cause to be competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">(d) That said petitioner exercised each one of the said twenty peremptory challenges allowed him by law, and, when he had so exhausted his twenty peremptory challenges, there still remained on the jury two jurors, as to each of whom your said petitioner had been by the court overruled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and said jurors, over the objection of the petitioner, were held to be com petent, and sat in the trial of the said case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">(&lt;\u2022) That among other of the jurors so challenged for cause by petitioner, and by the court held to be competent against the objection of petitioner, was one Charles W.
