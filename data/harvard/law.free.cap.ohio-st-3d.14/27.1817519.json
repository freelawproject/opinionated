In this case, thirty days from sentencing had elapsed prior to the trial court\u2019s ruling on relator\u2019s motion for new trial. Relator\u2019s responsibilities to the defendant had not ended prior to the court\u2019s ruling, and it would be unreasonable to foreclose relator from filing an application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>for fees, including services rendered subsequent to the thirty-day period; therefore, Local Rule 17.06 is deemed invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Further, the language of R.C. 120.33(D) relates the ninety-day time limit for requests for reimbursement to the time of final disposal of the court case. In this case the ninety-day period did not begin until after December 31, 1982. Thus, the county was not patently foreclosed from seeking reimbursement at the time relator\u2019s application for fees was filed on March 9, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">For reason of the foregoing, the writ is allowed and respondent is ordered to approve the fee application submitted by relator, subject to the exercise of his sound discretion as to the reasonableness and appropriateness of such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
