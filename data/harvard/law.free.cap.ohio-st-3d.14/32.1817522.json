Subdivision (A)(6) thereof permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a person as to a cause of action arising from that person\u2019s \u201c[c]ausing tortious injury in this state to any person by an act outside this state committed with the purpose of injuring persons, when he might reasonably have expected that some person would be injured thereby in this state.\u201d Alternatively, appellants contend that any alleged lack of personal jurisdiction was not patent and unambiguous so as to support issuance of a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Appellants\u2019 application of R.C. 2307.382(A)(6) is founded on the alleged tortious failure of appellee to support his illegitimate child. Appellants seek to have this court adopt the reasoning in <em>Poindexter </em>v. <em>Willis </em>(1967), 87 Ill. App. 2d 213, 231 N.E. 2d 1, which judgment was given full faith and credit in <em>Poindexter </em>v. <em>Willis </em>(1970), 23 Ohio Misc. 199 [51 O.O.2d 157]. Appellants note that other jurisdictions have reached comparable holdings which in essence state that failure to support an illegitimate child constitutes a tortious act, and under statutes similar to Ohio\u2019s, have extended personal jurisdiction to nonresident defendants if the Due Process Clause has been otherwise satisfied. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Tuffnell </em>(Fla. App. 1982), 418 So. 2d 422; <em>Black </em>v. <em>Rasile </em>(1980), 113 Mich. App. 601, 318 N.W. 2d 475; and <em>State, ex rel. Nelson, </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1974), 298 Minn. 438, 216 N.W. 2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">We reject the reasoning and holding of the Illinois court in <em>Poindexter, supra. </em>The underlying action herein seeks a determination of paternity, and,.-without a determination favorable to the child\u2019s mother who, as an Ohio and Cuyahoga County resident, brought such action, there can be no support order against the alleged father and hence no \u201c* * * tortious injury in this state to any person by an act outside this state * * as required by R.C. 2307.382(B). Thus tortious injury, <em>i.e., </em>failure to support, is ancillary to the determination of a duty of support by reason of paternity. See <em>Lightell </em>v. <em>Lightell </em>(Ala. Civ. App. 1981), 394 So. 2d 41; <em>State, ex rel. Larimore, </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1980), 206 Neb. 64, 291 N.W. 2d 241; <em>Beaudoin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Anderson </em>(1981), 109 Misc. 2d 753, 441 N.Y.Supp. 2d 37. Our determination herein also negates appellants\u2019 contention that want of personal jurisdiction is not patent and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In addition to our unwillingness to apply \u201ctortious injury\u201d -under R.C. 2307.382(A)(6) to a non-resident putative father for the purpose of extending long-arm personal jurisdiction, we find that the requirements of due process <em>are </em>pertinent and significant herein. In <em>Poindexter, </em>it was alleged, and the facts revealed, that conception of the subject child took place in Illinois (the state in which jurisdiction was sought). Here, appellee\u2019s allegation of birth and conception of the subject child in a state other than Ohio is conceded by the child\u2019s mother who brought the paternity action. Under R.C. 3111.06(B), sexual intercourse in this state expressly constitutes a submission to jurisdiction. That fact, as an activity attuned to satisfy due process requirements, is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In <em>Kulko </em>v. <em>Superior Court of California </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 84, 92, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201can essential criterion in all cases is whether the \u2018quality and nature\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s activity is such that it is \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018fair\u2019 to require him to conduct his defense in that State.\u201d We hold that it is not reasonable and fair for appellee to conduct his defense in this state under the circumstances herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">For reason of the foregoing the judgment of the court of appeals allowing the writ of prohibition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
