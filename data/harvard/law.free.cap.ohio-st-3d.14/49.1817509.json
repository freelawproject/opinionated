See, <em>e.g., Grossman </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 189, 190 [34 O.O.2d 347]. Specifically, Ohio Bell contends that the complainant\u2019s burden of proof cannot be met unless it is established by expert testimony that Ohio Bell\u2019s equipment or facilities were functioning improperly. There is no support for this contention. \u201cInadequate service\u201d is not defined in R.C. Title 49, that determination being left to the commission and dependent upon the facts of each case. Moreover, the commission is not bound by strict rules of evidence in its proceedings. <em>Greater Cleveland Welfare Rights Org., Inc. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St. 3d 62, 68. Here, it was uncontested that the complainant experienced continued service problems over a period of several years. The inadequacies were reported and service calls were made but the problems were not remedied. Moreover, complainant was never advised that the design or extent of his equipment or the way in which it was used by his employees could be contributing to his service problems until February 1981. Upon a review of all of the facts and circumstances in this case there appears to be sufficient evidence in the record upon which the commission could conclude that Ohio Bell provided inadequate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">It is well-settled that \u201c[u]nder the \u2018unlawful or unreasonable\u2019 standard specified in R.C. 4903.13, this court will not reverse or modify an opinion and order of the Public Utilities Commission where the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show that the commission\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>is not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and is not so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake or willful disregard of duty.\u201d <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 103, 104 [12 O.O.3d 112]. See, also, <em>Consumers\u2019Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 108, 110 [12 O.O.3d 115]; <em>Ohio Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 153, 164 [12 O.O.3d 167]; <em>Duff v. Pub. Util.
