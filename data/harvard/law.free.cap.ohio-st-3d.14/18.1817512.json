This court has reviewed the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>presented to the board and concludes that the board\u2019s finding that respondent lacked the authority to endorse Stewart\u2019s check is supported by the record. Consequently, we are not inclined to disturb the board\u2019s finding in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">As to the remaining charges, respondent admits that his conduct ran afoul of DR 9-102(A) and DR 9-102(B)(3). Furthermore, based on the findings of the board and the facts stipulated by respondent, we concur in the board\u2019s finding that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(6) as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Respondent suggests that a one-year suspension would be unduly harsh. In our view, a one-year suspension is entirely appropriate in view of the circumstances surrounding respondent\u2019s misconduct. As we stated in <em>Disciplinary Counsel </em>v. <em>Morton </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 206, 208:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u201c* * * There are few ethical breaches which impact more negatively on the integrity of the legal profession than the misuse of a client\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">* * <em>\u00a1tiff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">This is true whether the attorney\u2019s actions are due to dishonesty or, as was the case herein, ignorance and ineptitude. The facts of this case demonstrate that respondent commingled funds of his clients with his personal funds, failed to promptly notify a client of the receipt of funds, failed to keep virtually any records of client funds, and failed to promptly pay funds to a client. All of the above clearly adversely reflects on respondent\u2019s fitness to practice law. As a result, we agree with the board and relator that respondent\u2019s professional misconduct warrants a one-year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Accordingly, the findings of the board are adopted, and respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\n<em>\u25a0Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
