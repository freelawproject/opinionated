R. 601 and 804(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">In pertinent part, R.C. 2317.03 states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">\u201cA party shall not testify when the adverse party is the guardian or trustee of either a deaf and dumb or an insane person or of a child of a deceased person, or is an executor or administrator, or claims or defends as heir, grantee, assignee, devisee, or legatee of a deceased person * * *r i&gt;&gt;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Evid. R. 601 provides that \u201c[e]very person is competent to be a witness\u201d with certain limited exceptions which are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Historically at common law, in England and in the United States, parties to a lawsuit and all other persons having a direct pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the action were excluded from testifying in the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A party could not testify in his own behalf nor could he be required to testify if called by his adversary. The rule was thus a combination of disqualification and privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The theory advanced for disqualifying a litigant from testifying in his own behalf was that such person would likely perjure himself in support of his cause, and therefore, he should be prevented from giving testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">It appears that a great deal of argument against the disqualification rule ensued based on the premise that the rule underestimated the ability of judges and jurors to detect perjury, and that such rule created more injustice than it prevented. The rule disqualifying interested persons was eliminated in England by an Act of Parliament in 1943. Subsequently in 1951, a law was enacted which abolished the disqualification of parties, and those on whose behalf a suit was brought.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In the United States, the movement for reform or abolishment of the common-law rule of disqualification was strengthened by the British Acts. However, only compromise laws were generally effected throughout the states enacting such evidentiary rule changes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, statutes in most states which enacted reform legislation provided that the disqualification still remained as to testimony of parties and interested persons concerning a transaction or communication with a person since deceased in a suit prosecuted or defended by the executor or administrator of the decedent. There were many variations to be found within the state statutes which eliminated the disqualifications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, there was a marked variance to be found among state courts in construing their statutes as to what would be considered disqualified testimony under the specific Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In Ohio, the disqualifying statute was enacted in broad form as noted in the following language: \u201cA party shall not testify when the adverse party is * * * an executor or administrator, or claims or defends as heir, grantee, assignee, devisee, or legatee of a deceased person * * Thus, the Ohio provision extended the protection to anyone who derived his title or sustained damages from an act by, through, or under the decedent. Such persons included not only executors and administrators but heirs, next of kin, legatees, devisees and assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The Ohio statute has been held applicable to civil suits or proceedings, contract actions, as well as tort actions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, there are a number of exceptions to the application of the section including the specific exclusions that it does not apply to actions for causing death, or proceedings involving the invalidity of a deed or codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In 1980, this court through its authority under Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, adopted the Rules of Evidence, which were subsequently submitted to the General Assembly. No concurrent resolution having been adopted by the General Assembly, the rules became effective on July 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">As previously set forth, Evid. R. 601 and R.C. 2317.03 deal with competency of witnesses. In addition, the aforestated constitutional amendment provides that \u201c* * * [a]ll laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u201d This court has stated that rules of witness competency are procedural and do not create, modify, or abridge substantive rights. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Waller </em>(1976), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>47 Ohio St. 2d 52 [1 O.O.3d 32]. See, also, Ladd, Uniform Evidence Rules in the Federal Courts (1963), 49 Va. L. Rev. 692; Moore &amp; Bendix, Congress, Evidence and Rulemaking (1974), 84 Yale L.J. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Therefore, we hold that the adoption of Evid. R. 601 in 1980 effectively abrogated R.C. 2317.03 which was in conflict with the evidentiary rule. The effect of adopting this particular rule of law is best determined by reference to the Staff Note to Evid. R. 601.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The Staff Note sets forth a most significant point in support of the position that the rule abrogated R.C. 2317.03. The note states that concomitant to the adoption of Evid. R. 60l was the adoption of Evid. R. 804(B)(5).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The latter rule permits the introduction of hearsay statements made by a deceased person to third persons which tend to rebut the testimony of an adverse party that is admissible under Evid. R. 601. It is our conclusion that a lawful application of Evid. R. 601 and 804(B)(5) creates an evidentiary balance resulting in a fair and just approach toward the judicial effort to determine truth. Evid. R. 601 preserves one\u2019s competency to testify, while Evid. R. 804(B)(5) affords the adverse party an opportunity to introduce evidence which would otherwise be considered hearsay, to rebut such testimony. It is also, significant that two appellate courts have adopted the view that the \u201cdead man\u2019s\u201d statute, R.C. 2317.03, has been abrogated by Evid. R. 601. See <em>Simandl, supra; Bilikam </em>v. <em>Bilikam </em>(1982), 2 Ohio App. 3d 300. See, also, Blackmore &amp; Weissenberger, Ander<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>son\u2019s Ohio Evidence, Civil &amp; Criminal (1982 Ed.), Section 601.2; Giannelli, Ohio Evidence Manual (1982 Ed.), Section 601.10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">As previously stated, there are additional safeguards available to the practicing attorney who represents a decedent\u2019s estate against fraudulent claims. The most effective, of course, is that of appropriate cross-examination. This was ably pointed out by Justice Corliss of the North Dakota Supreme Court in the case of <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Lofland </em>(1895), 5 N.D. 140, 143, 64 N.W. 930:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u201c* * * [TJhose against whom a dishonest demand is made are not left utterly unprotected because death has sealed the lips of the only person who can contradict the survivor, who supports his claim with his oath. In the legal armory, there is a weapon whose repeated thrusts he will find it difficult, and in many cases impossible, to parry if his testimony is a tissue of falsehoods, \u2014 the sword of cross examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">It is our opinion that allowing the introduction of what would otherwise be considered hearsay evidence, pursuant to Evid. R. 804(B)(5), and the full opportunity afforded to the representative of an' estate to cross-examine all witnesses, pointedly counter the argument that to render competent the testimony of such witnesses opens the courthouse door to those who would perjure themselves and perpetrate a fraud upon the court. We believe it is much more reasonable to unseal the lips of those persons who would present a claim, as well as the lips of the deceased against whom such claim is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Furthermore, the statute which closed the mouths of honest and dishonest claimants alike results in more harm than good by effectively denying a \u201cday in court\u201d to those who would present honest claims. The statute also provides the unjust result of denying the presentation of valid claims by a representative of the decedent\u2019s estate. These \u201cdead man\u2019s\u201d statutes impede the court\u2019s search for the truth. It is entirely unreasonable that juries should be confused by being deprived of a substantial portion of the pertinent evidence bearing upon the issues in dispute. Based on the foregoing, we hold that with the adoption of Evid. R. 601 and the procedural safeguards within Evid. R. 804(B)(5), R.C. 2317.03 is no longer viable in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b89-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

R. 601 which declares all witnesses competent in federal matters, except as otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Evidence, and also declares that in state matters, the competency of witnesses is to be determined by state law. Rule 601 states the general rule of witness competency for Ohio. In so doing, the rule embodies certain prior Ohio practices and discards others.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u201cOne of the purposes of Federal Evid. R. 601 was to preserve statutes such as the dead man\u2019s statute in state matters in those states where such a statute existed. Ohio has chosen to eliminate the exclusion. Rule 601 supersedes R.C. 2317.03, the dead man\u2019s statute. By declaring all witnesses to be competent and not providing an exception for the exclusionary provisions of the dead man\u2019s statute, a conflict between the rule and the statute is created and the statute is superseded under constitutional provision.
