We are asked to consider whether allowing this child to remain indefinitely in the custody of the third party, without terminating the parental rights of the father or of the mother, constitutes a proper exercise of judicial discretion when evidence was presented at the termination of parental rights hearing that neither parent possesses the ability to ever safely care for the child. In reviewing this issue, we continue to follow this Court's precedent of more than a decade and affirm that the pursuit of the best interest of the child remains the overarching goal when considering the termination of parental rights (\"TPR\") pursuant to \u00a7 5-323 of the Family Law Article (hereinafter \"FL\") of the Maryland Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court first completed a comprehensive review of TPR proceedings in 2007, in\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/477/\">\n    402 Md. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490,5569324\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/177/\">\n    937 A.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).

Sufficient permanency for the child is not achieved when the child remains indefinitely in the guardianship and custody of a relative. Furthermore, we hold the juvenile court abused its discretion when it failed to recognize an exceptional circumstance justifying the termination of the parents' parental rights. Finally, it was an error of law for the juvenile court to change a child in need of assistance (hereinafter \"CINA\") permanency plan during a termination of parental rights hearing conducted pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-323 without issuing two separate orders pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-324. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the juvenile court and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   C.E. (hereinafter \"C.E.\" or \"the child\") is a male child born in May 2014 to C.D. (hereinafter \"Mother\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and H.E. (hereinafter \"Father\"). C.E. was born two months premature and after birth was placed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of\n   Johns Hopkins Hospital. In time, he was transferred to the Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Immediately after C.E.'s birth, a Baltimore City Department of Social Services (hereinafter \"the Department\") caseworker, Nia Noakes, responded to a \"risk of harm\" report and a request for a safety assessment of a newborn by Johns Hopkins Hospital. As a part of the safety assessment, Ms. Noakes examined Mother's home with both parents present. Ms. Noakes also consulted the Department's records to determine whether the family had a history with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ms. Noakes discovered that the Department had removed Mother's other five children from her care over the past two decades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315464,12491358\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/456/209/\">\n    456 Md. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315464,12491358\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/456/209/\">\n    172 A.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

Concerned with Mother's previous interactions with the Department, Ms. Noakes determined that C.E. would not be safe in her care. The Department also learned that Father could not care for C.E. because Father resided in a senior housing complex that did not allow children to reside at the property except for a short-term duration of two weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Department filed for emergency shelter care on July 10, 2014, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (hereinafter \"juvenile court\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   while C.E. was still at Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital. In late June or early July 2014, Mother telephoned her cousin, Ms. B., and advised that she could not take C.E. home from the hospital and asked for permission to provide Ms. B.'s contact information to Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital and the Department. Mother and Ms. B. had not been in contact for years prior to C.E.'s birth and had only reconnected when Mother found Ms. B. on Facebook. Ms. B. and her husband, Mr. B. consented. The Department reached out to Ms. B. and Mr. B. to conduct a background check and begin the placement process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a hearing in July 2014, the juvenile court granted the Department's request for temporary care and custody of C.E. By July 15, 2014, Mr. and Ms. B. had successfully completed the necessary department requirements. Upon C.E.'s hospital discharge on July 21, 2014, the Department placed C.E. with them where he has remained throughout his entire life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the summer of 2014, the Department facilitated the second FIM for both parents. Father entered into a service agreement with the Department that was in effect from July 11, 2014 to September 11, 2014, and committed to finding housing where he could reside with C.E. The Department also referred Father to the Center for Urban Families'\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   parenting classes which occurred twice a week for three months. Father initially did not attend the classes but he eventually completed the weekly ten-week course on positive parenting skills. Father was also referred to Hebron House\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   for anger management counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Department continued to provide other services to the parents to achieve reunification with C.E. The Department facilitated regular supervised visits between C.E., Mother, and Father. The visits were scheduled weekly during 2014 and bi-weekly from 2015 to 2017. Initially the visits occurred supervised at the Mother's home for three months. However, the Department decided to move the visits to Department facilities due to environmental concerns. The Department provided the supervision during the visitation period and both parents attended most of the scheduled visits. These visits were occasionally marked with C.E.'s angry outbursts towards his Mother. On other occasions, the visits were characterized as generally positive interactions with Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After multiple postponements, the juvenile court found C.E. to be a child in need of assistance on June 16, 2015 and awarded custody to the Department for continued placement with his relatives, Mr. and Ms. B. Additionally, the supervised visitation was continued and Father was ordered to submit to a clinical evaluation by Court Medical Services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother appealed\n   the juvenile court's findings to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.E.\n   </em>\n   , No. 0925, Sept.

Mother appealed. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the juvenile court's decision to waive reasonable efforts for reunification was not appealable and therefore dismissed the appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re C.E.\n   </em>\n   , No. 0464, Sept.

Following this Court's determination on waiver, the Department filed a Petition for Guardianship with the Right to Consent to Adoption or Long-Term Care Short of Adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The termination of parents rights hearing took place in 2017 on the following dates: March 20, March 21, April 27, May 2, June 27, and July 5. First, Ms. Noakes testified as a family services case worker with the Department. She testified to her interactions with both parents immediately after C.E. was born and while the Department was determining whether to petition for shelter care and guardianship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, Brenda Harriel, Coordinator of Medical Services for the Juvenile Section, testified as an expert witness in clinical and forensic social work, with specialties in diagnosis and treatment of individuals with DSM-V\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   mental health diagnosis\n   and parenting skills assessments. She evaluated Father in July of 2015. In reaching her conclusion, she relied on her meeting with Father, court documents, and the Department's family social history report. Father refused to consent to the release any of his medical records. She determined that Father\n   presented with schizotypal personality disorder which features \"cognitive or perceptual distortions ... odd beliefs, peculiar behaviors, inappropriate or constrictive affect, and reduced capacity for close relations.\" She recommended no treatment for his personality disorder. Ms. Harriel opined that Father would not be able to \"provide proper care in a consistent, protective, and nurturing way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. Harriel also testified to her evaluation of Mother in 2010. That evaluation was conducted during proceedings for one of Mother's other children, J.D. During that evaluation, Mother refused to answer questions, claiming her rights were being violated. From her behavior that day, Ms. Harriel observed symptoms of mania. However, Ms. Harriel conceded that she had not evaluated Mother since 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. and Ms. B. testified next. They explained that C.E. is epileptic and continues to receive medication for his epilepsy as prescribed by a neurologist. C.E. also exhibits delays in physical growth and has problems with communication, executive function, and attention deficit. He has been characterized as very active, impulsive, quick to frustration, and aggressive. They stated that at the time of the hearing, he was undergoing a formal diagnostic process at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center to determine whether he is on the autism spectrum. Ms. B. acknowledged C.E.'s challenges, but was satisfied with the progress he had made in their home. She testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   C[E.]'s a good boy ... He get up, and eat, and do what he do. He likes to be in his room. His room is like his little castle. He likes cartoons. He likes playing the cool stuff. He plays the guitar ... He likes to play. He likes to run and jump. [C.E.]'s [sic] very active.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When asked during each of their examinations whether they wished to adopt C.E., they both answered that they wished to adopt him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Laurie Higginbotham, the Clinical Social Worker Supervisor with the Department also testified and was accepted as an expert. Ms. Higginbotham was asked to observe a visit and to give some suggestions to Father and Mother to improve visitation with C.E. After observing Father with C.E. during several visits, Ms. Higginbotham opined that Father sometimes interacted appropriately with C.E. but that caring for C.E. consistently would likely be too stressful for Father. She noted that in her opinion, the Father would have difficulty sustaining enough energy for C.E. Overall, she concluded that C.E. requires focus and attention that Mother and Father cannot provide for their child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After Ms. Higginbotham, Ms. Mary Ann Ervin, a Supervisor for the Department, testified. Ms. Ervin was familiar with Mother due to Mother's previous interactions with the Department. Ms. Ervin explained some of the Department's efforts toward attempting reunification between the parents and C.E. Further, a variety of documents detailing the parents' interactions with the Department were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Nkeiruka Udom, the assigned caseworker testified. She was assigned to the case in 2017 after taking over for another caseworker. Ms. Udom testified to some of the visits she witnessed between C.E. and his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the conclusion of Ms. Udom's testimony, Mother was called as a witness. Prior to the start of the hearing, the juvenile court had granted Mother's request to have an accommodation and participate in the hearing through the telephone. For her testimony, the juvenile court required Mother to appear by video conference so that the parties and the juvenile court had\n   the benefit of her demeanor during the examination. Through video conference, Mother explained her visitations with C.E. and her interactions with the Department. She believes the Department \"took\" C.E. only because of her prior interactions with the Department. Mother also\n   testified that she maintains her own residence but spends a substantial amount of time with Father at his residence. She stated Father and Mother were looking to move to Delaware together. Mother also testified that she does not have a good relationship with Mr. and Ms. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As for her mental health, Mother stated, \"I don't have a mental illness, I have PTSD from legal abuse syndrome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother commented that she was testifying in this matter against her health. After Mother's first day of testimony, the Court characterized her responses during cross-examination as \"long,\" \"distorted,\" \"nonresponsive\" narratives to the questions asked. When cross-examination was to resume five days later, Mother did not appear. Within those five days, Mother had been hospitalized and discharged for anxiety and chest-pains. The juvenile court excused Mother from testifying that day and sought to reschedule Mother's testimony when her health permitted. Mother waived her appearance for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Father testified after Mother was excused. Father and Mother began their relationship in 2010 and remain together. Father was educated through the ninth grade and is employed full-time as a dishwasher. He receives Supplementary Security Income for a disability. C.E. is Father's second-born son. Father's first child, who is now an adult, entered the foster care system during minority and was raised by Father's sister. Father acknowledges he did not participate in the raising of his first son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Since C.E.'s birth and through the termination of parental rights hearing, Father has resided in senior citizen housing. His housing prohibits children from residing at the residence for longer than two weeks. When asked whether he planned to live with Mother if C.E. was returned to him, Father responded \"I would have to.\" He testified further that if C.E. was returned, he would exclusively rely on Mother to care for C.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   while he was at work. Father does not believe Mother has any mental illnesses and he is adamant that he will not separate C.E. from Mother. Father admitted past domestic violence with Mother, but testified that he had addressed that issue by attending classes at the Center for Urban Families. As Mother did during her direct examination, Father testified to his sincere desire to reunite with C.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The hearing resumed to permit C.E. to conduct cross-examination of Mother. Mother indicated she was not able to continue testifying and gave a narrative statement on the record without being sworn and without anyone's ability to cross-examine Mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to achieve a resolution\n   to the matter, C.E. waived his cross-examination of the Mother. The hearing concluded that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    The Juvenile Court's Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The juvenile court denied the Department's Petition for Guardianship with the Right to Consent to Adoption or Long-Term Care Short of Adoption. The Court found that there was clear and convincing evidence that Mother was unfit but that there was only a preponderance of the evidence that Father was unfit. Because it denied the petition for guardianship, the juvenile court did not terminate either Mother's or Father's parental rights. Specifically, the juvenile court wrote, in part, in its opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [T]he Court concludes that there is not clear and convincing evidence that it is in [C.E.'s] best interest to terminate his parents' parental rights; nor is there clear and convincing\n   evidence that it would be contrary to [C.E.'s] welfare to continue his parents' parental rights, diminished by a changed permanency plan of custody and guardianship to cousin [Ms. B.] and [Mr. B] without termination of parental rights. The Court finds in denying the TPR at this time and simultaneously changing [C.E.'s] permanency plan to [custody and guardianship] without termination of parental rights is in [C.E.'s] best interest and welfare.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The findings below show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no likelihood [of] reunification of [C.E.] with Mother and/or Father can be achieved in the foreseeable future, in eighteen months, or indeed, ever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   While adoption remains the gold standard of permanency where reunification is not safely possible, in this case the very strong commitment of [Mother]'s relatives, [ ][Mr. and Ms. B.], to his care, convince this Court that [C.E.] will have the benefit of stability and permanence with the plan adopted here in childhood and into his adulthood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Father's [sic] more likely than not unfitness to parent [C.E.] results from his lack of housing where [C.E.] can live in small part [ ]. Father's mental health evaluation [ ] opines a diagnosis of Schizotypal Personality Disorder. However, that diagnosis is not convincing in the fact of the consistently reported good parenting time/visitation Father has shared with [C.E.] Furthermore, the limited factual and analytical basis in this record for that diagnosis [ ] causes the Court to give little weight to the mental health assessment, on which [the Department] and [C.E.]'s counsel make no comment in argument. However, Father's [sic] found more than likely unfitness rests in great degree upon his admitted nearly total reliance on Mother to parent [C.E.] when he is unavailable during extensive working hours. While the provision of daycare to assist Mother is theoretically a safe plan for reunification, it is patently clear on this record that Mother's mental health would not allow her to accept this support necessary for [C.E.'s] safety in Mother's care. Repeatedly, Mother decomposes into stress induced\n   rage behaviors whenever a third party challenges the smallest aspect of her parenting conduct; [C.E.] can not and should not be subjected to this well established pattern of psychological abuse by Mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   While neither parent individually or together is able to care for [C.E.] the\n   Court is convinced that [C.E.] knows his parents and displays a sufficient connection with them-particularly with Father-to raise safety concerns for the termination of that relationship which has not been overcome by any clear and convincing evidence otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Both the unfitness found for [C.E.]'s parents (by clear and convincing evidence for Mother; merely a preponderance of the evidence for Father) and the exceptional circumstances found support the change of permanency plan to custody and guardianship without termination of parental rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [I]n the three years [C.E.'s] CINA case and more recently this TPR case have been pending, parents have achieved very little to prepare a safe placement for [C.E.] in their care.

Father is not shown by clear and convincing evidence to be an unfit parent on this record-but the Court does find it more likely than not Father is unable-unfit to parent [C.E.] Additionally, the Exceptional Circumstances of his lacking housing and Father's clear dependence on Mother for daycare while he is employed,\n   coupled with the additional Exceptional Circumstances found below, convince this Court that it is in C.E.'s best interest for the permanency plan to be changed to custody and guardianship to [Mr. and Ms. B.] without termination of parental rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Neither parent has contributed support for [C.E.'s] care and maintenance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Neither parent has displayed in visitation essential safe parenting skills-including but not limited to mirroring, patience, and affirmation-that are needed by [C.E.] particularly in response to his now presenting possible autism spectrum behaviors, seizure disorder, and speech development delays.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [Mr. and Ms. B.] provide [C.E.] safe stability in their care; in sharp contrast Mother's erratic, angry, raging behaviors and stress dysregulation, and Father's absence (employment schedule) would be a profoundly unstable emotional environment for [C.E.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on these findings, the juvenile court determined that it was in C.E.'s best interest to place C.E. in a guardianship with his extended family without terminating the parental rights of either parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   After noting timely appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, C.E. and the Department filed separate petitions for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on February 5, 2018. Together, C.E. and the Department collectively pose the following five questions before this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   1. Whether a CINA child has a protected interest in achieving a timely permanency plan of adoption that transcends his parents' right to raise him, where the three (3) year old child has resided in the same relatives' home since birth and where the trial court found, by clear and\n   convincing evidence, that reunification is \"unachievable ... in the foreseeable future\"?\n   2. Whether it is error of law for a court to change a CINA child's permanency plan in a [g]uardianship proceeding conducted pursuant to [FL] \u00a7 5-323 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   3. Whether the court's application of its findings of exceptional circumstances to justify custody and guardianship to relatives instead of using the exceptional circumstances to support a grant of guardianship, was an error of law in contravention of the statute's clear preference for adoption over custody and guardianship?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   4. Did the juvenile court err when it failed to find that Father was unfit to remain C.E.'s legal father in light of its finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that there was no likelihood that Father would ever be able to safely care for C.E.?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   5. Did the juvenile court err as a matter of law in its exceptional circumstances analysis, by elevating an incidental \"parental\" relationship over C.E.'s best interests in achieving the permanence afforded by adoption?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This Court heard oral argument on June 1, 2018 and an opinion was issued on August 13, 2018. Our opinion affirmed the juvenile court's findings as to Father, but reversed the juvenile court's findings as to the Mother, concluding \"it was error for the juvenile court to deny termination of Mother's parental rights.\" On August 24, 2018, the Department, C.E., and the Mother filed a Motion for Reconsideration pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-605. The Department and C.E. argued this Court could not order the termination of only one parent's parental rights. Mother also requested that this Court reconsider its Opinion and affirm the judgment of the juvenile court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a reply, the Father adopted and joined the Mother's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   By Order on December 3, 2018, this Court withdrew its opinion and ordered supplemental briefing and additional argument on a single issue: \"Whether the parental rights of both\n   parents must be terminated to grant guardianship under FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-323(b) and 5-325(a)(1), [or] whether the termination of the parental rights of only one parent is required.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of C.E.\n   </em>\n   , No. 77, Sept.

This Court heard oral argument on that supplemental issue on March 1, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After consideration of the issue on reargument, we recognize that our current statutory scheme requires the termination of both parent's parental rights. There are only three possible scenarios that may culminate in a guardianship pursuant to Title 5, Subtitle 3 of the Family Law Article: (1) both parents consent, (2) one parent consents, and the juvenile court terminates the parental rights of the other parent; or (3) neither parent consents, and the juvenile court terminates the rights of both parents. When neither party consents and where a local department of social services files a petition for guardianship, a juvenile court only has two options: (1) to either grant the petition and terminate both parents' rights; or (2) to deny the petition and refrain from terminating either parents' rights. The juvenile court's judgment is comprised only of the grant or the denial of the petition for guardianship. Where a\n   juvenile court denies a petition for guardianship, the juvenile court's judgment is wholly in the parents' favor-even if the juvenile court finds that one parent is unfit. Therefore, we erred in our now withdrawn opinion in which we terminated the Mother's parental rights and kept the Father's parental rights intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Upon reconsideration of all of the issues before us, and for the reasons stated below, we conclude that in order to achieve the best interest of C.E. and to provide sufficient permanency for him, it was an abuse of discretion for the juvenile court to decline to terminate Father's parental rights when the juvenile court determined that based on the factors present, Father was unable to ever safely care for C.E. Furthermore, while not necessary for a juvenile court to find if both parents are unfit, we also conclude that there was clear and convincing evidence of an exceptional circumstance that would warrant\n   the termination of father's parental rights in this matter. Finally, the juvenile court committed an error of law when it changed C.E.'s CINA permanency plan during the termination of parental rights hearing conducted pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-323 in a single order. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the juvenile court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Maryland appellate courts apply three different but interrelated standards of review\" when reviewing a juvenile court's decisions at the conclusion of a termination of parental rights proceeding.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of Cadence B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696792\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/146/#p155\">\n    417 Md. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696792\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/146/#p155\">\n    9 A.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(c) ] applies.

However, the existing statutory scheme is the appropriate mechanism for the evaluation of parental fitness or the kinds of exceptional circumstances that would suffice to rebut the presumption for continuing the parental relationship and justify the termination of that relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of Amber R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696757\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/701/\">\n    417 Md. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696757\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/701/\">\n    12 A.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2011) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of Ta'Niya C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/\">\n    417 Md. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696684\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/90/\">\n    8 A.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\"[T]he same factors that a court uses to determine whether termination of parental rights is in the child's best interest under the TPR statute equally serve to determine whether exceptional circumstances exist.\");\n   <em>\n    Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/477/\">\n    402 Md. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490,5569324\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/177/\">\n    937 A.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The four subparagraphs of FL \u00a7 5-323(d) are divided by topic and include consideration of: (1) the services that the Department has offered to assist in achieving reunification of the child with the parents; (2) the results of the parent's effort to adjust their behaviors so that the child can return home; (3) the existence and severity of aggravating circumstances; (4) the child's emotional ties, feelings, and adjustment to community and placement and the child's general well-being.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately,\n   these factors seek to assist the juvenile court in determining \"whether the parent is, or within a reasonable time will be, able to care for the child in a way that does not endanger the child's welfare.\"\n   <em>\n    Rashawn H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/477/\">\n    402 Md. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568490,5569324\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/177/\">\n    937 A.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the juvenile court never fully considered the exceptional circumstances prong as a separate legal conclusion from the unfitness prong. Rather, the juvenile court used the exceptional circumstances prong in conjunction with unfitness to examine specific circumstances such as the parental bond or the Father's relationship with Mother. This was erroneous because the exceptional circumstances prong is a separate legal conclusion. Thus, the prong requires a separate inquiry apart from unfitness. If a juvenile court deems a parent fit, then the juvenile court is required to examine whether any exceptional circumstances exist that would make a continuation of the parental relationship detrimental to the best interests of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In examining whether an exceptional circumstance exists, a juvenile court should look to whether there is a reason to terminate the parental relationship because the best interest of the child is not served through continuing the parental relationship. Here, the juvenile court utilized this statutory basis as a shield to protect against the termination of parental rights, not as a potential separate legal conclusion apart from unfitness. This was in error because, as we have previously stated, unfitness and exceptional circumstances are two separate inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In reviewing the remainder of the juvenile court's order, we are able to discern that the juvenile court found: (1) that the Department had made reasonable efforts to enable reunification; (2) that neither parent exhibits \"essential safe parenting skills;\" (3) that Father lacked housing in which C.E. could reside; (4) that, on the whole, neither parent had accomplished a material change to the circumstances rendering C.E. a CINA; (5) that C.E. has fully adjusted to his placement with Mr. and Ms. B.; (6) that neither parent had contributed\n   support for C.E.'s care and maintenance; and (7) that reunification with the natural parents is unachievable within the foreseeable future, if ever. It is also clear that the Court's sole factual finding that weighed in favor of continuation of Father's parental rights was a determination that C.E. knew and was attached to Father. In\n   sum, as we understand the juvenile court's order, almost every other factor delineated under FL \u00a7 5-323(d) was found against Father with the exception of the finding that there is an \"attachment\" between Father and C.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Department and C.E. assert that in declining to terminate Father's parental rights, the juvenile court failed to give appropriate consideration to the safety and welfare of C.E. Further, the juvenile court ignored one of the goals of subtitle three, permanency, and failed to afford appropriate weight to the question of \"whether the parent is, or within a reasonable time will be, able to care for the child in a way that does not endanger the child's welfare.\" The Department and C.E. argue that the juvenile court afforded too much credit to the relationship between C.E. and his father in lieu of giving proper credit to the other statutory factors. C.E. and the Department contend that the juvenile court properly found Mother unfit by clear and convincing evidence. Now, the Department and C.E. assert that there was ample evidence to find that Father was unfit or that exceptional circumstances existed by clear and convincing evidence to terminate his parental rights as well.

Additionally, while the father in\n   <em>\n    Alonza D.\n   </em>\n   was undoubtedly fit, the same cannot be said of C.E.'s Father. Father has failed to secure housing that is suitable for C.E. and there are numerous concerns about Father sustaining energy levels sufficient to care for C.E. The juvenile court should have found that a continued relationship with Father would be detrimental to C.E.'s health and welfare. All of the statutory factors deserve equal consideration when weighing unfitness. Father and C.E.'s relationship is only one factor to consider during the juvenile court's evaluation. Here, the juvenile court impermissibly elevated the parent-child relationship as a factor that surpasses all others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As with the parent-child relationship, we decline to elevate permanency above all other factors as the Department and C.E. requested.

In considering the appropriate permanent placement, juvenile courts are guided by the hierarchy of permanency plans codified in CJP \u00a7 3-823(e)(1) and FL \u00a7 5-525. Both statutes prioritize placement options in descending order: 1) reunification with the child's parent or guardian; 2) placement with a relative for adoption; 3) placement with a relative for custody and guardianship; 4) adoption by a nonrelative; and 5) custody and guardianship by a nonrelative. Here, the juvenile court ignored the order of priority as well as our line of cases holding that when reunification with the child's\n   parents cannot be achieved, adoption is the next best option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    No. 10941\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991887\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/99/#p106\">\n    335 Md. at 120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1991887\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/335/99/#p106\">\n    642 A.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Custody and guardianship does not afford C.E. with the same permanency as adoption with a relative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Caya B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957744\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/153/63/#p78\">\n    153 Md.

When the juvenile court combined the fitness and exceptional circumstances analysis, the juvenile court did not fully examine this important statutory prong.\n   In reviewing the exceptional circumstances basis, we are concerned with the continuing relationship between Father and Mother. Father testified that he refuses to sever his relationship with Mother, that he will continue to live with Mother, and that he will rely solely on her for providing childcare to C.E. while he is at work. Further, Father refuses to acknowledge Mother's mental health conditions despite the fact that Mother is undoubtedly unfit to care or be left alone with C.E.

He refuses to sever his relationship with Mother and seeks to place C.E. exclusively in her care while he works. He fails to recognize the threat Mother is to C.E.'s safety and welfare. He does not acknowledge that Mother has any mental illness despite her formal diagnosis and lengthy history with the Department. At no point in the record has Mother proven that she is capable of safely caring for C.E., thus C.E. is placed in danger whenever in her care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, he has refused to obtain a residence in which C.E. may permanently reside. In reviewing these factors, the trial court abused its discretion in declining to find exceptional circumstances to terminate the Father's parental rights. Father's continued parental relationship with C.E. is detrimental to C.E.'s safety and welfare. Thus, since his parents are not a placement resource, the juvenile court\n   should have looked to the next best thing-termination of parental rights to permit guardianship and adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Additional Action during a Termination of Parental Rights Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   All parties are in apparent agreement that the juvenile court erred in addressing the change in C.E.'s permanency plan in his CINA case in the same order denying the Department's petition to terminate parental rights. Father maintains, however, that any error is harmless, because the error could be rectified by separating the order into two distinct orders. FL \u00a7 5-324(a) provides that, in a separate order accompanying an order denying guardianship, the juvenile court shall include any order under Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article that is in the child's best interests,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an order with respect to a change in permanency plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Here, the juvenile court did not comply with this directive because it did not issue a separate order changing C.E.'s permanency plan to long-term relative guardianship. As such, the juvenile court's opinion/order raises doubt as to whether the\n   juvenile court reached its conclusions regarding the termination of parental rights and a change in the permanency plan in the proper manner-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   whether the two related but distinctly different concepts were afforded independent consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Reading the juvenile court's opinion/order, it is difficult to differentiate the FL \u00a7 5-323 termination of parental rights analysis from the analysis of the change of permanency plan. A striking example of this lack of clarity is the juvenile court's interwoven analysis of issues upon both a \"more likely than not\" or preponderance of the evidence standard, and a clear and convincing evidence standard. In another instance, the juvenile court concluded that exceptional circumstances required a change of permanency plan when parental unfitness or exceptional circumstances are required to terminate parental rights. To be sure, not every instance of procedural non-compliance constitutes reversible error. A juvenile court's\n   failure to issue separate opinions/orders may not, in and of itself, be sufficient grounds for reversal. In this instance, however, it is not possible to conclude that the juvenile court conducted a separate analysis with respect to the termination of parental rights and a change in permanency plan. As we are remanding this matter for further proceedings, the juvenile court will have the opportunity to remedy this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We also note that even though the juvenile court certainly had the authority to alter the CINA child's permanency plan during a TPR hearing, a best practice for juvenile courts is to separate the proceedings into two hearings. Separate proceedings are especially important in difficult factual situations such as this one. If a juvenile court denies the TPR proceeding, a permanency placement review hearing should be scheduled in the original CINA case on a separate date. This is optimal because a CINA permanency hearing and a TPR hearing are seeking to resolve related, but, ultimately distinct issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption/Guardianship of Cross H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3989581\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/200/142/#p152\">\n    200 Md.

Further, the juvenile court could have determined the extent to which Mother and Father were granted visitation and other aspect of the custody and guardianship. We also believe this would have also likely remedied many of the issues with the juvenile court's order that we have outlined above. Therefore, we recommend separate proceedings in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Overall, based on the juvenile court's order, it is not possible to affirm the juvenile court's decision declining to terminate\n   Father's parental rights. We are concerned with the court's findings as specified above and with the lack of clear articulation of the appropriate burdens of proof. The finding that Father was not unfit is contradicted by the juvenile court's finding that reunification with either Father or Mother was not attainable within the foreseeable future, if ever. Further, exceptional circumstances existed, specifically the Father's reliance on the Mother for housing and childcare for C.E., that would warrant termination of Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In regard to the order, although the juvenile court purported to make this finding by a preponderance of the evidence, it is unclear why the juvenile court would be using a preponderance of the evidence standard in assessing the termination of Father's parental rights. It is impossible to conclude that the juvenile court's concurrent consideration of a change in the permanency plan did not affect the ultimate disposition of the termination of parental rights hearing. Therefore, we shall direct that the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, sitting as a juvenile court, be vacated and that this case be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, SITTING AS A JUVENILE COURT, IS VACATED.

Mother has shown time and time again that she is incapable of caring for her children.
