Quinn III,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a state marshal, which concluded that the\n   defendant was entitled, under General Statutes \u00a7 12-162 (c), to be paid a 15 percent statutory fee for executing the subject tax warrant. The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in holding that the defendant was entitled to be paid the statutory fee because the defendant had not executed on the tax warrant or collected the delinquent taxes, but merely mailed notice of the tax warrant to the plaintiff, prompting the plaintiff to pay the delinquent tax and interest to the town directly before the warrant was served. We disagree, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff is a Connecticut corporation having offices at 39 West Street in Litchfield. It owns a single-family lakefront house at 72 Sandy Beach Road in Goshen, which it manages, by and through its president and sole member, Edward James Murphy, Jr., for a private, extended family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In February, 2016, the tax collector for the town of Goshen determined that the plaintiff had failed to pay the January 1, 2016 installment of its 2014 property tax bill. Therefore, on February 9, 2016, the tax collector issued a delinquent notice, notifying the plaintiff that it owed the outstanding tax, plus interest calculated through February 29, 2016. The notice expressly stated that the plaintiff owed a total of $ 3302.21, consisting of $ 3206.03 in back taxes and $ 96.18 in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March, 2016, the tax collector further determined that the plaintiff still had not paid its January 1, 2016 installment of its 2014 property tax bill. Consequently, on March 8, 2016, the tax collector issued to the plaintiff a notice of intent to lien, in which she indicated that the plaintiff owed $ 3206.03 in delinquent taxes, plus interest, calculated though April 30, 2016, in the amount of $ 192.36, for a total amount due of $ 3398.39. The\n   notice of intent to lien\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicated that payment in full of the\n   delinquent tax bill was due by April 12, 2016, and that if that payment was not timely submitted, the tax collector could enforce collection of the plaintiff's delinquent account, at the expense of the plaintiff, by any of several means, including assigning the plaintiff's account to a state marshal for the service of an alias tax warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff once again failed to pay its delinquent tax bill by the April 12, 2016 due date. Consequently, on April 26, 2016, the tax collector issued a \"Property Alias Warrant\" (alias tax warrant) to the defendant, commanding the defendant to collect the plaintiff's property taxes in the amount of $ 3476.48, consisting of $ 3206.03 in taxes, $ 240.45 in interest calculated through May 30, 2016, a $ 24 lien fee and a $ 6 warrant fee, and the defendant's \"lawful charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 1, 2016, the defendant mailed a letter to the plaintiff, informing it that he was in receipt of an alias\n   tax warrant authorizing him to collect the plaintiff's delinquent real estate taxes for the town of Goshen and enclosing a copy of the warrant. The letter stated, inter alia: \"This Alias Tax Warrant commands me to make demand upon you for the sum of $ 3,997.95, payable to: State Marshal Arthur Quinn, before making any attachments. THIS PROPERTY WILL BE SUBJECT TO TAX AUCTION IF DELINQUENCY REMAINS UNPAID AFTER MAY 30, 2016.\" The letter further warned: \"If no contact is made immediately, we will proceed to attach any wages earned or any existing bank accounts to include but not limited to the seizure of any equipment, property, vehicles, or assets for auction.\" The letter instructed that full payment of all sums due, including the defendant's statutory fee of $ 521.47, be remitted to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 24, 2016, the tax collector received payment from the plaintiff in the amount of $ 3476.48. The tax collector applied that payment, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 12-144b, as follows: $ 453.34 for the defendant's statutory fee of 15 percent of the tax, interest, fees and costs, which totaled $ 3023.03; $ 240.45 for accrued interest; $ 24 for the lien fee; $ 6 for the warrant fee; and $ 2752.58 toward the plaintiff's outstanding delinquent tax bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the tax collector applied the plaintiff's payment to its account, the 2014 tax bill still had an unpaid balance in the amount of $ 453.45 due and owing, in addition to any applicable interest, fees and costs. The plaintiff thereafter submitted payment for that remaining balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 26, 2016, the plaintiff mailed a letter to the defendant, demanding that he return to it the sum of $ 453.45 that the town had paid to him as his fee. The defendant did not respond to the plaintiff's demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter filed this action, alleging that the defendant was not entitled to a 15 percent statutory fee under \u00a7 12-162 because he never executed the alias tax warrant. The plaintiff further alleged that, because the defendant was not entitled to that fee under \u00a7 12-162, he was liable to it for conversion of that sum under General Statutes \u00a7 52-564.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 15, 2017, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its conversion claim because the defendant collected and retained his claimed fee without executing the alias tax warrant or collecting the delinquent taxes that the plaintiff owed to the town of Goshen, as required under \u00a7 12-162. The defendant countered that \"[t]here is no genuine issue as to any material fact establishing that the defendant was at all times acting in his official capacity as a Connecticut state marshal, engaged in the lawful service and execution of a valid alias tax warrant in accordance with applicable law and within the scope of his lawful duties, and thus was lawfully authorized to receive and exercise control of his lawful statutory fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 27, 2018, by way of a memorandum of decision, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. In its decision, the court described its task as to determine the meaning of the language, \"executes such warrant and collects any delinquent municipal taxes,\" in \u00a7 12-162 (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and consider that language specifically in relation to\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-261,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which pertains to fees and expenses of officers serving process or performing other duties, and \u00a7 12-144b, which sets forth the proper order of application of tax payments. The court set forth the applicable law governing our interpretation of statutory language, found that the phrase, \"executes such warrant and collects any delinquent municipal taxes,\" under \u00a7 12-162 (c) \"is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,\" and thus concluded that the language is not plain or unambiguous. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Having so concluded, the court \"look[ed]\n   for interpretative guidance in the statutes' legislative history, legislative policy and relationship to other statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court set forth the following reasoning: \"The obvious policy underlying \u00a7 12-162 (c), is that, 'if a municipality chooses to use [a state marshal] to collect delinquent taxes, the cost of that collection should be borne by the delinquent taxpayers rather than by those who duly pay their taxes.'

An Office of Legislative Research report provided the following, 'ALIAS TAX WARRANTS. After making a demand for unpaid taxes, a tax collector can issue an alias tax warrant to a state marshal or constable. The alias tax warrant commands the officer to collect the tax, interest, penalty, and charges from the taxpayer. The officer can garnish the taxpayer's wages or collect funds from a bank account or the taxpayer's goods or real estate ( [ \u00a7 12-162 ] ). If the officer levies on real estate, the property is sold under the procedures for a tax sale (see below, [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-157 ). The tax collector's fee for issuing an alias tax warrant\n   is $ 6 ( [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-140 ). An officer serving an alias tax warrant is entitled to collect the fees allowed by law for serving executions issued by a court. A state marshal or constable who executes a warrant and collects delinquent municipal taxes receives, in addition to expenses otherwise allowed, 15 [percent] of the taxes collected under the warrant or a $ 30 minimum ( \u00a7\u00a7 12-162 and 52-261 ). The amount a taxpayer owes is not just the amount due on the tax but includes interest on the delinquent portion of the principal of any tax due at a rate of 18 [percent] per year from the time it is due until it is paid ( [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-146 ). This is the amount put into the alias tax warrant and the state marshal's 15 [percent] is calculated on this amount. If a state marshal performs some other functions, such as publishing advertisements or conducting title searches, he or she could also be separately reimbursed for costs.'

See 30 Am. Jur. 2d 202, Executions and Enforcement of Judgments \u00a7 192 (2005) ('A levy on personal property is generally defined as a seizure of the property. Thus, in most jurisdictions, it is essential to the completion of a levy of execution upon personal property that there be a seizure, either actual or constructive, of the property.' ... Ballentine's Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969) p. 728 ('At common law a levy on goods consisted of an officer's entering the premises where they were and either leaving an assistant in charge of them or removing them after taking an inventory.

General Statutes \u00a7 52-261 (a) (F).

Under the last antecedent rule, '[r]eferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.' ... 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th Ed. 2007) \u00a7 47:33, pp. 487-89; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Foley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Elections Enforcement Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088775\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/764/#p786\">\n    297 Conn. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20A.3d%20823\">\n    2 A.3d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (applying rule);\n   <em>\n    LaProvidenza\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Employees' Retirement Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706562\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/178/23/#p27\">\n    178 Conn. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20A.2d%20905\">\n    420 A.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (same). There is not clear evidence of a contrary intention in the statutory text, as 'collected' may refer to the debtor/third party from whom the money is being collected or the person collecting the money. Moreover, had the legislature intended for 'by the officer' to apply to the first condition as well, it could have expressed such an intention more clearly by inserting a comma between the second condition and that phrase (when the money is actually collected and paid over, or the debt or a portion of the debt is secured, by the officer). Application of the last antecedent rule also is confirmed by a review of predecessors of \u00a7 52-261. For more than a century, the statute provided for the fee 'when the money is actually collected and paid over, or the debt secured by the officer\n   <em>\n    to the acceptance of the creditor\n   </em>\n   ....' \" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    Corsair Special Situations Fund, L.P.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Engineered Framing Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491630\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/791/#p472\">\n    327 Conn. at 475-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491630\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/174/791/#p472\">\n    174 A.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 4850; accord General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 52-261 (a) (6). \"It is clear that the italicized phrase would not have applied to the first condition. That phrase necessarily reflected that the officer exercises some discretion in the means or manner by which the debt is secured. The officer exercises no similar discretion when money is\n   collected from the third party or debtor; the officer merely accepts the money that is provided.... Accordingly, if the phrase 'to the acceptance of the creditor' did not modify the first condition, then the preceding phrase 'by the officer' similarly would not modify that condition. Although the legislature recently excised the phrase 'to the acceptance of the creditor' from the statute; [P.A. 03-224], \u00a7 10; it gave no indication that this change was intended to expand application of the phrase 'by the officer' to the collection of money or that it understood the previous statute to have such a meaning. See 46 H.R. Proc., [supra], p. 5443, remarks of [Representative Lawlor] (explaining that proposed changes 'will make it easier for the marshals to carry out their responsibilities and for the [State Marshal] Commission to conduct the oversight that is called for under the reforms of a number of years ago').\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Finally, common sense dictates that we should not construe the statute to limit the fee to only those circumstances in which the marshal has personally collected the money and paid it over to the creditor, as Corsair suggests.

Corsair's construction of the\n   statute also would deprive a levying officer of the statutory commission if the third party violated the order in the writ by paying the levied upon funds directly to the creditor instead of the officer, whether mistakenly or intentionally. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Fair Cadillac Oldsmobile Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124783\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/41/659/#p660\">\n    41 Conn.

L. Rptr. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 ] (after deputy sheriff served bank execution, judgment debtor\n   paid judgment creditor from source other than bank account). Under Corsair's interpretation of the statutory scheme, the officer would not be entitled to the fee, even though the creditor received the benefit of the officer's service because the third party's obligation to the judgment creditor arose only as a result of the proper service of the writ of execution. Corsair's construction would create an incentive for judgment creditors to circumvent the statutory commission, a process that could inure to the benefit of both creditor and debtor by an agreement to reduce the debt by an amount less than the 15 percent fee in exchange for direct payment....
