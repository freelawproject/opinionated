We agree with the plaintiff's first claim but disagree with the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts. A retaining wall was constructed as part of the defendant's \"Streetscape Project.\" The project was funded by federal and state\n   grants, and the state Department of Transportation (department) supervised the construction. The department's design engineer supervisor approved the construction of a five foot retaining wall without a fence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the construction phase of the project,\n   field conditions existed that necessitated the height of the retaining wall to become taller than five feet, as the driveway below it sloped downward. A wooden barrier in the style of a Merritt Parkway guardrail was installed several feet in distance from the retaining wall with dense landscaping behind it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The retaining wall was adjacent to the parking lot of the Lumberyard Pub. On the evening of August 26, 2011, at approximately 8:30 p.m., the plaintiff went to the Lumberyard Pub for dinner and drinks. The plaintiff left at approximately 2 a.m., after consuming approximately five beers. In order to reach Main Street by a shortcut, the plaintiff climbed over the guardrail and stepped off the retaining wall. While traversing the unfenced retaining wall, the plaintiff fell and injured his left leg and ankle in many places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant sounding in absolute public nuisance and alleging that he was injured when he fell off an unfenced retaining wall that had a nearly six foot drop to Main Street below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant filed an answer and special defenses, alleging, inter alia, assumption of the risk and recklessness. Following trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Kamp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , accepted and recorded. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict, and the court issued a memorandum of decision denying the motion. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court erred when it denied his motion to set aside the verdict because the jury's answers to the special interrogatories in the verdict form were inconsistent. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The court charged the jury, prior to deliberations, in part, as follows: \"First, the plaintiff must prove that the retaining wall was inherently dangerous ... that it had a natural tendency to create danger and to inflict injury upon person or property. It is the condition itself which must have a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury. You, as the trier of fact, must consider all of the circumstances involved in determining whether ... the condition in that particular location had a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury. Second, the plaintiff must prove that the danger was a continuing one .... Third, the plaintiff must prove that the use of the land, in this\n   case the retaining wall, was unreasonable or unlawful. In making a determination concerning the reasonableness of the use of the land, all the surrounding factors must be considered. Fourth, the plaintiff must prove that the condition interferes with a right common to the general public .... If you find that the plaintiff has proven the above elements of a public nuisance, next the plaintiff must prove that the nuisance was a proximate cause of the injuries suffered by [the plaintiff].\" In explaining how to proceed with the verdict forms and jury interrogatories, the court stated: \"[F]or example, you respond to question one. If you answer no, as the instructions indicate, you must return a verdict for the defendant, and you would fill out the defendant's verdict form and that would end your deliberations. If you answer number one yes, as the instructions indicate, then you go on to question two, and you answer that question. After question two, if you were to answer that question no, then you would return a verdict for the defendant using the defendant's\n   verdict form. If you answer yes, you continue to number three. And you continue through the process until you've reached your verdict either using one or the other of the verdict forms. You necessarily also have to complete the jury interrogatories at least completely or to where you stop if you answer a question no.\" The court did not further explicate interrogatories six and seven, which asked the jury to render special verdicts as to whether the defendant had proved its special defenses of recklessness and assumption of the risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the final charge of the court to the jury, the court submitted seven interrogatories to the jury, with the first and third as follows: \"1. Has Plaintiff proven to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the condition complained of, the subject retaining wall was inherently dangerous in that it had a natural tendency to inflict injury on person or property? ... 3. Has Plaintiff proven to you, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendant's use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During deliberations,\n   the jury presented the following question to the court: \"If we are not all in agreement on questions one and two\n   but are on question three, are we able to rule in favor of the defendant?\" (Emphasis omitted.) Thereafter, counsel discussed the issue with the court outside the presence of the jury, and the plaintiff's attorney stated: \"If some of them are saying that the wall was ... inherently dangerous and the danger was continuing, then that means that it has to be unreasonable.\" The court did not agree and stated that the \"law requires that you, on behalf of your client, prove all four elements, and if you can't prove each element then there's a defendant's verdict.\" The plaintiff's counsel explained, \"we don't abandon our position,\" to which the court responded, \"of course you don't because you're going to write about this on appeal.\" The plaintiff's counsel specifically took an exception to \"the omission of the words 'without a fence' after 'retaining wall' \" in the court's charge to the jury. He also had preserved the issue in the plaintiff's request to charge, dated July 25, 2016, which suggested that the court charged the jury that \"[t]he plaintiff must prove that the retaining wall without a fence had a natural tendency to create danger\n   and to inflict injury upon person or property.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the colloquy with counsel, the court responded to the jury's question as follows: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I instructed you on the law and you have my charge as a court exhibit. And the plaintiff has the burden of proof, as I indicated in my charge, to prove essentially four elements of an absolute public nuisance .... If the jury can unanimously ... agree that the plaintiff has not proven one of those four elements and you can agree upon that, and in this case if it's number three and you so indicate on your jury verdict interrogatories and you check that unanimously in the negative, then you ... can return a verdict in ... favor of the defendant. But you must all unanimously agree that [the plaintiff] has not proven one element of the cause of action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following deliberations, the jury responded in the affirmative to jury interrogatories one and two and in the negative to the third jury interrogatory. The plaintiff moved to set aside the defendant's verdict, arguing that the jury's responses to the first and third interrogatories, in which it found that the wall was an inherently dangerous condition but was not an unreasonable or unlawful use of the land, were inconsistent. The court denied the motion, reasoning that the \"jury's responses to the interrogatories were not inconsistent because there was evidence that allowed the jury to determine that, although the wall was unreasonably dangerous, it was not an unreasonable use of the land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The standard of review governing our review of a trial court's denial of a motion to set aside the verdict is well settled. The trial court possesses inherent power to set aside a jury verdict which, in the court's opinion, is against the law or the evidence .... [The trial court] should not set aside a verdict where it is apparent that\n   there was some evidence upon which the jury might reasonably reach [its] conclusion, and should not refuse to set it aside where the manifest injustice of the verdict is so plain and palpable as clearly\n   to denote that some mistake was made by the jury in the application of legal principles .... Ultimately, [t]he decision to set aside a verdict entails the exercise of a broad legal discretion ... that, in the absence of clear abuse, we shall not disturb.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Kumah\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20798\">\n    160 Conn.

The plaintiff claims that the wall was inherently dangerous, constituted a public nuisance, and that he injured himself\n   when he fell off the retaining wall. The issue in this case, as it was tried and argued below, was not whether the defendant could build a wall, but whether it could erect an unfenced wall, without thereby creating a public nuisance. In analogous settings, such as highway defect or premises liability cases, where a particular defect must be proved, what must be established is not a condition that might give rise to the defect, but the existence of the very defect that caused the injury, such as a pothole in a highway or a broken stair on someone's premises. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    DiPietro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Farmington Sports Arena, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20107\">\n    306 Conn. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20951\">\n    49 A.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In the present case, the condition which the plaintiff claims to have constituted a nuisance was the retaining wall\n   <em>\n    without a fence\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court instructed the jury on the \"reasonable use\" element of public nuisance that it was to consider \"all the surrounding factors.\" Although there was evidence of landscaping and a Merritt Parkway style barrier several feet from the approximately five foot tall wall, the jury nonetheless found the wall to be inherently dangerous. Evidence that the plaintiff was intoxicated, wore flip-flops, walked over the Merritt Parkway barrier and jumped off the wall, does not pertain to the question in the third interrogatory as to whether the\n   <em>\n    defendant's\n   </em>\n   use of the land was reasonable. \"[T]he only practical\n   distinction between an absolute nuisance and one grounded in negligence is that contributory negligence is not a defense to the former but may be as to the latter.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Quinnett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566535\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/343/#p349\">\n    213 Conn. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=568%20A.2d%20786\">\n    568 A.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), overruled on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Driscoll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653094\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/312/\">\n    262 Conn. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20A.2d%201003\">\n    813 A.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). That evidence might well pertain to the defendant's special defenses of recklessness and assumption of the risk, but the jury did not reach those issues. The issue of utility comes into play logically, not about whether the wall itself had\n   some use to hold back the earth, but whether there was any useful public purpose to erecting the wall without a fence atop it, which is the very defect that the plaintiff, in his complaint, supporting evidence, and argument to the jury, claims to have been the nuisance that proximately caused his injuries. In this case, as a matter of law, the jury could not have determined that the retaining wall without a fence was both inherently dangerous and not an unreasonable use of the land. A wall with or without a fence has the same capacity to hold back earth. The condition at issue is not the wall itself or the Streetscape Project, but the wall without a fence atop it. The inherently dangerous condition of the wall without a fence has no utility to stabilize soil. In\n   <em>\n    Kumah\n   </em>\n   , a jury reasonably could have found that the fire truck placed diagonally across an interstate was not an unreasonable use of the land given the utility of the fire truck in the emergency situation. See\n   <em>\n    Kumah\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20798\">\n    160 Conn.

In the present case, there is no scenario under which the jury reasonably could have determined, after concluding that the retaining wall without a fence was inherently dangerous, that the fact that the retaining wall lacked a fence served any utility to either the defendant or the community, or that a weighing of all relevant circumstances could make the use of the land for an unfenced wall that is inherently dangerous and lacks any utility, reasonable. Under the circumstances of this case, the jury's answers to interrogatories one and three are inconsistent.

In affirming the trial court's refusal to set aside the jury's verdict, this court addressed the reasonableness element of a public nuisance claim. In so doing, this court focused not only on the inherently dangerous condition, but also on the surrounding circumstances. The court emphasized that firefighters had activated \"flashing lights\" and had \"placed cones as warnings to approaching traffic.\" Id., at 800-801,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20598\">\n    126 A.3d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also id., at 806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20A.3d%20598\">\n    126 A.3d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.6 (\"[t]he jury may well have decided ... that the social utility of guarding the scene with, inter alia, flashing lights was great\").

The defendant installed both a guardrail barrier and a landscaping buffer to shield the retaining wall from the adjacent parking lot.

Moreover, the plaintiff's own expert testified at trial that the guardrail, in particular, provided adequate notice and was an effective means of keeping people out of the area between the retaining wall and the parking lot. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The admitted efficacy of that barrier provides a basis on which the jury could conclude that, notwithstanding the inherent dangerousness of the retaining wall itself, the defendant's use of the land was not unreasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In reviewing a claim of internally inconsistent interrogatory answers, we are obligated to harmonize those answers to the extent practicable while giving the evidence the most favorable construction that supports the jury's ultimate verdict.

Because the jury was presented with ample documentary and testimonial evidence that both a guardrail barrier and a landscaping buffer separated the parking lot from the retaining wall, as well as testimony from the defendant's project manager that the guardrail barrier was installed \"to protect vehicles and pedestrians,\" I believe the jury reasonably could conclude that protective fencing was, in fact, present on the land, insofar as fencing is defined as \"a barrier intended to prevent ... intrusion or to mark a boundary\" and \"something resembling a fence in appearance or function.\" See Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) p. 837.

Unlike the present case,\n    <em>\n     Bilodeau\n    </em>\n    did not involve internally inconsistent interrogatory answers by the jury but, rather, concerned \"an apparent inconsistency between the jury's answer to one of the interrogatories submitted to it and the plaintiff's verdict.\" Id., at 450,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20A.2d%201049\">\n     661 A.2d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

After answering one of the six interrogatories in the negative, the jury nonetheless delivered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and the court thereafter directed a verdict in favor of the defendant. Id., at 452-54,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20A.2d%201049\">\n     661 A.2d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    On appeal, this court expressly stated that its ruling was predicated on the particular \"circumstances of this case ....\" Id., at 456,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20A.2d%201049\">\n     661 A.2d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This court emphasized that the trial court \"did not expressly charge the jury that it must answer all of the interrogatories in the affirmative in order to find for the plaintiff.

The trial court's failure to so instruct the jury, coupled with the remedial mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 52-223, led this court to observe that \"considering the fact that the trial court had not specifically instructed the jury that it needed to answer all of the interrogatories in the affirmative in order to return a plaintiff's verdict, caution dictated that the jury be so instructed and given an opportunity to make its verdict clear\" before the court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant.

Furthermore, the plaintiff has never claimed any impropriety in the instructions furnished by the trial court and has not briefed such a claim in this appeal.\n    <em>\n     Bilodeau\n    </em>\n    , therefore, has little relevance to the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
