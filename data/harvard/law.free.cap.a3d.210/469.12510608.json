Under the circumstances alleged, we conclude that the defendant, Charles Cochran, a physician, owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, even though she was not his patient. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's one count complaint and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts, as set forth in the plaintiff's complaint and construed in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lestorti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344464\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/466/#p472\">\n    298 Conn. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20A.3d%20269\">\n    4 A.3d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ; and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. In early 2013, the plaintiff began dating her boyfriend, identified in this action by the pseudonym John Smith. At all relevant times, the plaintiff and Smith were involved in an exclusive romantic relationship. At some point, the couple agreed that, before their relationship became sexual, they would individually seek testing for STDs. As of July, 2013, the plaintiff had tested negative for and did not have any STDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that time, pursuant to his agreement with the plaintiff, Smith visited his physician, the defendant, who is a licensed medical doctor practicing in Norwalk. During Smith's visit, the defendant asked Smith why he wanted to be tested again for STDs, as the defendant had tested him just five months earlier. Smith explained that he wanted to be tested again for the protection and benefit of his new, exclusive girlfriend, the plaintiff. The defendant then took a sample of Smith's blood, arranged for it to be tested for STDs, and subsequently reviewed the laboratory (lab) test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The lab report that the defendant reviewed included a guide for reading the test's results. The guide indicated that an HSV 2 IgG (herpes simplex virus type 2 specific antibody) result of less than 0.9 is negative for the\n   herpes simplex virus type 2 (herpes), a result between 0.9 and 1.1 is equivocal, and a result greater than 1.1 means that the sample tested positive for herpes. Smith's HSV 2 IgG test result was 4.43, significantly above the threshold for a positive herpes diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant delegated to a member of his staff the task of informing Smith of the\n   results of his test. Even though the lab report clearly demonstrated a positive herpes diagnosis, the staff member incorrectly told Smith over the phone that his STD test results had come back negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff's relationship with Smith subsequently became sexual. Thereafter, the plaintiff began to experience herpes outbreaks and was diagnosed with herpes. Upon learning of this, Smith contacted the defendant to inquire further about his test results. The defendant then informed Smith that he actually had tested positive for herpes and apologized for the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff brought a one count action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant had been negligent in various respects. The defendant moved to strike the complaint on the basis that the plaintiff's claim sounded in medical malpractice and, therefore, must fail for lack of any physician-patient relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant argued in the alternative that, even if the court construed the plaintiff's claim as sounding in ordinary negligence, the plaintiff and the defendant were not involved in any special relationship that would justify extending a duty of care to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court granted the defendant's motion to strike. The court did not expressly resolve the issue of whether the plaintiff's claim sounds in ordinary negligence or medical malpractice, at once describing the plaintiff as \"seeking to extend medical malpractice liability of a physician to the sexual partner of a patient\" and referring to the defendant's \"claimed negligence\n   ... in reporting the test results.\" The analysis undertaken by the trial court, however, implies that it viewed the claim as sounding in ordinary negligence. Specifically, the court concluded that the claim was governed by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), and applied the framework that we set out in that case for determining whether a nonpatient may assert an ordinary negligence claim against a health care provider. See id., at 591-99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the trial court concluded the defendant did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff and, for that reason, granted the defendant's motion to strike. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, we must resolve a dispute between the parties as to the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint. As an alternative ground for affirmance, the defendant contends on appeal, as he did before the trial court, that the plaintiff's one count complaint sounds in medical malpractice. In support of this conclusion, the defendant points to, among other things, the facts that (1) the plaintiff alleged that \"[the defendant] had an obligation to perform the STD tests and [to] report the results accurately to ... Smith according to accepted medical practice and standards,\" (2) the plaintiff further alleged that the defendant's \"breach of accepted medical practice and standards\" by failing to properly treat, test, monitor, and advise Smith, was the cause of her injuries, and (3) the plaintiff's counsel attached to the complaint a certificate, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a), averring that there were grounds for a good faith belief that the defendant had committed \"medical negligence\" in the \"care or treatment\" of Smith. Because a medical malpractice claim that fails to allege a physician-patient relationship\n   between a plaintiff\n   and a defendant is legally insufficient;\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 588-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and because it is undisputed that the plaintiff never was a patient of the defendant, the defendant contends that the trial court properly struck the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff responds that, although she attached a certificate of good faith pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a (a) out of an abundance of caution, her complaint alleges ordinary, common-law negligence rather than medical malpractice. She notes that the single count complaint is titled simply \"negligence,\" and it alleges that the plaintiff's \"injuries were the result of the negligence and carelessness of the [defendant] ... in [that he failed] to properly advise ... Smith of his STD test results ....\" At no point, moreover, does the complaint use the term \"medical malpractice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin our analysis by reiterating that, although the better practice may be to include a separate count of the complaint for each distinct theory of liability, there is no such requirement. Practice Book \u00a7 10-26 provides that, \"[w]here separate and distinct causes of action, as distinguished from separate and distinct claims for relief founded on the same cause of action or transaction, are joined, the statement of the second shall be prefaced by the words Second Count, and so on for the others ....\" (Emphasis omitted.) In construing an earlier version of this rule of practice, this court explained that it has \"uniformly approved the use of a single count to set forth the basis of a plaintiff's claims for relief [when] they grow out of a single occurrence or transaction or closely related occurrences or transactions, and it does not matter that the claims for relief do not have the same legal basis. It is only when the causes of action, that is, the groups of facts [on] which the plaintiff bases his claims for relief, are separate\n   and distinct that separate counts are necessary or indeed ordinarily desirable.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Veits\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1616856\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/134/428/#p438\">\n    134 Conn. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438-39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20389\">\n    58 A.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948).

We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.... Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.... Moreover, we note that [w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged....

The relevant allegations of the complaint indicate that the defendant reviewed Smith's test results, notified a staff member of those results, and delegated to the staff member the task of informing Smith of the results. The complaint further alleges that the lab report contained a guide that made clear that Smith had tested positive for herpes. In addition, the complaint alleges that, although the test results were\n   positive, the staff member informed Smith that his results were negative. Finally, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant's negligence in failing to accurately advise Smith of his positive test results caused Smith to infect the plaintiff with herpes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   These allegations are consistent with two distinct theories of negligence. First, the defendant could have misread Smith's lab report and incorrectly concluded that the results were negative. Second, it is possible that the defendant interpreted the report correctly but that either the defendant misinformed his staff member that the results were negative or the staff member misinformed Smith. In other words, the alleged error could have occurred either in the initial interpretation of the report or in the inaccurate communication of the results, via the staff member, to Smith. See 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 311 (2), p. 106 (1965) (negligence may consist of failure to exercise reasonable care in ascertaining accuracy of information or in manner in which information is communicated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In either case, we agree with the plaintiff that her allegations reasonably can be understood to sound in ordinary negligence. It is true that the alleged error transpired in a medical setting and that it arose as a result of a medical diagnosis in the context of an ongoing physician-patient relationship. There are at least two reasons, however, why we nevertheless conclude that this aspect of the complaint need not be read to sound in medical malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, the alleged error is not one involving professional medical judgment or skill. If the defendant misread Smith's lab result, then he failed to perform what was, in essence, a simple, ministerial task. The index to the report states that a result greater than 1.1 indicates a positive test, and the report states that Smith's result was 4.43. No advanced medical training was necessary\n   to determine that Smith had tested positive for herpes; elementary reading and arithmetic skills should have been sufficient. Indeed, laypeople routinely perform comparable tasks, such as reading and interpreting meat thermometers, oil dipsticks, pool and spa test strips, and insulin tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Of course, the same conclusion holds to an even greater extent if the genesis of the error was that the defendant simply told his staff member the wrong test result or the staff member relayed the wrong result to Smith. That sort of careless miscommunication could occur in any setting and has nothing to do with the exercise of professional medical judgment or skill. Indeed, the very fact that the defendant delegated the task to a staff member, who presumably was not a medical doctor, points to the nontechnical nature of the communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, regardless of whether the alleged error arose from a misreading or a miscommunication, proving that it constituted negligence would not require expert medical testimony or the establishment of a professional standard of care. A jury will not need expert testimony to determine whether the defendant's staff was negligent in leading Smith to believe that he was free of STDs when the defendant knew, or should have known, that Smith had tested positive for herpes, a contagious STD, and intended to engage in sexual activity. Such a determination is well within the ken of a lay person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that, as in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff in this case pleaded a cause of action sounding in ordinary negligence.

The present case requires us to further clarify the scope of this exception to the general duty rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With these principles in mind, we now turn our attention to the central question posed by the present appeal, namely, whether a health care provider who negligently misinforms a patient that he does not have an STD owes a duty of care to an identifiable third party who foreseeably\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   contracts the STD as a result of the provider's negligence. The defendant contends that various public policy considerations counsel against recognition of such a duty. Most notably, because a patient such as Smith could have been or become intimate with an unlimited number of romantic partners, there is no meaningful way to identify or restrict the number of individuals whom he might infect and, therefore, to limit the class of persons who could have standing to bring an action of this sort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendant further contends that a number of public policy considerations and common-law traditions that are unique to the health care environment or, specifically, to the physician-patient relationship,\n   counsel against recognizing a physician's duty to a nonpatient third party under the circumstances alleged in the present case. He argues that (1) the law generally does not impose on physicians a duty of care to nonpatient third parties, (2) the considerations underlying the adoption of Connecticut's medical malpractice statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-190a through 52-190c, disfavor the imposition of additional liability on physicians, (3) imposing on physicians duties to third parties risks interfering with and undermining the physician-patient relationship, and (4) considerations of confidentiality create both legal and logistical hurdles to the recognition of such duties. Finally, the defendant contends that the plaintiff could have taken various measures both to protect herself from contracting herpes-presumably sexual abstention or the use of prophylactics-and to establish proper standing to bring an action of this sort-such as accompanying Smith when he sought treatment from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court, in granting the defendant's motion to strike, was swayed by a number of these arguments. The court also discussed several additional concerns: whether physicians might become obligated to contact and warn or to educate patients' sexual partners; the fact that physicians have no control over whether and how patients share their STD test results with potential sexual partners; and whether the recognition of a duty to nonpatients should be predicated on the existence of a formal, mutual STD testing agreement between the patient and his or her prospective sexual partner. Although the defendant, certain of the amici,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the trial court raise many valid concerns, for the reasons that follow, we are persuaded that\n   they do not counsel\n   against the recognition of a duty under the specific circumstances presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Setting aside for the moment the question of what third-party duties apply within the distinct confines of the physician-patient relationship, we observe at the outset that many of the concerns that the defendant raises and that the trial court found persuasive have been addressed and resolved in other professional contexts. Although the plaintiff has not labeled it as such, her claim is, in essence, one for negligent misrepresentation. That tort specifically encompasses situations such as this, in which a tortfeasor negligently supplies misinformation knowing that the recipient of that information intends to supply it in turn for the benefit and guidance of a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"This court has long recognized liability for negligent misrepresentation. We have held that even an innocent misrepresentation of fact may be actionable if the declarant has the means of knowing, ought to know, or has the duty of knowing the truth.... [When the information supplied is to be used in the furtherance of a business transaction and the alleged harm is solely pecuniary, the] governing principles are set forth in ... \u00a7 552 of [Volume 3 of] the Restatement Second of Torts [1977]: One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment ... supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance [on] the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    D'Ulisse-Cupo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498028\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/206/#p217\">\n    202 Conn. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20217\">\n    520 A.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Recognizing the potentially limitless scope of the financial\n   harms that may flow from the dissemination of false information, the Restatement (Second) restricts liability for negligent misrepresentation of this sort to the loss suffered \"(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance [the defendant] intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it,\" and \"(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.\" 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 552 (2) (a) and (b), p. 127 (1977) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20A.2d%20217\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   comment (a), pp. 127-28. In other words, the Restatement (Second) addresses the problem of potentially limitless third-party liability, first, by conferring standing on only those third parties to whom the defendant knew that the recipient intended to supply the information at issue and, second, by restricting liability to losses arising from transactions for the purpose of which the information was supplied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defined and cabined in this manner, liability for negligent misinformation has been upheld in various contexts in which a professional is hired to supply information to a client, knowing that the client is obtaining the information at least in part for the benefit and guidance of some third party or parties.

We are not persuaded by this contention. First, the defendant provides no authority to support his theory that either the law or the medical profession confers a special status on a nonspouse sexual partner who accompanies a patient to his or her appointment with a physician and that that status is sufficient to support a legal duty of care. Second, it may well be that the defendant's suggested approach would interfere more directly with the physician-patient relationship and raise more substantial confidentiality concerns than would the imposition of the third-party duty of care for which the plaintiff advocates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The defendant also notes that many of these cases involve potentially deadly diseases such as HIV that are more serious than herpes. We agree with the Alaska Supreme Court, however, that \"the duty issue cannot turn on possible distinctions among diseases based on their severity and ubiquity.... Rather, the severity and ubiquity of the disease bear on what the [provider] must do to discharge the duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Bolieu\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sisters of Providence in Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850952\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/953/1233/#p1239\">\n    953 P.2d at 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A Florida case,\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pizarro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817095\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/713/1036/\">\n    713 So. 2d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla.

In that case, a patient tested positive for hepatitis C, but her physician's office improperly advised her that she had tested negative. Id., at 1037. Several months later, the patient met the plaintiff, whom she eventually married. Id. The plaintiff contracted hepatitis C from the patient and filed an action against the physician for medical negligence. Id. In upholding the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the District Court of Appeal of Florida recognized that hepatitis C is a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease and that a physician's duty of care in treating such diseases is intended in part for the benefit of third parties. Id., at 1037-38. The court held that the physician owed no duty to the plaintiff, however, because he was neither identified nor known to the physician at the time of the incorrect diagnosis. Id., 1038. By contrast, our research has not revealed any cases in which a court held that there was no third-party liability under circumstances such as those in the present case, in which STD testing was obtained expressly for the benefit of an identifiable, exclusive romantic partner.

As we previously discussed, \u00a7 311 of the Restatement (Second) provides that one who negligently gives false information may be held liable to a third party who predictably is injured by the recipient's reasonable reliance on that information. Notably, comment (b) to that section holds up the physician-patient relationship as the primary illustration of the rule: \"The rule stated in this [s]ection finds particular application where it is part of the actor's business or profession to give information upon which the safety of the recipient or a third person depends. Thus it is as much a part of the professional duty of a physician to give correct information as to the character of the disease from which his patient is suffering, where such knowledge is necessary to the safety of the patient\n   <em>\n    or others\n   </em>\n   , as it is to make a correct diagnosis or to prescribe the appropriate medicine.\" (Emphasis added.) 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 311, comment (b), p. 106. Accordingly, we conclude that sister state and secondary authorities, although limited, generally support the imposition of a third-party duty under the circumstances alleged in the present case. As we discuss in part II B 5 of this opinion, sister state courts generally have not been swayed by the various practical concerns that the defendant and certain of the amici have raised and that the trial court found to be compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, because the question presented is one of first impression in Connecticut, we consider various public policy factors that both this court and other authorities have deemed to be relevant to whether and under what circumstances a physician owes a duty of care to a nonpatient third party.

When addressing third-party liability in the context of infectious diseases in particular, courts also have taken into account such considerations as \"the foreseeability of third-party injury as shown by the patient's [infectious disease] carrier status, the degree of communicability of the patient's infectious disease, and the physician's actual or constructive knowledge of the ease of transmission of the patient's infectious disease; a public health statute [the] legislative intent [of which] is partly to protect third parties, such as a statute requiring physicians to report diagnosed instances of communicable or infectious diseases ; breach of the physician's duty to exercise due care to protect third parties from foreseeable harm as shown by failure to report diagnosed instances of communicable or infectious diseases to public health authorities, failure to warn the patient with the infectious disease not to have contact with third parties, failure to warn the family of the patient with the infectious disease about the ease of, and precautions against, its transmission, failure to quarantine the patient with the infectious disease, failure to vaccinate the patient's\n   family [members] against the infectious disease, conveyance of an affirmative indication that contact with the infected patient is not risky, and failure to take other reasonable measures to prevent exposure to the patient with the communicable disease; additional indicia of negligence, including failure to use standard available tests for diagnosing a patient's infectious disease, failure to interpret diagnostic test results correctly, and failure to diagnose the patient's infectious disease; and harm to a third-party plaintiff as shown by the third party's illness from exposure to the physician's infectious patient.\" T.

First, although we continue to recognize the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship and the need to exercise \"restraint when presented with opportunities to extend the duty of health care providers to persons who are not their patients\";\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we also recognize that such concerns are at their nadir, and a physician's broader public health obligations are at their zenith, with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Throughout history, both medical organizations and government entities have recognized not only the critical role that physicians play in combatting the spread of contagious diseases such as STDs, but also the concomitant fact that, in diagnosing and treating such diseases, a physician's duties and loyalties necessarily must be divided between the patient and other people whom the patient may infect. See generally L. Gostin &amp; J. Hodge, supra, 5 Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Policy 9. For example, \"one of the earliest recorded public health strategies for STD prevention was to pierce the veil of\n   secrecy surrounding these hidden diseases by notifying sexual partners ... of infected patients ....\" Id., 11. \"Often known collectively as the 'duty to warn,' these [judicially imposed, common-law] obligations subsequently have been codified by many state legislatures.\" Id., 12. For example, partner notification measures were broadly implemented during the 1930s in an effort to control and eradicate the syphilis epidemic. Id., 21. Many states continue to operate provider based partner referral programs under which health care providers are responsible for contacting, on a confidential basis,\n   the sexual partners of patients diagnosed with various STDs. See id., 27-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Indeed, even the American Medical Association (AMA), one of the amici supporting the defendant's position, which argues against the imposition of a third-party duty under these circumstances, has recognized that, \"[a]lthough physicians' primary ethical obligation is to their individual patients\"; American Medical Association, Code of Medical Ethics (2017) opinion 8.4, p. 128; they also have a responsibility \"to protect and promote the health of the public.\" Id., opinion 8.1, p. 125. \"[P]hysicians must balance dual responsibilities to promote the welfare and confidentiality of the individual patient and to protect public safety.\" Id., opinion 8.2, p. 126. The AMA has further observed that a physician's \"long-recognized\" professional responsibilities to nonpatients are especially pronounced in the context of infectious disease, for which professional standards of care demand that a physician not only treat his or her own patients competently, but also go so far as to \"[p]articipate in implementing scientifically and ethically sound quarantine and isolation measures in keeping with the duty to provide care in epidemics.\" Id., opinion 8.4, p. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As we noted, the principle that a physician's duty to protect the broader public health and to help to deter\n   the spread of contagious diseases at times transcends the physician's duty to his or her individual patient has long been codified in federal and state law. See, e.g., L. Gostin &amp; J. Hodge, supra, 5 Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Policy 58. Connecticut is no exception in this respect. Our legislature has, for example, enacted laws that require physicians to test pregnant patients for syphilis and HIV; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-90 ; require health care providers to report certain communicable diseases to local and state public health officials; General Statutes \u00a7 19a-215 ; and permit physicians to warn, or to disclose confidential patient information for the purpose of warning, a known partner of a patient who has been diagnosed with an HIV infection or related disease. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-584 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Perhaps most notably, since 2006, both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the AMA have approved the use of so-called expedited partner therapy programs to combat the spread of STDs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Expedited partner therapy \"is the delivery of medications or prescriptions by persons infected with an STD to their sex partners without clinical assessment of the partners\"; in accordance with this protocol, \"[c]linicians ... provide patients with sufficient medications directly or via prescription for the patients and their partners.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AMA has authorized the use of expedited partner therapy even though that approach to treating STDs \"potentially abrogates the standard informed consent process, compromises continuity of care for patients' partners, encroaches [on] the privacy of patients and their partners, increases the possibility of harm by a medical or allergic reaction, leaves other diseases or complications undiagnosed,\n   and may violate state practice laws.\" American Medical Association, supra, opinion 8.9, p. 132. In other words, the medical profession has formed the judgment that the need to\n   stem the spread of STDs is so great, and the traditional physician-patient model so inadequate therefor, that an exception to the prevailing standard of care should be drawn so that physicians can provide treatment to third parties who are not their patients. Our legislature has embraced this novel approach, allowing practitioners to dispense oral antibiotic drugs to the sexual partners of patients who have been diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea, two kinds of STDs, without first physically examining the partners. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-14e (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We recognize that none of these laws directly applies to herpes. This presumably reflects in part the fact that that disease is not curable at present, and, thus, the sexual partners of patients infected with herpes would not be candidates for programs such as expedited partner therapy. At the same time, the fact that herpes is incurable highlights the extent to which a physician's duties in a case such as this run to third parties as well as to the patient, as it will be the patient's potential sexual partners who are the most direct beneficiaries of the diagnosis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Perhaps more than in any other field of medicine, then, the duty of care that a physician owes to his or her patient in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious and sexually transmitted diseases also, necessarily,\n   entails some duty to third parties who are likely to contract the disease from the patient. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania explained, \"[c]ommunicable diseases are so named because they are readily spread from person to person. Physicians are the first line of defense against the spread of communicable diseases, because physicians know what measures must be taken to prevent the infection of others. The patient must be advised to take certain sanitary measures, or to remain quarantined for a period of time, or to practice sexual abstinence or what is commonly referred to as safe sex.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DiMarco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lynch Homes-Chester County, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1823711\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/525/558/#p563\">\n    525 Pa. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1823696,1823733,1823711\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/583/422/\">\n    583 A.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Reisner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Regents of the University of California\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1125780\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/31/1195/#p1200\">\n    31 Cal.

Although the plaintiff contends that the defendant owed her a duty of care as an identifiable potential victim who foreseeably would rely on the\n   accuracy of his diagnosis, her argument is that that duty would have been\n   fully satisfied if the defendant simply had provided the accurate test results to Smith, his patient. In other words, the defendant was under no obligation to contact the plaintiff, to otherwise ensure that she was made aware of Smith's test results, or to do anything other than fulfill his undisputed professional obligation to accurately convey his patient's test results to the patient himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The concerns of the dissent that our decision in this case will somehow result in the disclosure of confidential medical information are, therefore, wholly unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In conclusion, we think that it is beyond cavil that physicians such as the defendant owe some duty of care to third parties when diagnosing and treating a patient who suffers from an STD. We do not believe that imposing the duty for which the plaintiff advocates would intrude on the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship. Indeed, the duty at issue here-simply to accurately relay the patient's test results to the patient-is far more limited and less intrusive than the public health reporting and partner notification requirements that have been imposed on physicians in the context of diagnosing and treating infectious diseases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The second set of factors that governs our analysis relates to the purposes of the tort compensation system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[T]he fundamental policy purposes of the tort compensation system [are] compensation of innocent parties, shifting the loss to responsible parties or distributing it among appropriate entities, and deterrence of wrongful conduct ....

An equally compelling function of the tort system is the prophylactic factor of preventing future harm .... The courts are concerned not only with compensation of the victim, but with admonition of the wrongdoer.... [Of course] [i]mposing liability for consequential damages often creates significant risks of affecting conduct in ways that are undesirable as a matter of policy. Before imposing such liability, it is incumbent [on] us to consider those risks.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 599-600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, these factors also weigh strongly in favor of imposing a duty on health care providers to identifiable and foreseeable third-party victims such as the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, we observe that, if the defendant is not held liable to the plaintiff under these circumstances, then, in all likelihood,\n   she will be without remedy or compensation for her injuries. It is doubtful, for example, that the plaintiff could recover in negligence from Smith, who acted responsibly in seeking regular STD testing and did not have sexual contact with her until he was possessed of a reasonable, good faith belief that he was free of STDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The trial court, while recognizing \"the absence of any other source of compensation for the [plaintiff's] harm,\" apparently concluded that this factor was mitigated by (1) the fact that \"the cost of medical treatment likely\n   would be covered by health insurance,\" and (2) the plaintiff's ability to engage in \"self-protective measures ....\" The dissent also is of the view that the plaintiff is not without recourse because she \"may well be covered by public or private health insurance policies ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   There is nothing in the record to support the pure speculation that the plaintiff had, or will continue to have, adequate health insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor do we think it is appropriate to expect ordinary health insurance policies, or taxpayers, to bear the costs of a physician's negligence. Medical malpractice policies exist to spread such costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In any event, the availability of insurance will be of little consolation to the plaintiff, insofar as genital herpes is presently an incurable disease. E.g., E. Moore, Encyclopedia of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (2005) p. 135; Mosby's Medical Dictionary (8th Ed. 2009) p. 872. We must assume that, for the remainder of her life, the plaintiff will suffer periodic outbreaks of painful blisters or ulcers associated with the virus. See, e.g., E. Moore, supra, pp. 132-33. Her desirability as a potential romantic partner may be diminished. And, if she should become pregnant, she will have to contend with the risk that she may transmit the virus to her newborn child. See, e.g., id., p. 135. Some of these injuries will not be covered-or may not be adequately covered-by medical insurance, and we ought not pretend otherwise. Only the defendant can compensate the plaintiff for these losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With respect to \"self-protective measures,\" we presume that the trial court was referring to the fact that,\n   notwithstanding Smith's apparently negative STD test results, the plaintiff could have further reduced the risk that she would contract an STD either by using prophylactics or abstaining from intercourse with Smith altogether. Even if we were to assume, for the sake of argument, that it would be reasonable and right to expect couples, such as the plaintiff and Smith, to abstain from sexual intimacy, or to consistently practice safe sex while dating, that would only push back the problem. At some point, their relationship could have progressed to a point at which they would have married and consummated their union. At that point, a wedding band would not have been proof against the defendant's negligence. See\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pizarro\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11817095\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/713/1036/\">\n    713 So. 2d at 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (STD was misdiagnosed prior to courtship, and sexual partner was diagnosed after marriage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Second, the flip side of the coin is that, if the plaintiff cannot hold the defendant responsible for his alleged negligence, then errors of this sort will go unadmonished. Patients such as Smith are unlikely to have incurred any legally cognizable damages\n   as a result of an incorrect test report and, therefore, may be unable to recover from a defendant physician. We recognize that not every wrong is compensable in tort and that losses, even unjust losses, sometimes must be allowed to lie where fate has cast them. See\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under these circumstances, however, imposing third-party liability would play an important role in spurring physicians such as the defendant to take greater care in reporting STD lab results. As the California Court of Appeal recognized in\n   <em>\n    Reisner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Regents of the University of California\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1125780\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/31/1195/#p1200\">\n    31 Cal.

Holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff would create such an incentive and deter the careless misreporting of STD test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The trial court, while recognizing that imposing third-party liability under these circumstances could play an important deterrent function and help control the insidious spread of STDs, expressed concern over what it saw as potentially unforeseen consequences. The court speculated, for instance, that physicians themselves might feel compelled to discuss lab results with their patients, which could be more costly and less efficient than relying on nurses or office staff to relay results. We do not find this concern compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A patient who seeks medical attention to be tested for a disease, any disease, has a reasonable expectation that the test results will be reported accurately, by whatever means. See, e.g., L. Casalino et al., \"Frequency of Failure To Inform Patients of Clinically Significant Outpatient Test Results,\" 169 Archives Internal Med. 1123, 1123 (2009) (\"[f]ailures to inform patients of abnormal test results ... are common and legally indefensible factors in malpractice claims\"). The risks and costs associated with misinforming a patient that he does not have a particular disease can be dramatic. Those include the direct costs to the patient and the health care system, as when, for example, treatment of a serious illness such as cancer is irremediably delayed, or, as in the present case, through the inadvertent infection of third parties by a patient who falsely believes that he is free of STDs. Holding health care providers responsible for errors of the sort alleged will help to maintain public trust in the reliability of the STD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   reporting system and, therefore, encourage continued participation in this important public health regimen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Of course, it ultimately will be for the jury to determine whether a reasonable health care provider would have reported Smith's test results differently, whether through direct physician-to-patient communications or through the use of additional fail-safes and quality assurance measures. But we certainly are not prepared to say, as a matter of law, that, whatever added costs might be entailed by a quick telephone call or a letter from one's physician, or a policy requiring office staff\n   to double check that they are reporting test results accurately, they are too onerous relative to the human, financial, and public health costs associated with a false negative report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Reisner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Regents of the University of California\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1125780\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/31/1195/#p1200\">\n    31 Cal.

In this era of technologized medicine, the conveyance of lab results is a regular and central component of a physician's professional duties. The physician has exclusive access to the original lab results, until such time as they\n   are shared with or conveyed to the\n   patient. As between the defendant, on the one hand, who can avoid errors of this sort simply by double checking the results before or after speaking with the patient; see L. Casalino et al., supra, 169 Archives Internal Med. 1123 (discussing \"relatively simple\" best practices); and Smith and the plaintiff, on the other, who could ensure that the plaintiff remained free of STDs only by permanently abstaining from intimate contact,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   a jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant was the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm at the lowest cost and, therefore, should bear the costs of the loss. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rodi Yachts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    National Marine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516573\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/984/880/#p883\">\n    984 F.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883-84, 888 (7th Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the same time, physicians such as the defendant can most readily bear and spread through malpractice insurance the costs associated with errors of the sort alleged. We are not convinced that such errors are both so prevalent and so ineluctable that imposing third-party liability, solely with respect to identifiable victims, will meaningfully impact insurance rates or overall health care costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, we conclude that\n   the relevant policy considerations weigh heavily in favor of allowing liability under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   5\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, we address two concerns that the defendant and certain of the amici\n   have raised and that the trial court found compelling. First is the slippery slope issue. The trial court observed, and we agree, that, \"[i]n a sense, [the] plaintiff's complaint identifies a best case scenario ....\" That is to say, the plaintiff and Smith were involved in an exclusive romantic relationship at the time Smith sought STD testing, Smith informed the defendant that he was seeking testing for the benefit and protection of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff subsequently agreed to engage in sexual relations with Smith in reliance on the test results as reported to Smith. This means that the defendant's potential liability for negligently misreporting Smith's test results extended to at most one nonpatient third party, a party of whose existence\n   the defendant was aware at the time of treatment, who could foreseeably contract a contagious STD if an erroneous negative test result were reported, and to whom he owed no independent duty beyond the duty already owed to Smith to accurately report his test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Nevertheless, the trial court expressed concerns that imposing a duty under these limited circumstances could open the floodgates. For example, the court questioned whether, if Smith had been dating multiple women at the time, or later began to date other women, with whom Smith had not discussed STDs, the defendant would owe a duty to a large and ill-defined class of potential plaintiffs. The trial court also questioned whether, under different circumstances, a physician such as the defendant might feel compelled to question a patient regarding his sexual partners, or to contact those partners to discuss the patient's STD status, or at least to ensure that the patient accurately relayed the test results to all of his sexual partners. Finally, the court questioned whether it makes sense to make liability hinge on the sort of mutual STD testing arrangement to which the plaintiff and Smith agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Beginning with the last point, we emphasize that the defendant's liability does not hinge on the fact that Smith and the plaintiff entered into a mutual testing agreement. The alleged fact that Smith sought and obtained STD testing at the time could become relevant at trial only insofar as it would support the plaintiff's theory of causation, that is, that she was free of STDs until she became intimate with Smith during or after July, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Beyond that, we emphasize that the duty that we recognize today is quite limited. It extends only to identifiable third parties who are engaged in an exclusive romantic relationship with a patient at the time of testing and, therefore, may foreseeably be exposed to any\n   STD that a physician fails to diagnose or properly report. And the physician fully satisfies that third-party duty simply by treating\n   <em>\n    the patient\n   </em>\n   according to the prevailing standard of care and accurately informing\n   <em>\n    the patient\n   </em>\n   of the relevant test results.

Whether there are other, broader circumstances under which a physician may be held to owe a duty of care to a nonpatient third party who foreseeably contracts an infectious disease as a result of the physician's negligence is a question that we need not resolve today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Nor, as we have discussed, are we overly concerned that our recognition of a duty under the specific circumstances of this case will create a flood of litigation, increase insurance costs, or discourage physicians from offering STD testing. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bolieu\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sisters of Providence in Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850952\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/953/1233/#p1239\">\n    953 P.2d at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The amici supporting the defendant's position\n   have given us no reason to believe that errors of the sort alleged are commonplace or that they cannot readily be avoided by cost-effective quality assurance measures. As the California Court of Appeal explained in rejecting such arguments, \"[a]rguments premised on opened floodgates and broken dams are not persuasive [when] ... we suspect that only a few drops of water may spill onto a barren desert.\"\n   <em>\n    Reisner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Regents of the University of California\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1125780\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/31/1195/#p1200\">\n    31 Cal.

And, of course, if the legislature perceives differently the risk that conferring standing on individuals such as the plaintiff will result in a health care funding crisis, then nothing bars that body from imposing whatever restrictions it deems prudent on common-law actions of this sort.\n   Second, we do not share the trial court's concern that recognizing a third-party cause of action for negligent misreporting of STD test results would be impracticable. The court reasoned that, in many such instances, a patient such as Smith and an alleged victim such as the plaintiff will no longer be romantically involved by the time an action reaches the trial stage and, therefore, that key evidence-the patient's medical records-may not be available. The court noted that federal and state privacy laws could bar a plaintiff from obtaining and presenting such records without the patient's consent and that the patient might have little incentive to disclose such records to a former partner and have his or her medical and sexual history become part of the public record. The court also appeared to suggest that, in cases in which the patient does cooperate with the plaintiff, the patient might agree to selectively provide only those records that supported the plaintiff's case, leaving the physician unable to defend himself or herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Although we do not discount the possibility that the concerns that the trial court raises could present logistical hurdles in some other case, those hypothetical challenges do not counsel against allowing the plaintiff to hold the defendant accountable in a case such as this, in which the plaintiff apparently will have full access to the medical records necessary to put on her case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Jacoby\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brinckerhoff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237115\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/86/#p96\">\n    250 Conn. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20347\">\n    735 A.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"evidentiary constraints at trial do not, themselves, affect the sufficiency of a stated cause of action ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court incorrectly concluded that, as a matter of law, the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff\n   with respect to the reporting of Smith's STD test results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In this opinion D'AURIA, MULLINS and VERTE-FEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   ROBINSON, C.J., with whom McDONALD and KAHN, J., join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that Connecticut physicians, with respect to the diagnosis and reporting of their patients' sexually transmitted disease (STD) test results, owe a direct duty of care to \"identifiable third parties who are engaged in an exclusive romantic relationship with a patient at the time of testing and, therefore, may foreseeably be exposed to any STD that a physician fails to diagnose or properly report.\" In my view, the majority's conclusion is inconsistent with our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590-91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), in which we deemed three principal considerations to be especially pertinent in determining what, if any, duty of care is owed by a medical professional to a nonpatient third party, specifically (1) Connecticut precedent, (2) the foreseeability of the alleged harm, and (3) public policy considerations.

Finally, the same concerns we voiced in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   concerning interference with the physician-patient relationship and an increase in litigation are present in this case, and are discussed more fully subsequently in this dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   I now move to the four specific factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   . \"Starting with the expectations of the parties, long established common-law principles hold that physicians owe a duty to their patients because of their special relationship, not to third persons with whom they have no relationship. Furthermore, there is no state statute or regulation that imposes a duty on health care providers to warn a patient for the benefit of the public.\" Id., at 603-604,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is unlikely that a person harmed in the manner that this plaintiff was harmed would expect to be compensated by the physician, with whom he or she has no special relationship, in light of the privileged status of the physician-patient relationship and the common-law protections granted to physicians. Consequently, the normal expectations of the parties weigh against recognition of a duty in the present case, as they did in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Turning to the public policy of encouraging participation in the activity under review, recognizing a duty of care under the circumstances of this case \"would be inconsistent with the physician's duty of loyalty to the patient, would threaten the inherent confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship and would impermissibly intrude on the physician's professional judgment regarding treatment and care of the patient.\" Id., at 606,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, \"[u]nlike most duties, the physician's duty to the patient is explicitly relational: physicians owe a duty of care to\n   <em>\n    patients\n   </em>\n   .... Mindful of this principle, we have recognized on more than one occasion the physician's duty of undivided loyalty to the patient ... and\n   the patient's corresponding loyalty, trust and dependence on the professional opinions and advice of the physician.... Undivided loyalty means that the patient's well-being must be of paramount importance in the mind of the physician. Indeed, this is the foundation for the patient's reciprocal loyalty, trust and dependence on the physician's medical treatment and advice. Consistent with this view, we have stated that, [a]s a matter of public policy ... the law should encourage medical care providers ... to devote their efforts to their patients ... and not be obligated to divert their attention to the possible consequences to [third parties] of medical treatment of the patient.... It is ... the consequences to the patient, and not to other persons, of deviations from the appropriate standard of medical care that should be the central concern of medical practitioners....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \"Extending a health care provider's duty also would threaten the confidentiality inherent in the physician-patient relationship because lawsuits alleging a breach of the duty would compel the use of confidential patient records by defending physicians. The principle of confidentiality lies at the heart of the physician-patient relationship and has been recognized by our legislature. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o was enacted in 1990; see Public Acts 1990, No. 90-177; to address the need to protect the confidentiality of communications in order to foster the free exchange of information from patient to physician .... The statute provides that a health care provider shall not disclose patient information in their files without the patient's explicit consent. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o (a). Thus, when a patient decides to bring a claim against a health care provider, the patient makes a purposeful decision to waive confidentiality.... Subsection (b) (2) of \u00a7 52-146o, however, contains an exception whereby patient consent is not required for the disclosure of communications\n   or records by a health care provider against whom a claim has been made. Consequently, if [an injured third party] files an action against the health care provider of [a patient], records containing the patient's medical history will very likely be disclosed in court and subjected to public scrutiny. The effect of expanding the duty of a health care provider in this fashion cannot be underestimated. Physician-patient confidentiality is described as a privilege .... When that confidentiality is diminished to any degree, it necessarily affects the ability of the parties to communicate, which in turn affects the ability of the physician to render proper medical care and advice. Accordingly, it is not in the public interest to extend the duty of health care providers to third persons in the present context because doing so would jeopardize the confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted; emphasis\n   altered; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 606-609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Connecticut state law reflects additional patient confidentiality concerns that militate against the recognition of a duty in the present case. State law demonstrates the overarching primacy of patient confidentiality, even\n   in this context of infectious disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Connecticut has a communicable disease reporting system and a list of specific diseases and conditions that physicians are required to report to public health officials. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-36-A2 (requiring Commissioner of Public Health to issue list of reportable diseases); see also Connecticut Department of Public Health, \"Reportable Diseases, Emergency Illnesses and Health Conditions, and Reportable Laboratory Findings Changes for 2019,\" 39 Conn. Epidemiologist 1 (2019) (list of reportable diseases). The reporting is made by physicians to the public health authority, but it is government officials who may act on the information and intervene with any third parties, not the reporting physician. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-215 (d). Put differently, the physician has no statutory duty vis-\u00e0-vis any third party beyond merely reporting the disease or condition to the appropriate authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Another instructive example of the legislature's concern for confidentiality can be seen in Connecticut's HIV laws, upon which the majority relies for the proposition that physicians' public health obligations may transcend their duties to individual patients, observing that the state \"permit[s] physicians to warn, or to disclose confidential patient information for the purpose of warning, a known partner of a patient who has been diagnosed with an HIV infection or related disease.\" The HIV statute is protective of confidentiality insofar as it does not permit a physician to directly inform a sexual partner\n   about a patient's HIV test results under circumstances similar to this case. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-584 (b) (physician may only directly inform known partner if both partner and patient are under physician's care or if patient has requested it). Although the majority's opinion does not impose a duty to warn on physicians under the circumstances of this case, the overarching emphasis placed on confidentiality by the legislature, including the legislature's decision not to impose further statutory duties on physicians to warn under similar circumstances,\n   coupled with the threat that confidential records may be disclosed in litigation without the patient's consent, suggest that imposition of a duty under the circumstances of this case is incongruous with the legislature's repeated emphasis on patient confidentiality. Put plainly, recognizing a duty under the circumstances of this case endangers participation in the activity under review because it interferes with physicians' duty of loyalty to their patients and threatens the sanctity of physician-patient confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Moving to the avoidance of the increased risk of litigation, the Department of Public Health has published STD reporting statistics for 2015 that indicate approximately 13,269 reported cases of Chlamydia, 2,092 reported cases of Gonorrhea, and 99 reported cases of Syphilis that year. Connecticut Department of Public Health, \"Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Primary and Secondary Syphilis Cases Reported by Town,\" (2015), available at https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/infectious_diseases/std/Table12015pdf (last visited July 11, 2019). Assuming that each of those individuals was in an exclusive sexual relationship, there would have been 15,460 additional individuals to whom physicians may have owed a duty under the majority's opinion in the present case. This increase in the risk of litigation threatens more than just the pocketbooks of physicians and their insurers;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   it threatens patient care. A likely consequence of this expansion of liability is that physicians will be reticent to discuss their patients' romantic relationships or sexual behavior in an attempt to avoid identifying third parties to whom the physician could be liable, despite such an approach not necessarily being in the patient's best interests. This reaction, referred to as \"defensive medicine\" in medical literature, involves physicians altering treatment and advice as part of an effort to avoid liability, and it is considered to have very negative and costly effects on the provision of health care. See J. Greenberg &amp; J. Green, \"Over-testing: Why More Is Not Better,\" 127 Am. J. Med. 362, 362-63 (2014); M. Mello et al., \"National Costs of the Medical Liability System,\" 29 Health Aff. 1569, 1572 (2010); see also B. Nahed et al., \"Malpractice Liability and Defensive Medicine: A National Survey of Neurosurgeons,\" (2012), p. 4, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3382203/pdf/pone.0039237.pdf (last visited July 11, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   An additional concern is the effect that an expansion of the potential liability of physicians is likely to have on malpractice insurance rates. Connecticut health care professionals cannot obtain a license to practice medicine without showing that they have adequate malpractice insurance. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-11b (a). If insurance premiums for physicians increase to an unaffordable level, physicians may leave the practice of medicine or, at the least, stop offering the services that instigate such high premiums. An instructive example of this concern is the early 2000s crisis in the field of obstetrics. \"Soaring malpractice insurance costs led to the closings of trauma and maternity wards across the country [and] forced many obstetricians to give up obstetrics, restrict services, deny certain high-risk patients, become consultants, relocate, retire early, or abandon their practices all together.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   S. Domin, \" Where Have All the Baby-Doctors Gone?

U. L. Rev. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499-500 (2004). The threat of something similar happening in Connecticut requires that we exercise caution, particularly in an area where the potential consequences are\n   such that the legislature is in a better position to address these concerns than our courts are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Indeed, this is an issue on which the legislature has previously acted. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   , part of the impetus behind the enactment of our medical malpractice statute, \u00a7 52-190a, was \"to put some measure of control on what was perceived as a crisis in medical malpractice insurance rates.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Jarmie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troncale\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n    306 Conn. at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n    50 A.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One such measure of control, the requirement that an opinion letter issued by a similar health care provider be attached to a medical negligence complaint, was suggested by the General Assembly's Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee after it conducted hearings following a significant increase in medical malpractice insurance rates in the early 2000s. See Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Connecticut General Assembly, Medical Malpractice Insurance Rates (December 2003). Because the majority's opinion recognizes a duty to potentially thousands of new plaintiffs, which is very likely to have an impact on medical malpractice rates, this court should not throw caution to the wind and take such action when the legislature is in a much better position to investigate the issue, and make findings and recommendations on the subject, as it has done in similar circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Given that the legislature has acted extensively in the areas of both STD reporting and to provide physicians relief from professional liability, I am hesitant to\n   usurp its \"primary responsibility for formulating public policy\" by recognizing a new duty to third party nonpatients. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mayer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p780\">\n    325 Conn. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p780\">\n    160 A.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

Thus, I disagree with the majority's decision to adopt a duty in the present case that will expand the pool of potential litigants, increase the risk of litigation, and threaten access to and the quality of patient care in this state-in contravention of legislative action on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Finally, turning to decisions of other jurisdictions, I note that there is no clear trend in our sister courts that supports usurping the legislature's responsibility for public policy and creating the duty that the majority recognizes in the present case.

Indeed, aside from one brief footnote, the dissent, which quotes heavily from\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    , barely acknowledges that the present case raises a fundamentally different question-the third-party liability of a medical professional with respect to the misreporting of a sexually transmitted disease-than that at issue in\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    or any of our previous cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    As we explain more fully hereinafter, it is beyond cavil that both the law and the medical profession impose broader and different duties on physicians, duties that extend beyond the confines of the physician-patient relationship, with respect to the diagnosis of STDs and other infectious diseases. Of course, it is not unreasonable to take the position, as the dissent has, that, for reasons of public policy, we never should impose on physicians any duties beyond those established by the legislature. We think it would be a mistake, however, for this court to simply conclude that\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    disposes of the issue presented in this case without carefully evaluating the fundamentally distinct considerations that characterize the context of communicable diseases.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    We recognize that there could be cases in which a dispute arises over whether the plaintiff is in fact the individual who was identifiable as a potential victim prior to the occurrence of negligence-if, for example, the defendant had argued that the plaintiff was not in fact the exclusive girlfriend of whom he was made aware when Smith sought STD testing. Because the defendant has not made that argument in the present case, for present purposes, the identity of the plaintiff as the identifiable victim is not in question.

This argument proves too much.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The entire dissent is predicated on the concern that any recognition that physicians have duties to third parties will compromise the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship, jeopardize the confidentiality of patient records, promote unnecessary defensive medicine, and bring about higher insurance rates and health care costs, driving doctors out of practice and adversely affecting patient care. As we have explained, however; see part I B of this opinion; medical malpractice claims are those that go to the core of the physician-patient relationship: physicians are sued in their capacities as medical professionals, on the basis of the specialized medical care of a patient, involving the exercise of medical judgment. If nonpatient third parties can have standing to prosecute claims of\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    sort, as\n    <em>\n     Squeo\n    </em>\n    says they can, then, a fortiori, allowing them to bring claims sounding in ordinary negligence need not intrude on the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship.

Specifically, one-if not the primary-reason that patients seek to be tested for diseases such as herpes is to be able to represent to a potential sexual partner that they are disease free. Accordingly, the dissent's fear that physicians will be liable to third parties for the improper diagnosis of conditions such as chicken pox, influenza, or the measles is unfounded. See footnote 9 of the dissenting opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    The dissent's position appears to be that, if the defendant's duty to the plaintiff is no more than the duty he owes to Smith to accurately report the test results, then holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff as well as Smith \"would not reduce the potential for harm because health care providers would be required to do no more than they already must do to fulfill their duty to patients.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Setting aside the fact that increasing a physician's potential liability will presumably increase his or her incentive to avoid negligent errors of the type alleged, the present case is readily distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    , from which the dissent draws the quoted language. In the present case, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    , which involved an automobile accident caused by the defendant physician's patient, Smith himself is unlikely to have any cause of action against the defendant, insofar as there is no indication that he suffered legally cognizable damages. Accordingly, the defendant will face potential liability only to an identifiable third-party victim such as the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    We note that \"[m]any people in Connecticut are currently without health insurance, usually because they think they [cannot] afford it, are unemployed or are at higher risk due to [preexisting] conditions.\" Insurance for the Uninsured, available at http://www.cthealthchannel.org/individuals/group-health-insurance/insurance-for-the-uninsured/ (last visited July 5, 2019).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    In order to prevent the spread of genital herpes, the CDC recommends that individuals take exactly the precautions taken by the plaintiff in the present case: \"The surest way to avoid transmission of STDs, including genital herpes, is to abstain from sexual contact,\n    <em>\n     or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested for STDs and is known to be uninfected\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.)

The Department of Public Health also has recognized that encouraging sexually active individuals to seek regular STD testing is a high public health priority. See Connecticut Department of Public Health, Press Release, Department of Public Health Urges Residents To Be Tested for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (April 28, 2010), available at https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Press-Room/Press-Releases---2010/April-2010/Department-of-Public-Health-Urges-Residents-To-Be-Tested-for-Sexually-Transmitted-Diseases (last visited July 5, 2019).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    We disagree with the dissent that the legally relevant question is whether \"a person harmed in the manner that this plaintiff was harmed would expect to be compensated by the physician ....\" Clearly, the plaintiff expected there was some reasonable possibility that the defendant would be held accountable, or she would not have brought the present action. Equally clearly, she could not have had a high degree of confidence in a favorable result, as no Connecticut court had previously recognized such a duty. When the issue is, as a question of first impression, whether a previously unrecognized common-law duty should be recognized, it makes little sense (and is circular) for the result to hinge on whether a layperson accurately would predict that an appellate court would rule in her favor. The salient question in this case, rather, is whether a person in the plaintiff's position reasonably would expect that a physician would adopt an STD test result reporting protocol with an eye toward the potentially serious harm that could befall a patient's exclusive sexual partner if a negative result should be erroneously reported.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    It may well be that the steady march of technology already has rendered purely academic the trial court's concerns, as many patients now are able to view their test results directly through online electronic portals. See Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, ONC Data Brief No. 40 (April, 2018) pp. 1, 6, available at https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-04/HINTS-2017-Consumer-Data-Brief-april-2018.pdf (last visited July 5, 2019) (stating that, as of 2017, 52 percent of individuals were offered online access to their medical records, and that lab results were most frequently accessed information).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    The dissent speculates that recognizing a third-party duty under these circumstances will lead physicians such as the defendant to engage in costly defensive medicine, which could raise the cost of health care. The dissent does not contend, however, that recognizing such a duty will lead to the unnecessary use of expensive medical tests or other modalities typically associated with defensive medicine. Rather, the defensive medicine that a physician may embrace under these circumstances is the avoidance of asking a patient to identify his or her sexual partner or asking whether he or she is seeking STD testing for the purpose of informing future sexual partners of the results.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    We think that there is little realistic risk that physicians will alter their standards of care when errors of the sort alleged can be so easily and economically avoided by adopting simple quality control measures and exercising reasonable diligence. In any event, we fail to understand the harm that would result if a physician did not go out of his or her way to specifically identify a patient's sexual partner.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    We note that herpes may be transmitted by forms of intimate contact other than intercourse. See, e.g., 1 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (A. Fauci et al. eds., 14th Ed. 1998) p. 1085.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The dissent posits that our decision could have a significant impact on the health care system because more than 15,000 new STDs are diagnosed in Connecticut each year and,\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n    we assume that each newly infected individual was involved in an exclusive sexual relationship, then their more than 15,000 partners all represent potential plaintiffs. This argument falters on many levels.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Not surprisingly, having multiple and/or anonymous sexual partners is among the primary risk factors for contracting STDs. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, STDs and HIV-CDC Fact Sheet (Detailed Version), available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/hiv/stdfact-std-hiv-detailed.htm (last visited July 5, 2019); see also L. Finer et al., \"Sexual Partnership Patterns as a Behavioral Risk Factor for Sexually Transmitted Diseases,\" 31 Fam. Plan. Persp. 228, 228-30 (1999). By contrast, if an individual is engaged in a truly and mutually monogamous relationship, then he or she is unlikely to contract an STD other than from his or her partner (who would not, in that scenario, be a potential plaintiff in a case such as this). Accordingly, the dissent's assumption that each of the more than 15,000 individuals who contracted an STD in Connecticut in 2015 was involved in an exclusive sexual relationship seems highly implausible. Nor is there any reason to believe that a significant percentage of STD test results are inaccurately reported to the patient.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Moreover, we note that, of the more than 15,000 new cases of selected STDs to which the dissent refers, the vast majority of them consist of chlamydia and, to a lesser extent, gonorrhea ; see Connecticut Department of Public Health, STD Statistics in Connecticut, available at http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3136&amp;q=388500 (last visited July 5, 2019); diseases that, unlike herpes, are readily treatable with antibiotics. See, e.g., E. Moore, supra, pp. 77, 107-109. Accordingly, even for the fraction of new STD cases that might involve an identifiable victim, in a newly exclusive relationship, who would become infected as a result of an erroneous test report, the vast majority would suffer minimal damages and would be unlikely to go to the trouble of bringing a legal action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    In sum, there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the present case is anything other than a singularity, let alone a harbinger of thousands of future legal actions. For example, there is no indication that other jurisdictions that have allowed such actions to proceed have experienced a spike in medical malpractice rates, and we are aware of no evidence to support the dissent's warning that such an increase is \"very likely\" in this state.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Both parties have represented that Smith executed authorizations allowing the plaintiff to obtain and use his medical records for purposes of this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Moreover, as in all cases, trial courts are free to take reasonable measures in mitigation of any such problems.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    Lest there be any confusion, we emphasize that the existence of a third-party duty with respect to the accurate reporting of STD test results does not hinge on whether a patient and a victim remain romantically involved or whether the patient agrees to cooperate in the victim's legal action.

Because I do not agree that principles of negligent misrepresentation support recognizing a direct duty of care owed by physicians to nonpatients, I respectfully disagree with this portion of part II B 1 of the majority's opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The majority relies on\n    <em>\n     Squeo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Norwalk Hospital Assn.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20558\">\n     316 Conn. 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20932\">\n     113 A.3d 932\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015), to bolster its argument that Connecticut precedent is \"unsettled with respect to the particular question presented here.\" That case is, however, distinguishable.

The majority effectively uses\n    <em>\n     Squeo\n    </em>\n    as evidence that we have already stepped through the door left open in\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    , and, \"if our decision in\n    <em>\n     Squeo\n    </em>\n    has not resulted in the parade of horribles that the dissent invokes ... then we can have some reassurance that the alarmist warnings in the present case will be no more prescient.\" As I argue subsequently in this dissenting opinion, the public policy concerns implicated in the context of STDs apply with equal or greater force to any number of different infectious diseases, a contention the majority disputes. Just as the majority relies on\n    <em>\n     Squeo\n    </em>\n    to support an expansion of liability under the circumstances of the present case, this court may subsequently rely on today's decision as a precedent to support further expansions of liability in other contexts. Because I find the majority's efforts to distinguish STDs from other infectious diseases in the context of the present case unavailing, I see it as unlikely that, in the future, the Connecticut Bar or even the courts of this state will view the precedential value of today's decision as limited to STDs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    I disagree with the majority's observation that, despite quoting \"heavily\" from\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    , I \"barely [acknowledge]\" that the present case raises a different question than the one at issue in\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    . I believe my agreement with the majority's observation that\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    left open the possibility that a duty may exist in a case where the victim is identifiable is acknowledgment enough that this case cannot be simply disposed of under\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    The majority further states that \"it would be a mistake ... to simply conclude that\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    disposes of the issue presented in this case without carefully evaluating the fundamentally distinct considerations that characterize the context of communicable diseases.\" I take no issue with that statement. In fact, the standard articulated by\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    requires evaluation of policy considerations. The majority and I have each evaluated the policy considerations, and conclude differently as to whether they militate in favor of or in opposition to recognition of a duty in this case. In essence, the majority believes certain policy concerns are so strong that this court should walk through the door left open in\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    . I, however, would stop at the threshold of that doorway.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    I further emphasize that the majority misunderstands this dissent as standing for my belief \"that, for reasons of public policy, we\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    should impose on physicians any duties beyond those established by the legislature.\" (Emphasis added.) Instead, I take the position that, when, as in the present case, our court is so deeply divided as to whether public policy concerns support recognition of a legal duty, and when the implications of such recognition of a duty may be so vast, the legislature is in a far better position to make such a determination given its institutional advantages with respect to considering and receiving evidence as to matters of public policy.

As noted previously, this court explicitly concluded that, \"although there is no directly comparable Connecticut case law on which to rely, our precedent, in general, does not support extending the duty of care ... because, with one limited exception that does not apply ... we repeatedly have declined, in a variety of situations, to extend the duty of health care providers to persons who are not their patients.\"\n    <em>\n     Jarmie\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Troncale\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20578\">\n     306 Conn. at 593\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20802\">\n     50 A.3d 802\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The majority contends, however, that such confidentiality concerns may be present in other cases, but do not exist in a case like this, in which a plaintiff will ostensibly have full access to the pertinent medical records via the patient, her exclusive romantic partner. But this reasoning would further limit the majority's holding to the alleged facts of this case, meaning that in a nearly identical future scenario, in which all that is different from the present case is that the patient is uncooperative with the plaintiff's action with regard to the disclosure of medical records-such as might happen if the relationship dissolved-there might be no recognition of a duty. I am aware of no Connecticut case law suggesting that our recognition of a duty of care should turn on the alleged willingness of a nonparty patient to have his or her medical records made available in a nonpatient's action sounding in ordinary negligence. Consequently, I respectfully find the majority's response to confidentiality concerns-that such concerns may be present in other cases, but do not exist in the present case-unconvincing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    I note that in its discussion of public policy concerns, the majority focuses a great deal of attention on public health concerns, namely, the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.

Even if I were to agree with the majority's winnowing of the list of cases we should consider to be relevant, I would hardly call a four to one majority in favor of the majority's position a convincing consensus among our sister courts, especially when so few courts have weighed in on the precise question presented.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Finally, even if I were to agree with the majority's recognition of a direct duty of care on the facts of the present case, which I respectfully do not, the future ramifications of the majority's opinion would nevertheless give me pause. Although the majority repeatedly cautions that its holding is limited and narrow, I nevertheless find this contention troubling because its implications portend just the opposite result. First, although the majority states that its decision is limited strictly to cases involving the diagnosis of STDs, the public policy concerns discussed therein apply with equal or even greater force to any number of different infectious diseases, such as chickenpox, influenza, and measles. It is likely that in cases with identifiable nonpatient third parties, the majority's opinion in this case will be held up as a logically convincing precedent to further extend the potential liability of health care providers. Second, the majority's foreseeability analysis is inherently subjective. What if the physician has awareness of a romantic partner's existence independent of knowledge obtained from the patient, such as through a social relationship? There is little reason why this court's logic would not counsel in favor of recognizing a duty in such a case, concerns of which would be exacerbated should the majority's decision be extended beyond STDs to other infectious diseases, such as influenza. Put differently, the majority's opinion sets a precedent that will easily open the floodgates to a great expansion of potential third party liability for health care providers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
