We are constrained to agree with Appellant and find that the Commonwealth failed to prove an essential element of COM-Felony. We, thus, vacate Appellant's COM-Felony conviction, and remand for resentencing on the lesser-included offense of COM, graded as a first-degree misdemeanor (\"COM-Misdemeanor\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Police charged Appellant with the Sexual Offenses arising from the 17-year-old victim's allegation that, on the evening of July 19, 2015, 20-year-old Appellant sexually assaulted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a two-day trial, on April 13, 2016, the jury convicted Appellant of COM-Felony. The jury, however, found him not guilty of the Sexual Offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2016, the court imposed a sentence of one to two years' imprisonment, and a consecutive term of three years' probation. Additionally, Appellant's conviction of COM-Felony classified him as a Tier I sexual offender, and required him to comply with the fifteen-year registration and reporting requirements of the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant did not file a Post-Sentence Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This timely appeal followed. Both Appellant and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant raises the following two issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [1.] Whether the jury's guilty verdict on the charge of [COM-Felony] was not supported by sufficient evidence since a material element of the offense was the commission of a Chapter 31 offense and Appellant was found not guilty of all four of the [Sexual Offenses] charged[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [2.] Whether the jury's guilty verdict on the charge of [COM-Felony] was not supported by sufficient evidence since the evidence failed to establish Appellant's acts constituted a \"course of conduct[?]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict on the COM-Felony because in order to convict Appellant of COM-Felony, the jury must convict him of at least one Chapter 31 sexual offense with which the Commonwealth charged him.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 14.

The Supreme Court concluded that since the Commonwealth charged and prosecuted Appellant with the predicate offense of Terroristic Threats, but failed obtain a conviction, the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of Ethnic Intimidation.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"988483,8908078\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/883/479/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"988483,8908078\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/883/479/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"988483,8908078\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/883/479/\">\n    at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Analogously, in the instant case, the Commonwealth charged and prosecuted Appellant for COM-Felony and the Sexual Offenses, but failed to obtain a conviction on any of the Sexual Offenses. By acquitting Appellant of the Chapter 31 Sexual Offenses, the jury found that the Commonwealth had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant acted \"in violation of Chapter 31.\" Thus, because the jury found that Appellant had not acted \"in violation of Chapter 31,\" an essential element of COM-Felony, the Commonwealth was unable to establish every element of COM-Felony.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Magliocco\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 493 (reiterating that to \"secure a conviction for any crime, the Commonwealth must prove all necessary elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325886\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/172/632/#p640\">\n    172 A.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jury found Appellant, a 20-year-old male, guilty of corrupting the morals of a 17-year-old female (\"the victim\"). On July 19, 2015, Appellant contacted the victim and asked to speak with her in person. Around 9:00 p.m., the victim went outside her house and met Appellant at the end of her driveway. Appellant said he wanted to take his dirt bike for a ride, and the victim agreed to accompany him. When the victim asked what Appellant wanted to discuss, Appellant replied that he would tell her \"in a little bit.\" They rode to a baseball field a short distance from the victim's home, where Appellant told her to leave her cell phone so \"no one could listen into\" their conversation. They then drove to the railroad tracks on the west side of town, where they talked for about twenty minutes. Appellant began touching the victim. She responded that she \"didn't feel that way about [Appellant],\" but Appellant began touching her breasts. When she resisted, he forcibly removed her top, placed her onto the grass, sat on her legs and put his weight down to pin her arms behind her back. The victim said she \"did not want to do this.\" Appellant removed the victim's shorts and underwear and digitally penetrated her vagina without her permission. While Appellant disrobed, the victim attempted to retrieve her clothing and get away, but Appellant stopped her and placed her back onto the grass. The victim continued to protest that she \"did not want to do this,\" asked Appellant to stop and tried to push Appellant off her, but Appellant inserted his penis into the victim's vagina. The victim never consented to sexual intercourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Commonwealth charged Appellant with Sexual Offenses and COM. Notably, the information against Appellant did not allege the\n   <strong>\n    crime\n   </strong>\n   of rape, sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, or indecent assault as the basis for the COM count. Instead, the COM count charged Appellant with a\n   <strong>\n    course of conduct related to sexual offenses.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury acquitted Appellant of the Sexual Offenses but found him guilty of COM. The trial court imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Crimes Code defines COM as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Whoever, being of the age of 18 years and upwards, by any\n   <strong>\n    course of conduct in violation of Chapter 31 (relating to sexual offenses)\n   </strong>\n   corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of any minor less than 18 years of age, or who aids, abets, entices or encourages any such minor in the commission of an offense under Chapter 31 commits a felony of the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6301(a)(1)(ii) (emphasis added). \"Course of conduct\" means \"more than one act over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of conduct,\" as opposed to a single act.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Magliocco\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the defendant was convicted of ethnic intimidation ( 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2710 ) but acquitted of terroristic threats ( 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2706 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, the ethnic intimidation statute provided that a person is guilty of ethnic intimidation\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   if, with malicious intention toward the race ... of another individual or group of individuals, he\n   <strong>\n    commits an offense under any other provision of this article\n   </strong>\n   or under Chapter 33 ... or under section 3503 ... or under section 5504 ... with respect to such individual ... or with respect to one or more members of such a group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2710(a) (emphasis added).

The Court held that under Section 2710, the acquittal of terroristic threats constituted the jury's determination that the defendant did not \"commit\" terroristic threats, which was a specific element of ethnic intimidation and the only potentially applicable predicate offense in his case. The Court emphasized that while the Commonwealth was not required to formally charge a defendant with the predicate offense in order to charge him with and secure a conviction for ethnic intimidation based upon that predicate offense, the Commonwealth did in fact charge the defendant with the predicate offense of terroristic threats.

There, the Commonwealth charged the defendant with two counts of indecent assault and two counts of COM based on the same conduct underlying the indecent assault charges. The jury acquitted the defendant of indecent assault but convicted him on\n   both COM counts. The trial court arrested judgment on the COM convictions, and the Commonwealth appealed. We reinstated the COM convictions, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Because we find that the convictions resulted from the introduction of sufficient evidence\n   <strong>\n    of specific acts\n   </strong>\n   by Anderson, and because these underlying\n   <strong>\n    acts\n   </strong>\n   , and not indecent assault, formed the basis of the corruption of minors charge, we reverse the trial court's order, reinstate the jury verdict and remand for sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 807.

We noted with disapproval that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [i]n its discussion, the trial court refers to \"indecent assault\" and the underlying alleged \"specific acts\" interchangeably, implying that they amount to the same thing. The court then proceeds on the assumption that indecent assault is an element of corruption of a minor and so interprets the general jury verdict as presenting a finding that the underlying act was not committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 808. We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   It is well settled that \"[a]n acquittal cannot be interpreted as a specific finding in relation to some of the evidence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

When a general verdict is rendered, knowledge of the basis of the decision rests only with the jury itself. Therefore, it is impossible, not to mention improper, to draw specific conclusions from a general verdict. Applied to the present case, this principle yields the conclusion that an acquittal on indecent assault cannot be interpreted to mean as a matter of law that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the underlying acts in fact occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 809. Further, we noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the information did not allege the crime of indecent assault as the basis of the corruption of minors charge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Rather, the information specifically based the corruption of minors charge upon the acts of cunnilingus. Although the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of indecent assault by committing the acts of cunnilingus, we cannot determine if the jury decided that the acts of cunnilingus did not occur, or if the acts of cunnilingus occurred but the victims consented to them, or if the jury was simply exercising leniency.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     We cannot determine why the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, and therefore cannot say as a matter of law that the jury believed that the acts of cunnilingus did not occur\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Majority overlooks the highlighted text. The COM statute does not require proof that Appellant committed predicate crimes; it only requires proof of\n   <strong>\n    acts\n   </strong>\n   that constitute a \"\n   <strong>\n    course of conduct\n   </strong>\n   ,\" a critical distinction from the ethnic intimidation statute in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Magliocco\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In the present case, as in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the information did not allege commission of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, or indecent assault as the basis for the COM charge. Rather, the information based the COM charge on a\n   <strong>\n    course of conduct\n   </strong>\n   culminating in sexual intercourse with the victim, and the Commonwealth presented evidence of this course of conduct during trial. Thus, like the defendant's argument in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Appellant's challenge to sufficiency of the evidence in this case falls flat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It also deserves mention that the trial court herein gave the jury the same type of instruction that the Supreme Court endorsed in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Aikens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Specifically, the trial court instructed the jury that, to find Appellant guilty of COM, it was required to find that Appellant corrupted or tended to\n   corrupt the morals of a minor while engaged in a \"course of conduct in violation of Chapter 31\" relating to the other sexual offenses being rape, sexual assault, and indecent assault. N.T. Trial, 4/12/16-4/13/16, at 147. Because the jury found Appellant guilty of COM, this conviction must stand even if the jury ultimately did not convict Appellant of the underlying Chapter 31 offenses. Even if the COM verdict of guilt was inconsistent with the acquittals on other counts, inconsistent verdicts clearly are lawful.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
