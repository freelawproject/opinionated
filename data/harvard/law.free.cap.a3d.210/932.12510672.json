If the FAA does not apply to plaintiffs, we hold that the New Jersey Arbitration Act (NJAA), N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-1 to -32, applies and requires arbitration of their claims. We also hold that plaintiffs waived a trial by jury and the ability to proceed as a class action under their agreements with SDS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SDS is licensed by the United States Department of Transportation as a freight forwarder and freight broker. It arranges for the local delivery of pharmaceutical products and general merchandise to its customers. Plaintiffs each signed identical \"Independent Vendor Agreement[s] for Transportation Services\" with SDS in which they said they owned and operated a business that provided transportation services. Plaintiffs agreed to provide transportation services as independent contractors for SDS's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The\n   agreements covered various issues: transportation needs, rate of compensation, payment, fringe benefits, vehicles, signage, uniforms, badges, tools, equipment, insurance, indemnification, and termination of the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Paragraph 19 of the agreement provided that the law of the state of residence of the \"vendor\" would apply, meaning that for these plaintiffs, New Jersey law governed the agreement, \"including its construction and interpretation, the rights and remedies of the parties hereunder, and all claims, controversies or disputes (whether arising in contract or tort) between the parties.\" Plaintiffs also agreed in paragraph 19(b) to waive \"any right to a trial by jury in any suit filed hereunder and agree to adjudicate any dispute pursuant to [p]aragraph 20 ....\" Paragraph 20 addressed arbitration and the waiver of class actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged they worked out of SDS's facility in Elizabeth from February 2015 to March 2016 performing \"truck driving and ... delivery functions.\" They claimed SDS made \"unlawful deductions\" from their compensation in violation of the New Jersey Wage Payment Law (WPL), N.J.S.A. 34:11-4.1 to 4.14. They contended they were misclassified by SDS as independent contractors and should have been classified as employees. Plaintiffs alleged they should have been paid one-and-a-half their hourly rate for work in excess of forty hours per week and SDS's failure to do so violated the New Jersey Wage and Hour Law (WHL), N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a to -56a38.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2016, plaintiffs filed suit against defendants on behalf of themselves and as a class action on behalf of other \"similarly situated persons,\" for violation of the WHL and WPL, and demanded a jury trial. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss\n   the complaint and to compel plaintiffs to arbitrate these claims on an individual basis, not as a class. Defendants relied on paragraphs 19 and 20 of the agreement, arguing that plaintiffs agreed to waive a jury trial, to proceed on an individual (non-class) basis, and to have their claims heard in binding arbitration. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing they were exempt from arbitration under the FAA, and that they had not waived their right to a jury trial or class action relief under the WHL or WPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court granted defendants' motion, treating it as a summary judgment motion, because the parties relied on materials not referenced in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:6-2.

The Third Circuit has held \"[t]here is no language in the FAA that explicitly preempts the enforcement of\n   state arbitration statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Palcko v. Airborne Express, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233990\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/588/#p595\">\n    372 F.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (3d Cir. 2004). Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Palcko\n   </em>\n   , the NJAA could be applied even if the FAA did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs argue\n   <em>\n    Palcko\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case. The agreement in\n   <em>\n    Palcko\n   </em>\n   included reference to the FAA, and said that if the FAA were not applicable, \"Washington law pertaining to agreements to arbitrate shall apply.\" We do not agree that this reference in\n   <em>\n    Palcko\n   </em>\n   means the NJAA does not apply in the present case. The NJAA governs arbitration agreements in New Jersey made after January 1, 2003. N.J.S.A. 2A:23B-3. Therefore, the parties should have understood that the NJAA would apply to their agreement. The agreement expressly provided that it was governed by the state law where the vendor resided, which in this case meant New Jersey. The agreement did not say that the NJAA did not apply. Their detailed arbitration provision showed they intended to arbitrate disputes. Otherwise, given their contention they are exempt under the FAA, there was no reason to include any reference to arbitration. Because the FAA did not preempt application of the NJAA in this context, we conclude that even if plaintiffs are exempt under section one of the FAA, they still are required to arbitrate their claims under the NJAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court must determine in the first instance if the FAA applies. We are constrained to reinstate the complaint and remand that issue to the trial court. However, if plaintiffs were engaged in transportation services in interstate commerce, meaning that they are exempt under the FAA, we will enforce the arbitration provision under the NJAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the court erred by dismissing their complaint because they did not waive their right to a jury trial on the wage and payment claims and did not waive the ability to pursue these claims on a class action basis. We agree with defendants that plaintiffs waived both of these rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The agreement provided in paragraph 19(b) that the \"parties voluntarily agree to waive any right to trial by jury in any suit filed hereunder and agree to adjudicate any dispute pursuant to [p]aragraph 20 below.\" Plaintiffs contend they are entitled to a jury trial on their wage and payment claims because those claims are based on statutes, not contracts. Thus, they argue if they must arbitrate under their agreements, they should not be required to arbitrate the WHL or WPL claims.

Although the Court reversed the order to arbitrate in\n   <em>\n    Garfinkel\n   </em>\n   because of ambiguity in the arbitration clause, the Court did not hold that statutory claims per se could not be subject to arbitration. Further, unlike\n   <em>\n    Garfinkel\n   </em>\n   , the arbitration provision in this case was not limited to claims under the agreement; it broadly included claims \"arising out of or in any way relating to\" the \"transportation services provided thereunder.\" The Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   that \"no prescribed set of words must be included in an arbitration clause to accomplish a waiver of rights.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p446\">\n    219 N.J. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/#p446\">\n    99 A.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the two concepts-jury trial waiver and arbitration-are linked in the same sentence by the conjunction \"and,\" we understand plaintiffs to have waived their right to pursue a jury trial based on, or made in conjunction with, the provision of binding arbitration. Because plaintiffs are required to arbitrate under the FAA or NJAA, we hold that plaintiffs waived their right to a jury trial on the wage and payment law issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court ordered \"mandatory binding arbitration on an individual basis.\" Plaintiffs argue they did not waive their ability to pursue their claims as a class. We agree with defendants that plaintiffs' waiver was \"clear and unambiguous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Paragraph 20(b) of the agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   any arbitration, suit, action or other legal proceeding arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement or the services provided thereunder shall be conducted and resolved on an individual basis only and not on a class-wide, multiple\n   plaintiff, collective or similar basis unless mutually agreed to in writing by all interested parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast to the jury trial waiver provision, the class-action waiver was not linked to the arbitration requirement; it was a separate subsection under paragraph 20.
