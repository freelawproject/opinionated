The WCJ denied in part Claimant's Petition to Review WC Benefits (Review Petition) because Claimant failed to establish that his average weekly wage (AWW) was incorrectly calculated, and granted Philadelphia Coca-Cola's (Employer) Petition to Suspend WC Benefits (Suspension Petition) for 525 days on the basis that Claimant, under Section 306(a.1) of the WC Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was \"incarcerated after a conviction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Claimant raises two issues. First, he argues that the WCJ incorrectly calculated his AWW because there is not substantial evidence that he was expected to work only 40 hours per week. Second, Claimant argues that it was error to suspend his benefits because he spent 525 days in\n   <strong>\n    pretrial\n   </strong>\n   incarceration, which, upon his conviction, was credited as time served, and this time does not meet the statutory requirement, \"any period during which [he was] incarcerated\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   a conviction.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.1 (emphasis added). We find merit in Claimant's arguments. The credited testimony was that Claimant was expected to work overtime during the summer, which the WCJ did not consider in calculating Claimant's AWW. Moreover, under the plain language of Section 306(a.1), incarceration that occurs\n   <strong>\n    before\n   </strong>\n   a conviction, due to the inability to meet bail, is not a \"period during which the employe is incarcerated\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   a conviction,\" and such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles underlying the WC Act and its purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we will remand for a recalculation of Claimant's AWW, and will reverse the suspension of Claimant's WC benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Petitions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 2, 2012, Claimant sustained an injury while working as a production manager with Employer. Employer issued a Notice of Temporary Compensation Payable, which was subsequently converted, as a matter of law, to a Notice of Compensation Payable (NCP). The NCP recognized Claimant's injuries as right pinky finger amputation and low back sprain, entitling Claimant to a weekly disability rate of $ 652 based upon an AWW of $ 978.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 7, 2015, Claimant filed the Review Petition claiming that his AWW was miscalculated in violation of Section 309(d.2) of the WC Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that his\n   AWW should have been no less than $ 1412.04, thereby entitling him to the maximum weekly disability rate of $ 888. Claimant also alleged an incorrect description of injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant further sought penalties for Employer's miscalculation of his AWW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 12, 2015, Employer filed the Suspension Petition, claiming that Claimant's benefits should be suspended because he spent 525 days in jail prior to his conviction and because he was credited with having served that time upon his conviction on January 22, 2015, Claimant should not be unjustly enriched and his benefits should be adjusted accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Hearings Before the WCJ\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hearing before the WCJ, Claimant testified that at the time of his injury, he had been working for Employer for about four weeks. His normal rate of pay was $ 24.45 per hour. Typically, he worked for 10 hours a day from 5:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. for 6 days a week, or 60 hours a week. When he met with Dennis Veneri, who hired Claimant, Claimant was told to expect to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, at $ 24.45 an hour. There was never a week he did not work overtime, Claimant testified. In the summer, because of increased supply and demand, Claimant was told he would work in excess of 60 hours. He was never told that during the summer he would work 60 hours and, thereafter, his hours would be reduced. A Statement of Wages indicated, however, that Claimant worked 40 hours per week. Claimant stated that the Statement of Wages was inaccurate. Pay stubs entered into evidence indicated the following:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-17\">Week Regular Hours Overtime Hours Total Hours 6/12/12-6/17/12 34.5 5 39.5 6/18/12-6/24/12 40 22.52 62.52 6/25/12-7/01/12 40 10.02 50.02 7/02/12-7/08/12 10 0 10</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Certified Record (C.R.) Items 23, 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Veneri testified that Employer employed him as Director of Maintenance for the Philadelphia Erie Facility, a position he held for five years. Veneri was involved in the hiring of employees. Veneri hired Claimant to work as a maintenance mechanic. The normal working hours are 4 10-hour shifts, but during the busy season, employees will work an extra day or 2 days for another 10-hour shift. In response to the question by Employer \"[h]ow many hours was [Claimant] expected to work per week under the terms of his employment,\" Veneri answered \"it was a four ten-hour shift, but it was explained to [him] that there could and probably would be overtime because it was the busy time of the year when he was hired.\" (C.R. Item 20, Hr'g Tr., Oct. 22, 2015, at 6.) In response to the question of \"would that overtime be guaranteed overtime,\" Veneri answered, \"In the busy season more than likely yes,\n   because it was busy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Veneri clarified that the busy season is \"typically the hundred days of summer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For overtime, Veneri noted, an employee received time and a half. Outside of summer, sometimes there was still overtime, depending on the schedule. Veneri noted that Claimant's paychecks showed that Claimant was paid a \"job premium\" rate, which was .35 cents per hour, and a \"job premium overtime\" rate, which was .525 cents; this reflected, Veneri testified, that Claimant was paid \"a little extra\" for working 10-hour shifts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Regarding Claimant's incarceration, the parties stipulated that Claimant was first incarcerated on August 16, 2013, when, upon being charged, he could not meet bail. On January 22, 2015, Claimant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 525 days time served. He received credit for the 525 days he spent incarcerated prior to his conviction and, therefore, was released from incarceration on January 22, 2015, the date of his conviction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The WCJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The WCJ granted the Review Petition in part and denied it in part and granted Employer's Suspension Petition. (WCJ Decision, Conclusions of Law (COL) \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) The WCJ granted the Review Petition to the extent Claimant alleged he sustained additional injuries\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a result of his work accident, which Employer acknowledged in a Stipulation of Facts. (WCJ Decision, Findings of Fact (FOF) \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; C.R. Item 30, Stipulation of Facts \u00b6 3.) The WCJ denied the Review Petition to the extent Claimant alleged that his AWW was incorrectly calculated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The WCJ found no dispute as to the authenticity of the pay stubs and that they were \"a credible and accurate representation of the hours\" Claimant worked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) However, the WCJ did not credit Claimant's testimony on this issue, instead crediting Veneri's testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) The WCJ explained that having viewed Claimant's \"demeanor and comportment\" and considered that Claimant acknowledged that Employer expected all employees to work overtime if requested and that Claimant's paystubs did not reflect \"a base of sixty hours per week,\" Claimant was not credible on the number of hours he was expected to work each week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Veneri, in contrast, was credible, the WCJ found, because, having viewed \"his demeanor and comportment,\" and considering the years he spent hiring potential employees for Employer, he was the \"the best individual to know the terms of employment for a mechanic in the Maintenance Department\" of Employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Therefore, the WCJ concluded, Claimant \"was hired to work a forty-hour work week with probable overtime during the busy season or 100 days of summer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The WCJ further found \"Claimant actually worked on average a forty-hours [sic] during the short time he worked for the Employer prior to his injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the incarceration issue, the WCJ concluded that Employer was entitled to reimbursement for benefits paid to Claimant during the 525 days Claimant was incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) The WCJ ordered\n   that Employer not be given a future credit against benefits to be paid to Claimant, but that Employer petition the Supersedeas Fund for reimbursement. (COL \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Board's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Employer appealed and Claimant cross-appealed from the WCJ's Decision to the Board. The Board modified the WCJ's Decision by allowing Employer to seek reimbursement for total disability compensation paid to Claimant while he was incarcerated via a credit against future disability payments to Claimant rather than requiring Employer to seek reimbursement through the Supersedeas Fund. (Board Op. at 10.) The Board otherwise affirmed the WCJ's Decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appeal to this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant raises two issues for our consideration. First, he argues that the WCJ incorrectly calculated his AWW because there is not substantial evidence that he was expected to work only 40 hours per week but that, at least during the summer, he was expected to work overtime; second, he argues that it was error to suspend his benefits because he spent 525 days in pretrial incarceration, which, upon his conviction, was credited as time served, and this time does not meet the statutory requirement \"any period during which [he was] incarcerated after a conviction.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. AWW Calculation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Claimant argues that there is not substantial evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support the WCJ's Decision that he was expected to work only 40 hours per week. Claimant contends his pay stubs are consistent with the credited testimony of Veneri that Claimant was required to, and did, work overtime, at least during the busy season. In the 3 full weeks preceding his work-related injury, Claimant averaged 50.68 hours of work. By including in the calculation Claimant's last week, in which he worked only 10 hours before being injured, Claimant argues the WCJ \"artificially deflated his average hours per week\" resulting in an average of 40.51 hours. (Claimant's Brief (Br.) at 17 (emphasis omitted).) At the very least, Claimant argues, this overtime should have been taken into account in one 13-week period and then averaged with a 26-week period when Claimant was expected to work only 40 hours a week. Further, Claimant contends, the WCJ erred when she neglected to include in her calculation that Claimant was paid a job premium rate and job premium overtime rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Employer argues that the WCJ properly determined Claimant's AWW using Section 309(d.2) of the WC Act. Such a determination, Employer maintains, is a factual one subject to the WCJ's assessment of credibility. The WCJ, Employer notes, credited the testimony of Veneri and discredited Claimant's testimony. The credited testimony is substantial evidence to\n   support the WCJ's finding that Claimant was expected to work 40 hours per week and, therefore, Employer concludes, that finding must be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because Claimant worked less than 13 calendar weeks, and had no fixed weekly wages, Section 309(d.2) of the WC Act applies. Section 309(d.2) provides the AWW is \"the hourly wage rate multiplied by the number of hours the employe\n   <strong>\n    was expected to work per week\n   </strong>\n   under the terms of employment.\" 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(d.2) (emphasis added). In interpreting and applying this section, we are cognizant that the General Assembly's intent behind Section 309(d.2) was to cover \"those instances of work injuries to recently[ ]hired employees for whom there was, by definition, no accurate measure of AWW other than taking the existing hourly wage and projecting forward on the basis of the hours of work expected under the employment agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Reifsnyder v.

Cmwlth. 2002) ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The question of how many hours a claimant was expected to work per week is a question of fact for the WCJ.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1101. The authority of the WCJ \"over questions of credibility, conflicting evidence and evidentiary weight is unquestioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the parties do not dispute that Section 309(d.2) applies here, they do dispute whether Claimant was expected to work more than 40 hours per week. The WCJ credited the testimony of Employer's witness, Veneri, and found that the pay stubs credibly and accurately reflected the hours worked. Relevant here, Veneri's response to Employer's question, \"[h]ow many hours was [Claimant] expected to work per week under the terms of his employment,\" was two-fold: he stated \"it was ... four ten-hour shift[s], but it was explained to [Claimant] that there could and probably would be overtime because it was the busy time of the year when he was hired.\" (C.R. Item 20, Hr'g Tr., Oct. 22, 2015, at 6.) He further testified, in response to Employer's question of \"[w]ould that overtime be\n   <strong>\n    guaranteed overtime\n   </strong>\n   ,\" \"[i]n the busy season more than likely\n   <strong>\n    yes,\n   </strong>\n   because it was busy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) Veneri quantified the busy season as \"typically the hundred days of summer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Veneri's testimony is consistent with Claimant's pay stubs. Excluding Claimant's last week of work where he was injured and appeared to work only one day, the pay stubs show that he worked overtime hours in each of the three other weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The WCJ specifically found, consistent with this credited testimony and evidence,\n   that \"Claimant was hired to work a forty-hour work week with\n   <strong>\n    probable overtime\n   </strong>\n   during the busy season or 100 days of summer.\" (FOF \u00b6 14 (emphasis added).) Yet, the WCJ did not account for\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   award of overtime in calculating Claimant's AWW. Instead, despite this finding and Veneri's testimony regarding overtime during the summer, in the next finding, the WCJ concluded that \"Claimant\n   <strong>\n    actually\n   </strong>\n   worked on average a [sic] forty-hours [sic] during the short time he\" was employed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (emphasis added).) In reaching this conclusion, it appears, as Claimant argues, that the WCJ included the week in which Claimant was injured, adding together the total number of hours Claimant worked for 4 weeks (39.5, 62.52, 50.02 and\n   <strong>\n    10\n   </strong>\n   ) and dividing that figure (162.04) by 4 to reach a work week of 40.51 hours. We agree with Claimant that the WCJ should not have used the 10-hour work week in the calculation where Claimant's injury,\n   <strong>\n    occurring on a Monday\n   </strong>\n   , prevented him from continuing to work and completing, at the very least, the 40 hours the undisputed evidence showed he was expected to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The credited testimony and evidence demonstrated that Claimant worked overtime for every week that he actually worked a complete work week. Yet, the WCJ did not take any overtime into consideration. We have required that overtime be taken into account when calculating a claimant's AWW under Section 309(d.2),\n   <em>\n    Lahr Mechanical\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8348752\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/933/1095/#p1101\">\n    933 A.2d at 1101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and therefore the WCJ erred when she did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In summary, to determine the hours Claimant \"actually worked on average,\" (FOF \u00b6 15), requires the calculation to \"reflect the economic reality of ...

The WCJ's calculation here did not do so, as it counted as a full work week the pay he received when he was injured on Monday and could not work the rest of the week, and further did not include any overtime hours contrary to the credited testimony and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, we must remand to the Board with direction to further remand to the WCJ to recalculate Claimant's AWW,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   taking into account that Claimant was expected to work overtime during the summer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claimant's Pre-Conviction Incarceration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Claimant argues that it was error to suspend his benefits because he was not\n   \"incarcerated\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   a conviction,\" as Section 306(a.1) requires. 77 P.S. \u00a7 511.1 (emphasis added). Rather, his incarceration occurred\n   <strong>\n    before\n   </strong>\n   his conviction and was the result of his inability to make bail while awaiting trial. Claimant asserts that the text of Section 306(a.1) does not allow for the suspension of benefits where, as here, the time Claimant spent incarcerated occurred prior to his conviction, he received a credit of time served upon his conviction for that period of pretrial incarceration and then was released. The Board's interpretation of Section 306(a.1) to include the suspension of benefits under these circumstances \"engraft[s] language onto the statute\" that the General Assembly did not see fit to include. (Claimant's Br. at 29 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rogele, Inc. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.

Cmwlth. 2009) ).) Moreover, Claimant argues, such an interpretation raises \"a serious question\" of unequal treatment under the law based on the inability to meet bail.

In\n   <em>\n    Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc. v.

This premise follows from the underlying principles of the WC Act because, once incarcerated\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   a conviction, the employee's disability, or loss of earning power, is no longer causally related to his work injury; instead, the employee's loss of earning power is the result of the incarceration.\n   <em>\n    Banic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11867138,281252\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/705/432/\">\n    705 A.2d at 435-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Prior to his conviction, Claimant was incarcerated because of his inability to make bail, not because of a conviction for criminal conduct.
