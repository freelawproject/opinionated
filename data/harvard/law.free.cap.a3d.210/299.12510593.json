After careful review, we reverse the decision of the PCRA court and grant Appellant a new degree-of-guilt hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1977, Appellant pled guilty to murder generally, and three judges were empaneled to decide Appellant's degree of guilt (\"Degree of Guilt Panel\"). The Commonwealth presented evidence to support its position that Appellant committed a First-Degree Murder while Appellant presented evidence to support his claim of Third-Degree murder. The Degree of Guilt Panel convicted Appellant of First-Degree Murder. On August 5, 1977, the lower court sentenced Appellant to a term of life in prison without parole. Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal, and our Supreme Court affirmed Appellant's Judgment of Sentence on January 24, 1979.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

On April 13, 2016, the PCRA court entered a final Order and Opinion denying Appellant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant timely filed a Notice of Appeal, and both Appellant and the PCRA court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. On November 15, 2017, this Court certified this case for\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, Appellant presents three questions for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [1.] Did the PCRA court err in finding that the [after-]discovered DNA evidence was not likely to change the outcome of [Appellant's] criminal proceeding notwithstanding that the [after-discovered] evidence rebuts the Commonwealth's overall theory of the case and disproves a key inference that the prosecution and finder of fact relied on to establish the intent necessary for conviction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [2.] Did the PCRA court err to the extent that it held the [after-]discovered evidence was immaterial or not exculpatory?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [3.] Did the PCRA court err by not considering [Appellant's] claims under the United States and Pennsylvania constitutions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, we find that the PCRA court erred when it concluded that the DNA evidence was not likely to change the result of the Degree of Guilt Panel. The PCRA court erroneously focused on other evidence in the record to conclude that the DNA evidence would not\n   likely change the result of the Degree of Guilt Panel; this is not the proper analysis. The proper focus is whether the after-discovered evidence significantly refutes an assertion on which the Degree of Guilt Panel and the Commonwealth placed significant weight. Because the Commonwealth argued and the Degree of Guilt Panel accepted the theory that Appellant murdered the victim while he raped her and the DNA evidence refutes the assertion that Appellant raped the victim, we find that Appellant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the DNA evidence would likely result in a different verdict. We, thus, reverse the decision of the PCRA court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court reviews the denial of a PCRA petition to determine whether the record supports the PCRA court's findings and whether its order is otherwise free of legal error.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In order to successfully prove an after-discovered evidence claim under Section 9543(a)(2)(vi), the petitioner must show that \"(1) the evidence has been discovered after trial and it could not have been obtained at or prior to trial through reasonable diligence; (2) the evidence is not cumulative; (3) it is not being used solely to impeach credibility; and (4) it would likely compel a different verdict.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mount\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , a three-judge panel had held a degree-of-guilt hearing and concluded that the appellant committed First-Degree\n   Murder because the appellant raped the victim and then killed her. At the sentencing hearing, the appellant argued that he only stabbed the victim and did not rape her. The Commonwealth, however, presented evidence from a laboratory technician specializing in blood and other body fluid stains who testified that she analyzed a pair of underpants located among the appellant's belongings, found seminal fluids and bloodstains, and concluded that the bloodstains matched the deceased's blood type. The panel imposed a sentence of \"death in the electric chair.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20578\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20578\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20578\">\n    at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted in the above case law, the analysis is not based on whether the\n   record contains other evidence sufficient to convict the Appellant of First-Degree Murder; rather, the focus is on whether Appellant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the after-discovered evidence would likely have changed the Commonwealth's theory of the case and the decision of the Degree of Guilt Panel.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mount\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20578\">\n    257 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   582 ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bulted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20158\">\n    279 A.2d at 161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed below, both the Degree of Guilt Panel and the Commonwealth placed significant weight on the theory that Appellant murdered the victim while raping her. Because the DNA evidence refutes the evidence of rape, the after-discovered would likely have changed the decision of the Degree of Guilt Panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A review of the Degree of Guilt Panel's Opinion demonstrates the significant weight that the panel placed on the conclusion that Appellant raped the victim in determining that Appellant committed Murder of the first degree. The Degree of Guilt Panel placed significant, if not exclusive, weight on the testimony of Anthony Lee Evans, who was incarcerated with Appellant in Erie County prison. The Degree of Guilt Panel characterized Mr. Evans' testimony as an \"admission\" that Appellant made to his cellmate and \"the most damaging\" to the Appellant. Trial Court Opinion, 7/18/77, at 5, 6. The Degree of Guilt Panel summarized Mr. Evans' testimony about Appellant killing the victim during the commission of a rape as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Evans testified that [Appellant] confided in him and eventually described in detail what had occurred. He said that [Appellant] told him that while he and [the victim] were riding in his truck he had put some \"DOWNS\" (pills) in the victim's beer; that while she was under the influence of the drug\n   <strong>\n    he took her to the woods where he tied her up in the manner above described and began having sexual intercourse with her; that she begged him to stop, crying and screaming; that she \"MADE HIM MAD\" and he grasped the rope \"ON EACH SIDE OF HER AND PULLED IT TIGHT UNTIL SHE WAS DEAD.\"\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20158\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Degree of Guilt Panel also relied heavily upon Mr. Evans' testimony that Appellant told him that the victim's \"death was a culmination of a sexual fantasy that he had been living with for a long time; that HE LIKES TO TIE WOMEN UP AND DO CRAZY THINGS TO 'EM.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%20158\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Degree of Guilt Panel also relied heavily upon the testimony of Paul Daube, a chemist employed by the Pennsylvania State Police, to corroborate Mr. Evans' testimony that the victim died while \"protesting a sexual attack upon her\" because Mr. Daube conducted tests and \"found the presence of seminal acid phosphatase in [the victim's anal and vaginal area].\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Degree of Guilt Panel then compared Mr. Evans' testimony to the statement that Appellant made to the police and concluded that since Mr. Evans' testimony is similar to Appellant's statement, except for the manner in which the victim died, that Appellant's theory of the cause of death \"lacks credibility.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on this analysis, the Degree of Guilt Panel then concludes that the murder of the victim \"was willful, deliberate and premeditated\" and Appellant's \"admission to his cellmate verifies that conclusion and removes all doubt.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We note that the Degree of Guilt Panel summarized other evidence presented at the hearing, but did not place any weight on that other evidence in reaching its conclusion of First-Degree Murder. Rather, the Degree of Guilt Panel relied exclusively upon the testimony of Mr. Evans and Mr. Daube.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similarly, the Commonwealth at the Degree of Guilt Hearing asserted the theory that Appellant killed the victim while she resisted a sexual assault. The prosecution repeatedly emphasized the evidence of seminal fluid during closing argument when urging the panel to convict Appellant of First-Degree Murder. During closing argument at the Degree of Guilt hearing, the prosecution argued: \"[A]ll of the words from [Appellant] are consistent with the fact that this was an intentional killing;\n   <strong>\n    that at least it was a rape\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    that the facts of the case show that there was intercourse between the two\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" N.T., 6/28/77, at 17 (emphasis added) (asserting also \"that there was sexual activity between these two people\"). Most significantly, the prosecution also argued that the presence of seminal fluid, presumed to be Appellant's, was proof of the intent required for a First-Degree Murder conviction.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With the basis for the Degree of Guilt Panel's decision and the Commonwealth's theory in mind, we turn to the implications of the DNA evidence. The new DNA evidence is uncontroverted\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   physical evidence that excluded Appellant as a possible contributor of the DNA samples that Mr. Daube had analyzed and testified about at the Degree of Guilt Hearing. Because the Degree of Guilt Panel relied upon Mr. Daube's testimony to corroborate Mr. Evan's testimony about Appellant murdering the victim while raping her, this corroboration evidence is no longer valid and the Degree of Guilt Panel erred in placing significant weight on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The DNA evidence also discredits Mr. Evans' testimony that the victim's death was a culmination of a sexual fantasy and, thus, fundamentally alters the Degree of Guilt Panel's credibility decision in weighing Appellant's version of events against Evans' testimony and the prosecution's version of events. Furthermore, the new DNA evidence makes it doubtful that the prosecution would present this theory and the Degree of Guilt Panel would accept it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Appellant has satisfied the PCRA's stringent requirements under these unique circumstances and has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the DNA evidence would have likely changed the decision of the Degree of Guilt Panel. We, thus, reverse the PCRA court. In light of this ruling, we do not address Appellant's other claims of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Order reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   President Judge Emeritus Bender, and Judge Panella, Judge Lazarus, Judge Kunselman, and Judge Murray join the Opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Judge Shogan files a dissenting opinion in which Judge Olson and Judge Stabile join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY SHOGAN, J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I respectfully dissent.

She never returned, and on August 12th her body was found floating in Cuss[e]wago Creek off Route 98 about 12 miles north of Meadville, in Crawford County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   When found the victim's hands and feet were bound by copper wire. Wire also encircled and was imbedded in her neck. Crawford County Coroner Wilbur C. Thomas ruled that the young girl had been strangled listing the cause of death as \"acute asphyxiation due to ligature.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The original charge against [Appellant], a teacher at the school attended by [the victim], was originally instituted in Crawford County, the body having been found there. However, on Friday, October 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 1976, [Appellant,] with the consent of his attorney and in the attorney's presence, gave a statement to Assistant District Attorney Donald E. Lewis. In the statement in which [Appellant] categorized [the victim's] death as accidental, he revealed that her death had occurred in Erie County. As the result thereof the murder charge was then filed in Erie County on December 8, 1976.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Following several continuances requested by [Appellant] and his counsel, trial was scheduled for Monday, April 11, 1977. On that date [Appellant] entered a plea of guilty to murder generally and a degree[-]of[-]guilt hearing was held before the [lower court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ] on June 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 1977. The merits have been argued and the matter is now ripe for decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   It is the contention of the Commonwealth that the facts require a finding of murder in the first degree. The defense argues that the crime should rise no higher than 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   degree murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Under the plea, voluntary manslaughter could be a possible determination. However, we are of the opinion that there are no facts before the court that would justify that result or require its further consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Section 2501 of the Crimes Code describes criminal homicide as \"where a person intentionally, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another person.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Under the amendment to section 2502 of the Crimes Code, effective March 26, 1974, murder is divided into three degrees. \"A criminal homicide constitutes murder in the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing. Murder in the second degree is where the death of the victim occurred while the defendant was engaged as a principal or accomplice in the perpetration of a felony. All other kinds of murder shall be murder in the third degree.[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Under sub-section (d) intentional killing \"is a killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The evidence before the court consists principally of the physical evidence, the condition of the victim's body, the testimony of the pathologist, [Appellant's] statement of October 8, 1976, and his\n   admissions to his former cellmate, Anthony Lee Evans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   While the defense called two former inmates of the Erie County prison to attack the credibility of Evan[s's] testimony, they relied principally on [Appellant's] version of the victim's death as contained in his statement to the authorities in Crawford County in October of 1976.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   In that statement [Appellant] told of meeting [the victim] as she was standing on the corner of Tenth and Raspberry Streets and taking her for a ride. He stated he had been smoking marijuana and had taken two \"downs\" (meprobamate) prior to meeting the victim; that after voluntarily consuming a number of the pills [the victim] agreed to pose for [Appellant], when he asked her if he could take some \"bondage pictures\" of her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   He stated that he continued to smoke marijuana as they headed for the Everett C. Hall Community Park, a secluded wooded area in Waterford Township in Erie County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   After arriving there he said that she allowed him to tie her hands and ankles together with some clothesline which he had purchased at the K-Mart. He had the victim get down on her knees. He then tied one end of the rope to a tree, then wound it around her neck and tied the other end to another tree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   At that time he discovered that he had left his camera in his truck; that despite the fact that the girl appeared to be affected by the pills she had consumed, he left her in the trussed[-]up position and returned to his truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   While there he smoked some more marijuana and loaded his camera. When he returned he discovered that the victim had fallen forward and had expired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   He said he panicked, that he cut the bonds, placed her in his truck and drove her back to his farm; that he then attached cement blocks to her body with some copper wire and placed her in a pond located at the property. Two days later he discovered that the body had surfaced. He then transported the body to the Cussewago Creek where it was found on August 12th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [Appellant] denied that he had had sexual relations with the victim or that he had in any way molested her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Counsel for [Appellant] rely on this statement for their defense, contending that [the victim's] death was accidental; that [Appellant] was at most negligent and that his degree of guilt should rise no higher than 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   We, however, are not impressed with either the accuracy or credibility of [Appellant's] statement. Yet it does have an important bearing on our determination. Not only does it place [Appellant] alone with the victim when she died, admittedly under circumstances caused by him, but it does in many respects corroborate other evidence introduced by the Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    The most damaging Commonwealth testimony was given by Anthony Lee Evans who was incarcerated along with [Appellant] in the Erie County prison in January and February of 1977.\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Evans testified that [Appellant] confided in him and eventually described in detail what had occurred.\n   <strong>\n    He said that [Appellant] told him that while he and [the victim] were riding in his truck he had put some \"downs\" (pills) in the victim's beer; that while she was under the influence of the drug he took her to the woods where he tied her up in the manner above described and began having sexual intercourse with her; that she begged\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    him to stop, crying and screaming; that she \"made him mad\" and he grasped the rope \"on each side of her and pulled it tight until she was dead.\"\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   At this point Mr. Evans'[s] testimony varies from [Appellant's] statement in that he testified that rather than taking the body back to the farm and placing it in the pond, that [Appellant] said he covered the body with leaves and left it there for several days until he decided where to dispose of it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Evans further testified that [Appellant] told him [the victim's] death was a culmination of a sexual fantasy that he had been living with for a long time; that \"he likes to tie women up and do crazy things to 'em.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Evans'[s] testimony corroborates in many respects the statement given by [Appellant] to the Assistant District Attorney of Crawford County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   In both statements he admits that the victim was under the influence of pills ingested either voluntarily or administered by subterfuge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The reference to a \"sexual fantasy\" and [Appellant's] penchant for bondage is important, for in [Appellant's] own statement he admits that it was he who suggested the taking of \"bondage pictures.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The manner in which [the victim] was tied is exactly the same in both statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The only real variation is in the manner in which death was caused. Even here there is verification for Evans'[s] testimony that she died protesting a sexual attack upon her. Paul R. Daube, a chemist employed by the Pennsylvania State Police testified that he conducted tests on Hemorrhogic fluids extracted from the victim's vaginal and anal areas. He stated that he found the presence of seminal acid phosphatase in both areas and that seminal acid phosphatase is found only in semen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   In the opinion of the court the accidental theory advanced by the defense lacks credibility. It is our belief that the testimony of Evans is more consistent with the established facts than the self serving statement of [Appellant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute murder in the first degree may be found from the circumstances surrounding the slaying together with all reasonable inferences therefrom....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In this case not only do the circumstances point to the conclusion that the slaying of [the victim] was willful, deliberate and premeditated,\n   <strong>\n    but [Appellant's] admission to his cellmate verifies that conclusion and removes all doubt.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The testimony before the court is also consistent with a slaying in the perpetration of a forceful rape which would constitute murder in the second degree.\n   <strong>\n    However, having concluded that [Appellant] is guilty of an intentional killing, we need not further pursue the theory of felony murder.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Degree-of-Guilt Court Opinion, 7/18/77, at 1-6 (original emphasis and some capitalization omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder.

Police traced the wire found on the victim's body to wire found on [Appellant's] property. The court also considered the testimony of [Appellant's] cell mate, Anthony Lee Evans. Evans corroborated much of the story given in [Appellant's] confession, differing only in connection with the manner in which the victim died. Evans testified that [Appellant] had told him about having intercourse with the victim while she was bound to the tree, and that when she begged him to stop he tightened the rope around her neck, strangling her. [Appellant] told his cell mate that this had been a fantasy of his for some time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The court stated in its Opinion, dated July 18, 1977, that it found [Appellant's] claim that the victim's death was accidental lacked credibility.

Appellant admitted he used cement blocks and copper wire to submerge the victim's body in a pond on his property. After her body re-surfaced, he transported her to another location and tried to submerge her body again. Mr. Evans testified Appellant had relayed to him that when he threw the dead body into the water, it was the climax to his sexual fantasy, and Appellant said, \"[H]e shot off all over himself.\" N.T., 6/7/77, at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Mr. Evans's testimony was contrary to Appellant's version of events where Appellant\n   stated that he \"panicked\" when the victim died. Moreover, Mr. Evans did not testify that Appellant ever ejaculated on or inside the victim; rather, Mr. Evans used a more vulgar statement saying that \"[Appellant] shot off all over himself.\" N.T., 6/7/77, at 59. Mr. Evans also testified that Appellant confessed that while he began having intercourse with the victim, she made Appellant mad so he strangled her with the rope, pulling the rope tight until she was dead.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 55-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Based on the evidence, Appellant's statements, and the testimony of Mr. Evans, which the court found credible, I conclude that the outcome of the degree-of-guilt hearing would not have been different even if the results of the DNA testing had been available because the evidence established Appellant's intent to kill the victim. As discussed above, the degree-of-guilt panel found Mr. Evans credible because his version of events made more sense that Appellant's self-serving statements. Mr. Evans testified that Appellant ejaculated on himself, not inside or on the victim. Moreover, Appellant was not convicted of rape, and the DNA evidence does not diminish the degree-of-guilt panel's credibility assessment. Accordingly, I would find that Appellant is entitled to no relief on his first claim of error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Appellant next argues that the PCRA court erred in concluding that the DNA evidence was neither material nor exculpatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's Brief at 40-49. Specifically, Appellant suggests that the PCRA court erred by considering evidence not of record. First, Appellant criticizes the PCRA court for creating a \"newly-minted theory\" regarding the perpetrator of this crime. Appellant's Brief at 42. Appellant takes issue with the following conclusion set forth by the PCRA Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   The presence of DNA material of another male does not help [Appellant's] case, it hurts it. In this court's view, the DNA evidence of another male is more inculpatory than ever, strongly suggesting that [Appellant] had an undisclosed partner in his depraved, murderous endeavor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   PCRA Court Opinion, 4/13/16, at 12). Additionally, Appellant disagrees with the PCRA court's conclusion that \"the primary use of the DNA evidence is for impeachment: to quibble with the verdict and Evans'[s] credibility.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   While I agree with Appellant that the PCRA court erred with respect to these conclusions, I cannot agree that this entitles\n   Appellant to relief. In considering both the materiality and the exculpatory nature of the DNA evidence, the presence of semen in the victim's body from someone other than Appellant\n   <strong>\n    could\n   </strong>\n   implicate an accomplice, as the PCRA court suggested. However, it is equally likely that this evidence could lead to the conclusion that the victim had sexual intercourse, consensual or otherwise, with someone other than Appellant or an accomplice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Furthermore, the presence of semen from someone other than Appellant is in no way exculpatory as to Appellant's first-degree murder conviction. In DNA testing cases, \"a test that is favorable to the petitioner does not guarantee acquittal. An absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Kunco\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349113\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/817/#p824\">\n    173 A.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (Pa. Super. 2017). As I have repeatedly noted above, rape was never the basis for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The fact that the semen found in the victim did not match Appellant's DNA is not an exoneration. Simply stated, the DNA evidence does not exculpate Appellant of first-degree murder, and it does not necessarily prove that Appellant did not sexually assault the victim. In other words, Appellant could have sexually assaulted the victim without leaving semen in or on the victim's body. The only fact of which the DNA is conclusive is that Appellant's DNA was not found inside or on the victim. Thus, despite the PCRA court's speculation concerning a third party, I agree that Appellant is not entitled to PCRA relief based on the absence of a DNA match to Appellant. I reiterate that Appellant's cellmate, Mr. Evans, testified and his testimony was found credible. As an appellate court, we do not disturb credibility determinations that are supported by the record.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wholaver\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349738\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/136/#p144\">\n    177 A.3d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I discern no error in the degree-of-guilt panel finding that Mr. Evans was credible, and I conclude there is no basis upon which to disturb the panel's findings of credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Although the DNA taken from the seminal fluid found on the victim does not match Appellant, the semen was but one factor at Appellant's degree-of-guilt hearing. The Majority states that \"[t]he proper focus is whether the after-discovered evidence significantly refutes an assertion on which the Degree of Guilt Panel and the Commonwealth placed significant weight.\" Majority Opinion, at 302. However, the Majority cites no authority for this parallel \"significance\" standard. Additionally, the Majority errantly states that the degree of guilt panel \"placed significant weight on the theory that Appellant murdered the victim\n   <strong>\n    while raping her\n   </strong>\n   .\" Majority Opinion, at 305 (emphasis added). As I pointed out\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there was no finding of rape, and the semen evidence was not the lynchpin of the degree-of-guilt panel's conclusion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 763 PGH 97 (unpublished memorandum at *4) (\"\n   <strong>\n    the presence of semen and the identity of the person from whom the semen originated, was not a major consideration in the determination of first-degree murder\n   </strong>\n   \"). Once again, I emphasize that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   The testimony before the court is also consistent with a slaying in the perpetration of a forceful rape which would constitute murder in the second degree.\n   <strong>\n    However, having concluded that [Appellant] is guilty of an intentional killing, we need not further pursue the theory of felony murder.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Degree-of-Guilt Court Opinion, 7/18/77, at 7 (emphasis added). Reviewing this statement, it cannot be concluded that the degree-of-guilt panel \"significantly relied\" on the rape theory; rather, the rape theory was espoused purely as a possible alternative basis for conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The absence of a DNA match does not establish Appellant's innocence-Appellant's argument is an indictment of Mr. Evans's testimony and the PCRA court's credibility determinations. Were it necessary to address this issue, I would conclude that Appellant is entitled to no relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Finally, Appellant claims that the PCRA court erred by not addressing Appellant's \"claim that his constitutional rights independently compel a new trial.\" Appellant's Brief at 49. Appellant argues the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   [Appellant] has been imprisoned for almost forty years under a theory based on evidence of seminal fluid that we now know was wrongly used against him. The newly discovered DNA evidence dramatically undercuts the claim that he murdered [the victim] in the course of a sexual assault and creates reasonable doubt as to the element of intent. The PCRA court did not, however, address [Appellant's] claim that his continued incarceration despite this new evidence violates due process under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. For that reason as well, this Court should at the very least remand for further proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Although he phrases this argument in terms of his rights under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, Appellant's argument, in reality, is a catchall claim suggesting that this Court should remand for the PCRA court to reconsider its decision. I am satisfied that the review conducted by this Court and the PCRA court provided the protections Appellant is afforded under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The DNA evidence does not prove, as Appellant suggests, that he is innocent of first-degree murder-it does not even prove that he did not sexually assault the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In conclusion, the degree-of-guilt panel relied significantly on Mr. Evans's testimony. Degree-of-Guilt Court Opinion, 7/18/77, at 6. The newly discovered DNA evidence does not disturb or negate the degree-of-guilt panel's determination that Mr. Evan's was credible.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wholaver\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349738\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/177/136/#p144\">\n    177 A.3d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I discern no error in the degree-of-guilt panel's reliance on Mr. Evans's testimony, and I conclude that this testimony supported a finding of first-degree murder. As noted herein, the absence of Appellant's DNA does not prove that Appellant did not sexually assault the victim, and I do not find that the result of the underlying proceedings would have been different even in light of the DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, I would affirm the decision of the PCRA court.

This is wrong. As noted, the degree-of-guilt court found that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    [t]he specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute murder in the first degree may be found from the circumstances surrounding the slaying together with all reasonable inferences therefrom....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    In this case not only do the circumstances point to the conclusion that the slaying of [the victim] was willful, deliberate and premeditated,\n    <strong>\n     but [Appellant's] admission to his cellmate verifies that conclusion and removes all doubt\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Degree-of-Guilt Court Opinion, 7/18/77, at 6 (emphasis added). These findings reveal that the degree-of-guilt court relied on the credible testimony of Mr. Evans and not exclusively or \"clearly\" on the presence of seminal fluid.
