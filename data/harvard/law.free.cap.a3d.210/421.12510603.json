The parties were directed to appear and show cause why this case should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the memoranda of the parties and the arguments by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. We proceed to decide this case without further briefing and argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The facts and travel of this case, taken from the pleadings and memoranda of the parties, are not in dispute. In February 2015, the union and the school committee began negotiations for a successor agreement to the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) that was due to expire on August 31, 2015. Mediation subsequently ensued, and a tentative agreement for a six-month contract, from September 1, 2015, to February 28, 2016, was reached on August 11, 2015. The tentative agreement provided that the terms of the existing contract would remain in place for an additional six months, \"unless a successor agreement is earlier agreed to by the parties\n   <em>\n    and ratified by the Middletown Council.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) The parties also agreed that the tentative agreement would \"\n   <em>\n    not be binding on the parties unless and until it is ratified by the Middletown Town Council.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) On September 21, 2015, the town council declined to ratify the tentative agreement. The union filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 2, 2015, the union filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was subsequently filed on November 13, 2015. The genesis of this case relates to a November 2012 amendment to the Middletown Town Charter (the amendment) that provides that all collective-bargaining agreements affecting any department of town government, including the school department, \"shall have no force or effect until and unless they are first ratified by a majority vote of the town council.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The union sought a declaration that, under the so-called \"Michaelson Act,\" the 2012 amendment \"does not give the Town any authority to approve or reject a six-month contract reached between the Union and the School Committee[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The union also alleged that the rejection of the six-month agreement by the town council was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The union also requested a declaration that the amendment does not vest the town council with any authority, express or implied, over the contracts reached between the union and the school committee, and further that, if the amendment applied to the school committee, then \"[a]ll of the obligations previously held by the School Committee must be assigned to the Town Council[,]\" effectively nullifying the Michaelson Act. The union also sought a somewhat doomsday-like judicial declaration that, if \"the Michaelson Act [does] not apply to either the Union or to the Town[,]\" then \"there are no applicable statutory dispute resolution procedures to resolve contract disputes between the Town and the Union[,]\" including the prohibition against teacher strikes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Additionally, the union sought a declaration that, when the General Assembly ratified the amendment in 2012, \"the General Assembly did not expand the scope of the Town Council's authority as it relates to certified teachers as purported by the Town Council.\" The union also sought injunctive relief \"in conjunction with the declaratory judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that this Court \"has twice upheld and enforced a nearly identical\n   ratification requirement that existed as a local ordinance in the City of Providence, even without legislative ratification\"; and, citing to\n   <em>\n    Providence Teachers Union v. Providence School Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924729\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/689/384/#p386\">\n    689 A.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (R.I. 1996), and\n   <em>\n    Providence City Council v. Cianci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11325868\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/650/499/#p501\">\n    650 A.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 (R.I. 1994), defendants argued that \"this well-settled precedent, and the clear and unambiguous language of the Town's legislatively ratified Charter,\" are dispositive of the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While defendants' motion for summary judgment was pending, the parties agreed to a new three-year CBA, effective from September 1, 2015, to August 31, 2018. On April 18, 2016, the town council voted to ratify the agreement. Thus, the issue of mootness came to the forefront of this case. Although defendants maintained that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits, in a supplemental memorandum in support of summary judgment, defendants also argued that the newly reached 2015-2018 three-year CBA rendered this dispute moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The union argued that the case was \"not moot because it is capable of repetition yet evading review, which is a very well known exception to the doctrine of mootness.\" According to the union, the issue was important because \"when the School Committee comes to the table, and when they know that what they are doing must be ratified by the Town Council, then it alters the sc[o]pe of the very negotiations[,]\" because if the union knows \"that ultimately we have to bring the deal back to the Town Council, it alters everything; and if we know that we don't have to, it alters everything.\" When asked if the requests for declaratory relief before the court pertained to the six-month CBA or the three-year CBA, the union responded that both contracts were before the court. The union argued that, although some of the declaratory relief it was seeking related only to the rejected six-month tentative agreement, \"the overall legal question which is, does the School Committee have the authority to enter into its own contracts[,]\" related to either a CBA \"or any other contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After reviewing the undisputed facts of the case, the trial justice quoted\n   <em>\n    Boyer v. Bedrosian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309912\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/259/\">\n    57 A.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 2012), for the proposition that a case becomes moot \"if there is no continuing stake in the controversy, or if the court's judgment would fail to have any practical effect on the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7309912\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/57/259/\">\n    57 A.3d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial justice concluded that, although at the time the amended complaint was filed the town council had rejected the six-month agreement that was reached by the parties, a new three-year CBA had been negotiated and ratified by the town council since then. Thus, he concluded that, \"while a justiciable controversy existed at the time the complaint was filed, the ratification of the new [CBA] appears to have deprived the Union of any continuing stake in this controversy.\" In granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, the trial justice declined to reach the merits of defendants' legal arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial justice also rejected the narrow exception to the mootness doctrine that is available when the issue is one of extreme public importance yet is capable of evading review. The trial justice did not address whether the issues raised in the union's complaint are of extreme public importance. He concluded, however, that, while repetition of the same issue was possible, the union had not adequately demonstrated \"why the issue is one that would evade review[.]\" The trial justice stated that, in the event the issue arose again, the union could file another declaratory-judgment action. Accordingly, he granted defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   motion for summary judgment, based on mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The union filed a timely notice of appeal on September 2, 2016. While this appeal was pending in this Court, the parties negotiated another CBA. Significantly, there was no effort by the parties to expedite this case in this Court. At oral argument, it was disclosed that, since the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants, the parties have entered into yet another three-year CBA, effective September 2018 through August 2021. The town council ratified the contract in the same manner as the 2015-2018 CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before this Court, the union assigns error to the decision of the trial justice declaring that this controversy is moot. The union argues that the issue before the court was not made moot because the parties entered into a new three-year CBA. The union posits that because \"[n]either the Union, nor the Town, have conceded their positions on the application of the Charter provision * * * the dispute remains live.\" It is the union's contention that \"the dispute is centered on the interpretation of an existing Charter provision.\" According to the union, declaratory relief \"would have a practical effect on an existing controversy in that a judgment in favor of the Union would mean that any agreements negotiated between the School Committee and the Union do not need to be ratified by the Town.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The union also argues that, even if this Court were to deem the controversy moot, \"the dispute will certainly continue so long as the parties' collective bargaining relationship exists[,]\" and therefore is both capable of repetition and, the union submits, of great public interest, and should be addressed under the exception to the mootness doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court employs a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review when confronted with a grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Sacco v.

The issue that brought the union to the Superior Court-the town council's 2015 rejection of the six-month contract extension-has not arisen again. The first agreement, which was effective until August 31, 2018, was negotiated and approved by the town council and was in place before the trial justice was called upon to consider defendants' motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in granting summary judgment on the basis of mootness; there simply was no justiciable controversy before him. Our opinion is further buttressed by the fact that yet another CBA was reached by the parties and approved by the town council. We are hard-pressed to conclude that the union, having reached two successor agreements since this case was filed, has a continuing stake in the outcome of this controversy. \"This Court will not review a case in which the parties no longer have an articulable stake in the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    H.V.

Furthermore, this Court has \"been loath to relax the rule insisting upon an actual, justiciable controversy in situations in which the subject matter of a case merely relates to ordinary contract disputes * * *\n   <em>\n    or to the binding effect of a collective bargaining agreement involving public school teachers.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11885785\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/703/748/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The union has failed to convince us that the case at bar involves constitutional issues, a person's livelihood, or a person's right to vote. As in\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , this case pertains to the application of a municipality's charter and, as the union candidly admitted, the practical effect the amendment may have on the scope of its future contract negotiations. The union offered no argument relative to the extreme public importance of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Turning to the question of whether this case is capable of repetition yet will evade review, we note at the outset that this issue has arisen during the successful ratification of the two CBAs that were entered into by the parties. The current CBA does not expire until 2021. The union asserts that \"while the dispute here arose in the context of collective bargaining[,] it has nothing to do with any provision of the CBA that has since expired or been replaced[,]\" but instead \"the dispute is centered on the interpretation of an existing Charter provision.\" According to the union, the doctrine of mootness simply does not apply when a newly negotiated \"CBA does not resolve the dispute[.]\" We respectfully suggest that this is not the law. The union voluntarily entered into contract negotiations and reached another CBA that was approved by the town council. The union did not request that the case be expedited before it undertook negotiations for the latest CBA that runs until 2021. This interregnum simply is not so inherently short that this case would perpetually evade review should the issue reoccur.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Cranston v.

Instead, the union seeks a judicial declaration concerning the effect of the charter provision-a question that will affect all future CBAs that the union and the school committee negotiate. Again, the three-year timeframe is not the determinative factor here. While we did state in\n    <em>\n     Local 1033\n    </em>\n    that \"[t]he three-year term of a collective-bargaining agreement, however, is not of such an 'inherently brief duration' that it would 'almost invariably be too short to enable full litigation on the merits[,]' \" I emphasize that my conclusion here does not rely on the time period of the parties' CBAs.\n    <em>\n     See Local 1033\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8193637\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/960/529/#p536\">\n     960 A.2d at 536\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Driver v.

Instead, I believe that the crux of the matter is the fact that the parties will constantly renegotiate successor CBAs, and the fact that the town could assert a veto authority pursuant to the charter in each instance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, I considered several scenarios to determine if this issue is capable of evading review. In the first scenario, I imagined that the union could file for declaratory judgment at the start of the next negotiation, to obtain resolution of the question of the town's authority under the charter. However, that scenario would require that the union wait for the judicial process to interpret the town's authority; and, in the meantime, the union would be forced to halt all negotiations and refuse any further offers or attempts to reach an agreement. As discussed above, such an approach would collide with the union's duty to negotiate on behalf of its members; this scenario would thwart that duty. Moreover, as the facts of this case exhibit, when the parties cannot initially reach an agreement, they typically pursue mediation and continue negotiating until an agreement is reached. Thus, to suggest that the union refile a claim for declaratory judgment the next time the parties return to negotiate would equate to this Court forcing the union to decide between\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    obtaining an answer as to the town's authority under the charter\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    fulfilling its mandated duty to negotiate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Similarly, to suggest that the union should seek declaratory judgment if and when the town rejects a proposed CBA in the future would also effectively force the union to forgo its duty to negotiate on behalf of its members. While I acknowledge that it very well could be the case that the town continues to approve CBAs negotiated and ratified by the union and the school committee, the question of the town's authority has a continuing effect on the negotiations because the town's interest as a nonpresent third party with veto power will inevitably be a consideration in\n    the negotiation process between the union and the school committee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In either scenario, the union would be required to wait a length of time that could amount to years for a case to be litigated to its completion in order to preserve its declaratory-judgment claim. The union, in the meantime, would be forced to decline to further negotiate. Thus, without forcing the union to decide between seeking a judicial declaration as to the town's authority under the charter and fulfilling its duty to negotiate on behalf of its members, I cannot fathom a situation in which the union could obtain declaratory judgment to resolve the question of whether the town has the authority to accept or reject a CBA negotiated by the union and the school committee. This Court's determination that the union's claim is moot and that the exception does not apply creates a \"catch-22\" scenario for the union and will, as a matter of practicality, deprive the union of its ability to seek a declaratory judgment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Therefore, because the charter is effective indefinitely and will come into play each and every time the parties return to the negotiating table, and because the union could receive an answer only in the event it neglects its obligation to negotiate with the school committee in the future, thus affecting the livelihood of the union members, the controversy is capable of repetition yet evading review, and the mootness exception should apply. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-58\">\n     \"The term 'catch-22' derives from a Joseph Heller novel by the same name.
