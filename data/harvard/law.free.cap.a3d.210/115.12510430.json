Ferrari, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., and Synthes, Inc. The plaintiff claims that the court erred by holding that (1) he cannot prove that the defendants' product was defective, or that the product's alleged defect caused the plaintiff's injury, without the use of expert testimony, and (2) the learned intermediary doctrine barred the plaintiff's failure to warn claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On August 17, 2012, the plaintiff underwent spinal surgery at Hartford Hospital. The procedure included a posterolateral fusion, in which the plaintiff's surgeon, Dr. Paul Schwartz, implanted various components of the defendants' product, the Synthes Matrix spinal system (product). This system included stabilizing titanium rods that were used in the fusion of the plaintiff's spine. The plaintiff's surgery required a junction of the new titanium hardware with a previously placed steel construct. On April 4, 2013, the plaintiff underwent a second surgery, which revealed a fracture of the left titanium rod at the junction of the new titanium instrumentation with the old steel construct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 7, 2016, the plaintiff served a four count complaint on the defendants. The first two counts alleged product defect claims pursuant to the Connecticut Product Liability Act, General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq. Specifically, the plaintiff set forth claims involving\n   (1) a failure to warn defect\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) a design defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The third and fourth counts alleged breaches of express and implied warranties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The deadline for the plaintiff to disclose any expert witnesses was January 15,\n   2017, pursuant to the parties' mutually agreed on scheduling order. The plaintiff failed to disclose any expert witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 17, 2017, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the plaintiff had failed to disclose an expert witness, (2) the plaintiff could not establish that the product was defective, (3) comment (k) to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts barred the plaintiff's claims, (4) the learned intermediary doctrine barred the plaintiff's claims, and (5) the plaintiff could not establish causation. On July 10, 2017, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, claiming that a\n   product defect can be inferred from the evidence without expert testimony and that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether there were adequate warnings. A hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment was held on July 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court issued its memorandum of decision on November 28, 2017, granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before addressing the plaintiff's claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review of a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment. \"Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

In response, the defendants argue that expert testimony\n   was required for the plaintiff to prevail on his claims, as a matter of law. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendants submitted numerous exhibits in support of their motion for summary judgment, including Dr. Schwartz' notes, the transcript of Dr. Schwartz' deposition, and a copy of the product insert that contained warnings with respect to the use of the defendants' product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The product's insert explained that nonunion\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   could result from the product's use. The insert provided in relevant part: \"These devices can break when subjected to the increased loading associated with delayed union\n   or nonunion. Internal fixation appliances are load-sharing devices which hold a fracture in alignment until healing occurs. If healing is delayed, or does not occur, the implant could eventually break due to metal fatigue. Loads produced by weight-bearing and activity levels will dictate the longevity of the implant. The patient should understand that stress on an implant can involve more than weight-bearing. In the absence of solid bony union, the weight of the limb alone, muscular forces associated with moving a limb, or repeated stresses of apparent relatively small magnitude, can result in the failure of the implant.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that, without expert testimony to establish the existence of a defect and the element of causation, the plaintiff could not, as a matter of law, maintain a breach of warranty claim or a strict liability design defect claim against the defendants. The court concluded that, under the modified consumer expectation test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff could not prove that the defendants' product was defective without the use of expert testimony. With respect to causation, the trial court determined that the product was of a complex design, and that \"[e]xpert testimony is thus essential, because the claims will raise and address complex and highly technical concepts and questions, which are clearly beyond the everyday experiences of the ordinary consumer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and relevant legal principles that guide our analysis. \"Our Supreme Court has described the essential elements of a strict products liability claim as follows: (1) the defendant was engaged in the business of selling the product; (2) the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the\n   consumer or user; (3) the defect caused the injury for which compensation was sought; (4) the defect existed at the time of the sale; and (5) the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in the condition.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Theodore\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lifeline Systems Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489972\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/654/#p308\">\n    173 Conn.

Those\n   discussions were in the nature of technical assistance, including the product to be used in the surgery and the properties thereof, including the size and type.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, at the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff's counsel argued: \"[Dr. Schwartz] testified that ultimately it was his decision.
