Following the confirmation of the arbitration award, the plaintiff commenced the present action seeking attorney's fees, pursuant to a contract between it and the defendant, for its prosecution of the fee dispute. After a trial to the court, the trial court rendered judgment in the defendant's favor, from which the plaintiff now appeals. The plaintiff claims on appeal that the court erred in concluding that it was not entitled to attorney's fees because it had represented itself, through its sole member, in the arbitration and award confirmation proceedings. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiff's claim. On December 1, 2011, the parties entered into an agreement for legal services (retainer agreement) whereby they agreed, in paragraph 12, that in the event the defendant failed to pay the plaintiff its agreed on fee or expenses, he would be liable for \"all costs related to a collection action including [the plaintiff's] attorney's fees and interest at the annual rate of ten percent ....\" On March 3, 2014, the plaintiff petitioned the legal fee resolution board of the Connecticut Bar Association (board) to resolve a fee dispute that had arisen between the parties. On December 24, 2014, a panel of three arbitrators found that the plaintiff was owed $ 109,683 in fees for its representation of the defendant. The plaintiff subsequently filed an application to confirm the arbitration award in the Superior Court, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Scholl, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted on March 17, 2015. The defendant appealed to this court, which affirmed the trial court's judgment confirming the arbitration award, and our Supreme Court denied the defendant's petition for certification to appeal.

Attorney\n   Edward Rosenthal, the sole member of the plaintiff, represented the plaintiff throughout the proceedings before the board and in the trial and appellate courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 1, 2016, the plaintiff commenced the present action alleging, inter alia, that the defendant breached the retainer agreement by failing and refusing to pay for the legal services it had rendered and that, as a result, it suffered damages\n   in the form of \"considerable time [spent] in collecting its fees from the defendant\" in arbitration and the related court proceedings. As clarified in its trial brief, the plaintiff sought to recover the attorney's fees and interest prescribed by paragraph 12 of the retainer agreement. More specifically, the plaintiff claimed that it had incurred $ 59,600 in \"legal fees\" in connection with the arbitration and related court proceedings, which reflected the time spent by Rosenthal on these matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 18, 2017, following a trial to the court, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Shapiro, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision in which it concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover attorney's fees under paragraph 12 of the retainer agreement because it had effectively represented itself throughout the proceedings at issue, and \"[t]he law of this state is that pro se litigants are not entitled to attorney's fees.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's sole claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in determining that the law barring self-represented nonattorney litigants from recovering statutory attorney's fees also precludes a self-represented\n   law firm from recovering contractual attorney's fees. The plaintiff argues that the portion of\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   relied on by the trial court is mere dictum. The plaintiff alternatively argues that we should overrule this portion of\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   because it is based on a \"serious misinterpretation\" of\n   <em>\n    Lev\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree that the statement in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   concerning self-represented attorney litigants is dictum and decline the plaintiff's invitation to revisit the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Preliminarily, we note that, because the plaintiff's appeal concerns the trial court's interpretation and application of the law to the undisputed facts of this case, our standard of review is plenary.

In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , both parties had raised and discussed in their appellate\n   briefs the question of whether self-represented attorneys may recover attorney's fees for the time spent litigating their own causes and had directed the court's attention to the conflicting authorities on the subject. See footnotes 2 and 4 of this opinion. The court intentionally took up and analyzed the issue and concluded that the general rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Lev\n   </em>\n   would bar the plaintiff attorneys in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   from recovering attorney's fees. Although the court discussed the\n   issue only briefly, there is nothing in its opinion or the record to suggest that its conclusion was less carefully reasoned than it might otherwise have been. In sum, the court's conclusion cannot reasonably be characterized as a merely casual, passing comment made without analysis or due consideration of conflicting authorities. It is clear that the court made a deliberate decision to resolve this issue and that it undeniably decided it. Accordingly, the court's conclusion that self-represented attorney litigants cannot recover attorney's fees constitutes an alternative holding, not dictum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We, therefore, disagree with the plaintiff that the trial court in the present case improperly treated this portion of\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   as binding precedent.
