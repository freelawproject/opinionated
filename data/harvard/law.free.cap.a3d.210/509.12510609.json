Following a jury trial at which the driver of the vehicle testified against him, the defendant was convicted of one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The Appellate Court thereafter rejected the defendant's claim that he was entitled to a new trial because (1) the admission of hearsay statements used to establish that he was the de facto owner of the vehicle-based on vehicle inspection records-violated his constitutional right to confront a witness against him, and (2) improper statements in the prosecutor's closing argument violated his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489836\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/43/#p7\">\n    173 Conn.

We granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal to this court. We affirm the Appellate Court's judgment, albeit under different reasoning on the first issue. We conclude that admission of the hearsay statement was not an error of constitutional dimension and that the defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the evidentiary error was harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, the state proved its case against the defendant largely though the testimony of three witnesses: the defendant's girlfriend, Winsome Lawrence, who was the driver of the vehicle; Lawrence's cousin, Charmaine Henriques; and Sergeant Gary Angon of the Waterbury Police Department. In addition, the state introduced into evidence a surveillance video reflecting the defendant's conduct preceding his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lawrence offered the following account of the events leading to that arrest. The defendant lives in the Bronx,\n   New York, where he operates a used car business under the name of Sinclair Enterprise. On multiple occasions between October, 2012, and February, 2013, the defendant and Lawrence drove to Connecticut for various purposes. On each such occasion, the defendant drove a tan Jeep to Lawrence's house in Mount Vernon, New York, and then directed Lawrence to drive while the defendant sat in the passenger seat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 5, 2013, the defendant had Lawrence drive the Jeep to Waterbury, purportedly to go to a shopping mall. When they arrived in Waterbury, the defendant instructed Lawrence to exit the highway and eventually directed her to a side street, where he told her to stop the car. Shortly thereafter, when a black vehicle came toward the Jeep, the defendant directed Lawrence to sound the horn. The driver of the black vehicle made a U turn and parked a few cars ahead of the Jeep. To Lawrence's surprise, the defendant then accessed a hidden compartment within the center console of the Jeep and removed two white packages of drugs. He took the packages to the black vehicle, gave them to someone inside, and walked back toward the Jeep with money in hand. Just then a marked police car slowly drove down the street toward the Jeep. When the defendant got into the Jeep, Lawrence saw that he no longer had the money in hand and asked him where it was. The defendant said that he had thrown it into a bush. He then directed Lawrence to drive to a nearby gas station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After they arrived at the gas station, the defendant called someone on his cell phone and said, \"Jay, come and pick me up, I'm going for the money, I'm going to pick up the money.\" The defendant then told Lawrence that he needed to get a bag, and he went into the gas\n   station convenience store. After he returned to the Jeep, the same black vehicle involved in the earlier transaction pulled into the gas station. The defendant exited the Jeep and got into the black vehicle. The vehicle departed and then returned soon afterward. When the defendant returned to the Jeep, he had a black bag filled with money, which he placed in the Jeep's hidden compartment. He then directed Lawrence to drive to the mall in Waterbury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sergeant Angon offered the following account of the circumstances that followed. Waterbury police organized surveillance of the area near the Brass Mill Mall on the basis of an anonymous tip that the department received earlier in the day regarding drug activity that allegedly was going to occur that evening. At approximately 8 p.m., Angon saw a tan Jeep coming off the exit ramp of Interstate 84 near the mall, which fit the description of the vehicle that the department had been given. He and his partner conducted a motor vehicle stop. Upon approaching the Jeep, Angon observed that the defendant appeared unusually nervous. When Angon asked the defendant who owned the Jeep, the defendant replied that it was his \"friend's.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A police detective from the department arrived with a narcotics detection canine and conducted a detection sweep of the Jeep. The dog alerted to the driver's side door and then to the center console. Angon and another officer then inspected the center console and discovered the hidden compartment beneath it. Therein they found a black bag containing $12,248 and ten bricks of what was later established to be heroin; each brick comprised of approximately 1000 prepackaged bags of heroin. The heroin had an estimated street value of between $45,000 and $60,000. The cash recovered from the compartment was consistent with the price of two\n   bricks of heroin. The police officers placed the defendant and Lawrence under arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Henriques, Lawrence's cousin, testified that the defendant provided money to help pay Lawrence's bond after the defendant\n   and Lawrence were arrested. She further testified that when she met with the defendant to ask for his help, he told her that he \"was trying a thing and [got] fucked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to this testimony, the jury viewed a surveillance video from the gas station for the period at issue. In the video, the defendant enters the convenience store and returns to the Jeep, carrying a beverage; no bag is in view. A black vehicle then arrives, and the defendant immediately gets into the rear right passenger seat of that vehicle. The vehicle leaves and then returns approximately ten minutes later. The defendant gets back into the Jeep, and the Jeep departs. The driver of the black vehicle exits that vehicle and enters the convenience store. Angon identified that person, Terence Saunders, as a heroin dealer in Waterbury. Angon also testified that most of the heroin sold in Waterbury comes from the Bronx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to this evidence regarding the incident in question, the state attempted to demonstrate that the defendant was the de facto owner of the Jeep. Angon testified that he had run a law enforcement query, which revealed that the Jeep was registered to a third party, Victor A. Manana, at an address in the Bronx.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Angon testified that, in his experience, drug dealers commonly register their vehicles in someone else's name and have\n   someone else drive, so that if they come in contact with the police, they are not directly linked to the vehicle. Over the defendant's objections, Angon then was permitted to testify that the Jeep had been inspected at Manny's Auto. He testified that a Google search revealed an address for Manny's Auto and a photograph of that location, which showed Manny's Auto to be located adjacent to Sinclair Enterprise, the defendant's used car business. Angon explained that certain inspection information had been elicited by someone in his department from the New York State Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant testified on his own behalf. According to the defendant, the tan Jeep belonged to Lawrence, and she was the \"friend\" to whom he was referring when responding to Angon's question of who owned the Jeep. He claimed that he had accompanied Lawrence to Connecticut on only one other occasion prior to this incident and was unaware that there were drugs in the Jeep. He admitted that he had asked Lawrence to stop at the gas station but claimed that it was for the purpose of meeting someone named Paul, who was interested in selling a vehicle to the defendant. According to the defendant, Paul was a passenger in the black vehicle that came to the gas station. The defendant joined Paul in the black vehicle, along with two individuals not known to the defendant, and drove to look at the vehicle Paul wished to sell. When they could not agree on a price, they returned to the gas station. Lawrence then drove the Jeep toward the mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant's inculpation of Lawrence was lent marginal support by DNA testing performed by the state forensic laboratory on the packaging of the heroin and a strap used as a component of the hidden compartment in the Jeep. The defendant was excluded as a contributor to any of the DNA samples they were able to recover. Lawrence was excluded as a contributor to all but one\n   sample, which had insufficient material to rule her out as a contributor.\n   The jury found the defendant guilty of the charge of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent. The court subsequently sentenced him to an eight year term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming that (1) the admission of Angon's hearsay testimony concerning the Jeep's inspection site violated the defendant's rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, and (2) numerous improprieties during the prosecutor's closing argument violated the defendant's due process right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A divided Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489836\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/43/#p7\">\n    173 Conn.

Judge Beach dissented in part, concluding that the admission of the inspection testimony was in fact a violation of the confrontation clause and that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489836\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/43/#p7\">\n    Id., at 28-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489836\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/43/#p7\">\n    162 A.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This court granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal, initially limited to the issues of\n   whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that any \"presumed violation\" of the defendant's confrontation clause rights was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that acts of prosecutorial impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489920,12489924\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/326/904/\">\n    326 Conn. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489922,12489923,12489924\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/1205/\">\n    163 A.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). In his brief to this court, the defendant addressed the threshold issue that the Appellate Court majority assumed but did not decide, asserting that the improperly admitted evidence amounted to constitutional, not merely evidentiary, error. In its responsive brief, the state asserted that this issue is outside the scope of the certified question and declined to address it. At oral argument, the state suggested that if we were to disagree with the Appellate Court's assessment of harm, that court could address the substantive issue on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This court subsequently issued an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following issues: (1) \"Did the evidence establishing that the Jeep had been inspected at a repair shop located adjacent to the defendant's business constitute testimonial hearsay for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    124 S.

The defendant claims that this evidence constituted testimonial hearsay admitted in violation of his constitutional rights. The defendant further contends that the improper admission of this evidence was harmful, irrespective of whether it is reviewed under the standard of\n   harm for constitutional error or evidentiary error. The state concedes that the inspection testimony was hearsay but contends that it is nontestimonial. The state further contends that its erroneous admission was not harmful, no matter what standard is applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whether the admission of the contested testimony was constitutional error or merely evidentiary error will dictate which party bears the burden of proof as to harm and the extent of that burden. \"[I]f an [evidentiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.... When an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Osimanti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344901\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/1/#p16\">\n    299 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20A.3d%20790\">\n    6 A.3d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the basis of the record before this court, we are compelled to conclude that the statements regarding the inspection were nontestimonial.

He argued that cross-examination had revealed that Angon did not obtain the information firsthand but, rather, secondhand from an unidentified person. As such, he submitted that this testimony was double hearsay \"at best\" and that its admission violated the defendant's rights under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   to confront witnesses against him. The trial court denied the motion, stating that the jury could determine what weight to give the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We begin our analysis of the importance of Angon's testimony with the observation that there are three layers of potential hearsay imbedded in it: (1) the New York inspection record itself; (2) the statement by a New York State Police employee relaying information in that record to a Waterbury Police Department employee; and (3) the statement by the Waterbury police employee relaying this information to Angon. There is no dispute\n   that these out-of-court statements were admitted for the truth of the matter asserted and therefore constitute hearsay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   Conn.

Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the ... evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial.... [T]he proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by the error....

See General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 21a-278 (b). Because both the defendant and Lawrence were in the vehicle at the time of the police stop and the drugs were in a hidden compartment, the state had to prove the defendant's constructive possession of the narcotics at trial. \"Where the defendant is not in exclusive possession of the premises where the narcotics are found, it may not be inferred that [the defendant] knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to buttress such an inference....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [Although] mere presence is not enough to support an inference of dominion\n   or control, where there are other pieces of evidence tying the defendant to dominion and control, the [finder of fact is] entitled to consider the fact of [the defendant's] presence and to draw inferences from that presence and the other circumstances linking [the defendant] to the crime.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bruno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147653\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/127/#p136\">\n    293 Conn. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136-37,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20A.2d%201253\">\n    975 A.2d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   There were plenty of circumstances other than the defendant's presence in the Jeep linking him to the crime of possession with intent to sell. Although Lawrence and the defendant pointed the finger at the other at trial, the jury reasonably could have found Lawrence credible as to the defendant's actions, even if it did not credit her testimony that she had no knowledge that the drugs were in the Jeep. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344689\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/640/#p648\">\n    299 Conn. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%20663\">\n    11 A.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"[t]he trier of fact may credit part of a witness' testimony and reject other parts\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Her testimony was corroborated by many facts independent of the inspection information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The defendant admitted to Henriques, in so many words, that he was the one who was selling the narcotics. He provided $4000 to help Lawrence make bail. The defendant was in the company of a known Waterbury heroin dealer just before a large quantity of heroin, packaged for sale, was discovered in the car in which he was a passenger. As we explain later, it was clear that the defendant was well acquainted with this person. During the motor vehicle stop, the defendant appeared more nervous than the average person who is subject to such a stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The defendant's own account of the events on the night in question was manifestly not credible. He initially testified on direct examination that the purpose of the February 5, 2013 trip was to go to \"the casino\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   with Lawrence, a trip that he claimed they had made before. The defendant later admitted that he had never been to a casino in Connecticut and did not know how to get there from Waterbury. Thereafter, the defendant offered a different explanation for the February 5 trip. He testified that he and Lawrence had driven to Connecticut that night to look at a used car owned by a man named Paul. The defendant testified that he had never previously spoken to Paul and only learned about him through Lawrence, who had informed the defendant that Paul wanted to sell him a used car. The defendant also claimed not to know any of the other occupants of the black vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The surveillance video tells a different story. It shows a black vehicle arriving at the gas station approximately three minutes after the defendant is seen on his cell phone. The vehicle is being driven by a Waterbury heroin dealer. The defendant walks up to the vehicle as it is pulling into the gas station and, without hesitation, enters the rear passenger seat the moment it stops. The vehicle immediately departs. It strains credulity to believe that neither the defendant nor three purported strangers would take a moment to confirm the identity of the other or to introduce themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The video also reflects that the black vehicle returned to the gas station approximately eleven minutes after it left with the defendant. That brief period of time would be consistent with the time it would take to retrieve something from a known location nearby (the cash in the\n   bush). That period does not seem consistent with the time that it would take to drive the \"mile and a-half [or] two miles down the road\" where the defendant claimed Paul's vehicle was located, to conduct a sufficiently\n   thorough inspection of the vehicle to decide to make an offer, to engage in a failed negotiation on price, and then to return to the gas station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, we observe that evidence independent of the inspection testimony pointed to the defendant as the person having control over the Jeep. The defendant mentioned an unnamed \"friend\" as the Jeep's owner when Angon inquired during the vehicle stop. His post facto claim that the friend to whom he was referring was Lawrence was manifestly not credible given that she was present when he identified the purported owner. Angon testified that it was common for drug dealers to register a vehicle they use for the sale of drugs to another person. The defendant had a used car business, which would provide ready access to vehicles, including those registered to third parties. The Jeep was registered in the name of a person who purportedly lives in the Bronx. The defendant's business is in the Bronx. Angon testified that most heroin sold in Waterbury comes from the Bronx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We conclude that the inspection testimony, while not unimportant, was not of sufficient consequence when viewed in light of the state's relatively strong case against the defendant to persuade us that the improper admission of this evidence had a significant effect on the verdict. Therefore, the defendant has not proved harmful error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, we turn to the defendant's claim that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that, although the prosecutor made certain improper statements during closing argument, those improprieties did not deprive the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"In analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process....

Just like he did with the black bag, right, and then we do send the stuff up there, we know we're not gonna get stuff,\n   <em>\n    usually they use that against us\n   </em>\n   , right, it's a Hobson's choice.\" (Emphasis added.) Then, in response to defense counsel's argument that Lawrence had no difficulty understanding the prosecutor's questions but intentionally failed to understand defense counsel's questions, the prosecutor stated, \"[w]hen you think about [Lawrence's] testimony, think about the manner in which I ask questions, even consider how I was talking. And think about the rocket fire questions from defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    Was he trying to trip her up? Was he trying to put words in her mouth?\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors to the present case, we agree with the Appellate Court that they do not collectively weigh in favor of the defendant. First, defense counsel invited one of the three prosecutorial improprieties regarding his cross-examination of Lawrence. Specifically, defense counsel stated in his closing argument that Lawrence deployed a strategy of claiming she did not understand defense\n   counsel's questions or could not recall the answers, even though she had no difficulty understanding the prosecutor or recalling information necessary to answer his questions. The prosecutor's comment regarding defense counsel's cross-examination technique was an attempt to explain why Lawrence had difficulty with defense counsel's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Second, the improprieties were not particularly severe. The defendant's theory hinged on attacking the credibility of Lawrence, not of the police. None of the improper comments significantly undercuts that theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although one of the problems arising from a\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   violation is that it risks distorting the state's burden of proof; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360131\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/693/#p712\">\n    259 Conn. at 709-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%20226\">\n    793 A.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"such comments excluded possibility that jury could have concluded only that witnesses were probably truthful and defendant was probably lying, thereby preventing jury from 'return[ing] a verdict of not guilty because the evidence might not be sufficient to convict the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt' \" [emphasis omitted] ), the fact that it was not directed at the state's key witness and had no impact on the critical video evidence renders it less serious. Defense counsel objected to only one of the comments-the prosecutor's comment concerning defense counsel's cross-examination of Lawrence-which suggests that the other comments were not viewed as particularly serious. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20604\">\n    308 Conn. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620-21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20503\">\n    65 A.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"[w]hen defense counsel does not object, request a curative instruction or move for a mistrial, he presumably does not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant's right to a fair trial\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). The court sustained that objection, although it declined a subsequent request for a curative instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Third, there were only three brief improper comments, all during rebuttal argument. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360131\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/693/#p712\">\n    259 Conn. at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%20226\">\n    793 A.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding it noteworthy that improper comments occurred in both cross-examination and closing arguments). Those comments can hardly be properly characterized as frequent in the totality of the closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Fourth, although two of the comments related to a critical issue in the case, namely, the credibility of Lawrence and the defendant, the comments only indirectly bolstered Lawrence's credibility or undercut the defendant's credibility. Defense counsel had been able\n   to strongly argue to the jury that Lawrence's testimony was not credible in light of certain impeachment evidence. Although the defendant did rely on the lack of DNA evidence tying him to the narcotics, DNA was not critical to the case, and the comment regarding typical defense strategies regarding such evidence did not place such argument in doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Fifth, the strength of any curative measures does not weigh in favor of either party. The trial court sustained defense counsel's only objection in the presence of the jury but denied his request for a curative instruction. The court properly instructed the jury that nothing the attorneys said was evidence. Further, the court properly instructed the jury that it was free to credit all, some, or none of each witness' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, the state's case was relatively strong. Despite inconsistencies in Lawrence's testimony, which undoubtedly was critical to the case, the video provided neutral evidence that sufficiently corroborated her account of the defendant's conduct. Moreover, the defendant's own testimony, which was internally inconsistent and objectively inconsistent with the video, was strong evidence of his guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We conclude that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have returned a different verdict in the absence of the three relatively inconsequential improprieties. Therefore, the defendant has not met his burden of establishing that he was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In this opinion PALMER, ROBINSON, MULLINS and KAHN, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   D'AURIA, J., concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   I agree with the majority of this court that the Appellate Court's judgment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   However, like the majority of the Appellate Court, I would not reach the thorny constitutional issue that the majority of this court addresses concerning the application of\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    124 S.

In fact, for my purposes, I do not feel the need even to reach the question of whether the trial court committed error as a purely evidentiary matter, although I do not necessarily disagree with the majority on that score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Rather, my review of the record leads me to conclude that any error in the trial court's admission into evidence of the Jeep's inspection information was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as there was overwhelming evidence that the defendant, Casey Sinclair, constructively possessed the narcotics found in that vehicle. Thus, even if I were to assume that the admission of the inspection information gave rise to a constitutional violation, I would hold that the defendant is not entitled to a reversal of the judgment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \"[T]o prove illegal possession of a narcotic substance, it is necessary to establish that the defendant knew the character of the substance, knew of its presence and exercised dominion and control over it.... [When] ... the [narcotics are] not found on the defendant's person, the state must proceed on the theory of constructive possession, that is, possession without direct physical contact.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mangual\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20182\">\n    311 Conn. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20A.3d%20627\">\n    85 A.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). To prove constructive possession of the narcotics, however, the state did not have the burden of proving that the defendant actually owned the vehicle in which the narcotics were found. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Winfrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170447\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/302/195/#p210\">\n    302 Conn. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%201218\">\n    24 A.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (that defendant's wife owned vehicle he was driving that contained contraband was among circumstances from which jury could infer defendant was in constructive possession of narcotics).

There is nothing in the record before us, or in logic, tending to suggest that Angon or any other police officer intentionally elicited the inspection information informally to avoid the confrontation issue. A certified copy of the record would have avoided both the confrontation and hearsay issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    It also seems implausible that the four strangers would have driven off together to allow the defendant to view Paul's vehicle rather than meet where Paul's car purportedly was located a short distance away or have Paul's car brought to the gas station.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    In his brief, the defendant devotes the majority of his argument addressing whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that only three of eleven actions on the part of the prosecutor constituted prosecutorial impropriety. Although the state asserted in its brief that the certified issue before this court is limited to whether the three improprieties identified by the Appellate Court deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial, the state conceded at oral argument that this court may review all of the defendant's additional claims that were raised and rejected, by the Appellate Court. We agree with the Appellate Court that the eight additional claims of prosecutorial impropriety are without merit and do not warrant further analysis.

Unlike much of the evidence the state presented, the vehicle inspection evidence did not directly connect the defendant to the narcotics, nor even directly connect him to the Jeep. Rather, it only connected the Jeep to the garage next to his business. The defendant contends that the jury could have inferred that he actually controlled the vehicle because it was inspected near his business. However, given the testimony of Winsome Lawrence, the defendant's girlfriend, that her Oldsmobile was serviced at Manny's Auto, the jury could also have inferred that Lawrence would have had all her cars serviced or inspected at the same garage, and that Lawrence controlled the Jeep.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    I also agree with part III of the majority's opinion in which it concluded that the defendant did not meet his burden to establish that he was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial as a result of alleged prosecutorial improprieties during closing argument to the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
