Specifically, Liberty Mutual argues that (1) the defects, errors, and omissions exclusion in the insurance policy bars coverage, and (2) the resulting loss clause in the policy does not reinstate coverage. We agree with Liberty Mutual and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The 777 entities are the owners of a high-rise building at 777 Main Street in Hartford (building), which they planned to renovate and convert from an office building into a 285 unit apartment complex. On March 27, 2014, the 777 entities hired Viking Construction, Inc. (Viking), as the general contractor for the renovation. Viking's work on the renovation included cleaning the concrete facade of the building. On October 2, 2014, Viking subcontracted with Armani Restoration, Inc. (Armani), to clean the concrete facade of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From September to December, 2014, Armani cleaned the building's facade using a crushed glass cleaner\n   that was sprayed onto the building using power washers. The cleaning inadvertently damaged the building's approximately 1800 windows, all of which had to be replaced at a cost of over $ 4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July, 2015, the 777 entities claimed coverage of the loss under a builder's risk insurance policy (policy) that they had purchased from Liberty Mutual. This policy, which was in effect when the damage occurred, provides: \"[Liberty Mutual] cover[s] direct physical loss or damage caused by a covered peril\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to 'buildings or structures'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   while in the course of construction, erection, or fabrication.\" (Footnote added.) The policy contains several exclusions, including a \"Defects, Errors, And Omissions\" exclusion, which provides that Liberty Mutual is not responsible for \"loss or damage consisting of, caused by, or resulting from an act, defect, error, or omission (negligent or not) relating to: a) design, specifications, construction, materials, or workmanship; b) planning, zoning, development, siting, surveying, grading, or compaction; or c) maintenance, installation, renovation, remodeling, or repair.\" The exclusion, however, contains an exception, also known as a \"resulting loss\" clause, which provides: \"[I]f an act, defect, error, or omission as described [in the exclusion] results in a covered peril, [Liberty Mutual] do[es] cover the loss or damage caused by that covered peril.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The policy also includes an optional renovation endorsement, which the 777 entities added to the policy because the project involved the renovation of an\n   existing building rather than the construction of a new structure. The renovation endorsement provides: \"[Liberty Mutual] cover[s] direct physical loss or damage caused by a covered peril to 'building materials' and 'existing buildings' that are part of [the 777 entities'] 'rehabilitation or renovation project.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 12, 2015, after investigating the 777 entities' claimed loss under the policy, Liberty Mutual denied coverage. On December 24, 2015, Viking filed an action against 777 Residential, alleging breach of contract on the basis of 777 Residential's alleged refusal \"to remit the outstanding contract balance ... for work Viking performed on the [renovation].\" On May 12, 2016, Viking filed a motion to cite in as defendants, inter alia, 777 Main, Liberty Mutual, and Armani, which the court subsequently granted. On August 19, 2016, the 777 entities filed a cross claim, alleging a breach of contract on the basis of Liberty Mutual's refusal to cover the claimed loss under the policy. In March, 2017, the 777 entities settled their case with Viking and Armani for $ 1.6 million. The 777 entities continue to seek the remaining balance of the cost to replace the windows from Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 6, 2017, after the close of discovery, Liberty Mutual filed a motion for summary judgment on the cross claim. On January 11, 2018, following oral argument on the motion, the trial court denied Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment. In its memorandum of decision on the motion, the court explained that its conclusion was based on a reading of the policy's exclusion in conjunction with the loss peril clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 31, 2018, the 777 entities filed a motion for summary judgment on their cross claim, which the court subsequently granted on February 14, 2018 \"[f]or the reasons stated in the court's memorandum of decision on Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment ....\" On February 16, 2018, the parties filed a stipulation as to the amount of damages. On February 20, 2018, the 777 entities filed a motion for judgment in accordance with the stipulation and Liberty Mutual filed an objection to the motion. On February 22, 2018, the court granted the motion for judgment and rendered judgment on the cross claim in the amount of $ 1,950,000 in favor of the 777 entities \"for the reasons set forth in the court's January 11, 2018, February 14, 2018, and February 22, 2018 memoranda of decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, Liberty Mutual filed the present appeal. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"We begin our analysis with the standard of review applicable to a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A party moving for summary judgment is held to a strict standard.... To satisfy [its] burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent.... When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue.... Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact ... are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact\n   and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45]....

One such undefined word is \"renovate.\" The verb \"renovate\" is defined as \"to restore to a former better state (as\n   by cleaning, repairing, or rebuilding) ....\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003). In the present case, the purpose of Armani's work was to restore the building to a better state by cleaning its facade. In fact, the 777 entities admitted as much in their brief, stating: \"Armani was working on the facade (the\n   <em>\n    renovation\n   </em>\n   work) ....\" (Emphasis added.) On the basis of the plain meaning of the policy, therefore, the cleaning of the building's facade was part of the renovation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having concluded that the cleaning of the building's facade was part of the renovation, we must next determine whether the damage to the windows, which was a direct result of this cleaning, was related to the renovation, thereby triggering the\n   exclusion. The policy also fails to define \"relating to\"; therefore, we must again turn to available dictionary definitions to determine the meaning of the term. \"Related\" is defined as \"connected by reason of an established or discoverable relation ....\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, supra. Additionally, our courts have consistently given the term \"relating to\" a broad meaning that comports with the dictionary definition of the term. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brennan Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147114\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/60/\">\n    293 Conn. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    977 A.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (defining \"relating to\" as \"to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). In the present case, the damage to the windows was not merely connected to the cleaning of the building's facade, it was a direct result of the cleaning. The 777 entities admitted this fact when they stated that \"there simply are not two concurrent causes [of the loss]: Armani accidentally sprayed the cleaning media onto the windows, causing damage.\" Thus, the damage to the windows was related to the renovation, as is required for the exclusion to apply.\n   Additionally, the parties' actions support our conclusion that the windows were part of the renovation. In their renovation plans, the 777 entities contemplated avoiding harm to the windows because the windows were not to be replaced or removed. The specifications of the contract between Viking and the 777 entities set forth Viking's and Armani's obligation to protect adjacent surfaces, which would include the windows, providing that Viking was to \"[p]rotect ... surrounding surfaces of building being restored ... from harm resulting from concrete restoration work.\" Although these specifications were drafted in contemplation of the use of a chemical cleaning media, Armani had a general obligation to avoid damage to adjacent surfaces, as set forth in the \"General Conditions\" provision of Viking's contract with the 777 entities, which provided: \"[Viking] ... shall provide reasonable protection to prevent damage, injury or loss to ... other property at the site or adjacent thereto, such as ... structures and utilities not designated for removal, relocation or replacement ....\" Because Armani's obligations in the performance of its renovation work included avoiding harm to the windows, structures not designated for removal, relocation or replacement, it is difficult to see how the windows and the damage to them is not connected or related to the renovation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In support of its argument, Liberty Mutual cites extensively to cases from other jurisdictions. Although the majority of these cases are unpersuasive, one case,\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Docket No. CIV-11-0036-C (RJC) (W.D. Okla. May 3, 2012), is instructive because it is factually similar to the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the owner of a commercial building filed an insurance claim when the windows of the building were damaged as a result of exterior cleaning.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The insurance company denied the claim, and the building\n   owner sued for, inter alia, breach of contract.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The policy in\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , contained an exclusion that is similar to the exclusion at issue in the present case. The exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , provided: \"[The insurer] will not pay for the cost of correcting defects in Covered Property, or loss or damage to Covered Property that was caused by, resulting from, or arising out of work done on Covered Property by [the insured], [the insured's] employees, or others working on [the insured's] behalf.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Like the 777 entities, the building owner in\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , argued that the\n   exclusion did not apply because \"the damage was not caused by work being done to the glass, but by work being done to the building ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court, however, rejected this argument and granted the insurance company's motion for summary judgment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20107\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Like the court in\n   <em>\n    Golan Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , we are unpersuaded by the 777 entities' argument to the effect that the exclusion is applicable to the cleaning of the building's facade but not to the windows. We conclude that the ordinary meaning of the terms in the policy indicates that the exclusion applies to the windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The 777 entities next argue that the damage to the windows is not barred by the exclusion because the exclusion only applies to the finished product, not to the process implemented by Armani. This reading of the exclusion would render most of the exclusion's language utterly superfluous, contrary to the principle that \"[an insurance] policy should not be interpreted so as to render any part of it superfluous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    R.T.

This interpretation of the exclusion would ignore subsections (b) and (c) of the exclusion and only give effect to subsection (a) of the exclusion, which addresses the quality of the finished product, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Liberty Mutual] do[es] not pay for loss or damage consisting of, caused by, or resulting from an act, defect, error, or omission (negligent or not) relating to ... design, specifications, construction, materials, or workmanship ....\" Subsections (b) and (c) of the exclusion provide: \"[Liberty Mutual] do[es] not pay for loss or damage consisting of, caused by, or resulting from an act, defect, error, or omission (negligent or not) relating to ... b) planning, zoning, development, siting, surveying, grading, or compaction; or c) maintenance, installation, renovation, remodeling, or repair.\" We conclude, therefore, that the 777 entities' argument to the effect that the exclusion applies only to the finished product of Armani's work is untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The 777 entities also argue that the exclusion does not bar coverage because such a reading would render the renovation endorsement meaningless. Liberty Mutual counters that, even if coverage is excluded for the damage to the windows, the endorsement has meaning because the main policy that the 777 entities purchased covered only new construction and, therefore, \"without the renovation endorsement the policy wouldn't have covered\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damage to the existing building ....\" (Emphasis added.) Indeed, at oral argument before this court, the 777 entities stated that they purchased the endorsement to extend coverage to the existing building because the policy only covered new construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although some jurisdictions assume that builder's risk policies exclusively apply to new construction; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ajax Building Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295845\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/795/#p799\">\n    358 F.3d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (11th Cir. 2004) (\"The very purpose of a builder's risk policy is to provide protection for the building under construction.... Just as there are standard forms of property insurance used to insure existing buildings, builder's risk policies are used to insure the building while it is in the process of being\n   built.\" [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ); in Connecticut, \"[t]he scope of coverage depends on the language of the policy.\" D. Rosengren, 13 Connecticut Practice Series: Construction Law (2005) \u00a7 12:3, p. 245. In the present case, the main policy form expressly limits coverage to new construction. The main policy form provides: \"[Liberty Mutual] cover[s] direct physical loss or damage caused by a covered peril to 'buildings or structures' while\n   <em>\n    in the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    course of construction\n   </em>\n   , erection, or fabrication.\" (Emphasis added.) It then goes on to state: \"[Liberty Mutual] only cover[s] ... 'buildings or structures'\n   <em>\n    in the course of construction\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the 777 entities' argument that the endorsement would be rendered meaningless if the exclusion applies is without merit because, if they had failed to purchase the endorsement, they would have been unable to recover for damage caused by a covered peril to the existing building they were renovating, such as fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Relatedly, the 777 entities argue that the exclusion is not applicable in the present case because the renovation endorsement does not contain a copy of the exclusion. \"A rider or endorsement is a writing added to or attached to a policy or certificate of insurance that expands or restricts its benefits or excludes certain conditions from coverage.... When properly incorporated into the policy, the policy and the rider together constitute the contract of insurance and are to be read together to determine the contract actually intended by the parties.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mutual Ins.

The resulting loss clause in this contract immediately follows the exclusion and provides: \"But if an act, defect, error, or omission as described above results in a covered peril, [Liberty Mutual] do[es] cover the loss or damage caused by that covered peril.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the term \"covered peril\" is not defined in the policy, the provision titled \"PERILS COVERED\" provides: \"[Liberty Mutual] cover[s] risks of direct physical loss or damage unless the loss is limited or caused by a peril that is excluded.\" As this provision indicates, perils, in the context of insurance, are \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of a risk of loss to person or property; [especially], the cause of a risk such as fire, accident, theft, forgery, earthquake, flood, or illness ....\" (Emphasis added.)

Plitt et al., supra, p. 153-11 n.8 (\"[i]n property insurance\n   parlance, 'perils' refers to fortuitous, active, physical forces such as lightning, wind, and explosion, which bring about the loss\"). On the basis of the plain language of the resulting loss clause in the present case, a loss caused by an act during a renovation will be covered if the act causes a covered peril, such as a fire, and that latter peril damages the building. In the present case, there was only one cause of the 777 entities' loss-the spraying of the building, which caused damage to the windows-and because that was not a covered peril, the resulting loss clause does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our reading of the policy comports with this court's interpretation of ensuing loss clauses in\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins.

The plaintiff argued, however, that the damage caused by the welding failure should be covered under the policy's ensuing loss clause.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20405\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The court disagreed and concluded: \"[T]here was no peril separate from and in addition to the initial excluded peril of the welding failure and kettle rupture. The spillage of molten zinc was part of the loss directly caused by such peril, not a new hazard or phenomenon. If the molten zinc had ignited a fire or caused an explosion which destroyed the plant, then the fire or explosion would have been a new covered peril with the ensuing loss covered. That did not occur.\" Id., at 180,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20405\">\n    270 Cal.Rptr. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as in\n   <em>\n    Weeks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Acme Galvanizing Co.\n   </em>\n   , the loss in the present case was caused by a single, excluded peril, and, therefore, the ensuing loss clause similarly does not reinstate coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The 777 entities argue, however, that\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zachem\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable and that, therefore, the independent peril approach to ensuing loss clauses that they set forth is inapplicable to the present case. In an effort to distinguish these cases, the 777 entities rely on the fact that the ensuing loss clause provisions in those cases contained different language than the resulting loss clause in the present case. Although the policies in\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zachem\n   </em>\n   use the term \"ensuing loss,\" while the policy in the present case uses the language \"results in a covered peril,\" this difference is immaterial. It is undisputed that the clause in the present case is a \"resulting loss\" provision and, as discussed previously in this opinion; see footnote 9 of this opinion; ensuing loss and resulting loss clauses are substantively indistinguishable. The clauses in\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zachem\n   </em>\n   and the clause in the present case all serve\n   the same purpose-reinstating coverage if an excluded peril causes a covered peril, which, in turn, results in a loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The 777 entities also attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zachem\n   </em>\n   by pointing out that those cases involved multiple, concurrent causes of the claimed loss, while the present case only involves one peril. Contrary to the 777 entities' argument, the fact that the loss in the present case was the result of a single, uncovered peril does not make the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Sansone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zachem\n   </em>\n   inapplicable. In both of those cases, the court made clear that an ensuing loss clause will only reinstate coverage when a hazard\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the excluded peril causes the loss. These cases clearly indicate that, as in the present case, where an excluded peril-the cleaning of the building's facade as part of the renovation-was the sole and direct cause of the damage to the windows, the ensuing loss clause does not reinstate coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the 777 entities' motion for summary judgment on the cross claim, to grant Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment and to render judgment on the cross claim for Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Although the complaint in the underlying action was filed by Viking Construction, Inc., against Liberty Mutual and 777 Residential, LLC, Viking Construction, Inc., withdrew from the case and is not a party to this appeal.

But it's less clear whether there is coverage when a careless worker renovating one part of the building damages another part of the building.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \"The answer lies in the policy's additional language. It says that if an act of renovation 'results in a covered peril,' damage from that covered peril is covered.... In this context, the language reasonably appears to mean that if the renovation 'results' in damage that isn't a renovation, the latter damage is covered despite being triggered by the former. The [777 entities] reasonably [take] this to mean that damage to a part of the building not being renovated by the worker-a window-is covered....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"But Liberty Mutual says the language is intended to provide coverage only where there are two independent perils: one excluded peril causing an independent peril that causes the damage. A contractor cleaning the facade drops a wrench that breaks a wire that ultimately causes a fire that damages the building. The second peril-the covered one-is the fire. A facade cleaner leaves open a window that lets in rain that damages a carpet. The second peril-the covered one-is the rain....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \"The important thing for the special clause here-often called a 'resulting loss' clause-is that the worker wasn't renovating the window but damaged it.

It doesn't cover any other kind of damage-to people or other property, for instance.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnotes omitted.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The court's January 11, 2018 memorandum of decision denying Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment, which the court referenced in its subsequent memoranda of decision, provides the only detailed explanation of the court's rationale for its decision to render summary judgment in favor of the 777 entities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In its January 11, 2018 memorandum of decision denying Liberty Mutual's motion for summary judgment, the trial court did not indicate whether coverage was barred by the exclusion; instead, it based its conclusion that the 777 entities were entitled to coverage upon its reading of the exclusion in conjunction with the resulting loss clause. The resulting loss clause, however, only may be considered when coverage is barred by the exclusion. For the purposes of our analysis, therefore, we must infer that the court found that the exclusion barred coverage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Specifically, the 777 entities argue that the exclusion does not apply because (1) the windows were not part of the renovation; (2) the exclusion only applies to workmanship; (3) the application of the exclusion would obviate the renovation endorsement; (4) the exclusion is not incorporated into the renovation endorsement; and (5) the exclusion is ambiguous and should be construed in their favor. We address each of these arguments in turn.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Finally, the 777 entities argue that, at a minimum, the exclusion is ambiguous and, therefore, must be construed in their favor. Because we conclude that the exclusion unambiguously bars coverage, we need not address this argument. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Amica Mutual Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Piquette\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490799\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/623/#p565\">\n     176 Conn.

Property &amp; Casualty Co.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Chaber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278982\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/239/329/\">\n     239 W.

The 777 entities, however, admitted that there was only one cause of the damage-the faulty spraying of the building's facade. Thus, we conclude that this argument is without merit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
