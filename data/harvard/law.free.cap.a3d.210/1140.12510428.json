Serrao (Claimant) is not ineligible for benefits under Section 3 of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Claimant was employed by Employer from October 2009 to May 10, 2018 as a full-time project coordinator. Board's Finding of Fact (F.F.) 1. On September 23, 2016, while off-duty, Claimant operated his personal motor vehicle while driving under the influence (DUI) and was subsequently convicted of DUI. Board's F.F. 3 &amp; 4. Claimant reported his conviction to his immediate supervisor, as required. Board's F.F. 5. On May 10, 2018, Employer terminated Claimant's employment due to his DUI conviction. Board's F.F. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department of Labor and Industry (Department) issued a determination denying benefits to Claimant under Section\n   402(e) of the Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for willful misconduct. Department's Determination at 1. After a hearing, the referee affirmed the Department's determination and found that it is Employer's practice, in accordance with its code of conduct, to terminate employees who are convicted of criminal conduct even when the conduct is unrelated to their employment or occurs off-duty. Referee's Decision and Order at 4 &amp; F.F. 4. The referee determined that Section 402(e) of the Law applied, rather than Section 3, and found that Claimant violated the code of conduct by engaging in criminal behavior resulting in his DUI conviction. Referee's Decision and Order at 3. Claimant appealed the referee's decision to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Board reversed the referee's decision and found that Section 3 of the Law applied, rather than Section 402(e), because Claimant's conduct was not work-related. Board's Decision and Order at 2. The Board noted that although the conduct leading to the criminal arrest may have been inconsistent with acceptable standards of behavior, it did not directly reflect upon Claimant's ability to perform his assigned duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

This Court concluded that the Board had erred, because the claimant's eligibility should have been determined under Section 3 given that the claimant was discharged from his employment solely on the basis of the off-duty accident which had no connection to his work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376651\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/119/133/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376651\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/119/133/#p753\">\n    at 752-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , Claimant's off-duty conduct, his DUI conviction, for which he was discharged, had no connection with his work. As such, the Board did not err in applying Section 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under Section 3 of the Law, the employer bears the burden to prove \"(1) that the claimant's conduct was contrary to acceptable standards of behavior and (2) that the claimant's unacceptable conduct directly affects or reflects upon the claimant's ability to perform his assigned duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Palladino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7304385\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/81/1096/\">\n    81 A.3d at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9085664\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/833/1181/#p1184\">\n    833 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1184-85 ).

Notably, Employer does not claim that the unacceptable conduct,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the criminal DUI conviction, affected Claimant's ability to perform his job duties as a project coordinator\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and does not challenge the Board's determination that the conviction did not affect Claimant's ability to perform his job. As such, because Employer did not establish one of the two necessary prongs, ineligibility for benefits under Section 3 cannot be established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, the Board did not err in concluding that Claimant is not ineligible for benefits under Section 3 of the Law, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   AND NOW, this 31st day of May, 2019, the September 20, 2018 decision and order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Act of December 5, 1936, Second Ex.
