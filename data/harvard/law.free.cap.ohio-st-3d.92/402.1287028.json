Sherrills filed an affidavit of indigency, but he did not comply with the R.C. 2969.25(C) <em>in forma pauperis </em>filing requirements for inmates commencing civil actions or appeals against government entities or employees. Nor did he submit the requisite affidavit pursuant to R.C. 2969.25(A) delineating any previous civil actions and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">In August 2000, a magistrate appointed by the court of appeals recommended dismissal of the action because Sherrills had not complied with R.C. 2969.25(A) and (C). Sherrills filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in which he claimed that because he was adjudged indigent in a separate case in 1988, application to him of the <em>informa pauperis </em>requirements enacted in 1996 violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the United States Constitution. In December 2000, the court of appeals overruled Sherrills\u2019s objections, adopted the decision of the magistrate, and dismissed the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">In his appeal of right, Sherrills claims that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Sherrills\u2019s claims are meritless. He failed to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2969.25 in commencing this action. See <em>State ex rel. Zanders v. Ohio Parole Bd. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 421, 422, 696 N.E.2d 594, 594-595; <em>State ex rel. Alford v. Winters </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 285, 286, 685 N.E.2d 1242, 1242-1243. Like the appellants in <em>Zanders </em>and <em>Alford, </em>Sherrills does not claim that R.C. 2969.25 is inapplicable to mandamus actions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b533-9\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\n<em>Darles Sherrills, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In addition, as the court of appeals concluded, \u201c[ijndigency is not a permanent condition,\u201d so Sherrills\u2019s reliance on a 1988 finding of indigency in a separate case is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Moreover, application of R.C. 2969.25 to Sherrills\u2019s July 2000 action does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. The <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause applies only to criminal statutes and R.C. 2969.25 applies only to civil actions. See <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 415, 700 N.E.2d 570, 580; R.C. 2969.21(B). Federal courts have rejected comparable constitutional challenges to the federal Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), Section 1915, Title 28, U.S.Code, which sets forth <em>in forma pauperis </em>requirements for prisoner litigation in federal courts. See, <em>e.g., Wilson v. Yaklich </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 148 F.3d 596, 606, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the provisions of the PLRA do not \u201crun afoul of the prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation\u201d because the PLRA, by its very terms, applies only to the filing of civil actions and \u201cwhile they may impact individuals incarcerated in the criminal justice system, [these provisions] are procedural in nature and were not enacted to affect the punishments already meted out for crimes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-10\">. On January 24, 2001, we held that because Sherrills had abused his <em>informa pauperis </em>status and had exhibited a continuous pattern of filing repetitious, frivolous appeals, the Clerk of this court would not accept for filing in this court any further appeals without Sherrills\u2019s prepaying the fee required by S.Ct.Prac.R. XV, except for direct or delayed appeals from criminal convictions and sentences. <em>In re Sherrills </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1420, 741 N.E.2d 145. Sherrills\u2019s filed this appeal before that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
