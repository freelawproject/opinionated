Travis, was convicted of kidnapping, rape, attempted rape, felonious assault, and gross sexual imposition, and he was sentenced to prison. On appeal, his convictions were affirmed. <em>State v. Travis </em>(Apr. 16, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 56825, unreported, 1990 WL 40573.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In December 2000, Travis filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Richland County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel his release from prison. Travis claimed that his trial court had denied him his constitutional right to a speedy trial. In January 2001, the court of appeals dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">This cause is now before the court upon Travis\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the reasons stated in its opinion. A claimed violation of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is not cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>Brown v. Leonard </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 593, 716 N.E.2d 183; <em>Mack v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 275, 22 O.O.2d 335, 189 N.E.2d 156. Instead, appeal is the appropriate remedy. <em>State ex rel. Brantley v.
