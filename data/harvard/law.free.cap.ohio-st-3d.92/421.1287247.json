Jalowiec, was convicted of aggravated murder with death-penalty and firearm specifications. He was sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(Apr. 15, 1998), Lorain App. No. 96CA006445, unreported, 1998 WL 178554. On direct appeal as of right, we also affirmed his convictions and sentence on April 4, 2001. <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 744 N.E.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">On July 8, 1999, appellant filed an application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals essentially found that Jalowiec had failed to show good cause for filing his application more than ninety days after that court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b). <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(Aug. 18, 1999), Lorain App. No. 96CA006445, unreported. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, albeit for different reasons. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Jalowiec has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697. To show ineffective assistance, Jalowiec must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b552-10\"><em>Gregory A. White, </em>Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Jonathan E. Rosenbaum, </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AS8b\">\n<em>Stanley E. Jalowiec, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Jalowiec \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We have reviewed appellant\u2019s twenty propositions of law alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>deficient performance by appellate counsel. Many of these same arguments were rejected by us on Jalowiec\u2019s appeal before this court. See <em>State v. Jalowiec, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 220, 744 N.E.2d 163. In any case, however, in none of the twenty propositions of law has Jalowiec raised \u201ca <em>genuine issue </em>as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d (emphasis added) before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
