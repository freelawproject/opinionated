Byrge, sustained an injury in the course of and arising from his employment with appellant David\u2019s Cemetery. Five days later, Dr. Krisell D. Fedrizzi diagnosed an incisional ventral hernia. In office notes of the same date, she advised claimant to \u201cavoid any heavy lifting and forceful pushing/pulling [until] hernia repaired.\u201d Those restrictions were repeated in a July 18, 1997 attending physician\u2019s questionnaire (\u201cAPQ\u201d), which certified claimant as unable to return to any job requiring such duties from June 10, 1997 through the \u201cpresent.\u201d There is no dispute that claimant\u2019s former position of employment entailed such duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Pursuant to Dr. Fedrizzi\u2019s referral, claimant saw a surgeon, Dr. Andrew H. Gabriel, on June 12, 1997. Dr. Gabriel confirmed the diagnosis and recommended surgery. Byrge indicated that he would seek workers\u2019 compensation approval. On June 30, 1997, Gabriel prepared a letter apparently for that purpose. In it, he outlined his proposed surgery and advised that \u201conce the\u2019 procedure is performed, the patient will be off work approximately six weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Claimant followed up with an application for a workers\u2019 compensation allowance. After several delays, it was finally heard by a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. In an order dated April 7, 1998, the DHO denied the claim as unrelated to employment. In so doing, the DHO cited Gabriel\u2019s report as well as affidavits from two co-workers \u2014 Stephen Hopkins and William Hendricks \u2014 Hopkins claiming that four days after the alleged injury occurred, claimant voluntarily quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Claimant\u2019s appeal was heard by a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) on May 11, 1998. The SHO vacated the DHO\u2019s order and allowed the claim for \u201cincisional ventral hernia.\u201d Temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d) was ordered from June 10, 1997 through July 18, 1997, based on the reports of Fedrizzi and Gabriel, and was to continue upon submission of medical proof. This order was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A June 18, 1998 letter from Gabriel to Fedrizzi indicated that claimant\u2019s surgery had been approved and was scheduled for July 8, 1998. The letter also indicated that claimant now also suffered from a left inguinal hernia. There was no allegation that this latest condition was work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">On June 30, 1998, Fedrizzi completed a C-84 questionnaire that was to be submitted with the claimant\u2019s request for further TTC. This form indicated that claimant had been/would be unable to return to his former position of employment from June 5, 1997, pending surgery. The diagnoses originally listed were incisional ventral hernia and left inguinal hernia. The latter, however, was then crossed out and initialed by the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Gabriel ultimately decided to repair the hernias in separate procedures. He successfully repaired the ventral hernia on July 8, 1998, and scheduled the remaining operation for August 14,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">On September 18,1998, David\u2019s Cemetery moved for a \u201cretroactive termination of temporary total disability benefits.\u201d In support, it submitted Fedrizzi\u2019s C-84, statements indicating that claimant voluntarily quit, and evidence of other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">A DHO heard the matter on January 15, 1999. The DHO broke the disputed period \u2014 June 10, 1997 through September 27, 1998 \u2014 into five parts. TTC from June 10, 1997 through July 18, 1997, was upheld on the basis of res <em>judicata. </em>TTC from July 19, 1997 through December 20, 1997, was sustained based on \u201cthe office notes of Dr. Fedrizzi.\u201d The DHO declared overpaid, compensation from December 21, 1997 through July 7, 1998, because claimant, by his own admission, worked intermittently over that time. TTC for the period following surgery for the allowed ventral hernia \u2014 July 8, 1998 through August 14, 1998 \u2014 was left intact. Finally, TTC from August 15, 1998 through September 27, 1998 \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>recovery period for claimant\u2019s nonallowed inguinal hernia \u2014 was found to have been overpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The DHO\u2019s order, along with his accompanying reasoning, was affirmed by an SHO on March 30, 1999. The evidence cited in support included \u201cthe medical reports of Dr. Fedrizzi.\u201d Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">David\u2019s Cemetery commenced an action in mandamus before the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission abused its discretion in awarding TTC. The court of appeals upheld the commission\u2019s order and denied the writ. This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Three periods of TTC are at issue: (1) June 10, 1997 through July 18,1997; (2) July 19, 1997 through December 20, 1997; and (3) July 8, 1998 through August 14, 1998. Upon review, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">David\u2019s Cemetery contests the commission\u2019s conclusion that the compensation awarded over the first period was <em>res judicata. </em>Citing Fedrizzi\u2019s June 30, 1998 C-84, David\u2019s Cemetery contends that the reference to a nonallowed inguinal hernia coupled with a certification of disability post-dated to the date of injury suggests that the nonallowed condition contributed to claimant\u2019s alleged temporary total disability from the claim\u2019s inception. This, per David\u2019s Cemetery, constitutes a new and changed circumstance sufficient to warrant reopening the matter under the commission\u2019s R.C. 4123.52 continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">David\u2019s Cemetery is correct in naming new and changed circumstances as a factor sufficient to invoke continuing jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Hts. Bd. of Edn. v. Johnston </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 132, 12 O.O.3d 128, 388 N.E.2d 1383. We do not concur, however, with its assertion that Fedrizzi\u2019s C-84 compelled that result. The commission is the sole evaluator of evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. None of the evidence prepared contemporaneously with claimant\u2019s injury or first period of disability (June 10, 1997 through July 18, 1997) mentioned the nonallowed inguinal hernia. To the contrary, the first reference was in Gabriel\u2019s June 18, 1998 letter \u2014 approximately a year later. This letter contained no allegation that the nonallowed condition was related to claimant\u2019s industrial injury. Viewing all of the evidence in totality, we cannot state that the commission abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the issue of causal relationship between disability and a nonallowed condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">We are also unpersuaded that evidence of other employment or of voluntary departure warranted the exercise of continuing jurisdiction. The latter was simply evidence supplementing statements originally considered at the April 7, 1998 DHO hearing. Likewise, evidence of other employment did not merit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>reconsideration, since claimant was not working over the TTC period declared <em>res judicata </em>by the commission. Accordingly, we sustain the finding of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">David\u2019s Cemetery next asserts that the remaining disputed periods of TTC are unsupported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d We again disagree. David\u2019s Cemetery engages in a semantics debate as to whether the DHO\u2019s reference to Fedrizzi\u2019s \u201coffice notes\u201d and the SHO\u2019s reliance on Fedrizzi\u2019s \u201cmedical reports\u201d denote reliance on the same medical evidence. We find it unnecessary to engage in such a discussion, since both notes and reports from Fedrizzi support TTC from July 17, 1997 through December 20, 1997. Her June 10, 1997 office entry instructs claimant to refrain from heavy lifting and forceful pushing/pulling until the allowed ventral hernia was fixed. Her August 18, 1998 report confirmed that these were indeed her restrictions over the relevant time period. Because David\u2019s Cemetery has not alleged that claimant\u2019s former position of employment was free from such physical duties, we hold these documents to be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting TTC over this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In attacking the final period of TTC at issue \u2014 July 8, 1998 through August 14, 1998 \u2014 David\u2019s Cemetery again asserts a lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d in support. David\u2019s Cemetery notes that the SHO based her award \u201cupon medical evidence finding claimant to be unable to return to his former position of employment due to the allowed conditions in this claim,\u201d without identifying to which evidence she was referring. David\u2019s Cemetery also notes that elsewhere in the order, the SHO lists reliance on Fedrizzi. We agree that this ambiguity is confusing but do not agree that, under these facts, it compels vacation of the commission\u2019s order. Ambiguous commission orders are generally returned for clarification. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Kirschner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 90, 694 N.E.2d 460; <em>State ex rel. Hall v. Marion Dresser Indus., Inc. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 540, 684 N.E.2d 70; <em>State ex rel. Buttolph v. Gen. Motors Corp., Terex Div. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 73, 679 N.E.2d 702; <em>State ex rel. Buchanan v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 168, 532 N.E.2d 743; <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721. In this case, however, a return for clarification of the evidence relied upon is, to us, unnecessary, since <em>all </em>of the medical evidence \u2014 including that of Dr. Steven S. Wunder, who examined claimant on David\u2019s Cemetery\u2019s behalf \u2014 articulates an approximately six-week, post-operative recovery period. See <em>State ex rel. Jackman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 397, 650 N.E.2d 467; <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the award of TTC from July 8, 1998, the date of surgery, through August 14, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">David\u2019s Cemetery issues a last broad challenge to TTC eligibility based on claimant\u2019s employment status at various times during the disputed periods. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>first argument focuses on the fact that claimant quit his job at David\u2019s Cemetery after he was hurt. This argument is founded on early voluntary abandonment cases such as <em>State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 145, 29 OBR 162, 504 N.E.2d 451, and <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533 \u2014 cases that have since been clarified by our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 376, 732 N.E.2d 355. <em>Baker </em>explained that the critical abandonment in evaluating TTC eligibility was abandonment of the entire work force, not simply abandonment of the former position of employment. This did not occur here. Other cases cited by David\u2019s Cemetery, such as <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469; <em>State ex rel. McClain v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 407, 732 N.E.2d 383; and <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Superior\u2019s Brand Meats </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 408, 667 N.E.2d 1217, are not dispositive, because they deal with employment discharge, not a voluntary quit.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b632-9\"><em>Pickrel, Schaeffer &amp; Ebeling, David C. Korte </em>and <em>Michelle D. Bach, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ASH\"><em>Betty D. Montgomery, </em>Attorney General, and <em>Stephen D. Plymale, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAE\"><em>Hochman &amp; Roach Co., L.P.A., Gary D. Plunkett </em>and <em>Roger A. Lee, </em>for appellee Byrge.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">David\u2019s Cemetery also suggests that claimant\u2019s intermittent employment from December 21, 1997 through July 7, 1998, precludes TTC thereafter. This is incorrect. Claimant\u2019s employment, even if sporadic, indeed bars TTC over the period in which he was employed. <em>State ex rel. Blabac v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 113, 717 N.E.2d 336. It does not, however, foreclose TTC should claimant again become temporarily and totally disabled, which clearly occurred during claimant\u2019s post-surgical recovery. <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">For the reasons cited above, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
