We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. While the victim was approximately eight and nine years old, she periodically was sexually assaulted in her home by her former stepfather, the defendant. According to the victim\u2019s testimony, she was assaulted on multiple occasions during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The victim did not tell anybody about the assaults until she was approximately fourteen years old, at which point she told her stepmother, her father and her mother. The victim also provided a written statement to the Waterbury police department. The defendant was arrested shortly thereafter and charged with sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant\u2019s case was tried to the jury in June, 2006. Following a guilty verdict by the juiy on all counts charged, the defendant was sentenced on August 25, 2006, to a total effective term of twenty-five years incarceration and ten years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The defendant first claims that his \u201cright to confront the witnesses against him was violated when the state\u2019s expert witness was allowed to testify beyond the permissible scope of testimony normally allowed for experts.\u201d Specifically, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s admission of hearsay testimony in the form of \u201cunnamed statistical studies of delayed reporting of abuse [and] anecdotal evidence\u201d provided by the state\u2019s sexual abuse expert, Diane Edell. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The defendant did not preserve his claim at trial but seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record is adequate for review, but the defendant\u2019s claim, fails under the second prong of <em>Golding </em>because the claimed error is evidentiary in nature and is not of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\u201cIt is well established that every evidentiary ruling that denies a defendant a line of inquiry is not a violation of his constitutional rights. The defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him is not absolute, but must bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. . . . Accordingly, [t]he defendant can not raise a constitutional claim by attaching a constitutional label to a purely evidentiary claim or by asserting merely that a strained connection exists between the evidentiary claim and a fundamental constitutional right. . . . Thus, [o]nce identified, unpreserved evidentiary claims masquerading as constitutional claims will be summarily dismissed. . . . We previously have stated that the admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerald W., </em>103 Conn. App. 784, 797-98, 931 A.2d 383, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 933, 935 A.2d 152 (2007); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 55, 644 A.2d 887 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>The essence of the defendant\u2019s argument is that without proper examination of Edell concerning her reliance on outside sources cited in her testimony, Edell\u2019s testimony was impermissible hearsay in violation of the confrontation clause. The concerns of the defendant, however, namely, the trustworthiness and reliability of the testimony, are addressed by the rules of evidence concerning expert testimony rather than the confrontation clause. See <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>250 Conn. 312, 321, 736 A.2d 889 (1999) (\u201can expert\u2019s opinion is not rendered inadmissible merely because the opinion is based on inadmissible hearsay, so long as the opinion is based on trustworthy information and the expert had sufficient experience to evaluate that information so as to come to a conclusion which the trial court might well hold worthy of consideration by the jury\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-4. Experts commonly rely on statistical studies and other sources. As stated in <em>In re Barbara J., </em>215 Conn. 31, 574 A.2d 203 (1990), \u201c[w]hen the expert witness has consulted numerous sources, and uses that information, together with his own professional knowledge and experience, to arrive at his opinion, that opinion is regarded as evidence in its own right and not as hearsay in disguise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Furthermore, the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine Edell as to her reliance on the outside sources but did not do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>59 Conn. App. 638, 652, 757 A.2d 1175 (2000) (\u201creliance on information provided by others does not violate the confrontation clause where the expert is available for cross-examination concerning the nature and reasonableness of his reliance\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 259 Conn. 693, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>793 A.2d 226 (2002). Simply put, outside sources are used to show the basis of the expert\u2019s opinion rather than for extrinsic substantive proof. See <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 324-25. Because the court\u2019s admission of Edell\u2019s expert testimony did not implicate a fundamental constitutional right, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved evidentiary claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted the state to introduce evidence of his prior misconduct. Specifically, the defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the victim\u2019s testimony referencing his prior misconduct with the victim\u2019s baby-sitter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The defendant did not preserve his evidentiary claim for our review. Our review of the record discloses that the defendant did not raise a specific prior misconduct objection to any part of the victim\u2019s testimony but, rather, objected to the testimony in question as \u201cnonresponsive.\u201d \u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is limited to the specific legal ground raised by the objection of counsel at trial. ... A specific objection is necessary to alert the trial court to purported error while there is time to correct it without ordering a retrial and to permit the opposing party to argue against the objection at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodrum, </em>39 Conn. App. 526, 543, 665 A.2d 159, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 929, 667 A.2d 554 (1995); see also <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 30, 807 A.2d 955 (2002). The defendant does not assert that he is entitled to any extraordinary means of review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>his unpreserved evidentiary claim, and we will not afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">We also note that even if we were to afford review of the defendant\u2019s claim, it would not help the defendant. The testimony to which he takes exception, specifically that \u201c[the defendant] did <em>something </em>and mom kicked [the baby-sitter] out,\u201d perhaps could lead to vague speculation but is not a clear expression of prior misconduct on the part of the defendant. (Emphasis added.) See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boykin, </em>74 Conn. App. 679, 687, 813 A.2d 143 (\u201c[s]imply stated, the remark\u2019s lack of specificity leads us to conclude that the remark did not unfairly prejudice the defendant in the eyes of the jury\u201d), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 901, 819 A.2d 837 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The defendant last claims that he was deprived of a fair trial as a result of prosecutorial impropriety, namely, that he \u201cwas prejudiced by the state\u2019s closing argument, which shows a pattern of pandering to the emotions and sympathies of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Before we examine the challenged remarks, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cProsecutorial [impropriety] claims invoke a two step analysis. First, the reviewing court must determine whether the challenged conduct did, in fact, constitute [an impropriety]. Second, if [an impropriety] occurred, the reviewing court must then determine if the defendant has demonstrated substantial prejudice. ... In order to demonstrate this, the defendant must establish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the [impropriety] so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pedro S., 87 </em>Conn. App. 183, 187, 865 A.2d 1177, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 924, 871 A.2d 1033 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\u201cBecause the claimed prosecutorial [impropriety] occurred during closing arguments, we advance the following legal principles. [P]rosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining whether such [an impropriety] has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>98 Conn. App. 93, 106, 908 A.2d 556 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">As noted, the first step in our analysis is to determine whether any of these statements were improper. In his brief, the defendant cites several statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument that he claims were appeals to the emotions and sympathy of the jury, such as, \u201c[r]emember when they\u2019re first bom,\u201d and, \u201c[y]ou held that little baby in your arms, and before you [knew] it, that little baby was out of your arms, and that little baby was grabbing on to your ankles, and they\u2019re trying to crawl up your legs to be able to walk with you.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>The state argues that the comments in question, \u201cwhen read in context, did nothing more than speak to the jurors\u2019 common sense and everyday life experiences with children.\u201d We conclude that there was no impropriety on the part of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Although a prosecutor may not appeal excessively and gratuitously to the emotions of the jury; <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 376, 897 A.2d 569 (2006); he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>or she may properly appeal to a jury\u2019s common sense and everyday experience. Id., 365. Here, the state\u2019s closing argument appealed to the common sense notion that children mature quickly, and that, consequently, the jury should keep in mind the age and experience of the victim at the time the abuse occurred, as opposed to her appearance and maturity level at trial almost eight years later. Although the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis on that point could have been delivered more succinctly, we recognize that \u201c[t]he occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiavo, </em>93 Conn. App. 290, 304, 888 A.2d 1115, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 923, 895 A.2d 797 (2006); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>102 Conn. App. 168, 190-93, 926 A.2d 7, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 906, 931 A.2d 267 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chasse, </em>51 Conn. App. 345, 361, 721 A.2d 1212 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 960, 723 A.2d 816 (1999). Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments were not improper, and, therefore, could not have prejudiced the defendant and deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\"> We note that the conduct that gave rise to the risk of injury charges allegedly occurred between 1999 and 2001. Although General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 was amended during that time, there is no dispute that the conduct in which the defendant allegedly had engaged was prohibited under all of the revisions of the statute applicable during that time period. In the interest of simplicity, we refer to the current revision of \u00a7 53-21 as the revision of the statute under which the defendant was charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\"> \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant may prevail on unpreserved claims only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two [prongs of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>102 Conn. App. 584, 588 n.3, 925 A.2d 1220, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 914, 931 A.2d 933 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> The outside sources were statistical studies regarding delayed reporting of sexual abuse claims and a conversation with an employee of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center about the frequent lack of physical evidence in sexual abuse claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\"> The following colloquy occurred during the victim\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: How long did [the baby-sitter] work with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: Watch us?

Have you ever heard the maxim, epjoy your kids while they\u2019re young, they grow up so fast?

And then they get to be two and three years old, and they\u2019re off on their own. They\u2019re running down store aisles, they\u2019re behind you, they\u2019re in front of you, they\u2019re around you. And then the stage comes when they\u2019re five years old and they\u2019re going off to kindergarten. They\u2019ve got that backpack on their back, the brand new lunch box, and they\u2019re probably just about this high at that time, and maybe you have to stoop down to have your picture taken with them because they\u2019re just that little. And then first grade comes and off they go, their full day of school. Again, the big backpack that\u2019s weighing them back, and they\u2019re maybe about this big at that point, and you send them off for their day by themselves, and that\u2019s your first break with them. And then second and third grade come along, and usually with those grades come soccer, T-ball, Girl Scouts, Brownies, Cub Scouts. They\u2019re still there and they\u2019re still your baby. Fourth grade comes, halfway through their grammar school career. They\u2019re probably about this big. You\u2019re probably letting them all go off to the bus at that time by themselves. Then we have fifth, sixth, seventh grade, they\u2019re hitting middle school. A lot of activities start, we\u2019ve come to that. They\u2019re probably about this big now when they get to those grades. And then they enter high school, and they really think they\u2019re old at that stage, but you know they\u2019re still your baby. And maybe when they\u2019re at high school age, they\u2019re probably level with you at that point, and they\u2019re going off to finish their four years of formal education. Some will be starting their careers at the end of those four years. Other of them might have the opportunity to go on off to college. But that\u2019s what you have. You have those years with your children and then off they go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">\u201cNow, I want you to just to think about that child, that baby in your arms and that child going off at the end of its high school career, and I want you to take a few steps back because you met [the victim] when she was a freshman in high school, when she was just starting off on that high school career, when [the victim\u2019s] about this tall. But step back in time.
