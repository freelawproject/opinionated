The dispositive issues on appeal are whether \u00a7 12 (a) (i) in the partnership agreement is enforceable, and, if so, whether such provision permits termination of one of the partner\u2019s association with the partnership \u201cwithout cause,\u201d as long as ninety days notice is given. We conclude that the provision is enforceable and that the language of the parties\u2019 contract is unambiguous and permits termination \u201cwithout cause.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial corut.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">The following facts as found by the corut are not disputed. On July 31, 1991, the plaintiff, Ken Epstein, Munk and Epstein\u2019s father, Gerald Epstein,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a partnership agreement. All four were dentists by profession. Under the partnership agreement, they formed Family Dental Group-Clinton Associates, located at 468 Clinton Avenue in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the court made the following factual findings. \u201cNeither of the Epsteins practiced at this location at any time subsequent to the formation of the partnership. Initially the Epsteins held a 50 percent interest in the practice, while [the plaintiff] and Munk each held a 25 percent interest. Upon Gerald Epstein\u2019s death or retirement in 1995 or 1996, [the plaintiff] approached Munk about securing additional shares of the practice. An agreement was reached whereby the ownership interest was changed to one third each for Munk, [the plaintiff] and Ken Epstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\u201cThe final draft of the agreement contained the following pertinent terms: The partnership was to continue until the year 2051, unless the partners agreed to an early dissolution. The partners were looking to form an entity which would survive upon their death. The partners were to devote full professional time and attention to the partnership during the first five years of its inception. The two practicing partners, [the plaintiff] and Munk, were to receive 35 percent of their collections. Additionally, any profit beyond expenses would be put into a profit pool of which the first 20 percent would be divided equally between all three partners and the remaining, if any, would be divided equally between [the plaintiff] and Munk.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\u201cFrom its formation until the present, the partnership has been successful, with increasing profits every year except in the year 2005. During the first five years, [the plaintiff] and Munk both maintained a full-time schedule. ... In 1997, [the plaintiff] decided to reduce his workload, decreasing his hours on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and eliminating Fridays.\u201d Since the formation of the partnership, Munk maintained a consistent, full-time work schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\u201cAround 1997, when Munk became aware of [the plaintiffs] change in schedule, he became upset and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ceased communicating with [the plaintiff]. According to Munk\u2019s testimony, [the plaintiff] was also to blame for their breakdown in communication. Munk was dissatisfied with [the plaintiffs] management style, the way he conducted his practice, his refusal to accept [health maintenance organizations], take emergencies and work on Saturdays. He was also unhappy with [the plaintiffs] appearance, the condition of his work space, and the amount of vacation time he took. He expressed his dissatisfaction to Ken Epstein through letters he wrote to him over the course of several years; however, he did not approach [the plaintiff] directly with his concerns. Despite Munk\u2019s unhappiness with him, [the plaintiff] was able to function normally in the office and interact appropriately with the remaining staff. Ken Epstein often acted as the mediator between Munk and [the plaintiff].</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cMunk was also dissatisfied with both his compensation and [the plaintiffs] refusal to expand the facilities. Munk wanted to change the agreement to alter his compensation or alternatively terminate [the plaintiff] as a partner. At a meeting held in 1999, a proposal was made to allocate the 20 percent of profit in proportion to the collections of the practicing partners. Alternatively, Munk suggested that he should receive a management fee for his managerial duties. [The plaintiff] did not accept either proposal and insisted that the parties submit to mediation pursuant to the agreement. The mediation resulted in an award of a management fee for Munk in the amount of two thirds of 1 percent of the gross revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\u201cOn October 28, 2002, Epstein and Munk offered to buy out [the plaintiffs] shares of the practice, or alternatively, to keep him as a graduated partner while eliminating his management responsibilities and his share of the profits. Epstein and Munk sent [the plaintiff] an offer letter for a buyout, which [the plaintiff] refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u201cOn February 26, 2003, a special meeting of the partners was held. At the meeting, Ken Epstein and Munk voted to terminate [the plaintiff] from the practice.\u201d Munk and Epstein terminated the plaintiffs association with the partnership \u201cwithout cause\u201d and provided him with ninety days notice pursuant to \u00a7 12 (a) (i) in the partnership agreement. As a result of the termination, the plaintiff filed a ten count complaint against the defendants. At trial, the plaintiff pursued only the first count of the complaint, in which he sought equitable relief pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 34-339<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 34-362 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and restoration of his partnership status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The court granted the plaintiffs request for injunctive relief and enjoined the defendants from terminating his association with the partnership. The court found that \u201cthe partnership\u2019s termination date implie[d] that a reduction in workload was contemplated. Under \u00a7 1 of the agreement, the partnership will terminate on December 31,2051, unless the parties agree to an extension in writing, or agree to terminate at an earlier time.\u201d The court concluded, stating that \u201cthis term in the contract implie[d] that there naturally would be a reduction in the number of hours a partner would devote to the practice over the years.\u201d The court did not find persuasive \u201cthe defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) of the agreement provides for termination without cause, as long as a ninety day notice is provided . . . .\u201d Instead, the court found that \u201cthe provision, standing alone, is unenforceable. The court conclude [d] that no reasonable, educated person would sign an agreement whereby they could be stripped of their equitable interest in a business without a reasonable basis.\u201d The court also found that \u201c\u00a7 12 (a) (i) of the agreement does not clearly state a majority of the partners can terminate another partner without any reasonable basis. Therefore, it is the court\u2019s opinion that a reasonable basis for [the plaintiffs] termination must be provided.\u201d The court concluded that because the defendants did not provide a reasonable basis for the plaintiffs termination and the reasons provided by the defendants were not sufficient to strip him of his equitable interest in the practice, the plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly found in favor of the plaintiff. Specifically, the defendants claim that the court improperly concluded that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement (1) is unenforceable and (2) does not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>that a majority of the parties can terminate another partner without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">\u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual communications is a question of law .... subject to plenary review by this court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 495, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000). \u201cIn giving meaning to the terms of a contract, the court should construe the agreement as a whole, and its relevant provisions are to be considered together. . . . The contract must be construed to give effect to the intent of the contracting parties. . . . This intent must be determined from the language of the instrument and not from any intention either of the parties may have secretly entertained. . . . [Ijntent . . . is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>101 Conn. App. 65, 74, 922 A.2d 1100 (2007). \u201c[Where] . . . there is clear and definitive contract language, the scope and meaning of that language is not a question of fact but a question of law. ... In such a situation our scope of review is plenary, and is not limited by the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Wolosoff <em>v. Wolosoff, </em>91 Conn. App. 374, 381, 880 A.2d 977 (2005). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law subject to plenary review. See <em>Enviro Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>279 Conn. 194, 200, 901 A.2d 666 (2006). Therefore, our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly concluded that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement is unenforceable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) is unenforceable because \u201cno reasonable, educated person would sign an agreement whereby they could be stripped of their equitable interest in a business without a reasonable basis. Simply put, it is something a reasonably prudent person would not do.\u201d The defendants maintain that the court \u201cignores and contradicts well established Connecticut law\u201d because Connecticut has a strong public policy favoring freedom of contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">There is a strong public policy in Connecticut favoring freedom of contract: \u201cIt is established well beyond the need for citation that parties are <em>free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree. </em>This freedom includes the right to contract for the assumption of known or unknown hazards and risks that may arise as a consequence of the execution of the contract. Accordingly, in private disputes, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>must enforce the contract as drafted by the parties and may not relieve a contracting party from anticipated or actual difficulties undertaken pursuant to the contract, unless the contract is voidable on grounds such as mistake, fraud or unconscionability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Holly Hill Holdings </em>v. <em>Lowman, </em>226 Conn. 748, 755-56, 628 A.2d 1298 (1993); see 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 154,159 (1981); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 208 (1981). If a contract violates public policy, this would be a ground to not enforce the contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Stamford Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>United Stone America, Inc., </em>99 Conn. App. 1, 16, 912 A.2d 1044, cert. denied, 281 Conn. 917, 917 A.2d 999 (2007). A contract, or in this instance, a partnership agreement, however, does not violate public policy just because the contract was made unwisely. <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 505-506. \u201c[C]ourts do not unmake bargains unwisely made. Absent other infirmities, bargains moved on calculated considerations, and whether provident or improvident, are entitled nevertheless to sanctions of the law. . . . Although parties might prefer to have the court decide the plain effect of their contract contrary to the agreement, <em>it is not within its power to make a new and different agreement; contracts voluntarily and fairly made should be held valid and enforced in the courts.'\" </em>(Emphasis in original.) Id. Moreover, our Supreme Court has opined: \u201cA provision of a partnership agreement does not violate public policy simply because it is susceptible of an application that is advantageous to one partner and disadvantageous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>another.\u201d <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>228 Conn. 206, 231, 635 A.2d 798 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In the present case, it is clear that the provision in \u00a7 12 (a) (i) does not violate public policy and is enforceable. This provision was entered into by sophisticated and highly educated professionals. Additionally, during the partnership agreement negotiations, both the plaintiff and Munk were represented by the same lawyer. Furthermore, \u00a7 34-362, under which the plaintiff sought relief, expressly contemplates that a partner may be \u201cdissociated\u201d from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution of the partnership.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Moreover, this provision, which the defendants argue is an involuntary termination clause, does not favor one partner over another because the majority of the parties voted to terminate the plaintiffs association with the partnership. If the circumstances were different, the plaintiff would have been able to rely on the same provision to terminate one of the other partners. Thus, this provision is not against public policy just because in the present case it was a disadvantage to the plaintiff. See <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 231. Therefore, \u00a7 12 (a) (i) is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly concluded that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) of the parties\u2019 partnership agreement does not provide that a majority of the partners can terminate another partner without cause. The defendants maintain that, as the provision is written, the language refers to \u201ctermination resulting from any possible circumstance, excluding death or total disability, except as otherwise modified by another provision in the agreement.\u201d In opposition, the plaintiff argues that this provision is not a termination without cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>provision; rather, it provides only the right of any partner to withdraw from the practice and voluntarily terminate his association in the event that a partner moved or relocated or for some other reason decided to terminate his association with the partnership.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree with the plaintiffs assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">\u201cA contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in the contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The defendants assert that the language in \u00a7 12 (a) (i) is clear and unambiguous and permits the partners to terminate another partner without cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 12 (a) (i), \u201c[i]n the event that any [p]artner\u2019s association with the [p]artnership is terminated for any reason other than death or total disability, <em>either party shall give the other not less than ninety (90) days written notice </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendants argue that if the parties intended that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) would refer only to voluntary termination, they could have stated such intent. The defendants also refer to \u00a7 9 (a), which provides that \u201c[a]ll decisions concerning the conduct of the [p] artnership business shall be made by a majority of the [p] artnership shares, except as otherwise expressly agreed to by the [p]artners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The language of \u00a7 12 (a) (i), specifically, that <em>either party shall give the other </em>ninety days notice, clearly indicates that this provision does not simply apply to voluntary withdrawal. The term used in the provision, \u201ceither party,\u201d evidences the intent of the parties that this provision be a termination without cause provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u00a7 12 (a) (i) coupled with \u00a7 9 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>permits the very action taken by the defendants: the majority of shares acting to terminate a partner without cause. Most significantly, the plaintiff himself testified that \u00a7 12 (a) (i) permitted termination for reasons other than death, disability and termination for cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that the provision is enforceable<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that it permits the termination of the plaintiffs association with the partnership in the manner taken by the defendants.
