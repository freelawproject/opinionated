J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmE\">In 2005, the General Assembly, by enacting Public Acts 2005, No. 05-275, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 05-275), required that persons filing legal actions claiming medical negligence, filed on or after October 1, 2005, must annex to the complaint a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider stating that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence. The principal issue before us in this appeal is whether a complaint delivered to the serving marshal one day prior to the effective date of the public act, but not filed with the clerk of the Superior Court until after its October 1, 2005 effective date, was properly dismissed. We conclude that it was properly dismissed and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>In this medical malpractice action, the plaintiffs Betzabel Flores and her minor daughter, Aramis Rios, appeal from the judgment of the court granting the motion of the defendants, CCMC Corporation, doing business as Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center, and CCMC Faculty Practice Plan, Inc., to dismiss the complaint for failure to include the opinion of a similar health care provider as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-190a, as amended by P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 <em>2</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>improperly (1) granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and (2) failed to find that a motion to dismiss was not the proper vehicle to address the defendants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. In this medical malpractice case, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were negligent in failing to diagnose appendicitis on October 18, 2003. On July 1, 2005, the plaintiffs, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioned the court for an automatic ninety day extension of the applicable three year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A clerk of the Superior Court granted the extension on the same day. The plaintiffs delivered a complaint and return of service to a marshal on September 30, 2005. A marshal served the defendants on October 28, 2005. The complaint was filed with the clerk of the Superior Court on November 4, 2005. Attached to the complaint was the plaintiffs\u2019 petition pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a (b) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>a certificate of good faith submitted by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. The complaint did <em>not </em>include an opinion of a similar health care provider attesting to a good faith basis for the action, as required by \u00a7 52-190a (a) of all cases filed on or after October 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On November 21, 2005, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint due to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to include the opinion of a similar heath care provider with the complaint, as required by \u00a7 52-190a. The plaintiffs objected to the motion to dismiss, and oral argument was heard by the court on January 3, 2006. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney informed the court that he had not obtained an opinion of a similar health care provider prior to filing the action in court. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court indicated that it would \u201chold off ruling on this motion\u201d and encouraged the plaintiffs to figure out a way to get an opinion of a similar health care provider submitted to the court. The plaintiffs, however, did not attempt to file an amended complaint with a health care provider\u2019s written opinion or in any other way attempt to supplement their complaint with such an opinion. The court, however, did not issue a ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion within 120 days; see Practice Book \u00a7 11-19 (a); and, on May 5,2006, the defendants moved to have the case reassigned to another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The matter subsequently was reassigned, and, after hearing oral argument, the court, <em>Stengel, J., </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on August 15, 2006. The court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was dated September 30,2005, and was filed November 4, 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court reasoned that because the plaintiffs\u2019 action was filed after October 1, 2005, the effective date of P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2, the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>statute applied. The court, therefore, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action concluding that they had not complied with the requirements of the public act. The plaintiffs thereafter filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We first set forth our standard of review on a challenge to a ruling on a motion to dismiss. \u201cWhen the facts relevant to an issue are not in dispute, this court\u2019s task is limited to a determination of whether, on the basis of those facts, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are legally and logically correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Shop-Rite Supermarkets, Inc., </em>86 Conn. App. 426, 430, 863 A.2d 211 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 921, 867 A.2d 838 (2005). Because there is no dispute regarding the basic material facts, this case presents an issue of law and our review is plenary. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim, with respect to \u00a7 52-190a, presents an issue of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and, therefore, our review is plenary. . . . The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>98 Conn. App. 147, 154, 908 A.2d 13 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Section 52-190a (a) provides that before filing a personal injury action against a health care provider, a potential plaintiff must make \u201ca reasonable inquiry as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. . . .\u2019\u2019In order to show good faith, the complaint, initial pleading or apportionment complaint is required to contain a certificate of the attorney or party filing the action stating that \u201csuch reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant. ...\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-190a (a), as amended by P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2. Prior to the 2005 amendments, the statute provided that good faith may be shown if the plaintiffs or their counsel obtained a written opinion, not subject to discovery, from a similar health care provider that there appeared to be evidence of medical negligence. General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-190a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to the amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the statute did not require plaintiffs to include with the complaint an opinion of a similar health care provider attesting to a good faith basis for an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Effective October 1, 2005, the statute was amended to require that in order to show the existence of good faith, claimants or their counsel, prior to filing suit, \u201cshall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider . . . that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a). The amended statute also provides that claimants or their counsel \u201cshall attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a). Subsection (c), which was added by P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c[t]he failure to obtain and file the written opinion required by subsection (a) of this section shall be grounds for the dismissal of the action.\u201d P.A. 05-275 was \u201c[e]ffective October 1, 2005, and applicable to actions filed on or after said date . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In this case, the complaint did not include an opinion of a similar health care provider attesting to a good faith basis for the action, as required by the 2005 amendment to \u00a7 52-190a (a). The writ of summons and complaint were delivered to a marshal for service of process on September 30, 2005, and were filed with the clerk of the Superior Court on November 4, 2005. The plaintiffs claim that the 2005 amendment to \u00a7 52-190a, as set forth in P.A. 05-275, does not apply to the present case because the action was filed before October 1, 2005, the effective date of the public act. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the action was \u201cfiled\u201d within the meaning of P.A. 05-275 when the writ of summons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>complaint were delivered to a marshal for service of process on September 30, 2005, one day before the effective date of the 2005 amendment to \u00a7 52-190a. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The word \u201cfiled\u201d is not defined expressly in P.A. 05-275. Nevertheless, statutes governing filing in the context of other court activities define the word \u201cfiled.\u201d These provisions of the General Statutes indicate that the term refers to bringing a complaint or other pleading to the clerk of the court. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-121 (a) (\u201c[a]ny pleading in any civil action may be filed after the expiration of the time fixed by statute or by any rule of court until the court has heard any motion for judgment by default or nonsuit for failure to plead which has been filed in writing with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 51-343 (b) (\u201c \u2018[f]iled\u2019 means filed at the court location where there is a clerk designated to receive and maintain the record of the action regardless of the court location to which the writ is made returnable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The usage of the term \u201cfiled\u201d in these statutory provisions to refer to the act of bringing a complaint or other pleading to the clerk of the court comports with the usage of the term in subsection (b) of the statute at issue. General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon petition <em>to the clerk of the court where the action will be filed, </em>an automatic ninety-day extension of the statute of limitations shall be granted to allow the reasonable inquiry required by subsection (a) of this section.....\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cIt is a familiar principle of statutory construction that where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 123, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cfiling,\u201d for purposes of the effective date of the statute, refers to the delivery of the writ of summons and complaint to a state marshal for service, therefore, is unavailing. Our review of the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes reveals that this reading is inappropriate. An action is not filed until the complaint is returned to court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The plaintiffs argue, citing <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>155 Conn. 636, 236 A.2d 895 (1967), that delivery of a writ of summons and complaint to a proper serving officer constitutes \u201cfiling\u201d of the thing to be filed. <em>Rosenberg, </em>however, did not concern a requirement of filing with the clerk of the Superior Court, nor did it deal with delivery of process to a serving officer. Instead, it concerned a claim that a proposed amendment to the master zoning plan had not been delivered timely to the town clerk. The <em>Rosenberg </em>court held that the trial court had found actual delivery to the town clerk by the defendant planning board. Id., 643. The court held that \u201c[f]iling is accomplished by an actual delivery to the proper officer of the thing to be filed,\u201d referring to a municipal officer, namely, the town clerk. Id. In employing that term, it did not refer to a process server. We, therefore, reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Nowhere in their brief do the plaintiffs invoke General Statutes \u00a7 52-593a (a), which provides that a cause of action \u201cshall not be lost\u201d by virtue of the passage of a statute of limitations \u201cif the process to be served is personally delivered to a state marshal authorized to serve the process and the process is served, as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>by law, within thirty days of the delivery.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This statute, had it been invoked, would not benefit the plaintiffs, in any event. Legal actions in Connecticut are \u201ccommenced\u201d by service of process. See, e.g., <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>268 Conn. 541, 553, 848 A.2d 352 (2004). There is a separate legal requirement for the return of the process so commenced to the clerk of the court after service of it by a marshal or other proper officer. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-46a. That statute deals with the filing of the process with the clerk after the action has been commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The plain and unambiguous meaning of the term \u201cfiled\u201d refers to the bringing of a complaint or other pleading to the clerk of the court. Accordingly, as correctly determined by the trial court, the plaintiffs filed their action on November 4, 2005, when the writ of summons and complaint were filed with the clerk of the Superior Court. As a result, P.A. 05-275, with its effective date of October 1, 2005, applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Because the plaintiffs failed to comply with the provision of the public act, requiring that an opinion of a similar health care provider attesting to a good faith basis for the action be included with the complaint, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss properly was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly failed to find that a motion to dismiss was not the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>vehicle to address the defendants\u2019 claim. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss should have been denied, and the defendants should have been directed to file a motion to strike. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">This claim presents an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>supra, 98 Conn. App. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The plaintiffs, <em>citing LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), and <em>Gabrielle </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>33 Conn. App. 378, 635 A.2d 1232, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 928, 640 A.2d 115 (1994), argue that a motion to dismiss is not the proper method of attacking the sufficiency of a good faith certificate in a medical malpractice case because the lack of a good faith certif\u00edcate is not a jurisdictional defect depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Gabrielle </em>and <em>LeConche </em>is misplaced because these cases interpret a prior version of the relevant statute. See <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>supra, 701 (holding that neither language of \u00a7 52-190a [Rev. to 1987] nor legislative history suggest that lack of good faith basis for action was ground for dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, thus absence of statutorily required good faith certificate from complaint renders complaint subject to motion to strike); <em>Gabrielle </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>supra, 378 (failure to attach certificate of good faith pursuant to \u00a7 52-190a [Rev. to 1987] subjects case to motion to strike complaint because failure to so attach not jurisdictional defect).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The 2005 amendment to the statute, however, rendered the line of cases which the plaintiffs cite inapplicable. Unlike the preceding revisions of the statute, the current revision of \u00a7 52-190a includes an additional subsection, (c), which was added by P.A. 05-275, and states that \u201c[t]he failure to obtain and file the written opinion as required by subsection (a) of this section shall be grounds for the <em>dismissal </em>of the action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (c). The plain language of this new statutory subsection, which was not in effect at the time of <em>LeConche </em>and <em>Gabrielle, </em>expressly provides for dismissal of an action when a plaintiff fails to attach a written opinion of a similar health care provider to the complaint, as required by \u00a7 52-190a (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court properly considered and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In this opinion BISHOP, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-5\"> Effective October 1, 2005, P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2, amended General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) to provide as follows: \u201cNo civil action or apportionment complaint shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint, initial pleading or apportionment complaint shall contain a certificate of the attorney or party filing the action or apportionment complaint that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each named defendant or for an apportionment complaint against each named apportionment defendant. To show the existence of such good faith, the claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney, and any apportionment complainant or the apportionment complainant\u2019s attorney, shall obtain a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider, as defined in section 52-184c, which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion. Such written opinion shall not be subject to discovery by any party except for questioning the validity of the certificate. The claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney, and any apportionment complainant or apportionment complainant\u2019s attorney, shall retain the original written opinion and shall attach a copy of such written opinion, with the name and signature of the similar health care provider expunged, to such certificate. The similar health care provider who provides such written opinion shall not, without a showing of malice, be personally liable for any damages to the defendant health care provider by reason of having provided such written opinion. In addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith. If the court determines, after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate or a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.

It is worth noting, however, that in speaking on the floor of the Senate, Senator Andrew J. McDonald, the Senate chairman of the judiciary committee, stated that the provision being enacted into law \u201cmakes substantial improvements over the current system because it would require that [a] report be in writing and presented in a detailed fashion, and a copy of that report, with the name of the doctor supplying it expunged, would be attached to the complaint as an exhibit. <em>The failure to attach such an opinion would require the court to dismiss the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 48 S. Proc., Pt. 14,2005 Sess., p. 4411.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b846-7\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHLO\">dissenting in part. Although I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part I, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part II that the failure of the attorney for the plaintiffs, Aramis Rios and her mother, Betzabel Flores, to attach a written opinion of a similar health provider to his good faith certificate, as set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-190a (a), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>amended by Public Acts 2005, No. 05-275, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 05-275), renders the complaint subject to a motion to dismiss instead of a motion to strike. A motion to strike would allow a plaintiff, as a matter of right, to file a new complaint with an appropriate certificate within fifteen days, whereas the granting of a motion to dismiss puts the plaintiff out of court. In the latter situation, if the statute of limitations applicable to a medical malpractice action had expired, it may very well be that a plaintiff would be without a remedy merely because counsel, through inadvertence or neglect, failed to attach a document to his good faith certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">First, let me set the record straight. In reaching its conclusion, the majority <em>erroneously </em>relies on the claim that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs\u2019 attorney informed the [trial] court that he had not obtained an opinion of a similar health care provider prior to filing the action in court.\u201d What actually transpired was the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\u201cThe Court: Why didn\u2019t you file the certificate with the thing [that is, the attorney\u2019s certification]?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\u201c [The Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel]: Well, I didn\u2019t have a <em>written letter </em>at the time that brought this from the doctor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">This colloquy reveals that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel never admitted, as claimed by the majority, that he failed to obtain an opinion from a similar health care provider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, counsel informed the court that he had not obtained the opinion in written form at the time that he brought the complaint. Accordingly, if a motion to strike was granted, this would have allowed the plaintiffs to plead over, and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney could have attached the written opinion of the similar health care provider to his good faith certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>I begin my analysis, as our Supreme Court did in <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>215 Conn. 701, 579 A.2d 1 (1990), by recognizing \u201cthe premise that traditionally the Superior Court has had subject matter jurisdiction of a common law medical malpractice action.\u201d Id., 709. The issue presented in the present case, therefore, is whether, in enacting the most recent amendment to \u00a7 52-190a, the legislature intended to subject a plaintiffs action to dismissal where his attorney has failed to attach the written opinion of a similar health care provider to his good faith certificate. It is well established that this \u201cdetermination must be informed by the established principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 709-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Prior to the passage of P.A. 05-275, \u00a7 2, which amended \u00a7 52-190a, our Supreme Court considered the issue of whether a medical malpractice plaintiff\u2019s failure to file an attorney\u2019s good faith certificate as required by the 1987 revision of \u00a7 52-190a constituted a jurisdictional defect that rendered the complaint subject to a motion to dismiss. Id., 701. Although our Supreme Court acknowledged that the statute established a mandatory pleading requirement, the court determined that such a defect did not render the complaint subject to a motion to dismiss. Rather, characterizing the inclusion of a good faith certificate as \u201ca pleading necessity akin to an essential allegation to support a cause of action\u201d; id., 711; the Supreme Court concluded that a medical malpractice plaintiffs failure to file a good faith certificate rendered the complaint subject to a motion to strike for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a curable defect. Id.; see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 10-39 and 10-44 (party whose pleading has been stricken may file new pleading within fifteen days).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Although I recognize that <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 701, addressed the inclusion of an attorney\u2019s good faith certificate, the legislature\u2019s amendment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\u00a7 52-190a did not overrule existing case law. Accordingly, if the plaintiffs had failed to attach a good faith certificate to the complaint, a pleading requirement set forth in \u00a7 52-190a (a), their complaint would have been subject to a motion to strike.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See id., 711. In the present case, however, the plaintiffs failed to attach to that certificate a written opinion of a similar health care provider, and, under the majority\u2019s conclusion today, this defect rendered the complaint subject to a motion to dismiss. In other words, if there was a complete failure of the attorney to file his good faith certificate, including the written opinion of a similar health care provider, the complaint would only be subject to attack by a motion to strike allowing the plaintiffs to file a new complaint within fifteen days in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 10-44, but, according to the majority, when an attorney\u2019s good faith certificate is filed that does not include the written opinion of a similar health care provider, the complaint is subject to dismissal. Surely, the legislature could not have intended such an anomalous result. See <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>284 Conn. 237, 249, 932 A.2d 1063 (2007) (recognizing overriding principle that statutes should be construed \u201cso as to create a rational, coherent and consistent body of law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201c[W]e must seek a meaning which avoids a result which the legislature could not have intended even at the expense of departing from the literal meaning of the words used.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lawler, </em>163 Conn. 149, 157, 302 A.2d 252 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Moreover, in utilizing the word \u201cdismissal\u201d in subsection (c) of the current revision of \u00a7 52-190a, I cannot agree that the legislature intended to implement tort reform measures that would function in a manner such that a procedural technicality based on a defect in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>pleadings, rather than applicable substantive law, would govern the outcome of a case. Such an interpretation of the statute is reminiscent of eighteenth century common-law pleading, a system plagued by archaic legalism and highly technical formality that Connecticut abandoned long ago. The general purpose of \u00a7 52-190a was to discourage the filing of baseless lawsuits against health care providers. See <em>LeConche </em>v. <em>Elligers, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 710. When a plaintiff has failed to include the written opinion of a similar health care provider, this policy is just as well served by interpreting \u00a7 52-190a to permit a medical malpractice defendant to file a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A \u201ccase should not be decided solely on the basis of the literal meaning of a word. As Justice Reed of the United States Supreme Court has said: When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, . . . this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole this Court has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simonette </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 466, 474, 338 A.2d 453 (1973) <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>dissenting), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em>310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S. Ct. 1059, 84 L. Ed. 1345 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Accordingly, I would interpret \u00a7 52-190a in light of the existing case law and conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to attach a written opinion of a similar health care provider to the attorney\u2019s good faith certificate renders the complaint subject to a motion to strike. To rule otherwise effectively creates a procedural trap for unwary litigants that would not only disregard the plasticity of modem pleading practice but also would frustrate the fundamental policy preference in this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>that seeks to \u201cbring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for the litigant his or her day in court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vollemans </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>103 Conn.
