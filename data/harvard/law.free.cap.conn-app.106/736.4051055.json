Martyn, Jr. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that (1) the court improperly concluded that a discovery order was not complied with, (2) the parties did not receive notice that a judgment of nonsuit had been rendered, (3) the court improperly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motion to open the judgment of nonsuit and (4) the dismissal of the action constituted too harsh a result. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The following detailed procedural history is necessary for our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The plaintiffs commenced their action on June 27, 2003, by way of a one count complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that Martyn, an employee of Con-Way Transportation Services, Inc., negligently operated a truck and collided with the plaintiffs\u2019 motor vehicle. The plaintiffs further claimed that they suffered injuries as a result of this negligence. In response, the defendants filed a motion for permission to file supplemental interrogatories, requesting that Tracy Misata provide \u201cinformation concerning collateral source benefits and/or payments received by her in connection with [the plaintiffs\u2019] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>claimed injuries.\u201d The court granted this motion in September, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">On November 5, 2003, the defendants filed a motion for nonsuit, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 13-14,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to respond to the supplemental interrogatories. On February 2, 2004, the court conditionally granted this motion, stating that the motion was granted \u201cunless full compliance is served, with no objections except as based on claims of privilege, by [February 20, 2004].\u201d The court subsequently granted the plaintiffs\u2019 ex parte motion for an extension of time and ordered that the plaintiffs respond to the interrogatories by March 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The plaintiffs responded to the interrogatories; however, the defendants viewed the response as incomplete and inadequate and, accordingly, filed a motion for non-suit on March 25,2004. The plaintiffs objected four days later, but the court did not rule on this motion. The defendants filed another motion for nonsuit on December 16, 2004, which was not decided by the court. Approximately nine months later, the defendants filed a motion for a judgment of dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 13-11, 13-14 and 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>On November 14, 2005, the court held a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion. At the outset, the court noted that a judgment of nonsuit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been rendered on March 15, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel indicated that he was unaware of the judgment of nonsuit. The court observed that the plaintiffs needed to address the entry of non-suit. The court also noted that all of the parties appeared to have been unaware of the nonsuit and inquired whether the defendants objected to opening the judgment of nonsuit. Counsel for the defendants acknowledged \u201ca lack of clarity as to where the case stood procedurally\u201d and objected to opening the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On December 28, 2005, the defendants filed a second motion for a judgment of dismissal. The plaintiffs responded by filing an objection to the defendants\u2019 motion and a \u201cmotion to reopen judgment of nonsuit\u201d on January 27, 2006. The court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion because of their \u201cfailure to fully respond to discovery response by March 15, 2004. Responses were incomplete, e.g., 6, 10, 12, 13 and 23.\u201d On March 21, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a \u201cmotion for reconsideration to reopen judgment of nonsuit.\u201d The court denied this motion, stating: \u201c[U]ntimely, no good reason given for entry of nonsuit or judgment or why counsel was unaware of [March 15, 2004] ruling. Discovery answers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>were equivocal, nonresponsive and inadequate for their purpose.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">As a preliminary matter, we must resolve, due to the procedural posture of this case, whether we may consider the merits of the underlying judgment of non-suit or whether our inquiry is restricted to whether the court abused its discretion in failing to open the judgment. See <em>Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Waterfield, </em>102 Conn. App. 277, 283, 925 A.2d 451 (2007). Ordinarily, we would conclude that our review is limited to the question of whether the court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to open the judgment of nonsuit. Due to the unique circumstances of the present case, however, we conclude that the question of whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to open the judgment is inextricably intertwined with the underlying judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The court rendered a judgment of nonsuit on March 15, 2004. Neither party, however, received notice of this judgment. Our review of the record does not reveal any indication that notice was sent to either party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>not until the November 14, 2005 hearing that the plaintiffs were made aware of the existence of the judgment of nonsuit. See <em>Segretario </em>v. <em>Stewart-Warner Corp., </em>9 Conn. App. 355, 360, 519 A.2d 76 (1986) (\u201c[a] judgment of nonsuit is in fact rendered when the trial judge orders a nonsuit entered orally\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that November 14, 2005, commenced the four month period<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> within which the plaintiff was permitted to file a motion to open the judgment of nonsuit. See <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Caldrello, </em>68 Conn. App. 68, 70-74, 789 A.2d 1005, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 903, 793 A.2d 1088, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 824, 123 S. Ct. 111, 154 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2002). Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 January 27, 2006 motion to open the judgment was timely before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The plaintiffs chose to pursue the procedural option of filing a motion to open. Subsequently, they filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of that motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They did not file an appeal from the judgment of nonsuit within twenty days of the November 14, 2005 hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Additionally, the plaintiffs filed the motion to open more than twenty days after receiving notice of the judgment of nonsuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On the appeal form, the plaintiffs indicated that they were appealing from the \u201c [dismissal (nonsuit) of case for . . . alleged failure to adequately in a timely manner answer . . . requests for discovery.\u201d Furthermore, they have raised issues pertaining to both the underlying judgment of nonsuit and the motions to open and for reconsideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">It is well established in our jurisprudence that \u201c[w]here an appeal has been taken from the denial of a motion to open, but the appeal period has run with respect to the underlying judgment, <em>we have refused to entertain issues relating to the merits of the underlying case and have limited our consideration to whether the denial of the motion to open was proper. Tiber Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>36 Conn. App. 670, 671, 652 A.2d 1063 (1995). When a motion to open is filed more than twenty days after the judgment, <em>the appeal from the denial of that motion can test only whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to open the judgment and not the propriety of the merits of the underlying judgment. Altberg </em>v. <em>Paul Kovacs Tire Shop, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 634, 640, 626 A.2d 804 (1993). This is so because otherwise the same issues that could have been resolved if timely raised would nevertheless be resolved, which would, in effect, extend the time to appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stephen </em>v. <em>Hoerle, </em>39 Conn. App. 253, 256-57, 664 A.2d 817, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 928, 667 A.2d 555 (1995); <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>60 Conn. App. 630, 635, 760 A.2d 974 (2000); <em>Connecticut Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Obenauf </em>59 Conn. App. 351,354, 758 A.2d 363 (2000); <em>Charbonneau </em>v. <em>Charbonneau, </em>51 Conn. App. 311, 312-13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>721 A.2d 565 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 964, 724 A.2d 1125 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs filed the motion to open more than twenty days after receiving notice of the judgment of nonsuit. In light of the well established precedent, they normally would be precluded from challenging the merits of the underlying judgment in this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our review of the record, however, reveals that there had been no judicial determination that the plaintiffs had not complied with the discovery request until the court denied the motion to open. Specifically, the February 17, 2006 order in which the court stated that the motion to open was \u201c[d]enied for the failure to fully respond to discovery response by March 15, 2004 [and that] [Responses were incomplete, e.g., 6,10, 12, 13 and 23,\u201d was the first ruling by a judge of the Superior Court that the plaintiff had not responded fully to the discovery order. Furthermore, in ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the court described the responses as \u201cequivocal, nonresponsive and inadequate . . . .\u201d Simply put, it was not until February 17,2006, and, in response to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration on April 17, 2006, that the court actually decided whether the plaintiffs\u2019 responses were sufficient. The court, therefore, was not only ruling on the motion to open but also the underlying basis of the entry of a judgment of nonsuit. Thus, in order for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in denying the motion to open, we must also consider whether the basis for the nonsuit was proper.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">As we previously have noted, the court did not explain the basis for its determination that the plaintiffs had not complied with the discovery orders. It described the plaintiffs\u2019 answers as \u201cincomplete,\u201d \u201cequivocal, nonresponsive and insufficient for their purpose.\u201d The court subsequently stated that \u201c[ultimately, no good reason [was] given for entry of nonsuit or judgment or why counsel [for the plaintiffs] was unaware [of the March 15, 2004] ruling.\u201d We conclude that the record is inadequate to review whether the court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 responses did not comply with the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201c[I]t is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . . [A]n appellate tribunal cannot render a decision without first fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>understanding the disposition being appealed. . . . Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the plaintiffs\u2019 claim] would be entirely speculative. ... It is, therefore, the responsibility of the appellants] to move for an articulation or clarification of the record when the trial court has failed to state the basis of a decision. . . . [W]here the trial court\u2019s decision is ambiguous, unclear or <em>incomplete, </em>an appellant must seek an articulation . . . or this court will not review the claim.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>94 Conn. App. 103, 124-25, 891 A.2d 106 (2006); see also Practice Book \u00a7 61-10. The plaintiffs have failed to perfect the record for our review, and, therefore, we cannot review the trial court\u2019s determination that responses to the discovery order were insufficient. We are left, therefore, with the conclusion by the court regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 responses that we cannot review.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">On the basis of this inadequate record, we are unable to conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to open on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 (a) provides: \u201cIf any party has failed to answer interrogatories or to answer them fairly, or has intentionally answered them falsely or in a manner calculated to mislead, or has failed to respond to requests for production or for disclosure of the existence and contents of an insurance policy or the limits thereof, or has failed to submit to a physical or mental examination, or has failed to comply with a discovery order made pursuant to Section 13-13, or has failed to comply with the provisions of Section 13-15, or has failed to appear and testily at a deposition duly noticed pursuant to this chapter, or has failed otherwise substantially to comply with any other discovery order made pursuant to Sections 13-6 through 13-11, the judicial authority may, on motion, make such order as the ends of justice require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch orders may include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\u201c(1) The entry of a nonsuit or default against the party failing to comply ----\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> The record does not reveal whether the court issued a memorandum of decision or simply entered the judgment of nonsuit without additional comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> \u201cGenerally speaking, a nonsuit is the name of a judgment rendered against a party in a legal proceeding upon his inability to maintain his cause in court, or when he is in default in prosecuting his suit or in complying with orders of the court. . . .
