The defendant challenges the court\u2019s conclusion that the state board of mediation and arbitration (board) improperly failed to address every aspect of the issue submitted for resolution. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">The relevant facts and procedural history are not in dispute. The plaintiff and the defendant are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. Article twenty-six of that agreement provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ll acting Assistant Chief assignments shall be filled by offering such assignments to Fire Captains in the order of their seniority who have been deemed qualified by the Fire Chief.\u201d The plaintiff brought grievances on behalf of two captains in the fire department, Bruce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Elander and William Haug, alleging that the defendant violated this provision. The grievances were not resolved to the satisfaction of the plaintiff at the municipal level. Thereafter, in accordance with article six of the collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiff submitted the consolidated dispute to arbitration by the board. The \u201cissue\u201d submitted was as follows: \u201cDid the City of Bridgeport violate Article 26 of the collective bargaining agreement as alleged in the Elander/Haug grievance? If so, what shall the remedy be?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Following a hearing before the board, the board issued a memorandum of decision denying the grievance. A majority of the members of the board concluded that the plaintiff had failed to present any evidence that either Haug or Elander were, at relevant times, senior captains to whom the provision at issue applied. The board reasoned that, in essence, the plaintiff was asking it to \u201cspeculate\u201d that, \u201cgiven their seniority status, Elander and Haug must have been denied an acting assignment during this period.\u201d The board based its decision on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The plaintiff subsequently filed in the Superior Court an application to vacate the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a). The plaintiff argued that the board \u201cfailed to render an award on the issue\u201d submitted to it and thus \u201cexceeded [its] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d In an oral ruling,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court sided with the plaintiff, concluding that the board merely had determined that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>remedy was available for Elander or Haug, but had failed to resolve the question of whether the defendant had violated the collective bargaining agreement. The court granted the application to vacate and directed the board to determine, first, if the defendant had violated article twenty-six and, second, if such a violation had occurred, to determine an appropriate remedy. The court implicitly determined that the issue submitted required the board to determine whether the defendant had violated article twenty-six with regard to <em>any </em>firefighter and, later, to determine whether Elander or Haug were entitled to a remedy related to such violation. In this vein, the court noted that the board\u2019s conclusion that neither Elander nor Haug was entitled to any remedy \u201cmay be absolutely proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendant appeals from the court\u2019s decision, arguing that the court essentially \u201cchanged the submission and ordered the [board] to determine a different submission.\u201d The defendant argues that the board properly interpreted the issue submitted to relate only to whether it had violated article twenty-six with respect to Elander or Haug, that the award properly conformed to the submission and that the court improperly failed to curtail its analysis to determining only whether the award conformed to the submission. The plaintiff continues to maintain that the board \u201cexceeded the scope of the submission\u201d by declining to determine whether the defendant had violated the agreement. The plaintiff argues that the court properly vacated the board\u2019s award because, under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the members of the board \u201cexceeded their powers or so imperfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u201cJudicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. . . . When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. . . . When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. . . . Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe significance ... of a determination that an arbitration submission was unrestricted or restricted is not to determine what the arbitrators are obligated to do, but to determine the scope of judicial review of what they have done. Put another way, the submission tells the arbitrators what they are obligated to decide. The determination by a court of whether the submission was restricted or unrestricted tells the court what its scope of review is regarding the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have . . . recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy . . . [and] (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>275 Conn. 72, 80-81, 881 A.2d 139 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We agree with the assertion made by both parties that the submission at issue was unrestricted; neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the parties\u2019 agreement nor any other provision restricted the powers of the board. See <em>Alderman &amp; Alderman </em>v. <em>Pollack, </em>100 Conn. App. 80, 85, 917 A.2d 60 (2007); <em>Rocky Hill Teachers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>72 Conn. App. 274, 278 n.6, 804 A.2d 999, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 907, 810 A.2d 272 (2002). Thus, we review only the ground raised by the plaintiff in the trial court, with which the court agreed, which is that the board contravened \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The court concluded that the board improperly had failed to resolve at least an aspect of the actual issue submitted by the parties. Essentially, the court reasoned that the board had either disregarded or misunderstood the nature of the issue submitted for resolution. We disagree. \u201c \u2018[T]he arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the issue must be upheld so long as it is rationally derived from the parties\u2019 submission\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Harty </em>v. <em>Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 99, quoting <em>American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, Milwaukee Local </em>v. <em>Runyon, </em>185 F.3d 832, 835 (7th Cir. 1999). \u201c[A]n award must be final as to the matters submitted so that the rights and obligations of the parties may be definitely fixed.\u201d <em>Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 617, 109 A.2d 240 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L. Ed. 748 (1955). As noted, the issue submitted was whether the defendant had violated the agreement \u201cas alleged in the Elander/Haug grievance\u201d and, \u201c[i]f so, what shall the remedy be?\u201d The board\u2019s decision reflects that it interpreted this submission to relate to two specific firefighters, Elander and Haug, and whether they were entitled to any remedy as a result of a violation of article twenty-six by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The board\u2019s interpretation of the issue submitted by the parties was entirely reasonable, and its analysis of the issue properly was tailored to reach a final award that resolved the issue for the interested firefighters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>whom the parties had identified by name. Once it determined that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that either Elander or Haug had been harmed by any violation of article twenty-six, it reasonably deemed it unnecessary to determine whether any violation of that provision had occurred as to any other firefighter. Although the board might have resolved the issue presented by first determining whether the defendant had violated that provision as alleged, there simply is no basis in law or logic to conclude that it was obligated by the submission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\"> The court neither issued a written memorandum of decision nor created a memorandum of decision from its oral ruling in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (a). It does not appear that the defendant took appropriate action under Practice Book \u00a7 64-1 (b) to perfect the record. Nevertheless, we are able to review the claim raised because the unsigned transcript of proceedings before the trial court adequately reveals the basis of the court\u2019s decision. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>93 Conn. App. 51, 57 n.6, 887 A.2d 923 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects ... (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
