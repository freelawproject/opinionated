Hering, then Comptroller of the State, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201cBaltimore, Md., June 1, 1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\n<em>George Warfield, Esq.,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\n<em>Former Sheriff of Baltimore City,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">To The State oe Maryland, Dr.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">For amount retained as sheriff of Baltimore City for the year ending November 28, 1903, in excess of salary ($3,000.00) for said year and of expenses of said office for said year, $5,518.79.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">(With interest from said date of November 28, 1903).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">On the 29th of June, 1909, the defendant appeared to the suit and filed a demand for a bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">On the 14th of July, 1909, the plaintiff filed an answer to the demand for a bill of particulars, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">That the statement of the particulars heretofore filed by the plaintiff, with its declaration, sufficiently sets forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim therein, and the defendant is not entitled to demand further particulars of said claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The State' of Maryland further shows that the defendant, at or after the conclusion of his term of office as Sheriff of Baltimore City, mentioned in the declaration and statement of the particulars of the claim heretofore filed by the State, the plaintiff herein, and prior to the institution of this suit, took possession of and removed from the office of the Sheriff the books of entry and account wherein and while the defendant was Sheriff during his term as aforesaid the entries of the receipts and disbursements of the sheriff\u2019s office during said term, as well as the entries of the amounts paid over by the defendant, as Sheriff as aforesaid, to the State of Maryland were recorded and kept, and that the defendant accord; ingly was and is fully informed of ail the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and is not entitled to any further or greater particulars than those set forth in the declaration and statement of the claim filed herewith by the plaintiff as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">And on the 29th of July, 1909, the defendant filed the following exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s answer and to the bill of particulars:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">1. Because the bill of particulars and answer filed by the plaintiff are insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">2. Because the State Auditor examined and verified the accounts of the defendant and passed them as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">3. Because the plaintiff must be in possession of all of the particulars of its alleged claim against the defendant, since it has, by its Comptroller, made affidavit to the amount of money claimed by it to be due from the defendant as set forth in its declaration filed by it in this case and sworn to as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">4. Because the defendant is not informed as to the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">5. And for other good and sufficient reasons to be shown at the hearing.'</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>After a hearing in the Court below of the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the answer of the plaintiff to his demand for a bill of particulars, it appears from the record that \u201con the 28th of Xovember, 1910, defendant\u2019s exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s answer were overruled and demand for a bill of particulars refused.\u201d And in an opinion filed by Judge Ej.mott, who heard the case in the Court below, it is stated, \u201cthe exceptions of the defendant will be overruled and he will be required to plead to the declaration as filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Oil the 27th of January, 1911, the defendant directed an appeal, as follows: \u201cEnter an appeal from the order passed on Xovember 28th, 1910, overruling\u2019 the defendant\u2019s exceptions to plaintiff\u2019s answer to defendant\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars, and refusing said demand for a bill of particulars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Xow, treating the ruling of the Court in this case as an order, refusing a proper demand to furnish further particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, it could only be regarded as a ruling in the course of the trial or an order interlocutory in its character, and if erroneous to be reviewed, if the action of the Court below is not final, when brought up after final judgment and appeal thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In <em>Poes Practice, </em>4th Ed., page 1,006, it is said: \u201cIt is to be observed, however, that even in cases where the lower Court proceeds in the exercise of its ordinary common law jurisdiction, neither an appeal nor writ of error can be prosecuted until after <em>final </em>judgment. Orders or rulings which do not settle and conclude the rights involved in the action and do not deny to the party the means of further prosecuting or defending the suit are not the subject of appeal at the time they are made; but, when final judgment is rendered and appeal thereon prayed, such interlocutory orders or rulings may be brought up in the record and may then be reviewed and reversed, if erroneous, provided, of course, they be in respect of matters upon which the action of the lower Court is not final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The rule in this respect is not only well settled, hut, as stated by <em>Mr. Poe, </em>is absolutely necessary to be enforced in order to prevent the regular process of a cause unto its final determination from being interrupted by successive appeals from rulings made from time to time during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In 2 <em>Gyc. </em>607, it is said: An order granting or denying a motion to make a pleading more definite and certain is not appealable before final judgment. <em>Ferry </em>v. <em>King Co., </em>2 Wash. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">It is well settled by express authority, that an order requiring or refusing a bill of particulars to be made more specific is not appealable before final judgment. <em>Burk </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>80 Md. 100; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>2 Gill, 430; <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>165 U. S. 486; <em>Van Zant </em>v. <em>Wood Produce Co., </em>54 Minn. 202; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Reifsnider, </em>39 Md. 430 ; <em>Millwood </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>2 Taunton, 224; 2 <em>Cyc., Appeal and Error, </em>586; <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>161 U. S. 29; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tweed, </em>63 N. Y. 199; <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>59 N. Y. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In 3 <em>Ency. of Pl. and Pr. </em>536, it is said: \u201cThere is no inflexible rule as to the classes of cases in which a bill of particulars will be granted, but it rests within the sound judicial discretion of the Court, to be exercised only in furtherance of justice, and the motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the Court.\u201d 3 <em>Ency. of Pl. and Pr. </em>524, 527, 529; <em>Oland </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>69 Md. 248; <em>Poe\u2019s Practice, </em>4th Ed. 827; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>102 Md. 344; <em>Vansant </em>v. <em>State, </em>96 Md. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In <em>Cunard </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>111 N. Y. 513, the Court said: \u201cIf the Court had the power to order* a bill of particulars in this action, then its exercise of that power will not be reviewed by us. * * * As it does not appear that the Court has transcended its power in granting the order appealed from, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">In <em>Witowski </em>v. <em>Paramore, </em>93 N. Y. 470, it was declared: \u201cThe scope of an order for particulars must ordinarily be a question of discretion, depending upon the circumstances. Such an order is not reviewable in this Court, unless it clearly transcends the power of the Court as defined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>general course of practice in respect to bills of particulars * \"x\u2018 * We think the Court had jurisdiction to grant the order, and the appeal should, therefore, he dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It is very clear, we think, that no appeal lies from the order passed in the case at bar, in overruling the defendant\u2019s exceptions and refusing the demand for a bill of particulars, and it therefore follows that' the action of the Court thereon is not a subject for review on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
