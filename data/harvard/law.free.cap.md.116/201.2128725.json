The c\u00e1rgo was consigned by the bill of lading to the appellee, hut on proper endorsement by them was turned over to the appellant, who subsequently sold the fruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The case has been tried at least five\u2019times in the Baltimore City Courts, resulting in several verdicts for the plaintiff, one in favor of the defendant and several mistrials. To the declaration filed on the 5th day of June, 1901, the defendant pleaded-the general issue pleas in assumpsit.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On June 4, 1903, the plaintiff by leave of Court filed the following amended declaration in trover: \u201cFor that the \u2022defendant converted to its own use and wrongfully deprived the plaintiffs of the use and possession of the goods and chattels of the plaintiffs \u2014 that is to say, of certain merchandise consisting of bananas and oranges, and valued at seven hundred and twenty-three dollars and twenty-five cents,\u201d and to this declaration, the general issue plea- of <em>non cul in tort </em>.was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On October 27, 1903, the case was removed to the Baltimore City Court, and upon trial on the 12th of November, 1903, a verdict was rendered by1 a jury for $776.96 in favor of the plaintiff, but which was subsequently set aside by the Court, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">On March 29, 1905, a trial was begun and a jury was sworn, but upon leave granted to amend the declaration from trover to assumpsit the case was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">On April 4th, 1905, the appellees filed a second amended declaration changing the form of action from trover to assumpsit on the common counts, and claimed $1,500 damages, and to this declaration was annexed a statement of account between the Catanzaro Company and F. W. Stock &amp; Sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">To the declaration the appellant, on the 7th of April, 1905, filed the general issue pleas and two special pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>of liniitation, as follows: \u201cFor a first plea, that it never was indebted as alleged; and for a second plea says, that it did not promise as alleged; and for a third plea the defendant says that the alleged cause of action did not accrue within three years before this suit; and for the fourth plea the defendant says that the alleged cause of action did not accrue within three years prior to the commencement of this suit, to wit, March 31, 1905.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On the 27th day of April, 1905, the plaintiff joined issue on the first and second pleas and filed a replication to the third and fourth pleas. Subsequently, petitions, motions, counter motions and other proceedings, almost too numerous to mention, were interposed before another trial was had, as will appear from the following docket entries in the case1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cDocket Entries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">24th May, 1905. \u2014 Petition of defendant to dismiss the Replications to the 3rd and 4th Pleas; reasons filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">24th May, 1905. \u2014 Order of Court extending time for filing a Rejoinder or Rejoinders for 10 days after the disposition of the petition to strike out the Replications to the 3rd and 4th Pleas filed.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">13th Movember, 1906. \u2014 Petition of plaintiffs to strike out their Replications to the defendant\u2019s 4th Plea and Affidavit in support -of said motion filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">13th November, 1906. \u2014 Order of Court granting leave filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">13th November, 1906. \u2014 Plaintiff\u2019s Replication to defendant\u2019s 4th Plea struck out; order of plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">13th Movember, 1906. \u2014 Motion by plaintiffs to strike out the defendant\u2019s 4th Plea filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">13thMovember, 1906.- \u2014 Affidavit of Joseph M.

Co. </em>v. <em>Young, </em>115 Md.; <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Warren Bros., </em>115 Md.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In this case the rules of Court are not in the record, and we have nothing except the docket entries, and these do not show why 'the Court permitted the plaintiff to strike out the replication to the fourth plea or why it struck out the fourth plea at all, and the presumption therefore is, the Court ruled and decided correctly. <em>Cushwa </em>v. <em>Cushwa, </em>9 Gill, 247; <em>Newcomer </em>v. <em>Keedy, </em>9 Gill, 264; <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>67 Md. 74; <em>Stockett </em>v. <em>Sasscer, </em>8 Md. 375; <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>69 Md. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Coming now to the rulings of the Court upon the prayers and the evidence, it appears that at the trial the defendant reserved forty exceptions, thirty-nine to the rulings upon the evidence and the fortieth to the ruling of the Court in grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ing the plaintiff\u2019s first, third, fourth and ninth prayers and in refusing the defendant\u2019s first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth prayers, and in overruling the defendant\u2019s special exceptions to the third and ninth prayers of the plaintiff. There were twenty-seven prayers submitted in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer was clearly erroneous and should have been rejected. It was error to have instructed the jury that the verdict must be for the plaintiff for the value of the goods at the time of their sale to the defendant. The proper measure of damages in an.action of this kind for money had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff would be the amount of money received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff, with interest in the discretion of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In <em>Ruhl </em>v. <em>Corner, </em>63 Md. 179, it was held that a similar prayer was correctly refused, for it claims as the measure of damages that which belongs to the action of trover and not to the form of action adopted by the plaintiffs. In the action of assumpsit the plaintiff can only recover for the money had and received from the sale to the use of the plaintiff. This prayer was, therefore, inconsistent with the form of action... <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Sternheimer, </em>29 Md. 268; <em>Heinekamp </em>v. <em>Beaty, </em>74 Md. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The prayer is also objectionable in other respects: First, it segregates a portion of the evidence and directs the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff upon this evidence and not upon the whole evidence; secondly, there was evidence tending to show that the defendant was a bona fide purchaser for value, which should have been embraced in the prayer for the jury to pass upon, and, thirdly, the prayer as framed did not present a sound legal proposition. <em>Darrin </em>v. <em>Whittingham, </em>107 Md. 52; <em>Poe\u2019s Pleading and Practice, </em>Vol. 2, section 301; <em>Mt. Vernon Co. </em>v. <em>Teschner, </em>108 Md. 173; <em>Christopher </em>v. <em>Christopher, </em>64 Md. 585; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Savings Institution, </em>84 Md. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s third, fourth and ninth prayers were also erroneous and should have been rejected. The third prayer was defective because it excluded from the consideration of the jury the evidence and defences relied upon by the defendant to defeat the action, and contained an erroneous proposition on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The fourth prayer is subject to the same objections as stated against the first prayer, upon the measure of damages, and practically embraced the first prayer. <em>Ruhl </em>v. <em>Corner, </em>63 Md. 179. * \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s ninth prayer. was granted, in connection with plaintiff\u2019s first, third and fourth prayers. They are so absolutely inconsistent upon the measure of damages, that conformity with one necessarily implied a disregard of the one or the other. The theories of the prayers were conflicting and directly opposed, and were calculated to mislead the jury and should have been rejected. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Capron, </em>21 Md. 186; <em>Haney </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>9 Md. 215; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. </em>v. Blocher, 27 Md. 277; <em>Farmers\u2019 Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>87 Md. 13. .</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">This brings us to a consideration of the defendant\u2019s prayers, and in the view we take of this case, we think the defendant\u2019s fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth prayers should have been granted, as the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the statute of limitations under its third plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">While these prayers do not refer to the pleadings, the defendant\u2019s first and second prayers do refer to* them, and this, we think, is sufficient to permit an examination of the pleadings on these .prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The first prayer, asked the Court to instruct the jury that \u201cthere was no evidence under any count in the declaration,\u201d and the second prayers \u201creferred to the material averments of the declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">In <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>107 Md. 128, this Court.said: \u201cIt is true that the prayer does not refer to the pleadings, but defendant\u2019s \u00a3D\u2019 prayer did specifically refer to the third and fourth counts; some prayers referred to the other counts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>and defendant\u2019s T\u00ed\u2019 prayer referred to the pleadings generally.\u201d The Court\u2019s attention to each and every count was, therefore, thus drawn by the prayers of the defendant to the pleadings. <em>Leopard </em>v. <em>Canal Co., </em>1 Gill, 222; <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Fauntleroy, </em>1 Md. 136; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>82 Md. 504; <em>Baltimore Bldg. </em>Asso. v. <em>Grant, </em>41 Md. 569; <em>Baltimore Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>65 Md. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The defendant\u2019s third plea set up the defence that the alleged cause of action did not accrue within three years before the suit, and this plea under the facts of the present case was a bar to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second amended declaration and the cause of action filed on the 4th day of April, 1905, materially changed the character of the action and made an entirely new case. The original suit had been instituted in assumpsit on the 5th day of June, 1901, and was changed on the 4th day of June, 1903, to trover, and on the 4th of April, 1905, the form of action was amended to assumpsit, and a new claim, demand and cause of action filed with the declaration. These actions, one in tort and the other an action <em>ex contractu, </em>do not admit of the same pleas. The measure of damages in trover is the value of the goods at the time of the conversion, and in assumpsit, the recovery is for the money had and received, for the use of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>53 Md. 37, it was held upon the filing of the amended declaration, under the circumstances of that case, the defendant had the right to interpose the plea of limitations as a defence to the new case thus made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Thirston, </em>94 Md. 256, where the original declaration was a suit upon an alleged oral agreement, and there was no count in the declaration on a <em>quantum meruit </em>for the value of the services, under an amendment to the action in <em>assumpsit, </em>to a <em>quantum meruit, </em>this Court held, it was a new suit, and the statute of limitations was a bar to the action. In <em>Zier </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Ry. Co., </em>98 Md. 41, Chief Judge McSheery, said: \u201cThus in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Thirston, supra, </em>it was-held that a plea similar in effect, to the one we are considering was proper because the amendment of the declaration changed the form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Hr; Poe in his valuable work on <em>Practice, </em>section 189, thus states the rule, \u2019if the defendant omits to plead the statute of limitations and subsequently the declaration is amended by the addition of other counts the defendant is entitled to plead limitations to such counts and where the amendment materially changes the character of the action the plea will be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In 25 <em>Cyc. </em>1308, the rule is thus laid down, as supported by authority, \u201can amendment which introduces a new or different cause of action and makes a new and different demand does not relate back-to the beginning of the action, so as to stop the running of the statute of limitations, but is the equivalent of a fresh suit upon a new cause of action and the statute continues to run until the amendment is filed, and this rule applies., although the two causes of action arise out of the same transaction. And if the plaintiff introduces a new\" claim and cause of action by the amendment against which the statute of limitations has run, that defence is available.\u201d 25 <em>Cyc. </em>1304 and 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The filing of the second amended declaration and cause of action was equivalent to bringing a new suit as of the amendment and the defendant can not be deprived of the opportunity of pleading the defence of limitations. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>District, 1 Mackey, </em>D. C. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In the present case, the change of the form of action by the plaintiff\u2019s amendment, introduced a new and different claim, demand and cause of action, and this opened the case to the bar of the statute of limitations under the defendant\u2019s third plea, and there was error in not granting the defendant\u2019s fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">As this conclusion disposes of the case, it will be unnecessary to consider the other rulings raised by the remaining exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>For the errors indicated the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and as the plaintiff\u2019s demand set out in the second amended declaration is barred by limitations, a new trial will not be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial refused, with costs to the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
