Robinson and Jerry L. Cand\u00eda, were arrested for possession of cocaine and related charges stemming from a motor vehicle stop on the George Washington Bridge. After an indictment was returned, defendant and Cand\u00eda moved to suppress evidence of the cocaine, which was seized after a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Judge Elijah Miller heard the following evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress. On October 4, 1996, at approximately 2:15 p.m., Port Authority Officer Gregory Johnson was driving westbound in a marked police unit on the George Washington Bridge. Port Authority Police Officers Tromlin and Simons were his passengers. While driving on the bridge\u2019s upper level, Johnson saw a gold Infiniti with a Connecticut paper dealer\u2019s plate \u201cdriving in a careless manner.\u201d The Infiniti was weaving in its lane, riding the lane markings, and at one point, was tailgating the vehicle in front. Johnson estimated that the Infiniti was traveling approximately two miles over the speed limit. He noticed that the Infiniti\u2019s driver was \u201ceither black or Puerto Rican.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Officer Johnson stopped the Infiniti after it exited the bridge. Officers Johnson, Tromlin and Simons then exited the patrol vehicle and approached the Infiniti. The driver, Robinson, could not produce a driver\u2019s license or registration. He explained that he had recently purchased the vehicle and that the registration sticker was on the window. He admitted that he had no license, insurance, nor any identification. Johnson asked Robinson to exit the vehicle. While standing at the rear of the vehicle, Robinson told Johnson that the Infiniti belonged to his cousin\u2019s girlfriend. He and the rear seat passenger, Cand\u00eda, had driven to Manhattan from Linden to buy rims for the car\u2019s tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Johnson noticed that Robinson was nervous when he exited the vehicle. He was also swaying while walking and standing, used profanity, acted boisterously, and uttered incomplete thoughts. Johnson suspected that Robinson was under the influence of CDS. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>He checked Robinson\u2019s eyes with a small pen light and noticed that his pupils were dilated and sluggish in reaction to the light.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Defendant was the front seat passenger. Johnson asked defendant to exit the vehicle because he did not want to talk to him in front of Cand\u00eda, the rear seat passenger. At the front end of the Infiniti, defendant said that the car belonged to his sister, Tammy Halsey. Defendant said that he and Cand\u00eda were in New York and happened to meet the driver there. Johnson noted that when defendant exited the vehicle, he was swaying, his eyes were watery and bloodshot, he was using profanity and talking fast. Johnson checked his eyes with his flashlight, and observed that his pupils were dilated and sluggish in reaction to the light. Johnson also noted that defendant\u2019s clothes were dirty and mussed. Johnson told defendant to stay at the front of the Infiniti, then walked to the side to speak to Cand\u00eda. <em>6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Johnson looked into the car to speak to the rear seat passenger and observed a brown paper bag by his foot. Johnson asked Cand\u00eda who owned the car and where they were coming from. Cand\u00eda responded that the three of them were in New York visiting a friend. Johnson observed that Cand\u00eda was using profanity and his pupils were fixed with no reaction to light.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Officer Tromlin retrieved the brown paper bag. The bag contained crack vials and plastic crack caps for the vials.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Johnson arrested the three occupants of the Infiniti. When asked if the suspects were placed under arrest at this point, Johnson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">They were under arrest before. They didn\u2019t know it but they were under arrest, but yes, after that, they all denied knowledge or ownership of the bag and its contents and then they were physically handcuffed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">In other words, the suspects were already under arrest for being under the influence of drugs but Johnson had not actually told them this until the brown paper bag was opened. The three men were placed in the back of the police car and driven to headquarters. Officer Tromlin sat in the front seat and Officer Simons drove the Infiniti. As they were driving back, Tromlin tapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Johnson on the leg and whispered to him that Cand\u00eda was moving around a lot in the back seat. When the officers arrived at headquarters, they took Cand\u00eda out of the squad car. Johnson pulled out the back seat of the squad car and found a plastic bag with crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In denying defendant\u2019s and Candia\u2019s motion to suppress, Judge Miller found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">[Officer Johnson] activated his lights, hit his siren, used his PA system, pulled over the vehicle to the right, it pulled over without incident, he made no untoward observations. On cross-examination noted that the driver was either a black male or ... a Puerto Rican male, he indicated, but he did not stop him because of race, it was not a profile stop, I\u2019ll get into that a little bit more, but that seems to be indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">I note, parenthetically, Officer Johnson is an African American and testifying in this context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">Here, Officer Johnson stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the motor vehicle violation had occurred. Robinson was driving in an erratic and careless manner, he was weaving in traffic and I so find, on the marking lanes as well as tailgating very close to the vehicle, within 15 feet....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">A look at the facts of this ease clearly show that the officer\u2019s observation gave him a qualified suspicion, if not probable cause, and I so find it was probable cause, that a motor vehicle infraction occurred, therefore, the stop of the defendant\u2019s car was lawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">The officer observed all three men to be under the influence, and failed to produce any identification. Clearly, the car could not go anywhere, could not be driven, it would have to be impounded as the officer said at that point. Based on these observations, Officer Johnson lawfully arrested all three men. Subsequently, they were read their rights, placed under arrest, handcuffed, placed in the rear of the ear. He acted appropriately, I found [him] to be candid, I find nothing in his conversation, in his testimony to indicate anything other than being candid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">I do find in this case they had that probable cause, based not only on the weaving and driving of that vehicle, but the perception that they were under the influence of drugs at that time, all three individuals, at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">After the motion to suppress was denied by Judge Miller, defendant entered into a negotiated plea of guilty to second degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>2C:35-5a(1), and -5b(2). In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss a related charge of third degree possession of cocaine, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(1), and two disorderly persons charges: being under the influence of CDS, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10b, and possession of drug paraphernalia, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:36-2 (Fort Lee Municipal Court complaint # S927819), and to recommend a ten-year term of imprisonment with a fifty-seven month period of parole ineligibility. Judge Eugene H. Austin accepted the plea and imposed the negotiated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Defendant now appeals pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d) contending that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">A. The Police Lacked The Requisite Articulable Suspicion In Order To Justify The Initial Motor Vehicle Stop Of The Vehicle Defendant Was Riding In.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">B. Defense Counsel Should Have Been Allowed To Pursue The Line Of Questioning Regarding Racial Profiling And It Was Reversible Error For The Judge To Limit Defense Counsel\u2019s Questioning Regarding That Issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">C. The Police Officer\u2019s Ordering The Defendant To Get Out Of The Vehicle Constituted A Violation Of His Fourth Amendment Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">D. The Testimony Of Officer Johnson Did Not Demonstrate That .He Had Probable Cause To Arrest The Occupants Of The Vehicle For Being Under The Influence Of A Controlled Dangerous Substance, And Therefore The Search Of The Vehicle Violated The Defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\">E. The Search Of The Vehicle Was Not Conducted Incident To a Lawful Custodial Arrest, And Therefore The Officer\u2019s Action In Searching The Vehicle Violated The Defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-14\">F. The State Cannot Rely Upon The Claim That The Evidence Would Have Been Inevitably Discovered After An Inventory Search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">We are not persuaded by any of these arguments which are without merit and, with one exception (the racial profiling issue), do not require extensive discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). We merely note the following. Judge Miller found Officer Johnson to be a credible witness. Johnson\u2019s testimony about the Infiniti\u2019s speed, tailgating, and changing lanes justified the stop for careless driving. That Officer Johnson did not prove a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>motor vehicle violation at the motion to suppress does not negate a good faith stop based upon an articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation occurred. Asking defendant to exit the Infiniti was appropriate and does not require reversal under the \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d test of <em>State v. Smith, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>599, 618-19, 637 A.2d 158 (1994) (holding that \u201cthe officer need point only to some fact or facts in the totality of the circumstances that would create in a police officer a heightened awareness of danger that would warrant an objectively reasonable officer in securing the scene in a more effective manner by ordering the passenger to alight from the car\u201d). Having legitimately asked the driver to exit the Infiniti, and believing that the driver was under the influence, Johnson was justified in making further inquiry of the other occupants who were likely to drive the Infiniti from the scene. In <em>State v. Pierce, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>184, 208, 642 A.2d 947 (1994), the Supreme Court held that a search of a vehicle is not authorized incident to an arrest for a motor vehicle offense. However, an arrest for being under the influence is different than a simple motor vehicle violation, such as driving while a license is suspended as in <em>Pierce. </em>In the latter case, the vehicle can be driven from the area of the stop after a summons has been issued. In the former, the stopped vehicle may have to be impounded if there is no alternative driver available and fit to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Defendant contends that Judge Miller erred by not allowing defense counsel to pursue the line of questioning regarding racial profiling. We disagree. The argument is based on the following exchange.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">[GO DEFENDANT CANDIAS COUNSEL]: Officer Johnson, how many drag stops have you ever made on the George Washington Bridge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">[JOHNSON]: Thousands and thousands and thousands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">Q. And, in your training, are you trained to spot maybe suspicious vehicles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">A. Spot \u2014 there\u2019s certain drug interdiction courses that go into certain \u2014 yeah, I would say yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact that they train you to spot out of state vehicles as, perhaps, indicative of transporting drugs and drug paraphernalia, is that one of the factors, that\u2019s my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">A. That by itself, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Q. Is that one factor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">A. One factor? In a combination. We have to have a combination, maybe out of state, luggage in the back seat, or a spare tire in the back seat, it\u2019s a rental, there\u2019s combinations, no just out of state plate, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Q. Would you consider the race of the occupant in determining whether or not to pull over a car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">A. I wouldn\u2019t, no I wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Q. Would \u2014 is [i]t common practice of the Fort Lee Police Department to pull over black men on the George Washington Bridge, driving an out of state \u2014 .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">THE COURT: How is that relevant? We have \u2014 the officer has indicated that it\u2019s not his policy, he made the stop. Practice notwithstanding\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: He\u2019s also not a Fort Lee police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">THE COURT: And he\u2019s not Fort Lee. We\u2019re dealing with ... Port Authority police officers and we do it in both states, so per force, anyone coming across is going to be out of state, one[ ] state or the other. So, and he\u2019s indicated right now at this point, that is not his policy. So the policy of any other police officer, even Port Authority to go to that point in time, he didn\u2019t say that had any bearing on his \u2014 you want to rephrase and start again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">Q. Could you describe to the Court and to myself, the various factors that would constitute a profile for ... a vehicle containing drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">A. I don\u2019t know of a profile. You know, you get old people, you get young people. I know of no profile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">Q. But in the thousands of vehicles that you pulled over, have you found a common profile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection as to relevance in this case, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-18\">THE COURT: Well, it would seem to be stretching. You may get there eventually, but at this point I\u2019m sustaining the objection. You rephrase and try to get there another way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-19\">Q. After you pulled over the individuals, or prior to pulling over the individuals, at what point did you notice the race of the individuals in the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-20\">A. When I was pacing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-21\">Q. You noticed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-22\">A. Not all of them, I could see the head of the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-23\">Q. And, what race did you believe the driver to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>A. Could either be black or Puerto Rican, I guess, from his look.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that this ruling was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We begin our analysis with a review of controlling principles. A defense claim of selective prosecution based on racial or ethnic profiling is a challenge to the constitutionality of the prosecution itself. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>456, 463, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1480, 1486, 134 L.Ed.2d 687, 698 (1996). However, the burden to establish such a claim \u201cis a demanding one.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The movant must demonstrate that the criminal laws were \u201cdirected so exclusively against a particular class\u201d so as to amount to a \u201cpractical denial\u201d of equal protection under the law. <em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1486, 134 L.Ed.2d at 698 (quoting <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 <em>U.S. </em>356, 373, 6 <em>S.Ct. </em>1064, 1073, 30 <em>L.Ed. </em>220, 227 (1886)). The party asserting such a claim must show that similarly situated individuals of a different class were not prosecuted for similar crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1487, 134 L.Ed.2d at 699. <em>See also State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 166-68, 590 A.2d 624, (1991); <em>State v. Di Frisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 266, 571 A.2d 914 (1990) (noting that the burden of proving selective enforcement is \u201cheavy\u201d; defendant must prove \u201cintentional selectivity\u201d and \u201can unjustifiable basis for the discrimination\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>1129, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>949, 133 L.Ed.2d 873 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> In most instances, a claim of selective enforcement cannot be proven without discovery of police records, which show enforcement patterns during a period of time in a given geographical location. These records are usually within the exclusive control of the police agency. However, in order to obtain such discovery, a defendant must first make a showing of \u201ca colorable basis for a claim of selective enforcement.\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 25, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991). In other words, \u201ca defendant must present \u2018some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense and that the documents in the government\u2019s possession would indeed be probative of these elements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 588 A.2d 834 (quoting <em>United States v. Berrios, </em>501 <em>F.2d </em>1207, 1211-12 (2d Cir.1974)). Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>discovery \u201cis permitted only when there is a colorable claim that a police agency has an officially sanctioned or <em>de facto </em>policy of selective enforcement against minorities.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 378, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On April 20, 1999, the Attorney General released and published the <em>Interim Report. </em>Subsequently, we held in <em>State v. Ballard, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 542, 752 A.2d 735 (App.Div.2000), that several defendants who were members of racial or ethnic minorities and arrested after a motor vehicle stop on the New Jersey Turnpike by New Jersey State troopers, had satisfied the threshold necessary for purposes of obtaining discovery. We concluded that the threshold had been satisfied through the combined weight of the decision of the Law Division in <em>State v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996) (granting defendants\u2019 motion to suppress where they proved a <em>defacto </em>policy in the State Police of \u201ctargeting blacks for investigation and arrest between April 1988 and May 1991\u201d within a particular stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike), the <em>Interim Report, </em>and the lack of any presentation of facts that indicated a change in the policy or practice of the State Police between the <em>Soto </em>decision and the publication of the <em>Interim Report. Ballard, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 542-43, 752 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Recently, we decided three cases dealing with the preservation for appeal of racial profiling claims. <em>See State v. Ross, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 763 A.2d 281 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Williamson, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>544, 763 A.2d 285 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Velez, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 763 A.2d 290 (App.Div.2000). These three eases involved motor vehicle stops on roads patrolled by the State Police. In the three cases, after we found that the discovery thresholds had been met, we remanded, first to Judge Barisonek, the specially designated judge, to set the scope of discovery, and then to the respective trial courts for a reconsideration of the previously denied motions to suppress. <em>Ross, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 538, 763 A.2d 281; <em>Williamson, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>551, 763 A.2d 285; <em>Velez, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 560, 763 A.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Subsequently, we held in <em>State v. Glenford Francis, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 76, 775 A.2d 79 (App.Div.2001), that where judgment of conviction was entered following a trial, before publication of the <em>Interim Report, </em>the defendant was entitled to discovery regarding claims of racial profiling asserted on direct appeal. <em>Francis </em>involved a State Police motor vehicle stop. No motion to suppress had been filed. Defendant contended on direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective for not pursuing a motion to suppress and/or not raising a selective enforcement defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">From <em>Ross, Williamson, Velez, </em>and <em>Francis, </em>it is clear that the <em>Interim, Report </em>goes a long way towards meeting the discovery threshold in racial profiling claims. In <em>Ballard, supra, </em>we observed that the <em>Interim Report </em>acknowledges that the State Police had adopted uniform practices, procedures, and educational instructions which could encourage racial profiling. 331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 546-48, 752 A.2d 735. These practices and procedures potentially impact all motor vehicle stops effected by the State Police. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 752 A.2d 735. There is no similar acknowledgment with respect to other policy agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">1,8] This case does not arise from a motor vehicle stop by the State Police. It involves a stop by the Port Authority Police. The <em>Interim Report, </em>therefore, is not admissible to determine if the discovery threshold has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We emphasize that the discovery threshold is the same in all cases regardless of the police agency involved. However, in cases involving the State Police, the courts may take judicial notice of the contents of the <em>Interim Report. </em>In cases involving other police agencies, the courts may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">[Section IV of this opinion involving a sentencing issue has been redacted for publication purposes.]</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\"> <em>Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Allegations of Racial Profiling, </em>released and published on April 20, 1999 by the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-13\"> This appeal has been assigned to this Part pursuant to its designation to consider and resolve questions pertaining to racial profiling or selective enforcement. <em>See State v.
