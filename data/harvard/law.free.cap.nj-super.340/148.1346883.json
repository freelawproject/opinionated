Plaintiff also alleged that it was relieved of obligation under the policy by reason of defendants\u2019 untruthful answer to a question asked in the application. On motion and cross-motion for summary judgment, the trial judge accepted plaintiffs non-coverage position and entered summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Defendants appeal, and we reverse. We conclude that ambiguities in the policy mandate the coverage defendants seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The facts underlying Smalley\u2019s claim, insofar as they implicate this coverage action, may be briefly stated. Smalley sustained injury in 1987 in an automobile accident. Her personal injury protection (PIP) carrier, NJUFIUA/Hanover Amgro Insurance' (JUA), paid PIP benefits through April 1991, when it declined further payment. It did, however, make a payment in January 1992 to a medical provider. Smalley retained M &amp; P in February 1993 to seek further PIP benefits from JUA. It is not disputed that the limitations period for Smalley\u2019s action against JUA expired in January 1994, two years after the last PIP payment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-13.1a. <em>See Ochs v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>108, 447 A.2d 163 (1982). M <em>&amp; </em>P failed to file suit against JUA before the expiration of the limitations period. JUA then brought a declaratory judgment action against Smalley seeking a determination that it was no longer liable to her for PIP benefits by reason of the running of the statute of limitations. Along with her answer to that complaint, Smalley filed a third-party complaint against M &amp; P in which she claimed that as a result of their malpractice in missing the statute of limitations, she lost the benefit of her PIP entitlement. By a separate count she also alleged that as a further result of the malpractice and because her PIP benefits had been withheld, she was unable to obtain the medical treatment she required and \u201cthereby [was] caused to suffer, and continues to suffer, great pain and suffering.\u201d Plaintiff assumed the defense of the first claim only, that is, Smalley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>alleged economic loss resulting from the withheld PIP payments. Eventually, JUA obtained judgment in its declaratory judgment action releasing it from further PIP liability, and plaintiff, as M &amp; P\u2019s malpractice carrier, settled that claim with Smalley in the amount of $75,000. Smalley then released M &amp; P from that claim but not from her personal injury claim that plaintiff had refused to cover. Plaintiff then brought this action seeking a declaration that under its policy it was not obliged to defend and indemnify defendant in respect of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In support of its position, plaintiff relied on a provision of Part B of its policy, entitled \u201cLiability Not Insured.\u201d The introductory clause of Part B reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">We do not provide insurance for any sort of costs, damages, expenses, liability, or settlements, directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, aggravated by, caused by, or resulting from any of the following, even if a covered activity otherwise insured contributes to such concurrently or in any sequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">[Underscored in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Thereafter follow thirteen numbered paragraphs, the first of which, entitled \u201cBodily Injury/Property Damage,\u201d reads, in respect of bodily injury, in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">A. We do not insure here any claim for bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[Underscored in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Plaintiffs contention then is simply that the language of that exclusion effected by Part B is clear and precise and excludes coverage for bodily harm resulting from a covered activity. The trial court agreed despite its conclusion, with which we agree, that such an exclusion is contrary to the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">We consider this exclusionary clause in the context of well-settled principles of insurance-contract construction. In sum, policies of insurance, as contracts of adhesion, will be construed liberally in favor of the insured in order to meet the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations, and, consequently, ambiguities will be construed in favor of the insured, and exclusions and exceptions will be construed strictly against the insurer. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. McClure, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 564-565, 742 A.2d 564 (App.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>1998), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>575, 745 A.2d 1162 (1999);. <em>United Serv. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Turck, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>480, 492-493, 721 A.2d 1 (1998); <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. v. L-C-A Sales Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>29, 41, 713 A.2d 1007 (1998); <em>Morton Int'l, Inc. v. Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. of Am., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 76, 629 A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>1245, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 L.Ed.2d 878 (1994); <em>Lee v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 513, 767 A.2d 985 (App.Div.2001); <em>Conduit v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 99, 746 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>135, 754 A.2d 1212 (2000). We consider the totality of this policy in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">To begin with, there is no dispute that the gravamen of defendants\u2019 malpractice, missing a statute of limitations, is a covered activity. It is also true that the first of these exclusions, which we have quoted, appears to deny coverage for a client\u2019s bodily injury resulting from a covered activity \u2014 the case here. But it also appears that such coverage is expressly afforded by Paragraph 7 of Part B, entitled \u201cPersonal Injury Exclusion,\u201d which reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">We do not insure here any claim arising out of personal injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">This Exclusion does not apply to personal injury included within the definition of covered activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[Underscored in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">It is obvious that by any common understanding of \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d that term includes pain and suffering, emotional distress, and aggravation of bodily injuries \u2014 just the injuries Smalley alleged. Nor can the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d be otherwise understood by the legal community for whom \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is virtually a term of art encompassing every conceivable manner of psychological and physical harm. A fair and reasonable reading, therefore, of Paragraph 1, which purports to exclude bodily injury, taken together with Paragraph 7, which excludes personal injury, but which excepts from that exclusion personal injury within the definition of covered activity, is to conclude, despite the apparent contradiction, that a personal injury sustained by a legal malpractice claimant arising out of a covered activity is covered as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>exception both to the bodily-harm exclusion and the personal-injury exclusion. And certainly, as the trial judge concluded, such an interpretation accords with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation that all consequences of a covered act of malpractice are in turn covered. <em>See, e.g., Search EDP, Inc. v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 632 A.2d 286 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>466, 640 A.2d 848 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Not so, says plaintiff, pointing to the Glossary comprising Part D of the policy. According to that Glossary, plaintiff contends, personal injury is defined so as to exclude bodily injury. And as we read the definitions in the Glossary, that is precisely what plaintiff has apparently attempted to do. Thus, the Glossary defines bodily injury as \u201cbodily harm, mental anguish, emotional distress, sickness, or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.\u201d And it defines personal injury as meaning any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c\u2018false arrest, detention, imprisonment, or malicious prosecution</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmY\">\u201c\u2022wrongful entry, eviction or invasion of right of private occupancy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQa\">\u201c infringement of copyright, slogan, or title</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7h\">\u201clibel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajb\">\u201c'publication or utterance in violation of a person\u2019s right of privacy</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Plaintiffs contention that it has defined personal injury to exclude bodily injury is literally correct. But we find that definition to be misleading in the extreme and certainly at odds with what is the apparent exception to the exclusion of Paragraph 7 of Part B. The general public, and lawyers in particular, would never understand or assume that the meaning of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d could be as limited as the policy definition. Surely, plaintiff could have used a term other than \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to refer to the damages arising from the specific torts it chose to encompass by that term. A phrase such as \u201cspecial damages\u201d might well have alerted the reader of the policy that something other than personal injury was intended. In our view, plaintiffs definitional undertaking is unavoidably reminiscent of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Humpty Dumpty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean \u2014 neither more nor less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwhether you can make words mean so many different things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, \u201cwhich is to be master \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Lewis Carroll, <em>Through the Looking Glass </em>163 (W.W. Norton &amp; Co.1971) (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">It is axiomatic that an insurer owes an obligation to make its meanings clear in its contracts of adhesion and not to trap the unwary, whether lawyers or not, by redefining commonly understood terms in an idiosyncratic manner, and by then disclaiming coverage based on that eccentric redefinition. In short, we are satisfied that a lawyer reviewing the policy should be able to rely on a fair and reasonable meaning of paragraphs 1 and 7 of Part B read together and thus to conclude that personal injury, in its universal sense, arising out of a covered activity is an exception to the bodily injury exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Because we are satisfied that defendants are entitled to coverage for all of Smalley\u2019s claims as a matter of contract construction, we need not consider defendants\u2019 argument that a fractionalization of her damages into those that are covered and those that are not violates public policy by reason of its violation of the so-called \u201cproximate cause rule.\u201d We note merely that although the majority view apparently permits exclusion of defined consequential claims, see cases collected in <em>Assurance Co. of Am., Inc. v. Jay-Mar, Inc., </em>38 F.Supp.2d 349, 354 (D.N.J.1999), at least two jurisdictions, California and Washington, take the minority view that if a risk is covered by the policy, all consequential damages arising therefrom must also be covered. <em>See respectively Howell v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>218 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>1446, 267 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>708, 714-715 (1990); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Hirschmann, </em>112 <em>Wash.2d </em>621, 773 P.2d 413, 416-418 (1989). We note further that at least two additional jurisdictions, Alaska and West Virginia, bar the exclusion of consequential claims where that exclusion defeats the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>West v. Umialik Ins. Co., </em>8 P.3d 1135, 1143 (Alaska 2000); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Murray v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>203 <em>W.Va. 477, </em>509 S.E.2d 1, 13-15 (1998). While we do not take a position here, we nevertheless point out the inclination for the proximate-cause rule as expressed in <em>Search EDP, Inc. v. American Home Assurance Co., supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 632 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The order granting summary judgment to plaintiff is reversed. The order denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment declaring coverage is reversed. We remand for further proceedings with respect to plaintiffs equitable fraud claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and defendants\u2019 right to an award of counsel fees should they ultimately prevail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-13\"> <em>See, e.g., Liebling v.
