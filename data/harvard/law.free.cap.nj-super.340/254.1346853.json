We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">The factual backdrop for the order under review is as follows. Plaintiff was employed by Gloucester County as a Road Supervisor. On August 30, 1994, plaintiff was appointed to his third five-year term. Shortly thereafter, he became the subject of a federal indictment for matters not related to his employment. As a result of the indictment, plaintiff was suspended without pay pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. On October 4,1996, plaintiff was found not guilty of all charges in the indictment. It appears from the record that, after plaintiffs acquittal, federal authorities turned over certain information relating to plaintiffs conduct to Gloucester County Counsel Bruce Hasbrouck. Hasbrouck then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>undertook an additional investigation into plaintiffs activities while Road Supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Despite plaintiffs acquittal, he was not permitted to return to his employment. Consequently, in January 1997, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging wrongful termination and retaliation. He sought damages and reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">On February 5,1997, Hasbrouck was interviewed by Lieutenant Nadine Reese and Investigator Robert Best of the Gloucester County Prosecutor\u2019s Office (GCPO). That statement by Hasbrouck consisted of ninety-one pages. Hasbrouck also provided documents supporting the matters discussed in his statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is undisputed that, at some point prior to the date of his interview, Hasbrouck initiated contact with the GCPO with respect to the results of his investigation into plaintiffs activities while Road Supervisor. One of the documents turned over to the GCPO by Hasbrouck was titled \u201cMEMO TO FILE-LaPorta,\u201d which was also authored by him. Another document was a memo authored by Mike Datz, Acting Road Supervisor, and addressed to Steve Sweeney, Freeholder. A copy of the memo was sent to Hasbrouck, as well as the First Assistant County Counsel, the County Supervisor, Purchasing Agent, and another Freeholder. Datz\u2019s memo reflects that it was being sent in response to an inquiry that Hasbrouck had made of the County Administrator on January 16, 1997, seeking information with respect to the \u201cLaPorta matter.\u201d The GCPO did not take any criminal action against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">When plaintiff subpoenaed documents in the possession of the GCPO with respect to the subject litigation, defendants claimed privilege as to the above described three documents and two others. The five disputed documents were submitted to the motion judge for an <em>in camera </em>review. Although not specifically stating whether Hasbrouck\u2019s interview with the GCPO contained either work-product or attorney-client material, the judge held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>that she did not deem the relationship between the County and the GCPO \u201cto be of such common interest\u201d as to afford defendants protection from disclosure. We infer from the judge\u2019s statement that whatever privilege would have attached to the interview, that privilege was waived by communicating it to a party that did not have a common interest with that of the defendants. Accordingly, the judge ordered the interview to be released to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The judge then found that the January 16, 1997, inquiry from Hasbrouck to the County Administrator that generated the response from Datz was protected by the attorney-client privilege, but that Datz\u2019s response was not. As to Datz\u2019s responding memo of January 21, the judge believed that it was not protected because it \u201c[was] not authored apparently by the county counsel\u2019s office to his client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Finally, with respect to the \u201cMEMO TO THE FILE-LaPorta\u201d document, the judge found that it was neither work product nor protected by the attorney-client privilege, apparently because it was prepared by Hasbrouck and transmitted to the GCPO \u201cin connection with the encouragement to involve itself in a criminal investigation of Mr. LaPorta.\u201d The one remaining document was found by the judge to be protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">At defendants\u2019 request, the judge stayed the order of turnover pending the resolution of this appeal. Plaintiff has not cross-appealed from the judge\u2019s determination that two of the documents were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. We have reviewed the three documents at issue in this appeal and conclude that all three of them contain Hasbrouck\u2019s attorney work-product. We further conclude that the privilege was not waived by communicating the work-product to the GCPO.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The work-product doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Hickman v. Taylor, </em>and protects from disclosure those documents and other tangible things that a party or a party\u2019s representative prepares in anticipation of litigation. 329 <em>U.S. </em>495, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>385, 91 <em>L.Ed. </em>451 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(1947). The doctrine recognizes the need for a lawyer to \u201cwork with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>385. It is essentially a rule of procedure and has been recognized in New Jersey by court rule. <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). Like the federal rule, New Jersey recognizes for protection \u201cdocuments and tangible things ... prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party\u2019s representative____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>An attorney\u2019s work-product may not be discovered unless \u201cthe party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Even then, however, a court ordering such discovery is obligated to \u201cprotect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">It can fairly be said that the \u201cMEMO TO FILE\u2014 LaPorta\u201d and the memo from Datz to Freeholder Sweeney are documents prepared in the context of Hasbrouck\u2019s preparation for the defense of the litigation brought by plaintiff against the County for reinstatement and damages. The \u201cMEMO TO FILE \u2014 LaPorta\u201d contains Hasbrouck\u2019s analysis and mental impressions concerning various documents that he reviewed with respect to plaintiffs conduct. It is clearly work-product. Further, as noted earlier, a copy of the memo from Datz to Freeholder Sweeney was sent to Hasbrouck. Clearly, it was written in response to a request by Hasbrouck to the County Administrator for information concerning a certain bid document that Hasbrouck reviewed in connection with the subject litigation. Because it was material gathered by Hasbrouck in preparation for litigation or trial, it was clearly his work-product. See <em>Medford v. Duggan, </em>323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 133, 732 A.2d 533 (App.Div.1999)(holding that work-product privilege applies to documents prepared by attorney\u2019s agent, so long as it is prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial). Lastly, Hasbrouck\u2019s transcribed statement to the GCPO contained his mental impressions concerning the many documents and files reviewed by him as a part of the County\u2019s defense to plaintiffs suit for reinstatement. Thus, it also constitutes attorney work-product.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Plaintiff makes no effort to prove that he \u201chas substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). Rather, plaintiffs primary contention is that defendants waived the privilege when Hasbrouck communicated the information to the GCPO. The concept of waiver is not specifically addressed in the Rule. However, waiver of privileges in general is recognized in our rules of evidence. <em>N.J.R.E. 530; see Hannan v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 29-31, 722 A.2d 971 (App.Div.1999)(discussing whether the work-product privilege was waived when the client used notes prepared in anticipation of litigation to answer interrogatories). The Evidence Rule provides in relevant part that a privilege is waived if \u201cwithout coercion and with knowledge of his right or privilege, [a person] made disclosure of any part of the privileged matter or consented to such a disclosure made by anyone.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. 530. </em>It has been recognized, however, that not every disclosure constitutes a waiver of privilege. Rather, \u201ccourts have interpreted [the waiver] principle in a commonsensical way, fashioning a \u2018common interest\u2019 doctrine which protects communications made to a non-party who shares the client\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>In re State Com\u2019n of Investigation, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 466, 544 A.2d 893 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>382, 550 A.2d 484 (1988)(quoting <em>United States v. Zolin, </em>809 <em>F.2d </em>1411, 1417 (9th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The boundaries of the common interest exception are not perfectly defined. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 544 A.2d 893 (discussing the problem, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>however, in the context of the attorney-client privilege). New Jersey ease law on the subject is non-existent in the context of work-product privilege. Federal case law on the subject, however, gives us guidance in resolving the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The common interest exception may be asserted with respect to communications among counsel for different parties if \u201c(1) the disclosure is made due to actual or anticipated litigation; (2) for the purposes of furthering a common interest; and (3) the disclosure is made in a manner not inconsistent with maintaining confidentiality against adverse parties.\u201d <em>Holland v. Island Creek Corp., </em>885 <em>F.Supp. </em>4, 6 (D.D.C.1995); <em>see also In re Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, </em>805 F.2d 120, 126 (3d Cir.1986). It is not necessary for actual litigation to have commenced at the time of the transmittal of information for the privilege to be applicable. <em>U.S. v. Schwimmer, </em>892 F.2d 237, 244 (2d Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>810, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>55, 116 L.Ed.2d 31 (1991). Indeed, communications need not only be among counsel for the clients. Communications between counsel for a party and an individual representative of a party with a common interest are also protected. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Importantly, it is'not necessary for every party\u2019s interest to be identical for the common interest privilege to apply. Rather, the parties must simply have a \u201ccommon purpose.\u201d <em>U.S. v. McPartlin, </em>595 F.2d 1321, 1336 (7th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>833, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>65, 62 L.Ed.2d 43 (1979); <em>see also, United States v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>642 F.2d 1285, 1298 (D.C.Cir.1980)(criticizing earlier opinions that employed a narrow definition of \u201ccommon interests\u201d and restricted the concept to situations in which the relationship of the parties was similar to that between co-parties in a suit). Thus, as one court put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">Whether an action is ongoing or contemplated, whether the jointly interested persons are defendants or plaintiffs, and whether the litigation or potential litigation is civil or criminal, the rationale for the joint defense rule remains unchanged: persons who share a common interest in litigation should be able to communicate with their respective attorneys and with each other to more effectively prosecute or defend their claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>[In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, 89-3 and 89-4 John Doe 89-129, </em>902 <em>F.</em>2d 244, 249 (4th Cir.1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we conclude that although the interest of defendants and the GCPO may not have been identical, it is clear that they shared a common purpose. That is, defendants\u2019 purpose is to bar plaintiffs reinstatement and ancillary remedies because of his perceived illegal conduct while he was the Road Supervisor. The GCPO\u2019s purpose in this context is to investigate alleged criminal activity by persons holding public office and to prosecute such individuals with a view toward barring convicted public officers from employment in that capacity. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2. It is of no moment that the GCPO decided not to proceed criminally against plaintiff. The question as to whether the parties share a common interest \u201cmust be evaluated as of the time that the confidential information is disclosed.\u201d <em>Holland, supra, </em>885 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 6. Nor is it significant that defendants were involved in civil litigation while the information transmitted by Hasbrouck was for the purpose of criminal prosecution, or that it was communicated to an agent of the prosecutor rather than to the prosecutor himself. <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoenas, supra, </em>902 <em>F.2d </em>at 249; <em>Schwimmer, supra, </em>892 <em>F.</em>2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We agree with defendants that a party should feel free to turn over evidence of crimes to the government without fearing that to do so will result in privileged and confidential information falling into the hands of one\u2019s adversary in a related or contemplated civil proceeding. Generally, when such privileged information is turned over to a non-adversary who has a legitimate interest in the information, such as the GCPO here, there is no waiver unless it can be shown that there was a \u201cconscious disregard\u201d of the possibility that an adversary would gain access to the material. <em>In re John Doe, </em>662 F.2d 1073, 1081 (4th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>1000, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1632, 71 L.Ed.2d 867 (1982); <em>see also Shields v. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., </em>864 F.2d 379, 381-82 (5th Cir.1989)(holding that disclosure simply to another person who has an interest in the information but who is not reasonably viewed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>a conduit to a potential adversary will not be deemed a waiver of the protection of the rule). There was no showing here that Hasbrouck consciously disregarded the possibility that the material might be transmitted to plaintiff. He had every reason to believe that his mental impressions of the evidence that he gathered would remain protected under New Jersey Court Rules, even if plaintiff could gain access to other privileged material by using the work-product rule exception contained in <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). That is so because mental impressions and strategy of counsel remain inviolate. <em>See Jenkins v. Rainner, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>50, 350 A.2d 473 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The judgment under review is reversed to the extent that it requires defendants to turn over the three documents in question.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> These documents apparently have been released to plaintiff without objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> Another exception, not relevant here, is found in <em>R. </em>4:10-2(d), concerning \"facts known and opinions held by experts.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
