Pennewell <em>et al. </em>as plaintiffs against Julius Koebler <em>et al., </em>defendants, to enjoin the latter from maintaining and carrying on the undertaking business in and upon their own premises at No. 1264 Willson avenue, in the city of Cleveland, for the alleged reason that said business there conducted and carried on, at that place, constituted and was a nuisance, and they asked that said defendants be restrained and enjoined from establishing, keeping or using in or upon their said premises a morgue. In the court of common pleas upon trial of the issues joined, that court found the issues in favor of the defendants and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s petition. Plaintiffs appealed to the circuit court, where the cause was again tried upon the pleadings, exhibits and testimony. Upon the trial of the case in the circuit court that court made the following finding of facts, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4u\">\u201cFirst. That the defendants, Julius Koebler and William Koebler, as partners, on and ever since the 5th day of July, A. D. 1903, have occupied the brick building described in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition herein, and formerly a private dwelling-house, and known as 1264 Willson avenue, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>also the premises upon which such building stands, and the appurtenance thereto, all of which are situated in the city of Cleveland, county of Cuyahoga and state of Ohio, and that said defendants, by themselves, their agents and servants, having during said time carried on upon said premises and in said building, and the appurtenance thereto, the undertaking business; that in connection with said undertaking business the said defendants, during said time, maintained, and kept on said premises and in said building a room or place in which, since the said 5th day of July, as the exigencies of said business required, the said defendants have from time to time kept the bodies of deceased persons for a period of time, varying from one to three days, and in most instances until burial. That said defendants at all times since said July 5th, 1903, when employed so to do, have sent to hospitals, railroad depots, residences, and other places, for dead human bodies, which they have transported to their said place of business, and have kept the same in said place so set apart for the same, until the same were taken away for burial. That for the purpose of enabling the said defendants to carry on said business, as undertakers and the said business of caring for and keeping dead human bodies, at the place aforesaid, they kept and maintained at said place two dead-wagons, a hearse and other vehicles and appliances necessary for the purposes aforesaid in which bodies were brought to said premises, driven into the barn and carried thence through a covered passage-way to said room in said house, neither body nor casket being exposed to view of persons outside said barn or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>house. That some of the bodies so received by the defendants at their said place of business were washed, dressed and embalmed at their said place of business after being brought there. That the said defendants propose to and will continue at said place, and the premises and the appurtenances thereon, and in connection therewith described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, to receive, wash, dress and embalm and keep the bodies of deceased persons, unless prevented from so doing by the order of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">\u201cSecond. The court finds that said Willson avenue, on July 5th, 1903, and for a long time prior thereto and ever since, has been a public highway and street located within the city of Cleveland, county of Cuyahoga and state of Ohio, and that all of the plaintiffs, during all of the times aforesaid, have lived and still live upon said street and occupy dwelling-houses, located and fronting\u2019 on said Willson avenue, as residences only; and all of which dwelling-houses are situated and fronting upon said Willson avenue, within two hundred yards of said building, known as 1264 Willson avenue, and within two hundred yards of the boundary lines of the premises fronting upon Willson avenue, and upon which said building is situated. That for- some time prior to the said 3th day of' July, A. D! 1903, and all the times herein mentioned, one of said plaintiffs has occupied a dwelling-house, as a residence only, immediately adjoining and north of said building known as No. 1264 Willson avenue, and another one of said plaintiffs during all of said time has occupied and still is occupying a dwelling-house as resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>dence only, immediately adjoining and south of said building known as No. 1264 Willson avenue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">\u201cThird. The court finds that said defendants established their said undertaking business and the said business of so keeping dead human bodies at said building, known as 1264 Willson avenue, and the premises on which the same stand, and the appurtenances thereto, on or about the 5 th day of July,-A. D. 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">\u201cFourth. The court further finds that the said Willson avenue in the vicinity where the said business of said defendant was^ established and has been maintained and carried on, was on and for a long time prior to July 5th, 1903, and ever since has been and still is a residence street; that within the distance of two hundred yards from said building known as 1264 Willson avenue, there are and at all times have been located a large number of dwelling-houses, used as residences only, fronting upon said Willson avenue and occupied by persons exclusively as residences. That the said defendants have never at any time obtained from any person or persons owning or occupying a dwelling-house and residence fronting and situated upon said Willson avenue, as a residence,, any consent of such person or persons to establish or maintain or keep their said business of receiving and keeping at said place, the bodies of deceased persons, or the consent of such person or persons to establish or maintain or keep at said building known as 1264 Willson avenue a morgue, and that said residence property has been materially depreciated in value, and the value of the use of same materially depreciated by the maintenance of said place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>As conclusions of law from the above. facts, said circuit court found and adjudged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">Conclusions of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">\u201cFirst. That the business of receiving and keeping dead bodies as carried on by the said defendants, at said place known as 1264 Willson avenue, constitutes the establishing, keeping and maintaining of a morgue, within the provisions of Section 3586a of the Revised Statutes of the state of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">\u201cSecond. It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the said defendants, each and both of them, their agents and servants and all persons claiming through or under them, be and they hereby are enjoined from receiving at said place known as 1264 Willson avenue in the city of Cleveland, county of Cuyahoga and state of Ohio, and the appurtenances thereto so occupied by them, the bodies of deceased persons, except for funeral purpose's only, and when so received, said bodies shall be fully prepared for burial in caskets, from which they shall not be removed and shall not remain upon said premises for said funeral purposes more than twelve hours, and that said plaintiffs recover of said defendants their costs herein to be taxed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">To which findings of fact and of law separately, .the said plaintiffs separately excepted, and to which findings of facts and of law separately, the said defendants separately excepted. And the defendants and each of them further except to said findings of fact in that there is a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>find facts material to the defendants which are established by the evidence, and further that the findings of fact are imperfect in that they are too general in their terms and do not specifically find the facts in issue.

But, on the other hand, if the above finding of the circuit court was erroneous and unwarranted, then upon this record, there being no finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the place was a nuisance <em>per se, </em>nor evidence to support such finding, plaintiffs were not entitled to .any relief, and their petition should have been dismissed. So that, from whatever view-point this record may be considered, it must we think be conceded that the judgment and decree as made and entered by the circuit court in this case is erroneous, and is the result of an endeavor on the part of the court to arbitrate, rather than to adjudicate, the matters in dispute between the parties. Upon the present record, then, the single question material for our consideration, and the one that is determinative of the rights of the parties hereto, is: Do the facts proven sustain and justify the conclusion of the circuit court that defendants were keeping and maintaining a morgue at No. 1264 Willson avenue, contrary to the provisions of Section 3586a, Revised Statutes? This section, so far as its provisions are pertinent here, is as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person or persons, company, association or firm to establish a morgue on any street or part of a street upon which are dwelling-houses, unless the owner or occupants of such dwelling-houses within two hundred yards (200 yards) of said proposed morgue give their written consent thereto.\u201d What, then, is a morgue within the purview and meaning of the above section? In the interpretation of this section, the word <em>morgue </em>being without definition in the statute itself is to be given its usual, ordinary and commonly accepted meaning, and the Legislature must be held to have employed and used it in that sense. The word is defined by standard lexicographers and dictionaries as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary \u2014 Morgue.

And there is nothing in Section 3586a to indicate that the word as therein used was employed in any other or different sense, or that the Legislature intended to give to it, or that it should have as therein used, a different- or more comprehensive meaning. Applying then this definition or test, were the defendants below keeping or maintaining a morgue in or upon their premises at No. 1264 Willson avenue? In the present case this is not to be determined solely upon the facts stated by the circuit court, for complaint was made in that court, and is here made, by counsel for plaintiff in error, that the findings of fact as made and stated by the circuit court are incomplete, indefinite and misleading, that material and controlling facts established by the evidence are omitted therefrom, and that the facts found are so imperfectly stated, or stated by the court in such manner, as to be misleading. And counsel have presented to this court with their petition in error a bill of exceptions containing the whole of the evidence introduced on the trial of this cause in the circuit court. An examination of this bill shows the following facts established by the evidence without contradiction: Prior to July 5th, 1903, Julius and William Koebler were engaged in the undertaking business in the city of Cleveland. On that date, having theretofore purchased the house and premises at No. 1264 Willson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>avenue, they established their said undertaking business at that place. In the house situated on said premises, which house had formerly been a dwelling-house, they selected, fitted up and thereafter maintained a certain room or place which they called the chapel, in which from time to time funeral services were held and conducted, and in which the bodies of deceased persons received by them were temporarily placed and kept until their interment. From July 5th, 1903, to the time of the trial of this 'case in the circuit court, which was more than a year and five months, the total number of bodies received by them was twenty-six (26). Of these all but three had been prepared for burial before being taken-to defendants\u2019 place of business, and all were taken there at the instance or request of relatives or friends of the deceased that funeral services might be held and conducted from that place. These bodies when at their establishment were placed in, caskets, were kept in this chapel, or a private room adjoining the same, and were not exposed to public view except perhaps at-the time when funeral services were being conducted over the remains. No unidentified or derelict body was ever in their place, and while, as found by the circuit court, bodies were taken to defendants\u2019 place of business from hospitals, railroad depots and private residences, yet in every instance they were, as above stated, taken there at the request of relatives or friends, and in order that funeral services might be conducted and held at that place. That which was done by defendants in this behalf was not different from that done by persons conducting modern undertaking establishments in all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>large cities of the state. These facts being undisputed, the finding and conclusion by the circuit court that the business of receiving and keeping dead bodies as carrried on by defendants at their place, No. 1264 Willson avenue, constituted the establishing, keeping and maintaining a morgue, was, we think, unwarranted and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We believe that the word morgue as found in this section was advisedly used by the Legislature, and that it clearly and appropriately defines and expresses the legislative intent as to the character of place intended to be prohibited; namely: a place where the unidentified and derelict dead are at all times received and kept and exposed to public view for the purposes of identification, thereby inviting and attracting to such place crowds of the morbid and curious who visit the place for no other purpose than that they may view the bodies there exposed. But in the absence of language requiring such construction, we can not think that the prohibition of this section was directed against, or was intended to include, the ordinary undertaking establishment conducted in the usual and customary way. If such had been the intention of the Legislature, it was easy to have expressed that intention in plain and unmistakable terms, but no such intention is expressed. The judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and the petition of the plaintiffs below, defendants in error here, will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-6\">; Shauck, C.
