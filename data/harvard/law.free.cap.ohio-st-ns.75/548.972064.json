The records to be reviewed were made in.the circuit court where the causes were tried on appeal. Plaintiffs are the Board of Commissioners of Ross County, having statutory authority and control over the highways in question. The defendant is a corporation organized for the construction of an interurban railroad from the city of Columbus, in Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>county, to the city of Chillicothe, in Ross county. The object of the suits was to enjoin the defendant from constructing its road across said highways at grade. Issues of fact having been joined the cause was submitted to the court upon an agreed statement of facts. The material facts so agreed upon are to be found in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-4\"><em>Mr. Peter J. Blosser, </em>prosecuting attorney, and <em>Mr. Albert </em>Douglas, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-5\">It seems to be substantially admitted by counsel on each side that the question presented by the record in this case is whether the first and second sections of the act of April 25, 1904 (97 O. L., 546), prohibit the defendant in error from crossing with its railroad the public highway named in the amended petition \u201cat grade.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">The language of this act is certainly clear and explicit. In terms it applies to all \u201crailroads\u201d; and the description of this defendant\u2019s road contained in the agreed statement of facts, clearly brings it within all definitions of the word \u201crailroad.\u201d But defendant insists (1st) that this act, though general in .its terms, applies only to \u201csteam railroads\u201d; and (2d) that the record discloses that its railroad is not a steam railroad, but an \u201cinterurban\u201d railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">The charter of the defendant company provides that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">\u201cSaid corporation is formed for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining a railroad with electricity or other lawful motive power with single or more tracks, with such side tracks, switches, turnouts, offices, depots, shops, telegraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>lines, telephone lines, poles, wires, devices and all other necessary appliances for the operation of a railroad with electricity as motive power, or for the operation of a railroad with any other lawful power which said company may hereafter adopt or use.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">This charter further provides for the transportation of passengers, packages, express matter, mail, baggage and freight over the said railroad.

We refer to the following: <em>Massillon Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Cambria Iron Co., </em>59 Ohio St., 179, construing an act passed in 1874. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Woodland Ave., etc., Street Railroad Co., </em>62 Ohio St., 67; <em>Cincinnati, etc., Elec. Street Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Lohe, Admr., </em>68 Ohio St., 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-4\">The above cases cited by opposing counsel in the court below comprise all the decisions of this court, relating to this question, which have come to our attention or which we are able to find; and we do not deem it necessary to review the dicta or the rulings of lower courts upon questions involving a distinction between steam and other railroads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-5\">Here is a company operating a railroad, built upon a private right of way, in every respect like the best standard gauge steam railroads of the most modern type; on which, as is common knowledge, are run machines weighing twenty to thirty tons, sixty feet long, at a speed of from 50 to 60 \u00a1miles an hour; in every regard as dangerous to the travel upon intersecting highways as an express train upon a steam railroad. And here is a statute not undertaking to disturb vested rights but to regulate the crossings of railroads thereafter to be constructed, so as to avoid the dangers and the nuisance of grade crossings. Furthermore we have here a crossing peculiarly dangerous in itself, as the record shows, and so located as to constitute, if maintained at grade, a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>larly dangerous crossing; and on the other hand we have a statute, the language of which, the policy of which, the justice of which, and the good sense of which, all appeal to the court as meeting the exigencies of this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-6\">This defendant company can acquire neither by grant of this plaintiff by estoppel nor otherwise any vested right to maintain a public' nuisance. <em>Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Ry.

Section 3443-8 and 3443-9, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>If, then, the defendant\u2019s railway crossing these highways constitutes a public nuisance, it can only be because of the peculiar facts and conditions surrounding and connected with these particular crossings. On this point w\u00e9 contend that if the highways are left in a reasonably safe condition for travel in the ordinary mode, they are free from nuisance. <em>City of Troy </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>67 Ohio St., 65; <em>Village of Cardington </em>v. <em>Admr. of Fredericks, </em>46 Ohio St., 442; <em>City of Zanesville </em>v. <em>Fonnan, </em>53 Ohio St., 605; <em>City of Circleville </em>v. <em>Sohn, </em>59 Ohio St. 285; <em>City of Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Fleischer, Admr., </em>63 Ohio St., 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-4\">Has the defendant lawful authority to construct the tracks \u00f3f its railway across these public highways at grade?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">It is apparent from this action of the board of commissioners that the right was granted the defendant by the authorities in charge of these highways to construct its road over said highways <em>at grade.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-6\">It is argued, however, by counsel for plaintiff, that this act of the board of commissioners is void for want of lawful authority in the board of commissioners to grant such right. This argument is based upon the provisions of the act of the General Assembly, passed April 25, 1904, 97 O. L., 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-7\">Does this act apply to defendant\u2019s road? The defendant claims that its road is of the class designated by the statutes of Ohio as an electric interurban street railroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-8\">The question thus presented is, does the act above quoted relate to and govern the construction of defendant\u2019s road over said highways? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>If it does, we freely concede that the commissioners of Ross county were without power to authorize the construction of grade crossings over said highways, while, if it does not, we contend the commissioners had lawful power to authoriz\u00e9 such grade crossings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-6\">It has frequently been held by this court that the word \u201crailroad,\u201d when used in the statute, without any qualification as to the kind of road intended, will be limited to the class of railroads known as steam railroads; in other words, that the term \u201crailroad\u201d used in the statute is not generic, pertaining to all classes of railroads, but \u00a1special, including only steam railroads. <em>Massillon Bridge Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Cambria Iron Co., </em>59 Ohio St., 179; <em>Cincinnati, etc., Street Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Lohe, Admr., </em>68 Ohio St., 101; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Woodland, etc., Street Ry.

Section 3443-8, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-8\">The title of this act, taken from Bates\u2019 Annotated Statutes, latest edition, is \u201cConstruction, etc., of <em>street railroads </em>outside of municipalities,\u201d and it is apparent from the act itself that it is the one under which the Scioto Valley Traction Company is operating. Section 3443-11, a statute in <em>pari materia </em>with the other one just quoted, gives such companies power to lease, purchase or make traf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>fic arrangement <em>with any other </em>street railroad company. These two statutes should be construed together, and in so doing, why should the word \u201cother\u201d be used if the railroads already spoken of were not street railroads? Section 3443-13, another statute in <em>pari materia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-4\">Section 347-/ alludes to one railroad company, or an electric railroad company crossing at grade.

S., 270.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b606-8\">Si-iauck, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">On the 5th day of September, 1904, the commissioners by resolution entered on their journal, authorized the Traction Company to construct and operate its road over these highways. The resolution contemplated grade crossings and it contained the express provision that over or under <em>crossings </em>should not be <em>required. </em>On the 8th of February, 1905, they passed another resolution to rescind that by which such permission had been conferred, reciting in the preamble to the latter resolution that the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>mer had been passed through mistake and misunderstanding, and that the crossings would be extremely dangerous to the traveling public. To the latter resolution there was appended an order that the company should not cross any highway in Ross County except in the manner provided in the original franchise, or in such manner as might be thereafter granted. In the meantime the company had gone forward in acquiring its right of way and with the construction of its road; and it is not contended that the latter resolution is effective to revoke any authority which had been effectively conferred by the former. The question presented, as counsel agree, is whether the company is within the act of April 25, 1904, 97 O. L., 546, its construction being for the operation of its cars by electricity conducted upon a third rail, and its cars being in fact so operated. The scope of the act is indicated by its first section, which provides that \u201cexcept as in this act elsewhere provided, all crossings hereinafter constructed, whether of highways by railroads or of railroads by highways, shall be0 above or below the grade thereof.\u201d Other sections of the statute provide the method by which crossings may be authorized at grade by the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Obviously the word \u201crailroad\u201d needs not to be used in a strained or unnatural sense to include an interurban road operated by electricity. And in this connection counsel for the plaintiffs naturally advert to the decisions in which manifest resemblances have been recognized between the companies which depend for the movement of their cars upon their own tractive friction and those which for that purpose employ locomotives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>for their tractive power. It is, however, an approximately correct generalization to say that the legal likenesses have been found in the relations which the different companies as common carriers of passengers and freight sustain to . their patrons and their relations to their employes. And it remains to inquire whether in the provisions which the legislature has made for the safety of those who are participating in the common use of crossings and highways and the tracks of common carriers it has preserved a distinction on account of the motive power or the tractive methods employed by the carriers. A substantial basis for such distinction is found in the greater weight and momentum of trains drawn by locomotives in comparison with cars for whose propulsion reliance is had upon the tractive friction produced by their own weight, and the promptness with which the latter may be stopped. We may with propriety advert to the substantial character of this difference, but only as an aid in determining whether the legislature has thought it sufficient to justify the distinction in question. The amendments of vario\u00fcs statutes upon the subject of railroads and street railroads which are cited in the brief of counsel for the defendant show that in the opinion of the legislature the former term does not include roads of the latter description, and that other terms must be employed to subject roads of different classes to the same statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The case of <em>The Massillon Bridge Co. et al. </em>v. <em>The Cambria Iron Co., </em>59 Ohio St., 179, involved the interpretation of Sections 3207 and 3208, Revised Statutes, relating to the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>railroads. It was there held upon considerations which appear to be as applicable here that the word \u201crailroad\u201d does not include street railroads, and by the judgment in the case an interurban' road was regarded as a street railroad within the legislative meaning. That case was decided November 29, 1898, and by its subsequent acts the legislature has indicated its satisfaction with that interpretation. Even the act here relied on was passed at a later date, employing terms which according to that interpretation would not apply to the defendant. It is admitted that existing legislation authorizes the commissioners of a county to permit \u201cstreet railroads outside of municipalities\u201d to run upon and along highways. From the exercise of this authority it would result that the Traction Company might enter upon these highways from one side and at a point more or less remote leave them upon the other. No considerations appear which would justify the conclusion that the legislature intended that to such roads as the- defendant grade crossings, if oblique, should be permitted, and if direct forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-5\">Crew, Summers and Davis, JJ., concur.
