It must not be forgotten that this is a claim of a creditor who has furnished certain articles to a railroad company contracting for construction,. and that he is entitled to the protection of the law which the railroad company is bound to know. What is the law? Section 3207, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-7\">Plaintiff in error has in its brief advanced fourteen propositions by which it attempts to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>error in the court below. Sections 3207, 3208, 3209, 3210 and 3211, Revised Statutes; Southerland on Statutory Construction, Section 402; Beach on Modern Law of Contracts, Section 715; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>State, </em>48 Ohio St., 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-6\">We submit it to be the law, when a- statute defines itself, that no other construction can be given. The legislature has said that \u201cmaterial,\u201d \u201clabor\u201d and \u201cboard\u201d shall, in this connection, include hay and grain. We cite in support of our view Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, Vol. 2, page 860; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Yarrington, 1 </em>Ohio St., 253; <em>Hildebrand </em>v. <em>Fogle, </em>20 Ohio, 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-7\">We think, under all the facts in this case, the authorities which we here cite support our view, that the notice was an absolute guaranty and for a consideration. <em>Cambria Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Keynes et al., </em>56 Ohio St., 501; <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Garn et al., </em>13-23 O. C. C., 447; <em>Birdsall </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>32 Ohio St., 177; <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Brachman, </em>40 Ohio St., 604; <em>Powers &amp; Weightman </em>v. <em>Bumcratz, </em>12 Ohio St., 273; <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>45 Ohio St., 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-8\">Viewing the case at bar as one showing the Pennsylvania Company as guarantor of the claim of the defendant in error, we affirm that it is the clear rule of the law in Ohio, that notice to the Pennsylvania Company of the acceptance by the defendant in error, of the guaranty, is not necessary. The telegram, as posted, is an absolute guaranty of the payment of the claim, and within the rule of the case cited in 12 Ohio St., and 45 Ohio St., <em>supra. </em>Indeed, the language of the notice posted is free from ambiguities and uncertainties, and is positive, definite and without conditions. If this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>notice is construed to be an offer of guaranty, then we conclude no language could be used that would state a guaranty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-4\">Crew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALH\">In the present case, aside from the averment in the petition (unsupported by any evidence) that the Pennsylvania Company by its authorized agent expressly promised to pay the claim here in suit, there is in this case neither allegation nor proof of any liability on the part of said company to compensate R. Mehaffey for the hay, corn, straw and feed furnished by him to Overstreet &amp; Styles, except such as can be predicated upon, or results from, the posting by the Pennsylvania Company at the village of Lafayette in Allen county, Ohio, and at other places within said county, of the following telegram or notice, to-wit:'</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u201cPennsylvania Lines West of Pittsburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cDate, 3-23, 1900. Fort Wayne. Time, 5:20 P. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u201cTo Agent Pennsylvania Company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cDear Sir \u2014 Post notice that Pennsylvania Company will protect all claims for material, labor and board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201cF. A. Zollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The language of this telegram, when construed most favorably for the plaintiff below, Mehaffey, in terms imposes upon the Pennsylvania Company no obligation or duty other than that of protecting and paying all such claims as properly belong to and fall within one or the other of the classes therein designated, namely: claims for material, labor or board. That the claim in suit in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>was not one for labor or board is conceded. But it is insisted that within the terms of the above telegram, and within the meaning of the statutes hereinafter referred to, the hay, corn, straw and feed furnished by Mehaffey to Overstreet &amp; Styles were materials; and that Mehaffey\u2019s claim for the articles so furnished became, and was therefore, one of the claims which the Pennsylvania Company in said telegram expressly assumed to protect and pay. Directly the contrary view is urged by counsel for the railroad company, who contend that the word \u201cmaterial\u201d as used in the telegram, and as employed in the statutes in connection with the construction of railroads, has, and had at the time said telegram was sent and posted, a fixed, well-defined and commonly understood meaning, which was and is, that the word or term when thus used is descriptive of and includes such articles only as are furnished for, and are to be used in, the construction of the road, and that it does not comprehend or embrace articles furnished or supplied for any other purpose; such as feed furnished for teams working upon the railroad, or merchandise, clothing or board furnished the. laborers employed thereon. On the trial of this cause in the court of common pleas, counsel for the Pennsylvania Company requested the.court to give to the jury the following instruction: \u201cNo. 1. Gentlemen of the Jury: I charge you, as a matter of law, that the hay, corn, feed, straw and rent set up in the itemized account of plaintiff, is not covered or included in the words 'labor, material and board/ set out in the telegram which is introduced as evidence in this case.\u201d This instruction the court refused to give, and in the general charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, gentlemen, * * * I might say, before closing, that if you find this telegram was posted by the authority of the company, and if you find that the plaintiff in this case furnished hay, grain, straw and other feed and materials of that character to the contractor or sub-contractor for the use of his horses upon the work, that the plaintiff would be considered as having furnished material, within the meaning of the terms of this telegram, and he would be entitled to recover.\u201d The refusal of the court to cliarge as requested, and the giving by the court of the above instruction, are among the errors here assigned. A determination of whether or not the action of the court in this behalf was erroneous necessarily involves a consideration of the purpose and provisions of Sections 3207, 3208, 3209, 3210 and 3211, Revised Statutes. Section 3207 provides what contracts for railroad work shall stipulate, and makes the contractor liable to persons performing labor or furnishing materials stipulated for in the contract with the owner of .the road. But it makes no provision for a lien upon the road, nor does it impose any liability on the railroad company for the labor so performed or the materials so furnished. Section 3208 provides : \u201cA person who performs labor or furnishes materials for or in construction of any railroad, depot buildings, water tanks, or any part thereof, and a person who furnishes boarding on the order of any contractor or sub-contractor, to persons employed by them or either of them, in furnishing materials or performing labor for or in construction of such railroad, depot buildings, water tanks, or any part thereof, in addition to his rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the preceding section shall have a lien for the payment of the same upon such railroad, and such lien shall have and maintain precedence over any lien taken, or to be taken, and shall subsist for one year from the date of filing the attested account hereafter provided for; and if an action is brought to enforce the lien within that time, it shall continue in force until finally adjudicated.\u201d It further provides and points out what shall be done in order to perfect such lien. Sections 3209 and 3210 provide how actions may be brought for the enforcement of liens, provide for notice to the contractor or sub-contractor, and the adjustment of disputed claims, and are merely sections governing procedure. Section 3211 provides as follows: \u201cThe provisions of the four preceding sections shall apply to and include any person who furnishes grain, hay, merchandise,. tools or implements, or who repairs any tools or implements, on the order of any contractor or sub-contractor, for their own use, or the use of persons employed by them of either of them, while furnishing materials or labor for or in construction of such railroad; provided, that the amount of such claim shall not exceed the wages of the person performing labor or. furnishing materials, to whom furnished, or the amount found due such contractor or sub-contractor, under the provisions of section <em>thirty-two hundred and seven; </em>and in every such case, the' requirements of section <em>thirty-two hundred </em>and\u25a0 eight, as to filing affidavits and giving notices, shall be strictly complied with; and, provided further, that the aggregate of all liens taken and perfected under sections <em>thirty-two hundred and seven, thirty-two hundred and eight, thirty-two </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>hundred and </em>tenand <em>thirty-two hundred and eleven, </em>shall not be in excess of the actual construction contract price of the railroad company. The word \u2018owner\u2019 in these sections shall be held and considered as including any lessee, receiver, corporation, company, or persons owning, operating or managing any railroad, with whom or in whose behalf the contracts herein have been made.\u201d While this section in terms extends the provisions of the four preceding sections to such persons as furnish grain, hay, merchandise, etc., on the order of a contractor or sub-contractor for their use or the use of persons employed by them or either of them while furnishing material or labor for or in the construction \u2022 of such railroad, it does not enlarge or extend the meaning of the word <em>material </em>as employed and used in the preceding sections, nor does it impose upon the railroad company any personal liability for the claims of persons furnishing the articles therein m\u00e9ntioned, unless a lien be taken therefor agreeably to its provisions. The sole purpose and effect of this enactment, apart from declaring the meaning of the word \u201cowner,\u201d is to provide for the giving of a lien upon the railroad, to the limited extent therein provided, to persons furnishing on the order of a contractor or sub-contractor as aforesaid, any of the articles in said section enumerated, the furnishing of which, but for this statute, would not entitle the person so supplying the same to have or take a lien therefor. The statute is itself, therefore, a legislative declaration that hay, grain, merchandise, tools, etc., are not materials, and that they are not within the intent and meaning of that term as employed and used in the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ceding sections. All of the afore-mentioned sections are parts of an act passed by the legislature April 6, 1883 (80 O. L., 99). On April 10, 1884 (81 O. L., 126), the legislature passed an act declaratory of the true intent and meaning of the aforesaid sections, which act reads as follows: \u201cThe true intent and meaning of sections thirty-two h\u00fandred and seven, thirty-two hundred and eight, thirty-two hundred and nine, thirty-two hundred and ten and thirty-two hundred and eleven of the revised statutes of Ohio, as amended April 6, 1883, is hereby declared to be as follows: Any person or persons who perform labor or furnish material or boarding, under contract, express or implied, with such railroad company, or any of its authorized agents, for the construction of such railroad, or any part thereof, is entitled to a lien for the payment of the same upon such railroad, as provided in section thirty-one hundred \u00bfnd eight of the above recited act.\u201d In the case of <em>Industrial &amp; Mining Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Electrical Supply Co. et al., </em>58 Fed. Rep., 732, Swan, Judge, reviewing and construing the above enactment, and also Section 3208, Revised Statutes, says: \u201cBy Section 3208 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio it is provided that \u2018a person who performs labor or furnishes material for or in the construction of any railroad, depot buildings, water tanks, or any part thereof, to a contractor or sub-contractor, * * * shall have a lien for the payment of the same upon such railroad.\u2019 * * * This statute gives a lien upon the railroad only for materials furnished a contractor or subcontractor, for or in the construction of such railroad, depot buildings, and water tanks, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>part thereof. For whatever other structures materials may be furnished, no lien is given under this act.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u201cThe act of April 10, 1884, declaratory of the meaning of Section 3208, above cited, <em>enlarges </em>the list of those entitled to a lien, by enacting that the true intent and meaning of those sections is that \u2018any persons who perform labor or furnish material or boarding under contract, express or implied, <em>with </em>such <em>railroad </em>company, or any of its authorized agents, for the construction of such railroad, or any part thereof, is entitled to a lien for the payment of the same upon such railroad, as provided in Section 3108 (?) [3208] of the above recited act/ <em>The only effect </em>and purpose of this latter act was to give a lien under Section-3208 as well to persons furnishing materials directly to or performing labor under contract with a railroad company, as to those who dealt with contractors and sub-contractors, who were protected by Section 3208. Neither act, however, purports to give a lien-upon a railroad for anything <em>not used </em>in its construction as a railroad or that of its depot buildings or water tanks.\u201d That the general rule of construction is, that statutes giving a lien upon the railroad for materials furnished, should be limited to materials that are furnished for and to be used in the construction of the road, so as in a sense to become a part of it, would seem to be well settled by a uniform line of decisions, of which we cite the following as a type:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Central Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Texas &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co., </em>27 Fed. Rep., 178; <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; Northern Michigan R. R. Co., </em>30 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 236; <em>Stewart Chute Lumber Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. et al., </em>33 Neb., 29; <em>Basshor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Balto. &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>65 Md., 99; <em>Ferguson et al. </em>v. <em>Despo et al., </em>8 Ind. App., 523; <em>Knapp et al. </em>v. <em>St. Louis, Kansas City &amp; Northern Ry. Co., </em>6 Mo. App., 205. Having regard, then, for the well-defined. and established meaning of the term as employed in the statutes, it must be held that the hay, grain, straw and feed furnished by Mehaffey to Overstreet &amp; Styles, were not <em>materials </em>either within the meaning of the statute or the intent and language .of the telegram posted by the Pennsylvania Company, upon which this suit was predicated. And if not materials, then Mehaffey\u2019s claim for the articles so furnished was not within the terms of the telegram, and the sending and posting of said telegram \u2014 there being no allegation of fraud or attempt to mislead thereby \u2014 created no obligation against, neither did it impose any liability upon, the Pennsylvania Company to protect or pay Mehaffey\u2019s claim, or any claims of like character. Whether then Mehaffey, as averred in his petition, because of his reliance upon said telegram, did not, until the bringing of the present suit, institute any legal proceedings to secure the payment of his claim, and forbore the filing of an affidavit with the recorder of Allen county to perfect his lien against the railroad company for the articles furnished and supplied by him to Overstreet &amp; Styles, becomes wholly immaterial, for the reason that such facts, if proven in the present case, would in no wise either change or enlarge his rights against the railroad company. There being then in this case no liability on the part of the Pennsylvania Company to Mehaffey, except such as can right<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>fully be predicated upon the sending and posting of the above mentioned telegram, and Mehaffey\u2019s claim not being covered by, or within the terms of, said telegram, it follows that he is without right to recover in this case, and the trial court should have sustained the motion of counsel for the Pennsylvania Company \u2014 made at the close of the evidence \u2014 and should have directed a verdict in favor of the defendant company. Not having done this, but having overruled said motion and submitted the case to the jury, the court should then have given to the jury above request No. 1, as asked by counsel for the Pennsylvania Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Upon an application for a rehearing in this case, it is stated by counsel for defendants in error that certain of the items of Mehaffey\u2019s claim referred to in \u201cExhibit A\u201d attached to his petition, amounting to $21.1-0, are labor claims, and therefore within the express language and letter of the above telegram. And it is claimed that as to these items at least, Mehaffey is entitled to recover in this case. It is perhaps a sufficient answer to this claim to say, that Mehaffey\u2019s petition in the present case contains no allegation that these claims, or any of them, were labor claims, nor are they so denominated or described in Exhibit A attached to said petition. Mehaffey\u2019s claim as shown by the averments of his petition, and as exhibited by schedule A thereto attached, is one \u2022for hay, grain, straw and feed furnished by him to Overstreet &amp; Styles, or to other persons on their order and for which they were to pay. He does not ask, nor is he entitled in this case, to recover as owner or assignee of an}? claim for labor. There is a further, and we think equally conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>sive, answer to this suggestion of counsel for defendant in error, which is, that where, as in this case, a railroad contractor gives to a laborer in his employ an order upon a third party, by which such laborer obtains from said third party goods or merchandise to the amount of such order, the transaction is one of mere novation, whereby a new debt is created and the original debt, to the extent of the order, cancelled and paid, and it can not in law be treated as an assignment <em>pro tanto </em>of the laborer\u2019s claim to the person furnishing the goods or merchandise upon said order, so as to enable the latter to proceed against the railroad company under the statute as one owning and holding a claim for labor. In view of the conclusions above reached, it is unnecessary to dispose of the other questions argued, and they are not here considered. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and judgment will be entered for plaintiff in error upon the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment for plaintiff in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-7\">Shauck, C.
