J. Super. 477 (Ch. Div. </em>1953). Our review guides us to the conclusion that the extraordinary relief granted by paragraph No. 3 of the judgment wherein the defendants, their respective officers, agents and attorneys are permanently restrained and enjoined from assigning the tenant\u2019s interest or any part thereof under the lease, and from subletting the whole or any part of the demised premises during the term of the lease, or any renewal thereof, without the written consent of the plaintiff William Berland Eealty Co., or its successors and assigns, was unwarranted by the existing state of the evidence. In that respect only the judgment is reversed and in all other respects it is affirmed. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
