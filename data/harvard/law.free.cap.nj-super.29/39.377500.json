R. </em>1:6-2. The rule authorizes such a statement provided counsel present it to the court below for approval within 20 days after the filing of the notice of appeal. Here the notice of appeal was filed September 4, 1953. The application for an extension, though verified December 8, 1953, did not come before the three members of this part until December 21, 1953, not only after the expiration of the 20-day period, but about three months thereafter. It might be noticed, in passing, that all applications for extensions of time come before the part sitting together.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Counsel for defendants-appellants seeks to excuse this delay, saying that 'as assistant prosecutor he had to spend a substantial portion of one month in the preparation of a murder trial and that, in addition to six pre-trial conferences, he appeared in court on 18 days for all or a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the day. Very plainly that does not account for or excuse this delay of <em>2y2 </em>to 3 months. Under <em>'ll. Li. </em>1 U \u2014 13 we are authorized to extend the times fixed by the rules for the perfecting of appeals, provided good cause is shown. Good cause is not shown here. It makes no difference that the respondent\u2019s attorney consents to the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
