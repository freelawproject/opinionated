J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A3v\">This is a test case. The appellant was convicted in the municipal court as a disorderly person for violating <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:170-76. The County Court affirmed. By the statute it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cAny person who, without just cause, * * * possesses with intent * * * to sell the same, any instrument, medicine or other thing, designed or purporting to be designed for the prevention of conception * * * is a disorderly <em>person.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The defendant owns vending machines located in men\u2019s toilets in gasoline stations, each machine containing articles called prophylactics, commonly known as condoms, sold to the public by inserting a quarter into the machine. In his brief defendant cooncedes the State established that he (in the words of the statute) \u201cpossessed\u201d the articles with intent to sell them. However, with respect to the statutory provision as to \u201cjust cause,\u201d no question was raised below, and the briefs here do not go into it. <em>Cf. </em>153 <em>A. L. R. </em>1218, 1220, 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Bqth the machine, and the package containing the prophylactic, bear the legend: sold only for the prevention of disease. At the trial in the County Court the State asked the court to take judicial notice that, notwithstanding the legend, this prophylactic \u201cis a contraceptive\u201d \u2014 that is, that it was designed as such. The establishment of \u2022 this fact was essential to the State\u2019s case, and there was no other proof of the matter. Indeed there was no proof at all on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">The court may take judicial notice of any fact so notorious as not to be the subject of a reasonable dispute. <em>Grand View Gardens, Inc. v. Borough of Hasbrouck Heights, </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. 167 (App. Div. </em>1951); <em>Brown v. Piper, </em>91 <em>U. S. </em>37, 23 <em>L. Ed. </em>200 (1875); <em>Thayer, Judicial Notice, 3 Harvard L. Rev. </em>285, 305 (1890); <em>Model Code of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Evidence, </em>see <em>Professor Morgan's discussion of Judicial Notice, pp. </em>65-69, also <em>Rules </em>801-806. In <em>State v. Arnold, </em>211 <em>Wis. </em>340, 258 <em>N. </em>W. 843, 846 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), it is said that the sale of condoms \u201cin a public toilet by a mechanical vending machine is a sufficient warrant for the inference that the purpose of its sale was contraception and not merely the prevention of disease.\u201d <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Goldberg, </em>316 <em>Mass. </em>563, 55 <em>N. E. 2d </em>951 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1944). <em>State v. Arnold, supra, </em>however, is not quite in point. Our statute deals, not with the designs of the seller of the article \u2014 in other words, not with \u201cthe purpose of its sale\u201d <em>(State v. Arnold, supra) </em>\u2014 but with the designs of the article; the statute speaks of any <em>\u201cthing, </em>designed or purporting to be designed for the prevention of conception.\u201d Furthermore, by employing the words \u201cpurporting to be designed,\u201d the statute does not require proof of the article\u2019s designs as they existed in the mind of the manufacturer or any one else when the article was made. \u201cTo purport\u201d means, as used here, \u201cto have the appearance * * * of being.\u201d <em>Webster's New International Dictionary (2nd ed.); United States v. McGuire, </em>64 <em>F. 2d </em>485, 491 <em>(C. C. A. </em>2, 1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> So the question then becomes this: May judicial notice be taken that the prophylactics here \u201chave the appearance of being\u201d designed as contraceptives? We think judicial notice may bo taken that their apparent design is twofold: to prevent not only conception but also disease. In reaching this conclusion we attach little significance to the unmistakably self-serving legend on the package; the sale through a vending machine, without any meeting of buyer and seller, belies any restriction professedly placed upon the purpose of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> That brings us to the defendant\u2019s principal point. If, he argues, yon find (as we do find) that the article is designed for two purposes \u2014 first, to prevent disease and, second, to prevent conception \u2014 then, since the first would lead to an acquittal and the second to a conviction, the presumption of innocence, not to speak of the presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>that the law has been obeyed, compel an acquittal. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Werlinsky, 307 <em>Mass. </em>608, 29 <em>N. E. 2d </em>150 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1940). The answer to the argument is simple. We think the statute, we deal with, may perhaps be aimed at condoms more than any other article, despite the fact that they are designed for both purposes stated. Where one of the substantial designs of an article is the prevention of conception, any person who, without just cause, comes into the possession of it, with intent to sell it, is caught squarely within the terms of the statute. It matters not that the article was designed for some other purpose too. There is no warrant whatever for holding (as we are asked to do) that the words, \u201cdesigned for the prevention of conception,\u201d mean \u201cdesigned exclusively\u201d for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The defendant insists strongly that if the statute is so construed, then any one who, without just cause and with intent to sell the same, possesses antiseptics capable of use as a contraceptive, such as vinegar, sour milk and warm water, is a disorderly person. Of course not. None of these things was \u201cdesigned\u201d to prevent conception. We need not consider certain manufactured antiseptics referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The remainder of the defendant\u2019s argument seems to be bent upon finding in the statute an implication that, to constitute the offense, there must be an intention on the vendor\u2019s part to sell the prophylactics for an illegal purpose. In support of that endeavor, the defendant first relies upon <em>Youngs Rubber Corp. v. C. I. Lee &amp; Co., </em>45 <em>F. 2d </em>103, 108 <em>(C. C. A. 2 </em>1930), dealing with 18 <em>U. S. C. </em>\u00a7 1461 (the Comstock Act), and \u00a7 1462, which prohibit the mailing, or deposit, with any common carrier, of any \u201cthing designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception.\u201d The court held \u201cthe intention to prevent a <em>proper medical use </em>of drugs or other articles merely because they are capable of illegal use is not lightly to be ascribed to Congress.\u201d Therefore in a dictum the court, in effect, recast the terms of the statute so as to require \u201can intent on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>part of the sender that the article mailed or shipped by common carrier be used for illegal contraception * * That dictum was followed in <em>United States v. One Package, </em>86 <em>F. 2d </em>737 <em>(C. C. A. 2 </em>1936) where a specialist in gynecology was sued under 19 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1305 <em>(a) </em>for importing pessaries. There the court, construing the statutory words \u201cany article whatever for the prevention of conception,\u201d said the statute was not well understood by Congress when it was passed. Por other federal cases in accord, see <em>United States v. </em>Nicholas, 97 <em>F. 2d </em>510 <em>(C. C. A.</em>2 1938) and <em>Davis v. United States, </em>62 <em>F. 2d </em>473 <em>(C. C. A. </em>6 1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">There are two things to be said as to these federal cases. First, other courts faced with statutes similar to the federal statutes \u2014 similar, in that they contain no exception to cover the matter of proper medical use \u2014 have rejected the federal authorities, refusing to inject into their statutes such an exception. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>126 <em>Conn. </em>412, 11 <em>A.2d </em>856 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1940); <em>Tileston v. Ullman, </em>129 <em>Conn. </em>84, 26 <em>A.2d </em>582 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1942); <em>Commonwealth v. Gardner, </em>300 <em>Mass. </em>372, 15 <em>N. E. 2d 222 (Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1938); <em>cf. Lanteen Laboratories, Inc. v. Clark, </em>294 <em>Ill. App. </em>81, 13 V. <em>E. 2d </em>678 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1938). Second, the New Jersey statute is not so unreasonable as to warrant the taking of liberties with its language. Indeed, it is quite different from the statute first enacted in New Jersey, <em>L. </em>1869, <em>p. </em>1115, which was unqualified in its terms, and which in that respect was like the Comstock Act of 1873, now 18 <em>U. S. C., </em>\u00a7 1461, <em>supra, </em>and like other similar statutes enacted then and thereafter in a nation-wide movement <em>(cf. Lanteen Laboratories, Inc. v. Clark, </em>294 <em>Ill. App. </em>81, 13 <em>N. E. 2d </em>678 <em>(App. Ct. </em>1938)). However the <em>Revision of </em>1877, <em>p. </em>234, \u00a7 44 introduced into our statute the words \u201cwithout just cause,\u201d a phrase not found in the federal acts; and these words make provision for the very situations that concern the federal courts, the cases of \u201cproper medical care\u201d and the like. It might be noticed too, while looking back over the legislative history on the matter, that in another revision of the New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>statute (the </em>revision effective January 1, 1952, referred to in <em>State v. Maier, </em>13 N. J. 235, 239, 1953), the offense we are concerned with was reduced in Hew Jersey from a misdemeanor to one merely of disorderly conduct, <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:170-76, supra; whereas under 18 <em>U. S. C., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1461 and 1462, the offense still is a serious felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"> The defendant next seems to put forward a general proposition that to convict one of crime requires proof of an intention to commit a crime. <em>State v. Terry, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. 539 (F. &amp; A. 1917); State v. Costa, 11 </em>N. <em>J. </em>239, 246 (1953); <em>Nosowitz v. United States, </em>282 <em>F. 575 (C. C. A. </em>2 1922), dealing with 27 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 30. There is no warrant in our law for so general a proposition. On the contrary it is plainly within the competence of the Legislature to constitute an act a crime, regardless of the lack of a <em>mens rea </em>or criminal purpose. <em>Halsted v. State, 41 N. J. L. </em>552 <em>(E. &amp; A. 1879); State v. Kuehnle, </em>85 N. <em>J. L. </em>220 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913); <em>State v. Labato, </em>7 N. <em>J. </em>137 (1951). The question is, did the Legislature intend <em>it so. On </em>that, each statute must stand on its own terms. Thus possession of lottery slips make one a disorderly person, even though there be no intention to put 'them to an unlawful use. <em>State v. Murzda, </em>116 N. <em>J. L. </em>219, 226 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1935); <em>State v. Labato, </em>7 N. <em>J. </em>137, 149, 150 (1951), <em>supra. </em>It may be urged that a <em>mens rea </em>or criminal purpose is never required in connection with disorderly conduct unless the statute plainly demands it; but we need not stop to examine so broad a matter. Suffice it here to say we see no basis for adding to N. <em>J. S. 2A </em>:170 \u2014 76 a requirement that the one in possession of the prophylactics must have a criminal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Other eases relied upon by <em>defendant </em>\u2014 State <em>v. Zellmer, </em>202 <em>Iowa </em>638, 210 <em>N. </em>W. 774, 775 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926), and <em>Bibb v. State, </em>84 <em>Ala. </em>13, 4 <em>So. </em>275 <em>(Sup. Ct. 1888) </em>\u2014 may be dismissed cursorily. The statutes dealt with there, may perhaps be said to be somewhat parallel to that here, except that the words \u201cdesigned\" or \u201cpurporting to.be designed,\" or a participle of like import indicating the design of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>article, has been omitted. However, leave those words out of our statute here, and you put an entirely different aspect on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"> In a final endeavor at construing our statute so as to imply therein a provision that, to constitute the offense, the vendor must intend, when he sells the prophylactics, to prevent conception, the defendant relies upon <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Corbett, 307 <em>Mass. </em>7, 29 <em>N. E. 2d </em>151, 152 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1940). There the court had before it the statutory words \u201cwhoever sells * * * any * * * instrument or article whatever for the prevention of conception\u201d is guilty of a felony. Looking at the context and the legislative history, the Massachusetts court read into the statute the words \u201cintended to be used\u201d as modifying the word \u201carticle,\u201d and then found that, to warrant a conviction, it must be established that the seller intended the article to be used for the prevention of conception. The words \u201cintended to be used\u201d may possibly apply to the intentions of either the maker or the seller. <em>Cf. Weinstein v. United </em>States, 293 <em>F. </em>388 <em>(C. C. A. </em>1 1923). But our statute uses the words \u201cdesigned or. purporting to be designed\u201d -which apply to the intention or apparent purpose of the designer or maker, not the seller. The case is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
