Upon reconsideration we conclude that the Websters should not be penalized, nor their attorneys or the trial judge faulted, for the jury instructions that lacked the refinements of our formulation to govern the imposition of municipal liability stated in. the prior en banc opinion of this case (735 F.2d 838, 841) and our recent writing in <em>Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc). From the proof made, this jury could have found liability under the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-26\">For the above reasons, we grant rehearing to the following extent: (1) we affirm the judgment as to liability against the city; (2) we reverse .the judgment as to damages for the reasons given by the panel, 689 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>F.2d 1220, 1228; and (3) costs are adjudged against the City of Houston. In all other respects the petition for rehearing is denied. No further petition will be entertained and the mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
