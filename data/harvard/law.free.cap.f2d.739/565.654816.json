The agency re-evaluated Freeman\u2019s condition in 1981, concluded that she was no longer disabled, and terminated her benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 68-70, 93. In its report, the SSA diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lumbar disc syndrome. <em>Id. </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Claimant requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. Claimant was represented by a paralegal at the hearing and was the only witness. The AU found that claimant was no longer suffering from disabling pain and was not disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. The Appeals Council denied review. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s termination of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">This court has held that there could be no termination of benefits unless there was substantial evidence of improvement to the point of no disability. <em>Simpson v. Schweilcer, </em>691 F.2d 966, 969 (11th Cir. 1982). This court has also recognized that a comparison of the original medical evidence and the new medical evidence is necessary to make a finding of improvement. <em>Vaughn v. Heckler, </em>727 F.2d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir.1984). Unlike the AU in <em>Vaughn, </em>the AU here specifically referred to the original medical evidence. 2 Rec. at 21. However, he did not compare the old evidence with the new evidence, but instead stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">[t]he medical evidence indicates that the claimant\u2019s conditions are not attended by clinical findings that meet or equal in severity the requirements of Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Part 404 of the regulations. Moreover, the claimant is not engaging in substantial gainful activity. Consequently, the issue before the Administrative Law Judge is whether claimant\u2019s impairments prevent her from performing her usual work; and if so, whether those impairments prevent her from performing other kinds of substantial gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 20. While the AU did state that \u201cclaimant no longer continues to suffer from incapacitating and disabling pain to such an extent as to constitute a severe impairment or impairments within the meaning of the Social Security Act, as amended,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 24, he did not actually compare the old and new evidence but simply determined that Freeman did not now suffer from incapacitating pain. Because the AU did not consider the issue of improvement but instead treated the case as though it were an original application for benefits, the case must be considered under the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Claimant asserts that the AU improperly required objective medical evidence to substantiate her testimony about pain. The AU stated that \u201c[tjhere is very little objective clinical evidence of conditions which would precipitate disabling pain.\u201d In this circuit the AU must recognize that pain alone can be disabling, even when there is no objective medical evidence to support the claimant\u2019s testimony about pain. <em>Gaultney v. Weinberger, </em>505 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir.1974). The AU improperly required objective medical evidence to support Freeman\u2019s claim of disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1522 (1983) required that the AU consider the combination of claimant\u2019s impairments. The AU considered the impairments separately but not together. This issue should be addressed on remand. <em>Reeves v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 519 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">In <em>Broz </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>677 F.2d 1351 (11th Cir.1982), <em>vacated and remanded sub nom. Heckler v. Broz, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2421, 77 L.Ed.2d 1311, <em>adhered to, </em>711 F.2d 957, <em>modified, </em>721 F.2d 1297 (11th Cir.1983), we held the grids invalid to the extent they treated the age/ability to adapt factor as a legislative rather than adjudicative fact. <em>Broz, </em>677 F.2d at 1360. We explained in <em>Reeves v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 519 (11th Cir.1984) how the Secretary could use the age grids in establishing claimant\u2019s ability to adapt. The determination we described in <em>Reeves </em>has not been made in this case. The record indicates that the AU applied the grids mechanistically. On remand to the Secretary, Freeman must be given the opportunity to offer evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>her inability to adapt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the absence of such evidence the AU\u2019s use of the age grids would be dispositive of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANT\">. We have already determined that this case must be remanded to the Secretary on grounds other than the Secretary\u2019s application of the grids. Consequently, there is no need for the claimant to make a proffer of evidence to the district court on her ability to adapt. Rather, on remand to the Secretary, the Secretary must reconsider the case in light of <em>Broz </em>and <em>Reeves </em>if the ALJ applies the grids to Freeman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
