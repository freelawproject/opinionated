No member of the panel arid no judge in regular active service of the court has requested that the ease be polled on rehearing en banc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The panel, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>has withheld final action on the petition for rehearing pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Following the rendition of that opinion, the panel gave counsel additional time within which to file supplemental briefs addressing the issues in this case in the light of the Court\u2019s decision. Having studied both the Court\u2019s opinion and counsel\u2019s briefs, we deny the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Martin\u2019s comparative-review argument requires little discussion. The panel opinion simply applied the en banc decision in <em>Williams v. </em>Maggio,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which held that Louisiana\u2019s system of comparative review of death sentences was constitutionally adequate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Pulley v. </em>Harris,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which upheld California\u2019s capital scheme notwithstanding its failure to provide comparative proportionality review, amply supports that result. We turn to the application of the principles set forth in <em>Washington v. Strickland </em>to the contention that trial counsel was ineffective when representing Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The Court in <em>Washington </em>announced a standard for determining whether counsel was ineffective. While specific guidelines are not appropriate, it said, courts must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct. \u201cA convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the defendant proves that counsel was ineffective, he must \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He must \u201cshow that there is a <em>reasonable probability </em>that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">The Court then discussed \u201cpractical considerations\u201d involved in application of the tests it had outlined. It admonished lower courts to eschew a mechanical approach to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel \u25a0 cases. \u201c[T]he ultimate focus of inquiry must be the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged ... [and] whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, the result of the particular proceeding is unreliable because of a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court also decreed that, \u201c[t]o the extent that this has already been the guiding inquiry in the lower courts, the standards articulated today do not require reconsideration of ineffectiveness claims rejected under different standards____ With regard to the prejudice inquiry, only the strict outcome-determinative test, among the standards articulated in the lower courts, imposes a heavier burden on defendants than the tests laid down today. The difference, however, should alter, the merit of an ineffectiveness claim only in the rarest case.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court then proceeded to apply these standards to the facts before it, and concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and to present a different line of defense at Washington\u2019s sentencing hearing was the result of rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>sonable professional judgment. The Court also determined that, \u201c[gjiven the overwhelming aggravating factors, there is no reasonable probability that the omitted evidence would have changed the conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and, hence, the sentence imposed.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In our prior opinion, we held that, even indulging every credibility determination that a factfinder might make in Martin\u2019s favor, no jury would have accepted the intoxication defense that Martin suggests should have been offered instead of the defense relied upon.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We also set forth our reasons for reaching that conclusion in detail and do not reiterate them. In addition to the evidence referred to in that opinion, further evidence is mentioned in the Louisiana Supreme Court opinion affirming Martin\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The evidence indicates that Martin carefully planned the murders in advance; had to reload the revolver twice, one shell at a time, in order to shoot the number of rounds that he expended in committing the murders; confessed the murders to five different persons over a period of several hours without any indication that he had ever suffered from any amnesia; indicated to each that he acted deliberately; explained that once he had started shooting, he couldn\u2019t stop; pulled the trigger fifteen times; gave two expended shells to a friend to dispose of so that this evidence would not be found; had blood on his clothes and bathed that night; and said to his wife, \u201cI did it for you, baby.\u201d We have no doubt, certainly no reasonable one, that, in the face of this evidence, a jury would have acquitted Martin on the thesis that PCP sometimes (or commonly) may impair a person\u2019s ability to form criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The crucial question in an intoxication case is whether the accused had the capacity to form the specific intent to kill when he caused the death of the individual with which he is charged. Even \u00e1t this time counsel for Martin, in urging that we remand the case to the district court to provide an'opportunity for him to present additional evidence on the prejudice issue, does not proffer any additional evidence that would affirmatively prove the- prejudice that is indispensable to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">For these reasons, we conclude that Martin has not shown that he suffered any prejudice by the action of his trial counsel \u2022and that we must deny his petition for rehearing. Doing so, we note that the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence by a 4-3 decision, the three dissenters arguing that the death penalty was inappropriate in this case,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that much of the evidence preferred in the habeas corpus evidentiary hearing concerning his character and the circumstances that preceeded his rampage was not presented to the jury. These should be presented to those state authorities who have power to grant clemency for such action, if any, as they may see fit. It is our legal duty to affirm the conviction and sentence. The power of mercy lies in other hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">For these reasons, the application for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">. <em>Martin v.
