The plaintiff sustained no injury in the collision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-28\">2. The plaintiff sustained injuries but the injuries left no consequences, no damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-29\">3. The plaintiff sustained damages at about the time of the collision or thereafter, but the damages were not the proximate result of the collision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>We believe the plaintiff should know on which horn he was caught. And, we find it most difficult ourselves to review the case without knowing which conclusion the trial court reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Accordingly, the case is remanded to the district court. It is suggested the judgment and findings and conclusions be vacated and new ones entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On a new appeal, the old record and briefs may be used so far as desired, either upon a stipulation or on motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
