W. Kaine, Commanding General, 77th United States Army Reserve Command and Captain William Stanners, Commanding Officer, 146th General Support Company, whereby he sought permanently to enjoin them from enforcing certain statutes and a directive issued as of July 1, 1968 which might result in plaintiff being certified to his Selective Service Board for immediate induction into the Armed Services. He also requested the convocation of a three-judge court to rule upon alleged constitutional issues. The defendants moved for an order dismissing the complaint or alternatively for summary judgment in their favor. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment, dismissing the complaint and plaintiff appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The facts are to be found in the complaint and affidavits to which correspondence between plaintiff and the Army, plaintiff\u2019s employer and the Army and an inter-departmental memorandum are annexed. The controversy is based upon the length of plaintiff\u2019s hair, particularly during the period from July 15, 1968 to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Some six years ago plaintiff enlisted in the Army and, instead of the two-year period of continuous service, elected to enlist in the Reserves for six years, six months of which were to be active duty, the balance by regular attendance at drills (two days a month) and by two weeks\u2019 annual summer camp training. He finished his active duty assignment on February 20, 1964, and was eventually assigned to the 146th General Support Company. Shortly thereafter plaintiff obtained employment with a theatrical agency and in 1965 became an agent for \u201crock and roll\u201d bands. Because of this position plaintiff claims that he \u201chas worn his hair longer than conventional length\u201d (Compl. par. 8). Until July 1, 1968 an Army directive gave individuals \u201cthe right to retain long hair\u201d if it contributed \u201cto the individual\u2019s civilian livlihood.\u201d (Weekly Bulletin 42, October 20, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">Subsequently this directive was superseded by the directive of July 1, 1968 which \u201cprohibited reservists from wearing their hair as long as that then and still being worn by plaintiff.\u201d (Compl. par. 11). During his summer training period in July 1968 plaintiff was ordered to conform to the new directive and refused to comply. The penalty was a fine of some $20 but an additional and more serious consequence was the denial of credit for attendance at drills. Again on August 10, 1968 plaintiff was advised by defendant Stanners that unless he wore his hair at a conventional length he would not receive credit for attendance and that because of such defaults he would be inducted into military service for approximately fifteen months\u2019 active duty. Thereafter plaintiff wrote to Vice-President Humphrey and Congressman Ryan. These letters and others were unproductive of results favorable to plaintiff and on September 12, 1968 plaintiff was advised by a Major General of the Army that \u201cArmy regulations require that haircuts be well groomed, cut short or medium length, and trimmed at all times. Exceptions will not be made to this policy.\u201d A subsequent letter from plaintiff\u2019s employer to the Major General indicated that if. plaintiff cut his hair his value to them \u201cwould be sharply curtailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-10\">At this time plaintiff had accumulated thirteen unexcused absences from drills. Some absences he disputes but if his absences, resulting from no credit because of his unkempt appearance, are counted, they exceed the allowable number.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">The district court relied upon this court\u2019s recent decision in Smith v. Resor, 406 F.2d 141, in which the court said: \u201cFurther, the decision as to what constitutes the correct appearance of reservists is, absent extraordinary circumstances not present here, within the jurisdiction of the Army.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">Plaintiff summons to his aid seven of the first ten amendments to the Constitution, probably on the theory that with seven pegs on the board his broadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>hurled arguments might attach themselves to one. But such reliance points to the fallacy of plaintiff\u2019s position. If he asks: Does being in the Army curtail or suspend certain Constitutional rights?, the answer is unqualifiedly \u201cyes\u201d. Of necessity, he is forced to surrender many important rights. He arises unwillingly at an unreasonable hour at the sound of a bugle unreasonably loud. From that moment on, his freedom of choice and will ceases to exist. He acts at the command of some person \u2014 not a representative of his own choice \u2014 who gives commands to him which he does not like to obey. He is assigned to a squad and forced to associate with companions not of his selection and frequently the chores which he may be ordered to perform are of a most menial nature. Yet the armed services, their officers and their manner of discipline do serve an essential function in safeguarding the country. The need for discipline, with the attendant impairment of certain rights, is an important factor in fully discharging that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">In listing all his constitutional impairments plaintiff forgets that it is the Constitution which authorizes the creation of an Army. Plaintiff\u2019s and his fellow citizens\u2019 duly elected representatives enacted the draft legislation. He knew that he could fulfill his military obligations by enlisting in the Army for two or for six years. It is the same Army \u2014 only the period of service differs. Plaintiff concedes that, had he elected the two-year period, he would have had to conform to Army Regulations including the length of his hair. However, plaintiff chose the six-year enlistment undoubtedly because it offered certain inducements. Not the least of these inducements was probably the ability to carry on various civilian activities and to avoid the raucous sounds of daily bugles and the regimented day thereafter \u2014 or even possibly foreign service. But these civilian activities were permissive, they were not constitutional rights. Plaintiff was still in the Army and subject to Army discipline. He was not a free agent. Nor could he ignore his Army enlistment. For six years he, by his own choice, imposed restrictions upon his activities and his appearance. For various reasons, the Army decided (not subject to federal court review unless the courts take over the functions of the General Staff) that the equivalent of two years\u2019 intensive service was six months, followed by five and one-half years of bi-weekly drills and summer camp training.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">Plaintiff now asks that an exception as to appearance be made in his case. The Army has advised him that such an exception cannot be made. Such a decision is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">How have the courts handled such requests for special treatment under allegedly special circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-8\">First it is necessary to set out the statutory and regulatory framework underlying the present action. Section 673a of Title 10 authorizes the President to order to active duty any member of the Ready Reserve who is \u201cnot participating satisfactorily\u201d in his reserve duties. Members of reserve units are exempt from induction under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456 only \u201cso long as they continue to be such members and <em>satisfactorily participate </em>in scheduled drills and training periods as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense * * No definition of \u201csatisfactory participation\u201d is contained in either statute. [Emphasis added]</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">Army Regulations No. 135-91, issued pursuant to the above authority, prescribes the \u201cpolicies, procedures and responsibilities pertaining to satisfactory completion of the Ready Reserve service obligation.\u201d Members \u201care required to participate satisfactorily in paid drill units * * * for the full period of their Ready Reserve obligation.\u201d \u201cSatisfactory participation\u201d is defined in the Regulations as \u201cAttendance at all scheduled unit training assemblies * * * unless excused by proper authority.\u201d A member is not satisfactorily participating \u201cunless he is in the prescribed uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>form, <em>presents a neat and soldierly appearance, </em>and performs his assigned duties in a satisfactory manner as determined by the unit commander,\u201d Army Regulations 135-91(5) (d) (2) [Emphasis added]. Failure to properly participate leads to loss of attendance credit and to an unexcused absence. The nature of the relief appellant seeks in this lawsuit is to have this Court become the arbiter of what constitutes \u201ca neat and soldierly appearance,\u201d within the meaning of the Army regulations, inform the Army that his hair is the proper length for a reservist and then order the Army not to call him up for active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">This Court has repeatedly refused to grant relief in similar situations where men have been called to active duty because of unsatisfactory participation in training functions. Fox v. Brown, 402 F.2d 837 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1114, 89 S.Ct. 1007, 22 L.Ed.2d 120 (March 24, 1969); Winters v. United States, 281 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.N.Y.,1968), aff\u2019d 390 F.2d 879 (2d Cir. 1968); United States v. Lonstein, 370 F.2d 318 (2d Cir. 1966). See also United States ex rel. Schonbrun v. Commanding Officer, 403 F.2d 371 (2d Cir. 1968). The rationale has been that determination of whether a reservist has fully discharged his duties was, absent extraordinary circumstances, for the Army and not for the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Smith v. Resor, <em>supra, </em>cited by plaintiff, is not to the contrary, although the facts are somewhat similar to the present case. There a reservist was called to active duty because of five \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d ratings for attendance at required meetings. See Army Regulations 135-91. He had received most of these ratings because his hair was too long. However, this Court in reversing the District Court\u2019s denial of relief remanded because the Army had failed to follow its own regulations. Weekly Bulletin 42, referred to above, was then in effect and Smith\u2019s employer had written the required letter indicating that longer hair was necessary to his employment but his commanding officer refused to allow him to wear his hair long. More importantly, this letter was not placed in his file, as is required, but was tucked in the commanding officer\u2019s desk, thereby rendering any in-service appeal fruitless. The Court, remanding for such an appeal, emphasized that what constituted proper or correct appearance was \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the Army,\u201d and declined to review the validity of the decision that Smith must cut his hair to get credit for attendance at drills. This is precisely the discretionary determination which plaintiff now asks this Court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">Discretionary power by its very nature is the power to choose among competing considerations. Although rarely is discretion absolute \u2014 even the broad discretion of governmental personnel officers in hiring and firing is limited where certain bases of action would violate the Constitution' \u2014 this Court, because of the frequent need for expedition in call-up orders has expressed serious doubt how far this principle should apply to such matters. United States ex rel. Schon-brun, <em>supra, </em>403 F.2d at 374. In Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953), the Supreme Court declined to review a military call-up order where an abuse of discretion may very well have been involved. The Court refused to review despite the claimed discriminatory character of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">At the time of the present action, Raderman had not yet been formally ordered to report for active duty, and in anticipation of such order and to bar its issuance he brought this suit. He claims that his case is distinguishable from other cases cited above, since it is \u201can affirmative lawsuit <em>before an induction order\u201d </em>has been received, rather than a habeas application after an induction order. [Emphasis added.] But the procedural posture of such an action is irrelevant to the merits. If it were otherwise, a reservist, who could reach the courthouse steps first, by commencing an action before a call-up order issued, presumably would have greater sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>stantive rights than one who was not as agile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Plaintiff claims that compliance with his commanding officer\u2019s order to trim his hair would have seriously impaired his ability to earn his living. Therefore, he alleges that the military\u2019s action has denied him \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d without due process of law, citing a quotation from Chief Justice Warren in Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 492, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 1411, 13 L.Ed.2d 1377 (1959), that \u201cthe alleged liberty is petitioner\u2019s freedom to practice his chosen profession\u201d * * * \u201cfree from unreasonable governmental interference.\u201d The <em>Greene </em>case involved the question of whether an engineer, who for years had had security clearance and had worked on many defense projects, could be denied such clearance on the basis of confidential informant testimony without the opportunity to confront and cross-examine his accuser. The Court held that he could not be. The case is clearly distinguishable on its facts; it did not involve a reservist and Chief Justice Warren dictum must be viewed in the context of the factual situation of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\"> The problem with a reservist, such as Raderman, is that he is neither a civilian nor a full-time soldier. In effect he must live in two worlds, one military and one civilian and attempt to satisfy the requirements of both. As in this case, the demands of each may conflict and, while the result may appear harsh, he made the choice some time ago to join a reserve unit. Concomitant with that decision was the knowledge that he would be subject to Army rules and regulations concerning his appearance- for six years. Certainly what constitutes a neat and soldierly appearance for a reservist within such regulations is within the discretion of the military. There is no claim here that plaintiff was treated any differently than any other reservist; in fact, he was advised by a Major General of the Army that \u201cExceptions will not be made to this policy.\u201d Throughout the ages the appearance of the military has changed radically. Pictures of Visigoths and our own Civil War soldiers illustrate these changes. But past practices afford no criteria for the present. At any rate, a court is in no position to make that kind of judgment. In the present case there is clearly no action by the military which goes far beyond any rational exercise of discretion. Relief must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">We have reviewed the other claims raised by the plaintiff and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
