The district court summarily denied relief indicating that the Kansas Supreme Court had earlier given full and fair consideration to the issues and had decided such issues adversely to petitioner. At that time the district court had before it only the petition and the reported opinion of the Kansas court in State v. Hoy, 199 Kan. 340, 430 P.2d 275. For the reasons stated in Brown v. Crouse, 10 Cir., 399 F.2d 311; Maes v. Patterson, 10 Cir., 401 F.2d 200, and Scheer v. Patterson, 10 Cir., 411 F.2d 811, this day decided, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further consideration. Cf. Maxwell v. Turner, 10 Cir., 411 F.2d 805, and Day v. Page, 10 Cir., 411 F.2d 810, this day decided.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
