He contends that the court should have charged the jury that he could be convicted of lesser included offenses, e. g., assault by striking, beating, or wounding, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(d), or simple assault, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-24\">The evidence disclosed that Agofsky, in the nighttime, stabbed a fellow prisoner with a knife while the victim was asleep in his bunk. There is no contention that a dangerous weapon was not used. As a matter of law, Agofsky did not have just cause or excuse to stab a sleeping victim who offered him no imminent harm. \u201cA lesser-included offense instruction is only proper where the charged greater offense</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>requires the jury to find a disputed factual element which is not required for conviction of the lesser-included offense.\u201d Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 350, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965). Therefore, it was not incumbent upon the district judge to instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty could be returned on the lesser included offenses. Parker v. United States, 123 U.S.App. D.C. 343, 359 F.2d 1009, 1013 (1966); United States v. Strassman, 241 F.2d 784, 786 (2d Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Agofsky\u2019s other assignments of error are without merit. His conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
