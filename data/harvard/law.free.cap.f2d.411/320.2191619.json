BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AhB\">MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">This controversy had its genesis in Germany in 1858 when Rudolf Diesel was born. The engine which was later named after this noted automotive engineer revolutionized the conversion of chemical to mechanical energy. His small, efficient engine was quickly adopted by industry and is today found on all the highways and railroads of this country and throughout the world. And therein lies the rub. When the Nation\u2019s railroads started using the diesel engine, they stopped using the steam locomotive\u2019s firemen, or so they thought. Since diesel fuel need not be shoveled, and the diesel fire need not be tended, the coal-shoveling, fire-tending firemen of the nineteenth century were soon to become superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">They are a strong and powerful lot, however, and are vigorously represented on the National front by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (BLFE) in their struggle with the railroads to perpetuate their use on diesel locomotives. This basic confrontation between men and technology has locked this Nation in one of the longest and most bitterly fought labor disputes in the country\u2019s history. Courts across the land have been struggling with this clash of interests with little, if any, success but with an experience-proved recognition that the \u201cgenie cannot be put back into the bottle\u201d Op. [1] 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">We have here but a small and wholly unnecessary portion of this running controversy. By drawing freely on Judge Leventhal\u2019s monumental opus in the <em>merits </em>opinion for the District of Columbia Circuit as well as the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>contempt </em>decision we may severely caps\u00falate the facts with the caveat that the details, if needed, may be found there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, some of the details come out in our contempt decision reversing the criminal contempt decision of BLFE.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Not surprisingly, the contemporary dispute arises out of a settlement of the irrepressible controversy. The problem began when the Carriers and BLFE voluntarily entered into the National Diesel Agreement in 1950, providing that firemen should be employed on substantially all locomotives. In 1959, the Carriers filed a \u00a7 6 notice pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 156) in an attempt to eliminate firemen from certain locomotives. After numerous attempts at mediation and conciliation, and on the eve of a threatened nation-wide railway strike, Congress in 1963 enacted Public Law 88-108 (77 Stat. 132) which required transitory compulsory arbitration and set up Special Arbitration Board No. 282. The Arbitration Board promulgated Award 282 in November 1963, which made sweeping orders concerning the use of firemen on locomotives (and some \u201ccrew consist\u201d problems not involved here). As permitted under the enabling Act (P.L. 88-108) by agreement between the Carriers and BLFE, the expiration date of Award 282 was fixed at 12:01 a. m., March 31, 1966. But the two-year period did not bring the hoped-for peaceful solution nor did it precipitate hoped-for bargaining, just more litigation and as the expiration date approached, all sorts of skirmishes by which the adversaries hoped the expiration might bring more advantageous positions than would bargaining. The \u201clegal\u201d argument centered about the Brotherhood\u2019s contentions that Award 282 expired fully and finally on E-day, and the Carriers\u2019 reflex claim that Award 282 endured until changed by the parties. (See Op. [1] p. 592).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">In November 1965, in anticipation of the expiration of the Award, BLFE served three separate \u00a7 6 notices on the Carriers, proposing a new agreement concerning the use of firemen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>riers made the double track contention that the Notices were premature and that No. 2 and No. 3 were not even proper subjects for bargaining.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But not to be outdone they made \u201cjust in case\u201d (Op. [1] p. 592) \u00a7 6 notices. BLFE and the Carriers were unable to reach agreement. On March 24, 1966, the Nation\u2019s Class I railroads filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking declaratory and in-junctive relief. On March 28, 1966, Judge Holtzoff, of that Court, issued a temporary restraining order against BLFE prohibiting a strike upon the expiration of the Award. At 12:01 a. m. on March 31, 1966, BLFE initiated a strike against the Central of Georgia (Georgia Central) and other railroads. Southern was affected in that some of its personnel would not cross the Georgia Central picket lines. Later on March 31, Judge Holtzoff expanded his restraining order to cover any strikes in any way relating to the Award. (Op. [2] p. 574) On the same day, Georgia Central and Southern sought injunctive relief against BLFE in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The District Court in Georgia also issued a temporary restraining order on March 31, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">It rounds out the picture to state here that the strike was terminated on late Sunday April 3, 1966. (Op. [2] p. 574) And nothing except the Georgia criminal contempt proceeding of April 4, (See note 2) is shown by our record to have taken place in the Georgia case down to about May 12 to 16. But much was taking place under Judge Holtzoff\u2019s direction with full relief being accorded the Carriers both as to the there-pending civil-coercive contempt<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the merits. (Op. [1] pp. 592, 600.) On May 12, 1966, Judge Holtzoff entered a judgment in accordance with his opinion in Bangor and Aroostook R. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, D. C., 253 F.Supp. 682 permanently enjoining BLFE and each of its lodges, divisions, locals, officers, and agents, and all persons acting in concert with them from engaging in any strikes or work stoppages or from picketing the premises of any of the railroads with respect to the failure or refusal of any carrier to confer, bargain, negotiate, participate in mediation or otherwise participate in proceedings under the Railway Labor Act with respect to Notice Nos. 1 and 2 or the failure or refusal of any carrier prior to the expiration of the Award to confer, bargain, negotiate, or participate in mediation with respect to Notice No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Without the slightest whisper of a suggestion of a remote possible reason why, with the strike terminated and'the threat of all renewed action being positively enjoined by Judge Holtzoff\u2019s final order of May 12, the Georgia District Court on May 16 entered a preliminary injunction dated May 12 (F.R.Civ.P. 79(a)) which is the subject of this appeal. Except that it zeroed in for local railroads against localized Brotherhood representatives it was a virtual ditto of Judge Holtzoff\u2019s. It enjoined BLFE, and each of its lodges, divisions, locals, officers, and agents, from authorizing, calling, encouraging, permitting or engaging in any strike or work stoppage against Georgia Central or Southern and from picketing the premises of either Georgia Central or Southern in a resumption of the strike against Georgia Central which commenced March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>31, I960, or over any dispute as to the effect of the expiration of Award 282 or over any dispute arising out of any of the proposals served by BLFE on the Carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"aln-dedup-1\">The Brotherhood appeals from this preliminary injunction of May 16, 1966, with two principal attacks. The first is the procedural one complaining of duplicate litigation in both Georgia and the District of Columbia. The second goes to the merits including the validity of the \u00a7 6 notices and the prohibitive effect of the Norris-La Guardia Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We need not consider the second group on the merits (see items 2 through 7, note 7 <em>supra) </em>for two reasons. The first is that, for reasons to be discussed, we get this case out of Georgia, where it never should have been, by sending whatever remains of the ease to the D.C. District Court. Second, both Georgia Central and Southern were and are formal parties to the D.C. litigation. Each is irretrievably bound as to every issue determined by that Court and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This includes, among others, the timeliness of the \u00a7 6 Notices 1, 2, and 3 and the validity of Nos. 1 and 2 (Op. [1] pp. 597, 599, 600-603), and the application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act both as to \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 8 (Op. [1] pp. 600-604, 613-614).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">As we dispose of this case we do not have to assay the actions in terms of the initial restraining order of March 31 (which was a parallel of Judge Holtzoff\u2019s of the same day). We concentrate on the preliminary injunction entered May 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">Nothing illustrates better the utter uselessness of this entire proceeding than the Carrier\u2019s complaint filed in the District Court in Georgia. \u201cThis matter was litigated before the Honorable Alexander Holtzoff, United States District Judge, District of Columbia, in the case of Bangor and Aroostook Railroad Co., et al versus Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, C.A. 777-66. He held with the railroads and by order dated March 28, 1966, restrained and enjoined defendants from causing a work stoppage. A copy of the pertinent part of said order is attached hereto, marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019.\u201d More than that, the Carriers recognized the binding character of Judge Holtzoff\u2019s order and its nation-wide application to the Brotherhood and all of its components and agents.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Thus the Georgia District Court was on March 31, fully aware of the existing temporary restraining order of March 28, and the supplemental order of March 31, issued by Judge Holtzoff. And with all of the \u201ccrises\u201d now long out of the situation the lower court knew specifically of Judge Holtzoff\u2019s permanent injunction of May 12. In spite of this, the District Court of Georgia proceeded to issue duplicative restraining orders and finally the preliminary injunction entered May 16. Both sets of temporary restraining orders and injunctions prohibited precisely the same parties from engaging in precisely the same activities and protected precisely the same railroads. The jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia having been invoked by these very parties out of this very controversy and the decrees of that Court having issued, that is the only place where the case then properly belonged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>We need not expressly determine whether in these circumstances the District Court erred in failing to grant BLFE\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground of the pendency of the same case in the District of Columbia. This is because we hold that, as a minimum, the Trial Court should have transferred this case under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1404(a) to the D.C. Court. We achieve what ought to have been done three years ago bj- remanding with directions to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The Carriers here are the last ones able to challenge any such procedure for that is precisely how Georgia Central and Southern (and their cohort Carriers) got the controversy before Judge Holtzoff. The litigation concerning the consequences of the expiration of Award 282 and the \u00a7 6 notices was initiated in February 1966, by BLFE\u2019s suit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Carriers moved to transfer the action to the District of Columbia on the ground that there was a prior action pending in the District of Columbia, brought by the Carriers against the other operating unions involved in Award 282.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The District Court in Illinois granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">We concur in the wisdom of that transfer and therefore in the interests of justice we direct on remand that this whole cause be transferred<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to the District of Columbia Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">Just what remains of the case, what issues are still alive, what issues have already been resolved irrevocably under <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel or both, by the prior decisions of the Courts in the District of Columbia Circuit (see note 1 supra) to which Georgia Central and Southern are bound as parties are matters for the determination of the transferee court and its Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Judgment vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\">.

This sequel concerns the internecine, intramural, probably non-fraternal dispute between the two Brotherhoods as to which gets the Apprentice Engineer craft and the dilemma facing the Carriers in recognition and bargaining. With the collective apologia of the Court\u2019s principal spokesman Judge J.

Judge Maris, speaking in 1941 in terms of then expanding Court dockets, again revealed both his remarkable wisdom in court administration problems and his prescience in predicting what has since become a real explosion of judicial business.

Equally important is its adverse effect upon the prompt and efficient administration of justice. In view of the constant increase in judicial business in the federal courts and the continual necessity of adding to the number of judges, at the expense of the taxpayers, public policy requires us to seek actively to avoid the waste of judicial time and energy.
