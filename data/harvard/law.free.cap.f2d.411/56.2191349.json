M. Sloan, Inc. (\u201cSloan\u201d), from violating the minimum-wage and overtime provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and restraining Sloan from the withholding of a total of $2712.11, inclusive of interest, found by the court to be due to five employees as minimum wage and overtime compensation under the Act. The Opinion of the District Court is reported at 285 F.Supp. 669 (W.D.Pa.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The case concerns five employees of F. M. Sloan, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a Pennsylvania corporation doing business only within the state of Pennsylvania. The question presented is whether the District Court erred in concluding that these five employees were covered by the Act and entitled, therefore, to the protection it provides. Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207, extend its coverage to employees \u201c * * * who in any workweek [are] engaged in [interstate] commerce or in the production of goods for [interstate] commerce * * *.\u201d Section 3(j), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(j), provides that \u201c * * * for the purposes of this chapter an employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed * * * in any <em>closely related </em>process or occupation <em>directly essential </em>to the production thereof * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">During the period relevant to this action, December 13, 1964 to April 17, 1966,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sloan was engaged in the production of natural gas from twenty-six wells owned or leased by it, all within the state of Pennsylvania. All of the gas so produced was sold, as required by contractual agreement, to The Peoples Natural Gas Company of Pittsburgh (\u201cPeoples\u201d), a Pennsylvania corporation. The gas was delivered on a continuous, almost daily basis from Sloan\u2019s pipeline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>into a Peoples\u2019 pipeline, where it was commingled with much larger quantities of gas produced by Peoples\u2019 own wells and those of other producers who sold to Peoples., The District Court found, and it is undisputed, that it would be impossible to trace any particular cubic foot of gas back to its source once it had merged with the other gas in Peoples\u2019 pipelines. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it is not \u201cessential to coverage that any particular cubic foot of defendant\u2019s gas should be so traced.\u201d D. A. Schulte, Inc. v. Gangi, 328 U.S. 108, 121, 66 S.Ct. 925, 90 L.Ed. 1114 (1946); Mitchell v. Jaffe, 261 F.2d 883, 887 (5 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Although Peoples did not sell or deliver gas to customers located outside the state of Pennsylvania, and thus was not <em>directly </em>involved in interstate commerce, it did distribute a large percentage of the gas in its pipelines on a daily basis to the mills of Braeburn Alloy Steel Company at Braeburn, Pennsylvania, and Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corporation at Brackenridge, Pennsylvania and approximately 95 percent of the gas so delivered was utilized in producing steel products of which 85 to 90 percent was shipped in interstate commerce on a regular basis. It is settled that, under the facts as outlined above, the employees of Peoples, regardless of the nature of the work they performed, would fall within the coverage of the Act because of their engagement in a \u201cclosely related process or occupation directly essential to the production\u201d of goods for interstate commerce. See Wirtz v. Idaho Sheet Metal Works, Inc., 335 F.2d 952 (9 Cir. 1964), aff\u2019d 383 U.S. 190, 86 S.Ct. 737, 15 L.Ed. 2d 694 (1966), reh. den. 383 U.S. 963, 86 S.Ct. 1219,16 L.Ed.2d 305, 306; Mitchell v. Independent Ice and Cold Storage Company, 294 F.2d 186 (5 Cir. 1961), cert. den. Independent Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v. Goldberg, 368 U.S. 952, 82 S.Ct. 394, 7 L.Ed.2d 386 (1962); Mitchell v. Mercer Water Co., 208 F.2d 900 (3 Cir. 1953), aff\u2019g Durkin v. Mercer Water Co., D. C., 112 F.Supp. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In deciding whether the employees of Sloan are covered by the Act, the critical issue is whether the fact that the gas is first sold to an independent \u201cmiddleman\u201d (Peoples) and then resold to the steel companies sufficiently \u201cinsulates\u201d Sloan from the production of goods; so that the activities of its employees do not meet the \u201cclosely related\u201d and \u201cdirectly essential to\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Since the Supreme Court has ruled that in applying the Act \u201cwe focus on the activities of the employees and not on the business of the employer,\u201d Mitchell v. Lublin, McGaughy &amp; Assoc., 358 U.S. 207, 211, 213, 79 S.Ct. 260, 264, 3 L.Ed.2d 243 (1959), the nature of the work done by the employees here involved and its direct relation to the production of gas is critical. The District Court found that employees Schweinsburg, Shaffer, Osloskey and Creighton regularly, on an hourly basis, checked and recorded the readings on various metering gauges on Sloan\u2019s pumps and performed routine maintenance services on the machinery, specifically the adding of oil to the pump engines. These activities consumed only a small portion of each work-hour of the employees; but they were performed on a regular and recurring basis. The regularity of these gas-producing activities was viewed as a key factor by the District Court, and it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201c * * * in my opinion the de minimis doctrine does not apply to regular and recurring work, and such need not be substantial timewise.\u201d (citing Wirtz v. Durham Sandwich Company, 367 F. 2d 810 (4 Cir. 1966).) 285 F.Supp. at 672.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The remainder of the employees\u2019 working time was spent on various tasks connected with the operation of a pine tree nursery and a hothouse owned by Sloan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Sloan contends we are bound by this Court\u2019s decision in Kaferle v. Frederick, 360 F.2d 536 (3 Cir. 1966), to conclude that the five employees here in question are not covered by the Act. In <em>Kaferle, </em>suit was brought by four employees to recover amounts alleged to be due them as employees covered by the Act. There, the defendant employer was engaged in the mining of coal within the state of Pennsylvania. All the coal was sold by the defendant to customers within the state, resulting in total sales of $288,725.-46 during the relevant period. Of this amount, $2,300 of the sales was to a coal broker, Pape, who, in turn, sold coal to two industrial concerns in Pennsylvania which used it as fuel in the production of goods for interstate commerce. It was contended by plaintiff-employees that, as a result of the indirect sales to producers of goods for interstate commerce, they were \u201cengaged in a \u2018fringe\u2019 occupation which is closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for interstate commerce.\u201d 360 F.2d at 538. This court held that there was no coverage under the Act, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201c * * [i]f, in fact, any of appellant\u2019s [employer\u2019s] coal reached [the producers of goods for interstate commerce], it had to pass through an intermediary, namely, Pape. This alone defeats the requirements that such work must be \u2018closely related\u2019 and \u2018directly essential\u2019, especially since the sales were isolated and insubstantial.\u201d 360 F.2d at 538-539.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Sloan contends that Peoples is the \u201cmiddleman\u201d counterpart in the instant case of the coal broker in <em>Kaferle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">We are of the opinion that <em>Kaferle </em>is inapposite here. There, only an \u201cinsubstantial\u201d part, less than one percent of the coal was sold to the middleman broker and these sales were \u201cisolated\u201d, viz., made on a non-recurring basis. There is no indication that a large part of the broker\u2019s sales was to the concerned two producers for interstate commerce. In <em>Kaferle, </em>the connection between the employees\u2019 activity and interstate commerce was tenuous indeed. In sum, it was not the mere presence of an intermediary, but, rather, that factor coupled with the \u201cisolated and insubstantial\u201d nature of the sales connected with interstate commerce which resulted in the holding in <em>Kaferle </em>that that the Act did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The factual situation here is quite different. The <em>entire </em>output of these wells was sold to Peoples on a <em>regular </em>basis and under a contract(s) which bound Sloan not to sell to anyone else. A <em>large </em>percentage of Peoples\u2019 gas was sold to the producers for interstate commerce, and <em>almost all </em>of this gas was utilized in producing those goods, <em>most </em>of which regularly moved into interstate commerce. The sales in this connection were not \u201cisolated and insubstantial\u201d, but regular and recurring and accounted for the <em>totality </em>of Sloan\u2019s income from gas production.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">In Mitchell v. Jaffe, 261 F.2d 883 (5 Cir. 1958) it was held that four employees engaged by defendant-employer in the stripping of salable parts from wrecked automobiles and the handling of the scrap metal residue were covered by the Act when that scrap was sold by defendant to an independant intermediary who, in turn, resold this scrap to local steel mills which used it in the production of goods for interstate commerce. The sales to the intermediary constituted only a minimal percentage of defendant\u2019s gross receipts, but the court considered this point immaterial. It focused on the fact that \u201cthe scrap moved to [the intermediary] as a regular non-sporadic part of the Employer\u2019s general operation of its business * * and declared that \u201c * * * it matters not that the annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>tonnage (100 tons) was slight, or that in dollars it was but 1.67% of the Employer\u2019s annual volume of sales.\u201d 261 F.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s holding at 285 F.Supp. 673 that \u201cUnder the facts disclosed, * * * it is immaterial that defendant sold its gas to Peoples instead of directly to the steel mills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In D. A. Schulte, Inc. v. Gangi, supra, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cMere separation of the economic processes of production for commerce between different industrial units, <em>even without any degree of common ownership, </em>does not destroy the continuity of production for commerce. Producers may be held to know the usual routes for distribution of their products.\u201d 328 U.S. 121, 66 S.Ct. 931. (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">There remains Sloan\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in ruling that Sloan could not, seven months after trial, for the first time, claim the exemption for forestry operations provided by Section 13(a) (15) of the Act (29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (15)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.) The contention is without merit. Systems Incorporated v. Bridge Electronics Company, 335 F.2d 465, 466 (3 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Moreover, we cannot say that the District Court erred in its holding that \u201c * * even if we assume that the affirmative defense has been raised properly, the evidence brought out on cross-examination was insufficient to prove that defendant\u2019s employees were exempt under the operative specifications of section 13 (a) (15)\u201d, and, \u201cThe defendant failed to sustain its burden in this respect.\u201d (285 F.Supp. 675).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">. Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint also alleged a violation of the record-keeping provisions of \u00a7 211(c) and 215(a) (5) of the Act and 29 CFR 516, promulgated under the authority of the Act, as to all five of the employees involved. During the course of the proceedings, records were produced by defendant as to the hours worked by all of these employees with the exception of Hugh Torrance. Consequently, the charges as to record-keeping with respect to these individuals were dropped. Employee Torrance died on August 22, 1966, before the entry of the Order of Judge Marsh, making it unnecessary for the Order to contain any prohibition against further failure by defendant to keep records of this employee\u2019s activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-12\">. By pre-trial Stipulation of the parties, part III (G), the five employees concerned are: William J. Creighton, Andrew Oslos-key, Robert Schweinsburg, Harry C. Shaffer, and Hugh Torrance. Terry Baughman included in the original Complaint, was dropped from consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-24\">. Prior to the amendment of the Act in 1949 (63 Stat. 910, 911) this section read: \u201c * * * if such employee was employed in * * * any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof, * * It is generally acknowledged that the purpose of the amendment was to restrict the scope of coverage of the Act as to \u201cfringe\u201d activities and to make it clear that the Act was not intended to reach as far as the constitutional limits of Congress\u2019 commerce power. Mitchell v. H. B. Zachry Co., 362 U.S. 310, 312-313, 80 S.Ct. 739, 4 R.Ed. 2d 753 (1960); Kaferle v. Frederick, 360 F.2d 536, 538 (3 Cir. 1966); Mitchell v. Jaffe, 261 F.2d 883, 886 (5 Cir. 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b145-29\">. The Complaint was filed December 13, 1966. The parties have agreed by Stipulation, part III(K), that the two-year statute of limitations of 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 217, 255 shall be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-5\">. For the above work, these four employees were paid $1.00 per hour with no additional pay for overtime work, at a time when the Act prescribed a minimum regular wage of $1.25 per hour with 1% pay for work in excess of forty hours per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>week. 29 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 206(a) (1), as amended 1961, Pub.L. 87-30, \u00a7 5(a) (2), 75 Stat. 65, and \u00a7 207(a) (1). The court also found that Hugh Torrance, the fifth employee in question, acted as the foreman or supervisor of the other employees mentioned and that he was paid for this a salary of $425 per month, an amount which fell below minimum wage levels when his normal work-hours per week were considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b148-10\">. The exemption provision was amended and redesignated as Section 13(a) (13) by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966 (80 Stat. 830), which became effective February 1, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
