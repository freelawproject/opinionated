No hearing was held by the district court. The record of the state trial was not an exhibit below, and is therefore not before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">Appellant raises some twelve substantive grounds on this appeal, at least one of which relates to a codefendant, and asks for an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on another point. We do not reach the merits, but remand on procedural grounds alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">A federal court may accept the determination of a state court as to constitutional rights, but only after reviewing the state proceedings to ascertain that all federal standards have been met. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) sets general guidelines for such a review. See also Wright v. Dickson, 336 F.2d 878, 881 (9th Cir. 1964); Pike v. Dickson, 323 F.2d 856, 859 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-23\">The district court here recognized in its Memorandum of Decision that it did not consider or have available <em>the full record </em>of the trial in the state court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-24\">\u201cThe proceeding for habeas corpus relief is before this court upon the petition, respondent\u2019s return, petitioner\u2019s traverse, supplementary traverse <em>and the transcript of the trial proceedings as cited by petitioner and by the California District Court of Appeal, </em>Second Appellate District, No. 9963 in its opinion * * * affirming the judgment of conviction.\u201d (C.T. 158. Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">The district court was required to examine the entire record to determine if \u201ca full and fair state evidentiary hearing [resulted] in reliable findings.\u201d If so, it should ordinarily accept the facts</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>found in the hearing. <em>Townsend, supra, </em>p. 318, 83 S.Ct. p. 760. Petitioner\u2019s constitutional grounds depend primarily on fact-finding decisions: for example, his unlawful search and seizure claim and his Henry v. Mississippi (379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965)) waiver point. The district court is required to itself apply, independently, the applicable federal law to the state court fact findings. <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 318, 83 S.Ct. p. 759. The district court could not do this without the essential, and preferably the whole, state court record before it (assuming such record, or \u2014 in the words of Townsend v. Sain \u2014 \u201csome adequate substitute, such as a narrative record,\u201d is available). <em>Id. </em>at 319, 83 S.Ct. p. 760. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (d), and its legislative history. Pub.L. 89-711, \u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">We reverse and remand for further proceedings consonant with this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
