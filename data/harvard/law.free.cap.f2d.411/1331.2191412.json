Moreover, the board specifically found that \u201c[i]n light of the record presented, there can be no doubt that the mark \u2018METRECAL\u2019 is extremely well-known in the dietary food field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-17\">The board also found \u201cthat applicant has test-marketed a regular margarine, a low calorie margarine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and an artificial sweetener<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under the mark \u2018MAGI-CAL\u2019.\u201d The board further noted that \u201c[a]pplieant has introduced * * * thirty-six third party registrations which contain \u2018CAL\u2019 as a suffix portion of the mark for a wide variety of foods and beverages, several of which are of the dietary or low-calorie type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-18\">In dismissing the opposition, the board held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-19\">Opposers\u2019 dietary foods and [applicant\u2019s] margarine, particularly a low-calorie margarine, are obviously closely related in that they are both food products which are sold through the same trade channels to the same class of purchasers. * * * On the other hand, it is our considered opinion that the marks \u201cMAGI-CAL\u201d and \u201cMETRE-CAL\u201d are sufficiently different so as to obviate any likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>of confusion or mistake. In this regard, the marks are distinguishable in both sound and appearance and are entirely different in significance. In the event that opposer\u2019s mark \u201cMETRECAL\u201d conveys any meaning at all, it would probably be that of measured calories, while the mark \u201cMAGI-CAL\u201d is an obvious play on the word \u201cmagical\u201d, even though its suffix may also connote \u201ccalorie\u201d. * * * While we agree that the notoriety of the mark [METRECAL] is a factor to be considered, it does not alter our conclusion where, as here, there is no element of doubt in our minds that the marks of the parties are readily distinguishable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">We agree with the board\u2019s decision and are not convinced of any reversible error therein. Appellant has not urged that the board failed to consider any relevant factor; it merely disagrees with the board\u2019s conclusion that, based on all the facts and circumstances including the respective goods, and viewing the marks in their entireties, there would be no likelihood of confusion or mistake. We, as did the board, agree with appellant that :</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">1. The goods of the parties are closely related;</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">2. Third party registrations neither disprove that the suffix CAL is suggestive in nature nor disprove that CAL is the dominant portion of the mark; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-9\">3. Any doubt in the present case as to likelihood of confusion should be resolved against applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">However, we are not convinced of reversible error in the board\u2019s ultimate holding that the differences in the appearance, sound and meaning of the parties\u2019 marks, when viewed in their entireties and when applied to their respective goods, obviate any likelihood of confusion or mistake. Accordingly, the board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">.
