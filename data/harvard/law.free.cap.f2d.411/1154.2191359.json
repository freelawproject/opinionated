No. 79, 67 L.R.R.M. 1270 (1968). A common issue in each case is whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support a conclusion of the National Labor Relations Board that a single employee was discharged for union activities in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-24\">The general principles governing the Board and reviewing courts in discharge cases have been stated and restated by the Supreme Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It would serve no useful purpose to repeat them here. It is often difficult, however, to apply the principles to such cases as this where there is some evidence tending to show that the employee\u2019s discharge was motivated by his union activities and other evidence tending to show that his discharge was unrelated to his union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Judge Blackmun commented on the difficulties in N.L.R.B. v. Byrds Manufacturing Corporation, 324 F.2d 329, 332-333 (8th Cir. 1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-6\">\u201c * * * These discharge issues are difficult and sensitive when termination coincides with union activity. The employee and the Board present plausible cause for continued employment \u2014 a good record, superior comparative production, recent change in assignment, lack of individual warning, and the <em>like </em>\u2014 and <em>would tie Ms discharge solely to union sympathy or activity known to the employer. </em>Management in turn presents equally plausible cause for the discharge\u2014 under-production, production not in line with ability, troublemaking, attitude, undesirable effect on fellow employees, similar contemporaneous discharges of non-union employees, and the <em>like, </em>\u2014 and <em>would tie the discharge to time-honored and accepted management prerogatives wholly unrelated to union activity or sympathy </em>* * *. The trier of fact must choose between these two. Again its decision, although always outrageous to the losing party and hard for it to accept, is, if supported by an adequate evidentiary basis, not to be retried by this court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">The language used by Courts of Appeals in determining whether a discharge is violative of the Act varies from case to case. This is particularly true in cases where an employer is obviously moved by valid as well as discriminatory motives. In Philadelphia Moving Picture Mach. Op. U. Local No. 307 IATSE v. N.L.R.B., 382 F.2d 598 (3rd Cir. 1967), the Court stated at p. 600:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiAO\">\u201c* * * [A]n employer commits an unfair labor practice <em>when he dismisses an employee partly on valid grounds and partly for a cause unlawful under the Act. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACUQ\">In Betts Baking Co. v. N.L.R.B., 380 F. 2d 199, 203 (10th Cir. 1967), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-11\">\u201c * * * It seems settled, however, that <em>the Act may be violated if union discrimination is but a partial motive for the discharge * </em>* * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">In N.L.R.B. v. West Side Carpet Cleaning Co., 329 F.2d 758 (6th Cir. 1964), the Court stated at p. 761:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-15\">\u201c * * * <em>Even though part of the motivation for Weber\u2019s discharge might have been a needed cutting of expenses, such circumstance could not be legally used to effectuate a companion motive to rid the company of a union protagonist. * </em>* * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-18\">In N.L.R.B. v. Symons Manufacturing Co., 328 F.2d 835 (7th Cir. 1964), at p. 837, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-19\"><em>\u201cThe </em>mere <em>existence of valid grounds for a discharge is no defense to a charge that the discharge was unlawful, unless the discharge was predicated solely on those grounds, </em>and not by a desire to discourage union activity. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) Accord, Sunshine Biscuits, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 274 F.2d 738, 742 (7th Cir. 1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aao-dedup-0\">And, in N.L.R.B. v. Great Eastern Color Lithographic Corp., 309 F.2d 352 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 950, 83 S.Ct. 1680, 10 L.Ed.2d 705 (1963), the Court stated at p. 355:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-20\">\u201c* * * [E]ven though the discharges may have been based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>other reasons as well, <em>if the employer was partly motivated by union activity, </em>the discharges were violative of the Act. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">This Court has also expressed itself in a variety of ways in similar situations. For example, in Cupples Co. Manufacturers v. National Labor R. Board, 106 F.2d 100 (8th Cir. 1939), the Court stated at p. 117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-5\">\u201c * * * It seems probable that [the employee\u2019s] joining the union was at least <em>a contributing cayse of his discharge.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">In Kansas City Power &amp; L. Co. v. National Labor R. Board, 111 F.2d 340 (8th Cir. 1940), at p. 348, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-7\">\u201c * * * [T]he real inquiry here is whether the transfer was simply for work purposes or whether the purpose <em>or one purpose </em>was so to interfere or so to discipline.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj6\">In Mitchell v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, 278 F.2d 562 (8th Cir. 1960), the Court stated at p. 565:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-8\">\u201c * * * Plainly, all that had occurred was that [the employer] had just learned of Cole\u2019s complaint to the Wage &amp; Hour authorities. <em>Whether this fact alone motivated [the employer] at that time or whether it was, as defendant\u2019s counsel suggested, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, the unavoidable inference is that [the employer\u2019s] action was prompted by knowledge of Cole\u2019s complaint. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">In Marshfield Steel Company v. N.L. R.B., 324 F.2d 333, 337 (8th Cir. 1963), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-11\">\u201c \u2018 * * * A justifiable ground for dismissal is no defense if it is a pretext and not the moving cause.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-16\">* * * \u25a0Jr \u25a0X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANiG\">\u201c \u2018 * * * Although the discharge of an inefficient or insubordinate union member or organizer is lawful it may become discriminatory if other circumstances reasonably indicate that <em>the union activity weighed more heavily in the decision to fire him than did dissatisfaction with his performance.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">And, in Farmbest, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 370 F.2d 1015 (8th Cir. 1967), the Court stated at p. 1019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-19\">\u201c * * * [T]here is no record evidence that the discharge of [the employee] * * * was <em>motivated in any degree </em>by [the employee\u2019s] union activities. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-20\">The emphasis appears to vary from case to case. Thus, in <em>Cupples, </em>we spoke of \u201ca contributing cause;\u201d in <em>Kansas City Power, </em>we used the test of \u201cone purpose;\u201d in <em>Mitchell, </em>we spoke of \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back;\u201d in <em>Farmbest, </em>we used the term \u201cmotivated in any degree;\u201d and in <em>Marshfield, </em>we suggested that the Board has the responsibility of determining whether \u201cthe union activity weighed more heavily in the decision to fire him than did dissatisfaction with his performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-21\">Despite the differences in terminology and emphasis, the cited cases require that there be substantial evidence indicating that the employee, but for his union activities, would not have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-22\">While <em>Symons </em>can be read as permitting the Board to find a discriminatory discharge if there is <em>any </em>evidence in the record to support such a finding <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and while <em>Marshfield </em>can be read as requiring that there be a \u201ccalculus of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>values\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or more than substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support such a finding, the opinions read in their entirety do not sustain these interpretations. We would add that either interpretation would be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">At the risk of further complicating an already confused area, we restate what we consider to be the appropriate standards to be followed by Trial Examiners and the Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">(1) The General Counsel has the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the employee was discharged for his union activities or membership \u2014 that but for his union activities or membership, he would not have been discharged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-18\">(2) This burden can be satisfied by direct or circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-19\">(8) The Board, in reaching its decision, is permitted to draw reasonable inferences,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to choose between fairly conflicting views of the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It cannot rely on \u201csuspicion, surmise, implications, or plainly incredible evidence.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 484, 71 S.Ct. 456, 462, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-20\">If the Board follows these standards, we, as a reviewing court, have no alternative but to affirm its decision. If it fails to follow them, we must reverse.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> With these principles in mind, we turn to a consideration of whether the Board correctly decided that Theodore Foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>was discharged because of his \u201czealous efforts as a union steward and to dim the ardor of any steward who might succeed him.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Foster was hired by Mead as an operating engineer in the late summer of 1966. Mead was a party to a collective bargaining agreement with various building trade unions, including the Operating Engineers\u2019 of which Foster was a member. The agreement gave Mead broad authority to discharge unsatisfactory employees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Foster was assigned to operate the hoist. As he was the first operating engineer on the project, he was designated as a union steward. He was competent and efficient in operating and maintaining the hoist. He raised numerous grievances during the time that he was employed \u2014 the most important ones being: that Mead failed to take required safety measures with respect to the hoisting operation; that the hoist was in poor mechanical condition; that a number of employees had not been paid for show-up time in accordance with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between Mead and the Union; that the Company was violating the collective bargaining agreement by not having operating engineers man heaters (submitted in December, 1966); and that members of other unions were doing operating engineer\u2019s work (submitted January 22, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">The grievances were satisfactorily resolved by conferences between Mead and the business agent of the Operating Engineers\u2019 Local or by direct action on Mead\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">The hoist operated by Foster was the center of activity and controversy. The general contractor and the various subcontractors were all interested in having their materials hoisted without interruption. Foster frequently left the shack, in which the controls were located, to regulate traffic at the lift and to determine whether the lift was safely loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">Mead contends that it instructed Foster to remain at the controls in the shack except on those occasions when he visually observed that the lift had been improperly loaded. It further contends that it had instructed Foster that it was not his function to determine who was to have the priority use of the lift nor to supervise its loading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">Foster concedes that he was so instructed, but contends that he only left the shack when it was necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">There is no evidence indicating that Foster spent any significant time away from the immediate area of the hoist in performing his duties as a steward, or that the Company objected to the time that he did spend in so doing. It appears that most of the information as to grievances was readily available to Foster without his leaving the \u201cshack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-13\">The Examiner gave great weight to the testimony of Headley, a non-supervisory employee, and to testimony of Pike, the supervisor, who discharged Foster.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">Headley testified that Pike told him that he was going to fire Foster if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>didn\u2019t stay in the shack because he was always going around the job with his nose in everybody else\u2019s business. Headley added that he told Pike that this was part of Foster\u2019s responsibility as a union steward, and that Pike replied that Foster goes by the rule book an awful lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">That Mead believed that Foster constantly exceeded his authority, that he was loud, and that he spent too much time out of the operating shack is clear from the record. That Mead could have discharged him for these reasons without violating the Act is equally clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">That Foster took his duties as a union steward seriously is apparent from the record, and that he had a right to do so is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">What is not clear is whether there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the Examiner\u2019s finding, adopted by the Board, that the employer was motivated, at least in part, by Foster\u2019s activities as a union steward to discharge him. The Examiner\u2019s reliance on <em>Symons </em>and <em>Sunshine Biscuits </em>does nothing to relieve our anxiety on this score. Nor is our confidence in the Examiner\u2019s report increased by his discussion of the evidence. It leaves us with the impression that he was as concerned with the fairness of the employer\u2019s action as he was with its unlawfulness under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">Considering the record as a whole, we cannot find the substantial evidence necessary to justify the Board's decision. The employer had a collective bargaining agreement with the Union; there is no evidence of Union animus or of collusion between the Union and the employer; all grievances brought to the employer\u2019s attention by Foster were promptly taken care of; a Union man replaced Foster; and, another union steward was appointed to fill his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">We are convinced that Foster would have been discharged even if he had not vigorously enforced the collective bargaining agreement. We are also convinced that he would not have been discharged had the employer\u2019s only complaint been the vigor with which he pursued his duties as a union steward. A reading of the record convinces us that the employer\u2019s real complaint was that Foster was an unsatisfactory employee because he insisted on telling everyone what to do and how to do it. In our view, Mead discharged Foster because it considered him to be an unsatisfactory employee. Whether he was an unsatisfactory employee is not for this Court to decide.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">The decision of the Board is reversed. Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1242-13\">. The other cases are: Ames Ready-Mix Concrete, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 411 F.2d 1159 (8th Cir. 1969); N.
