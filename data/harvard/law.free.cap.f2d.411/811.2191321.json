The district court summarily denied and dismissed the petition, noting that such issue had been presented to the Colorado Supreme Court and had been decided adversely to the claims of petitioner. Stilley v. People, 160 Colo. 329, 417 P.2d 494. The opinion of the Colorado court and petitioner\u2019s application for a writ constitute the entire record in this case and thus present the identical issue and error considered in Maes v. Patterson, 10 Cir., 401 F.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case remanded for further consideration in view of <em>Maes. Cf. </em>Maxwell v. Turner, 10 Cir., 411 F.2d 805, and related eases this day decided.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
