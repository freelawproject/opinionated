After a pretrial conference the defendant moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted on the basis of the depositions of the defendant\u2019s crew, whose testimony the plaintiff had taken. The Court indicated that there was no evidence from which defendant could have been found negligent because there was no evidence that it would have been possible to avoid the collision even if the brakes had been applied immediately after the automobile became visible to the crew as the train came forward along the curve. The Court then went on to declare that the wife-plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-31\">In view of the severity of the wife-plaintiff\u2019s injury and the unusual circumstance that summary judgment was entered against the plaintiffs on the basis of the depositions of the defendant\u2019s crew,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we have carefully combed the record for any evidence from which a fact finder could determine that the defendant was negligent. There is no such evidence. Unfortunately for plaintiffs, they had no evidence other than testimony of the members of the railroad crew. The evidence affords no basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>a conclusion that the train could have been stopped in the time available from the moment when the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile first came into view and the time of the actual impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">In these circumstances it is unnecessary to consider the question of the wife-plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence in the light of the presumption of her due care which results from her inability to recall any of the circumstances of the accident. See Kmetz v. Lochiatto, 421 Pa. 363, 219 A.2d 588 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">The judgment of the District Court therefore will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1103-21\">.
