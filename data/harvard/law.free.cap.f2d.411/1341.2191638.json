As described both in that patent and in the application, those greases comprise hydrocarbon oils of lubricating viscosity combined with certain complex aluminum soaps as thickeners, the soaps having \u201cat least two dissimilar substantially hydrocarbonaceous organic anions * * Both anions are generally oleophilic but one, derived from long chain fatty carboxylic acids containing 8 to 30 carbon atoms (stearic acid, for example), is more soluble in the oil than the other which is derived from an aromatic carboxylic acid, such as benzoic acid. According to the specification, a problem existed with respect to those prior-art greases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-21\">It is found, however, <em>that after long periods of time, particularly at elevated temperatures, the grease begins to liquefy. </em>In attempting to stabilize the grease, many of the known commercial stabilizing agents are found to be ineffective or have detrimental side effects, particularly in the presence of common additives, such as the filler, zinc oxide, or the common rust inhibitor, sodium nitrate. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-22\">To solve the liquefaction or grease break-, down problem and \u201cto provide a composition with enhanced stability at elevated temperatures,\u201d appellant has added to those greases, according to the present invention, 0.1 to 20 per cent by weight of lithium, sodium, or potassium salts of certain aromatic carboxylic acids \u2014 the sodium salt of benzoic acid, for example, the preferred additive. In Table I of his specification, appellant presents comparative results of a \u201cThin Film Life Test\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conducted at 250\u00b0F. on various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>complex aluminum carboxylate greases to which 0%, 1% or 5% by weight sodium benzoate has been added. The \u201cThin Film Life\u201d of those greases was in the range of 24-48 hours with no additive, 120 hours with 1% additive, and 168-1128 hours with 5% additive, varying with different grease compositions. Appellant further states, apparently justifiably;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-4\">It is evident from the above table that a great extension of useful life is obtained by the addition of sodium benzoate \u2014 as exemplary of alkali metal aroates \u2014 to the aluminum complex greases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">Claim 1 is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-10\">1.

anion aluminum soaps- \u2014 aluminum benzoate stearate, for example \u2014 are useful as thickeners in making grease from lubricating oils. According to the Hot-ten patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-24\">The complex aluminum soaps are particularly useful in greases. These soaps impart to the grease composition high melting point and resistance to emulsification in water, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>Ricketts discloses grease compositions comprising a lubricating oil, a sodium fatty acid soap \u201cwith which other alkali metal or other metal soaps may or may not be incorporated,\u201d and \u201ca small quantity of a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring.\u201d Exemplary of the metal salts used as additives are sodium benzoate and aluminum benzoate, among others named. According to Ricketts, the objects he achieves by his additives are the production of a grease having a higher melting point than conventional mineral oil soda soap greases, concomitantly (1) \u201cproducing a lubricant which is suitable for use at high temperatures,\u201d (2) \u201cpreventing or reducing leakage of the lubricant from the bearings at high temperatures,\u201d (3 \u201cimproving the stability of the grease at normal and at high temperatures,\u201d and (4) improving \u201cthe stability of such a grease, as indicated by freedom from granulation, by absence of any tendency to \u2018bleed\u2019 or separate either during manufacture or later in storage, and by resistance to breakdown from mechanical stirring or beating.\u201d In various examples, a soda soap grease containing sodium benzoate evinced \u201cno bleeding\u201d as a result of heat treatment at 300-500\u00b0F. for 24 hours, at 200-250 \u00b0F. for 72 hours, or upon \u201cstorage after heating for several months\u201d; such a grease also \u201cassumes mineral oil fluidity at considerably higher temperatures\u201d than a grease not containing sodium benzoate. Upon completion of a bearing test for 20 minutes at 150\u00b0F., the sodium benzoate-containing grease \u201cremained unchanged in appearance and structure\u201d with \u201cno evidence of breakdown or of separation of oil and soap.\u201d In a similar test for 30 minutes, applying heat to a maximum of 450\u00b0 F., \u201c[s]imilar results were obtained, save that between 240 and 400\u00b0F. streamers of grease made their appearance above the plane of the bearing; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">It is unnecessary to discuss Licata\u2019s disclosure beyond noting how the examiner employed it in the following restatement of his rejection in his Answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-6\">Claims 1-6 are rejected as unpat-entable over Hotten in view of Rick-etts and Licata (35 U.S.C. 103). Hot-ten shows the instantly claimed complex aluminum soap greases to be old in the art. Ricketts shows soda soap greases of improved stability against leakage of the lubricant from the bearings at high temperatures. A small quantity of a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring is incorporated into the grease to improve stabilities. Samples [Examples?] of both light and heavy metals [which] may be employed [are given]. Examples of suitable salts are sodium and potassium benzoate. Licata shows aluminum-base greases and aluminum soaps of saturated higher fatty acids that are highly stable, in storage and use, against any separation or syneresis by incorporating into the greases a lithium soap of a fatty acid. Hence, it would be obvious to improve the stability of the old greases of the primary reference with the known grease stabilizers of Ricketts and especially in light of <em>Licata\u2019s teaching that the metals may be different in the stabilizers and the greases. </em>Regardless of the differences in the greases, one would expect somewhat similar problems of instability and how to improve the stability is obviously within the prior art teachings and the skill of the art. Moreover, in following the teachings of Ricketts and Licata appellant has solved the same problems for complex aluminum greases as for aluminum-based and soda soap greases * * *. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">Evidently, the examiner further thought the general problem of \u201cstability\u201d and the particular problem of liquefaction to be common to soda soap and complex aluminum soap greases, for he also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-9\">Appellant\u2019s problem is one of liquefaction at elevated temperatures <em>which is a problem solved by Ricketts at high </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number><em>temperatures by preventing leakage </em>of the lubricant and other instabilities of the grease. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">The board agreed. The essence, of its opinion is in the following passage from its opinion, summarizing the rejection with which it agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aam-dedup-1\">It appears to be the Examiner\u2019s position that since the Ricketts patent shows the addition of sodium benzoate to <em>sodium </em>soap greases to stabilize them at both normal and high temperatures, and particularly against bleeding, it would have been obvious to add this compound to the <em>aluminum </em>soap greases of Hotten for the production of the <em>same </em>results. He considers this conclusion to be further supported by Licata who shows the occurrence of the <em>same bleeding </em>or syneresis problem with certain aluminum soap greases and its solution by the addition of a lithium soap of a fatty acid. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">We agree with appellant that the examiner and board erred in failing to appreciate the specific stability problem appellant encountered with his particular complex aluminum soap grease. True, Ricketts does disclose that sodium and other metal benzoates are effective to solve certain stability problems present in <em>soda </em>soap grease. The examiner especially relied on Ricketts\u2019 disclosure that adding sodium benzoate to a soda soap grease prevented leakage of lubricant from bearings at high temperatures, equating such leakage with liquefaction. The board, in turn, seems to have placed some reliance on Ricketts\u2019 disclosure that <em>\u2018\u2018\u2018bleeding\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>during storage at normal or high temperatures is reduced by adding sodium benzoate to the soda soap grease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-15\">Appellant, however, has convinced us that the particular stability - problems solved by Ricketts with respect to soda soap grease are of a different nature than the \u201cliquefaction\u201d problem he faced with his complex aluminum soap greases. We think appellant is correct in pointing out that Ricketts\u2019 observation of no leakage of his grease from a bearing during a test carried out for a period of but 20-30 minutes is no indication at all of the long-term stability of complex aluminum soap grease against liquefaction of the grease sought and achieved by appellant, and certainly would not suggest that the effective life of a complex aluminum soap grease could be increased from about 1-2 days to 7-47 days by adding sodium benzoate to that grease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-16\">With respect to the board\u2019s reliance on the reduction in bleeding during heating or storage disclosed by Ricketts for his sodium benzoate stabilized soda soap grease, the problem of \u201cbleeding\u201d or \u201csyneresis,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> too, appears different from the problem of liquefaction. As we understand it from the references in this grease art, \u201cbleeding\u201d or \u201csyneresis\u201d involves <em>leakage </em>or separation of some liquid lubricant out of the solid, soap-thickened grease structure without total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>breakdown of the grease. On the other hand, \u201cliquefaction,\u201d as the expression itself implies, appears to involve liquefying of the entire grease structure over an extended period of time. Moreover, appellant quotes from another of his own prior patents, No. 2,768,138 referred to in his specification, passages showing that his complex aluminum soap grease starting material already has a reduced tendency to \u201cbleed.\u201d Appellant argues, correctly we think, that one of ordinary skill in the art would regard the problems of \u201cbleeding\u201d and \u201cliquefaction\u201d as different and would have no occasion to add Ricketts\u2019 sodium benzoate to the complex aluminum benzoate-stearate grease of Hotten to solve a nearly nonexistent problem of bleeding in that grease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-5\">In short, we find no suggestion in Ricketts, or elsewhere in the record, that sodium benzoate would solve the problem of liquefaction of complex aluminum soap greases which occurs after relatively long periods at elevated temperatures. We think the claimed invention is un-obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1429-18\">. While the nature of the \u201cThin Film Life Test\u201d is not entirely clear from the specification, appellant explained it in the following terms in his brief before the hoard:</p>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-2\">In order to demonstrate the effort of the sodium benzoate on the complex aluminum greases, the thin film life of the greases at 250\u00b0 F. with and without the alkali metal aroate was determined. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>Without other additives, the lifetime went from 24 hours to 300 hours. In tlie presence of other additives, the lifetime went from 48 hours to 1,128 hours. The test is carried out by heating a thin film of grease at a constant temperature until the grease structure is lost. During the test, the grease is subjected to evaporation, degradation and oxidation. Whatever effect the alkali metal aroate has, it greatly extends the lifetime of the grease structure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">. It is interesting to note that every one of Ricketts\u2019 14 claims is directed to the use of his additive \u201cto prevent bleeding,\u201d no other result being mentioned in the claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1432-8\">. Appellant\u2019s brief gives us the following definition of \u201csyneresis\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-9\">Loss of liquid lubricant from a lubricating grease due to shrinkage or rearrangement of the structure. The shrinkage may be due to either physical or chemical changes in the thickener. Syneresis is a form of BLEEDING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-10\">He also defined \u201cbleeding\u201d thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-11\">The separation of liquid lubricant from a lubricating grease for any cause.
