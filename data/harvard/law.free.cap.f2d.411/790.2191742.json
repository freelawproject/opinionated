Clark is a California prisoner, convicted of robbery. At his trial, he did not take the stand. The prosecutor commented briefly on Clark\u2019s failure to testify, telling the jury that they would receive an instruction on the subject. The court gave CAL JIC instruction 5L The comment and instruction violated the ruling in Griffin v. California, 1965, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, which was decided after Clark was tried. The conviction was affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>On petition for habeas corpus, the District Judge granted the writ and the Warden appealed. We vacated and remanded for reconsideration in the light of Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Nelson v. Clark, 9 Cir., 1968, 388 F.2d 985. The District Judge has now reconsidered, and has again ordered that the writ issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The judge concluded that \u201cit cannot be said * * * beyond a reasonable doubt * * * that [the] * * * error did not influence the jury and affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d We agree. One witness against Clark was the victim. His identification of Clark, while stated positively, leaves much to be desired. The other, and in many respects the key witness against Clark, was characterized by the California District Court of Appeal, in Clark\u2019s appeal to it (unpublished), as \u201ca scorned and perjurious woman\u201d. She testified that Clark told her that he had participated in the robbery and described the clothes that he said that he was wearing during the robbery. If believed, her testimony would have been sufficient to convict. In the minds of the jury it could also have been thought to corroborate the victim\u2019s identification of Clark. The jury could well have felt, in the light of the comment and the instruction, that Clark\u2019s failure to deny or explain the woman\u2019s testimony about him lent it credibility that it would not otherwise merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">.
