The facts are stated in a memorandum opinion of the district judge reported at 289 F.Supp. 832 (E.D.Mieh.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-20\">The question on appeal is whether a statement of the bank examiner, who was attending a meeting of the bank\u2019s board of directors in his official capacity for the purpose of explaining his audit of the bank\u2019s affairs, was absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-21\">The appellee relies on Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959), as being conclusive on the point in issue. We are of the opinion that the factual situation here is stronger in favor of appellee than was presented in <em>Barr </em>where the Court held a Government official\u2019s statement to be absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-22\">We, therefore, affirm the judgment on the basis of the factual analysis of this case contained in the district judge\u2019s memorandum opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
