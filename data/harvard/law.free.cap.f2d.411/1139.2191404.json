In a jury trial he was acquitted on Count I and convicted on Counts II and III. A sentence of five years was imposed on each of the two counts, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Appellant urges as error (1) failure of his retained trial counsel to (a) rely upon the defense of entrapment and (b) offer instructions or object to those given; (2) failure of the trial court to (a) direct a verdict of acquittal on the ground that entrapment was established as a matter of law or (b) instruct the jury on entrapment; and (3) misconduct of the prosecutor in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">George Heard, a federal narcotics agent, testified that he first met appellant on October 24, 1967, when he went to appellant\u2019s home, following a telephone call in which an informant, Otis Warren, asked someone called \u201cLittle Brother\u201d if \u201che had the things they were talking about earlier\u201d and said that he had a friend who wanted to make a purchase. Upon arriving at appellant\u2019s apartment, Heard told appellant he had come to pick up the package Warren had called about. Appellant gave Heard five balloons containing a quantity of cocaine, for which Heard paid him $100.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">Heard testified further that he returned unannounced to appellant\u2019s apartment the following day, and appellant sold him another five balloons containing cocaine for $100. On this occasion appellant asked Heard if he liked the package he had purchased the previous day. He wrote his telephone number on a slip of paper and told Heard to identify himself as \u201cBig Man\u201d and ask for \u201cLittle Brother\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Heard made his third purchase on November 7, when he called from his office, identifying himself as \u201cBig Man\u201d and asking for \u201cLittle Brother\u201d. In this telephone conversation he discussed the possibility of purchasing an ounce of cocaine for $750. Chatman replied that he only had the \u201cusual amount\u201d in his possession, that he could get an ounce of cocaine, but would have to contact \u201chis people\u201d early in the morning to get such an amount. Calling back a few minutes later, Heard told appellant he could not afford the ounce but would \u201ctake the usual $100 worth\u201d. Heard then went again to appellant\u2019s apartment and purchased another five balloons containing cocaine for $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">On cross-examination Heard testified that informant Warren had previously worked for him and at the time he commenced such work there was a case pending against him. Warren was not called as a witness by either party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-12\">The substance in the various balloons was identified as cocaine by an expert chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-13\">Appellant testified that he had known Warren about eight months; that in October, 1967, Warren brought to appellant\u2019s home a package consisting of a plastic bag containing some balloons sealed together and asked appellant to keep the package for him, stating that he and his wife had had a quarrel; that about three days later, Warren called saying a \u201cguy would pick up a package and leave $100 for five balloons\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-14\">Thereafter, according to appellant, agent Heard, whom he had not seen before, came to appellant\u2019s apartment with Warren, who introduced appellant to Heard, and the exchange of money and the five balloons took place. Appellant testified further that on October 25 Warren left five more balloons, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>were picked up by Heard, and that Warren returned later and picked up the money. A similar procedure was followed on November 7, Warren supplying the balloons and receiving the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">According to appellant, the balloons were at all times closed, he observed no white powder, he had never used cocaine, had never sold balloons to anyone except Heard, and did not receive any of the money from the sales to Heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Appellant's trial counsel, an experienced attorney, relied upon the defense of appellant\u2019s lack of knowledge that he was consummating the sale of a narcotics drug rather than upon the defense of entrapment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant denied that he had committed the offense charged \u2014 not that he knowingly sold the cocaine, but was induced to make the sales by a Government agent. There is no substantial evidence that he was improperly induced to make the sales. On the contrary, the evidence of Agent Heard indicates that appellant acted .freely and voluntarily and \u201cwas ready and willing without persuasion * * * to commit the offense\u201d. United States v. McMillan, 2 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 810, 812, cert. denied 386 U.S. 909, 87 S.Ct. 856, 17 L.Ed.2d 783. The mere fact that a Government agent affords the opportunity and facilities for the commission of an offense does not in itself constitute entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">It is true of course that \u201ca failure to request an instruction on entrapment or a failure to object to its omission forecloses the right to object on appeal\u201d. Smith v. United States, 9 Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 401, 402. Under appellant\u2019s testimony and the theory on which the case was tried, there was no reason for appellant\u2019s trial counsel to request an instruction on entrapment. His failure to do so does not indicate inadequate or incompetent representation of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, it is clear that the defense of entrapment was not established as a matter of law and that the failure of the trial court to give an instruction on entrapment did not constitute plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">We find no error in the court\u2019s instructions. While counsel for defendant did not offer any special instructions, the instructions were discussed fully by court and counsel prior to argument, and the instructions given were fair to both parties and set forth the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-14\">Nor do we find support for appellant\u2019s contention that his retained trial counsel was \u201cgrossly inept\u201d in other respects. From an examination of the entire record we conclude that appellant was adequately and competently represented by his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\">Finally appellant claims prejudice in the comments of the prosecuting attorney in his summation to the jury. The challenged statements are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No objection was made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>the allegedly improper statements. They were made in the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument and answered by appellant\u2019s counsel. The court instructed the jury that \u201c * * * the statements and the arguments of counsel are not evidence * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Appellant argues that the remarks are prejudicial within the rule set forth in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314, where the Court said in part: \u201cThe United States Attorney * * * may prosecute with earnestness and vigor \u2014 indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones\u201d. The Court held that misconduct of a prosecutor which is \u201cpronounced and persistent\u201d, particularly in a weak case, affords ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Here there was no \u201cpronounced\u201d or \u201cpersistent\u201d misconduct as in Berger. While some of the remarks of counsel may have been injudicious, they do not constitute prejudicial misconduct. The \u201creliability of testimony is a matter for argument before the jury, and for the jury\u2019s ultimate determination\u201d. Phillips v. United States, 9 Cir. 1965, 356 F.2d 297, 309, cert. denied Walker v. United States, 384 U.S. 952, 86 S.Ct. 1573, 16 L.Ed.2d 548. The remarks of counsel were directed to the evidence in the case, and particularly to discrepancies and contradictions in appellant\u2019s own testimony, and were not based upon any personal knowledge of the attorney apart from the evidence. See Orebo v. United States, 9 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 747, 749, cert. denied 368 U.S. 958, 82 S.Ct. 402, 7 L.Ed.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-11\">Counsel\u2019s comment \u201cthat the drug traffic, in its every aspect, from start to finish, is an abomination\u201d was not prejudicial error. As this court said in Tenorio v. United States, 9 Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 96, 99, cert. denied 393 U.S. 874, 89 S.Ct. 169, 21 L.Ed.2d 145: \u201cCounsel are entitled to a reasonable degree of latitude in the presentation of argument\u201d and a comment of this nature contains \u201cnothing more than that which is within the common knowledge of all reasonable people\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">. Heard\u2019s testimony regarding the first call was partially contradicted by that of his fellow agent. The agent testified that he had maintained surveillance outside the apartment on October 24 and 25 and that on October 24 Heard was accompanied by the informant, Otis Warren.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1228-15\">. The failure of the Government to call an informant as a witness does not necessarily violate the defendant\u2019s rights. All the Government need do is to identify its informant; it need not produce him as a witness at the trial. Wilson v. United States, 9 Cir., 409 F.2d 184, decided Mar. 13, 1969, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">. In counsel\u2019s opening statement, he told the jury that the evidence would show that the defendant \u201cat no time ever knew what was in those balloons, * * * that at no time did he keep any of the money\u201d and that he was simply used as \u201ca depository for Otis Warren and an intermediary for the Federal Narcotics Bureau\u201d. The case was tried and argued on this defense, and the defendant was acquitted on the first count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aqa\">. As this court said in Smith v. United States, supra, 390 F.2d at 403, \u201cThere is no evidence that the informant (here agent) pleaded or argued with the defendant to sell him the heroin. It is evident that, under any theory, entrapment had not been put in issue, and certainly had not been shown as a matter of law. The defendant was not entitled to such instruction and the failure to give the instruction does not constitute plain error\u201d. See also Wilson v. United States, supra, n. 2, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1229-17\">. ii * * * iphe faet that a defendant has that right to put the government to its burden, to say \u2018I\u2019m not guilty until a jury concludes that I am,\u2019 doesn\u2019t include the right of a defendant to take the stand, to be sworn, and then to tell the jury a pack of lies.</p>\n<p id=\"Azx1\">\u201c * * * I would suggest that just from what you heard from the defendant alone you just couldn\u2019t possibly believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>what he told you and what he asks you to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"aab-dedup-0\">\u201cHe asks you to believe that, given a circumstance and the kind of person that he is, the kind of life that he leads, a sort of activity that he engages in to make his living, he asks you to believe that, nonetheless, he is so innocent and so naive that he took these things from Otis Warren, participated in this entire event, turned all the money over to Otis Warren and really didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p>\n<p id=\"AtA\">\u201c * * * You know, I am sure, that the potential of what seems to me a great deal of powder there is horrible, that the drug traffic, in its every aspect, from start to finish is an abomination.</p>\n<p id=\"AU8W\">\u201c * * * If you think that the story told you is a reasonable one, a true one, the real version of the facts, by all means acquit him. Find him not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">\u201cBut if you find that he has taken advantage of his rights to put the government to its proof and that he has instead taken the stand and attempted to simply sell you a complete barrel of hogwash, then I ask you to reject it in its entirety and to arrive at the only logical alternative, the alternative that the defendant is, in fact, guilty of each and every charge alleged in the indictment, if you are convinced of this beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
