United States (10 Cir., 1960), 286 F.2d 118, relied upon by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-26\">It is clear that the parol evidence rule has no application to a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>such as this, where the government proved by one of the purported parties to an assignment that the side agreement between appellant and the purported assignee prevented the document from being the assignment which it purported to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Finally, there was ample evidence to submit to the jury the question of the wilful and intentional purpose of appellant to deceive the Internal Revenue Agent into accepting the purported assignment as speaking the truth when it, in fact, did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
