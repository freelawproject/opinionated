The jury was informed that, in determining guilt or innocence, it might consider any false exculpatory statements made by the defendant. Since the record reveals no evidentiary basis for the instruction, this portion of the court\u2019s charge is clearly irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-21\">Rule 30 of tne Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, precludes the assignment as error of any jury instruction not objected to at trial, and no such objection was made in the present case. It is not urged, nor could it be, that the extraneous portion of the charge was so prejudicial to the defendant as to constitute \u201cplain error\u201d in the sense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>Rule 52(b) warranting notice and reversal by this court despite the appellant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\">At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel abandoned as without substance an additional issue raised in his brief, the admissibility of a palm print in evidence. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The conviction is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"AWo\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
