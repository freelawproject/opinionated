United States, 409 F.2d 513 (9th Circuit, decided April 3, 1969), the facts and the trial court\u2019s findings in this case more closely resemble Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. den. 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967), than they do other \u201calimentary canal cases\u201d involving narcotics. Evidence was sufficient to establish a \u201cclear indication\u201d of the possession of narcotics by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-19\">The other errors alleged as to introduction of evidence and sentencing we find without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1034-20\">ELY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">I respectfully dissent. When this case was submitted, there was then pending our disposition of Huguez v. United States, 406 F.2d 366 (9th Cir. 1968), another case involving the probing exploration of the rectal cavity of one suspected of crossing the international frontier with narcotics concealed in that cavity. The published record reveals that all of the judges of our court gave long and careful consideration to the <em>Huguez </em>problem. The original panel of our court, with one judge dissenting, held that the search of Huguez was illegal. We held that the federal constitution was infringed because the procedure employed by the border officials, with the assistance of the same doctor who participated in this case, was shockingly offensive under the teaching of Rochin v. State of California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed.2d 183 (1952). More important, however, as it affects the present case, is our holding in <em>Huguez </em>that the border police were not aware, at the inception of the search procedure, of facts sufficient to provide the required \u201cclear indication\u201d that narcotics were concealed in Huguez\u2019 rectal cavity. I have previously expressed my dissatisfaction with the so-called \u201cclear indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>tion\u201d test and its nebulous concept, but our court has accepted it. Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967); Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967). Each of the three judges first concerned with the <em>Huguez </em>appeal expressed his separate views. Following the issuance of these opinions, the case reached the attention of all except the Senior judges of our court. A vote was taken as to whether <em>Huguez </em>should be reheard in banc. The court rejected such a rehearing, with four of our ten judges publicly recording the view that we should have granted such a rehearing. 406 F.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Now, at long last, we decide the case before us. As I see it, there is no present need to review facts and possibly provoke another controversy such as those which have hitherto arisen in connection with the troublesome issue which is involved. <em>See </em>Huguez v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870 (9th Cir. 1966). I do no more than express my conviction that if the required \u201cclear indication\u201d did not exist in <em>Huguez, </em>then, <em>a fortiori, </em>it did not exist in the circumstances of the ease before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">The disposition of the present appeal dramatically emphasizes the validity of my criticism of the \u201cclear indication\u201d test, expressed in <em>Huguez. </em>There, I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-7\">\u201cHere the majority reaches a eonclution favorable to Huguez, but it is altogether possible that had another judge sat in the place of [one of the two judges constituting the majority] the opinion of [the dissenter] would have prevailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-8\">\u201cNone should deny that there should be uniformity in the application of legal principles. Huguez should not have the benefit of a decision which might possibly be denied to others in the same position.\u201d 406 F.2d at 383.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">A bygone jurist, whose name I do not know, once wrote something to the effect that no nation can endure and prosper into and through whose life is not found the golden thread of equal justice. Huguez has, perhaps, been set free, while the appellant here gains no redress for the degrading violation of any vestige of dignity which might have remained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Once more, I must make it clear that while not even a judge is able to cast away that compassion which the illness of narcotics addiction invites, I share the disgust which all respectable individuals must hold for the self-degradation of one like Thompson, regardless that his depraved lack of respect for his own body may have been induced by his compulsive addiction. It must never be, however, that the application of legal principles should rest upon the qualities, favorable or unfavorable, of individuals who invoke them. I have previously expressed the opinion that, when time permits, authority for a bodily cavity search at our borders should be conferred by a judicial magistrate. <em>See </em>Blefare v. United States, 362 F.2d 870, 880-888 (9th Cir. 1966) (Ely, J., dissenting). My opinion is now shared by a number of commentators. <em>See </em>Comment, Intrusive Border Searches \u2014 Is Judicial Control Desirable?, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 276 (1966); Note, Search and Seizure at the Border \u2014 The Border Search, 21 Rutgers L. Rev. 513 (1967); 18 W. Res. L. Rev. 1007 (1967). <em>See also </em>Note, Border Searches and the Fourth Amendment, 77 Yale L.J. 1007 (1968) . My dismay that such an extreme power is vested in border police, without judicial authorization and supervision, stems from my concern for the rights of innocent individuals whose legitimate business or pleasure leads them to cross our borders in countless numbers. In <em>Blefare, </em>I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-14\">\u201cThe record reveals that at the border point here involved, \u2018millions\u2019 of people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>enter the United States each year. * * * 362 F.2d at 881.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-4\">\u201cThat customs officials should seek judicial authorization, where time permits, before engaging in extremely unusual invasions of the human body would appear to be a wholly reasonable requirement, a requirement which would protect the constitutional rights of individuals who cross our international borders and not significantly thwart the necessary regulation of border traffic.\u201d 362 F.2d at 888.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">The record in <em>Blefare </em>was barren of information as to the number of innocent transients who had been subjected to degrading searches of their body cavities by mistaken police. Now, we have the disturbing, even appalling, information that \u201c80 to 85 per cent\u201d, <em>at least four-fifths, </em>of all border transients whose bodily cavities are invaded by the border police are innocent of the suspected wrongdoing!<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Morales v. United States, 406 F.2d 1298, 1300n.2 (9th Cir. 1969). I suppose we should presume that those who violated the personal dignity of those innocent people believed that there were \u201cclear indications\u201d that their searches would be fruitful!<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I suspect, also, that the innocent individuals whose rectums have been probed, as well as the touring females whose va-ginas have been explored, have, in most instances, chosen to suffer their shame in silence. I cannot remain silent, however, until our court or some other responsible agency undertakes to furnish more effective judicial safeguards against the infliction of these indignities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">. These statistics reflect the experience of a physician, who according to the records of our court, frequently assists the border police in their searches of bodily cavities. I think it not unreasonable to believe that in situations wherein the police may not seek medical assistance, an even greater percentage of innocent persons are offended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1036-21\">. The appellant crossed the border with two companions. The rectums of all three were probed, and if these searches were justified, the justification rested upon the same \u201cclear indication.\u201d Yet the searches of the cavities of appellant\u2019s two companions were unproductive!</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
