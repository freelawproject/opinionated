The state court judgments for death, personal injury and property damage resulting from a three-vehicle accident had been returned jointly against American Mutual\u2019s insured and State Farm\u2019s insured. State Farm has filed an answer to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-21\">The principal issue in the suit between the two insurers was whether State Farm\u2019s insured had failed to give it notice of the accident as soon as practicable, thereby violating the terms of the policy so as to release it from liability thereon. The district judge, after full trial, found that, notwithstanding a delay in reporting the accident of 117 days, State Farm\u2019s insured reasonably believed that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>not involved in the accident and hence, under the law of Virginia, he had not breached the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The issue raised on appeal is a narrow one. The parties have filed complete briefs and State Farm has filed an extensive appendix. We see nothing to be gained from oral argument. We conclude that the district judge\u2019s finding that State Farm\u2019s insured reasonably believed that he was not involved in the accident was not clearly erroneous, and we do not disagree with the district judge\u2019s informed prediction that under the law of Virginia the insured\u2019s notice to his insurer would not be deemed untimely, especially since he gave notice within three hours of the first claim of civil liability made on him. We grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The judgment of the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is</p>\n<p id=\"acu-dedup-1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-14\"> American Mutual Liability Insurance Co. v.
