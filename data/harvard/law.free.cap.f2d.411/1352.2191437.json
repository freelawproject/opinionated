The examiner\u2019s refusal is under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)), based on the registered mark COLLEGI-ENNE <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as applied to shoes of leather, rubber, fabric and combinations, girls\u2019 and junior girls\u2019 hats, coats, suits, dresses, sweaters, skirts, and blouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-27\">The basis of rejection is that the appellant\u2019s mark so closely resembles the registered mark in sound and in meaning as to create likelihood of confusion, mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>take, or deception when used on the identical and closely related goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">The appellant acknowledges that \u201cthere is no correct pronunciation of a trademark.\u201d We think that one is very likely to pronounce \u201cCollegienne\u201d as if it were spelled \u201cColleejen\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cColleejun.\u201d Thus, in sound, the appellant\u2019s mark differs from the registered mark primarily in that the former is the plural form of the latter, which we feel does not amount to a material difference in a trademark sense. Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 F.2d 877, 44 CCPA 1019 (1957). We feel that the two very similar marks, when applied to the same goods, would create a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">The appellant has argued that third party registrations in the record would indicate the reference registration is a \u201cweak\u201d mark and therefore \u201cless likely to be confused.\u201d The question still remains whether the marks viewed as a whole create a likelihood of confusion. Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. v. Lilli Ann Corp., 376 F.2d 324, 54 CCPA 1295 (1967). Third party registrations have very little weight on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">.
