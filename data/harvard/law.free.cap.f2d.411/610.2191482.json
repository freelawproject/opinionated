Evidence as to appellant\u2019s dealings with Morris Moche was properly admitted, as bearing on the 'motive for the allegedly false statement that certain papers had been lost. Moreover, except for one answer, no objection was made to any of this evidence. It is apparent from the record that this was part of the defense strategy, as it furnished a basis for attacking the credibility and bias of Moche, who was the principal prosecution witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">Nor was there any improper prejudice to the defendant in the few questions which the trial judge put to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
