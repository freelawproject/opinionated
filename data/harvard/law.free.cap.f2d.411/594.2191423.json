See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-27\">The sole question presented concerns the reasonableness and record support of the Referee\u2019s allowance of an attorneys\u2019 fee to a secured creditor in this bankruptcy proceeding. Aetna sought $11,200.00 as a reasonable attorneys' fee, and the Referee awarded $4,000.00. In analyzing the fee awarded, it appears that on an hourly basis Aetna\u2019s attorneys were paid at the rate of $40.00 an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-28\">In corporate reorganization proceedings, on appeal from an order allowing fees to receivers, attorneys, and others, a reviewing court is confined to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>termination of whether the trial court abused its discretion to the extent of manifest disregard of right and reason. See Calhoun v. Hertwig, 363 F.2d 257 (5 Cir., 1966), cert. den. 386 U.S. 966, 87 S.Ct. 1047, 18 L.Ed.2d 116; In Re Long Island Properties, 150 F.2d 313 (2 Cir., 1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Based upon the record before this Court, we are of the opinion that the award of a fee of $4,000.00 to appellant\u2019s counsel did not constitute a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
