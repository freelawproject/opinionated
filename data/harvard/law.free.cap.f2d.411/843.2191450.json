But we are not, as we indicate, <em>infra, </em>impressed by their argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b932-6\">COFFIN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In the summer of 1962, Anderson Bros., Inc., a general contractor, entered into three construction contracts with the United States Air Force for work at Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts and Dow Air Force Base in Maine. As required by the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270a et seq., Anderson Bros., Inc. applied to the appellee (surety) for payment and performance bonds. Contained in the application for the bonds was an assignment to the surety \u201c * * * of earned monies that may be due or become due under said contract * * This assignment to the surety was not recorded under the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Subsequent to the posting of payment and performance bonds on two contracts, Anderson Bros., Inc. obtained a line of credit from appellant National Shawmut Bank (the Bank).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As collateral for the loans an assignment of \u201c * * * all monies due and which shall hereafter become due from the United States * was made to the Bank. A financing statement covering this assignment was filed in compliance with M.G.L.A. c. 106-9, and notice of the assignment was given to the United States as required by the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 203 (1964). However, no written notice was given to the surety even though such notice was required by this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">In the spring of 1963 the construction contracts were terminated by the United States because of Anderson\u2019s default. The surety completed the work as it was obligated to do under the bonds. The cost of completion was approximately $97,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">As of the date of termination of the contracts, earned progress payments to-staled $44,202.05. Both the surety and the Bank- seek to satisfy their respective claims from this fund, v/</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">In December of 1964 a complaint was filed by the Bank naming the surety as defendant in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The case was tried to the court without a jury and on September 27, 1968, the district court dismissed the complaint and ordered judgment for the defendant surety. The Bank brings this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The critical question which this appeal raises is one which has been, and continues to be, the cause of some uncertainty in the wake of enactment of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). It is: to what extent, if any, does the doctrine of subrogation survive the passage of Article 9 of the U.C.C.?</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Our effort will be to see what subrogation means in the transaction before us, to see what extent Article 9 is devised to deal with such a transaction, and to apply relevant case law. Subrogation is an old term, rooted in equity, and semantically stemming from words meaning \u201cask under\u201d. Today we use the parallel phrase, \u201cstand in the shoes of\u201d. The equitable principle is that when one, pursuant to ^obligation \u2014 not a volunteer, fulfills the duties of another, he is entitled to assert rights of that other against third \"'persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\"><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case there is confusion because the tendency is to think of the surety on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Miller Act payment and performance bonds as standing in the shoes only of the entity it \u201cinsures\u201d \u2014 the contractor. So long as this one-dimensional concept prevails, logic compels the surety to be assessed as merely one of the contractor\u2019s creditors, and to be subject to the system of priorities rationalized by the Uniform Commercial Code. But the surety in cases like this undertakes., dutie_s,~which-entitle it to step intoCthree) sets of shoes.) When, on default ofTiHe contractor, it pays all the bills of the job to date and completes the job, it stands in the shoes of the contractor insofar as there are receivables due it; in the shoes laborers and material men who have been paid by the surety \u2014 who may have had liens; and, not least, in the shoes of government, for whom the job was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">This unique accumulation of subrogation rights serves to induce a function that is neither ordinary insurance nor ordinary financing. The business of a construction contract surety is not one of ordinary insurance, for the risk is not aetuarially linked to premiums, nor is there a pooling of risks. Pearlman v. Reliance Ins. Co., 371 U.S. 132, 140 n. 19, 83 S.Ct. 232, 9 L.Ed.2d 190 (1962). Neither is the business one of ordinary financing, for while the surety extends its credit to the owner (the government), as the ultimate guarantee that the job will be done, this is a credit that may either never have to be drawn upon or, if it is drawn upon at all, will in all likelihood be overdrawn. That is, if a contractor defaults, \u201cpayment\u201d of the credit depends upon the surety\u2019s competence in economically finishing what somebody else has started. In this hermaphroditic situation, the \u201csecurity\u201d for the surety is not the fee but a compound of its confidence in the contractor and the opportunity to prevent or minimize its ultimate loss by its right to salvage the debacle by its own performance. Assuming that its confidence is misplaced, the surety receives very little from the contractor but the right to complete the job. Unlike a bank, it does not face specific requests for funds which it is able to link to suitable collateral with subsequent requests determined by assessment of current management and rcurrently available additional security. In case of default, the bank takes its security; the surety must go ahead and perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">All of this, we think, is relevant background to an interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code as applied to the kind of security interest at issue. We commence by saying that appellant makes a respectable argument based on the Code. At best, however, we deem the Code not compelling and, on balance, notl focused or directed to the surety\u2019s problem.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To begin with, we have the exculpatory general principle that \u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity * * * shall supplement its provisions.\u201d M.G.L.A. \u00a7 1-103. As we shall see, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court gives impressive weight to this canon in French Lumber Co., Inc. v. Commercial Realty &amp; Finance Co., Inc., 346 Mass. 716, 719, 195 N.E. 507 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Going on to specifics, we note the definition of \u201csecurity interest\u201d in M.G. L.A. \u00a7 1-201(37) as \u201can interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation * * * [and which] includes any interest of a buyer of accounts * * * or contract rights * * Neither clause seems to fit the construction contract surety. What secures its payment is really the opportunity, on default, to finish the job and apply any available funds against its cost of completion. This kind of right does not readily set-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tie under the rubric of \u201cpersonal property\u201d or \u201cfixtures\u201d. Nor does the surety easily fit the description of a \u201cbuyer of * - * contract rights\u201d. We make a similar comment about M.G.L.A. \u00a7 9-102(1) (a) which applies the Code \u201cto any transaction * * * which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures including * * * contract rights; and * * * (b) to any sale of * * * contract rights\u201d. While one may strain to say that the right to finish a job in an emergency and thus minimize damages is a contract right, we think it is not the kind of independently valuable asset that such synonyms as \u201cgoods, documents, instruments, general intangibles, [and] chattel paper\u201d suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">There are other hurdles. Section 9-102(2) requires \u201csecurity interests\u201d to be \u201ccreated by contract\u201d. In this case the real security is not the assignment of accounts receivable \u2014 which could be, failing the completion of performance, set off by the government \u2014 but the eventual right to be in the shoes of the government upon job completion. This is not \u201ccreated by contract\u201d but rather by the status, resulting from a contract, inhering in a surety, quite independently of the expressed terms of the contract. <em>See </em>Memphis &amp; L. R. R. Co. v. Dow, 120 U.S. 287, 301-302, 7 S.Ct. 482, 30 L.Ed. 595 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">We add to this our difficulties with \u00a7 9-106 which defines \u201c[a]ccount\u201d as \u201cany right to payment * * * not evidenced by an instrument\u201d and \u201c[c] on-tract right\u201d as \u201cany right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance\u201d. As to the former, when the contractor defaults, there is no right to payment, <em>see infra. </em>As to the latter, we think of a right to receive payments from one who continues with the performance (as rents receivable by a landlord), rather than a right conditioned on performance by the transferee of the \u201cright\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">We have, finally, the historic fact of the rejection of a proposed \u00a7 9-312(7) to the Code which would have provided that \u201cA security interest which secures an obligation to reimburse a surety * * * secondarily obligated to complete performance is subordinate to\u201d a later lender which perfects its security interest. We report the comments of the Editorial Board in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, we do not feel that this signalized an admission by surety companies that theirs was a \u201csecurity interest\u201d within the meaning of the Code, but simply that they had won the battle to defend the preserve of sub-rogation. The cases cited by the Board would seem to underscore this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>If analysis were not enough, we think that case law is. Perhaps the most significant case, not cited by appellant or its amicus is French Lumber Co., Inc. v. Commercial Realty &amp; Finance Co., Inc., 346 Mass. 716, 195 N.E.2d 507 (1964). For we deem our source of substantive law as governed by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and there has been no suggestion that this is a proper case for the devising of a rule of federal common law. In that case the lumber company financed the purchase of an automobile through Ware Trust Company (Ware) which filed a financing statement under the U.C.C. The lumber company then pledged its equity in the automobile to Commercial Realty which also filed a financing statement under the U.C.C. The lumber company defaulted on its obligations and Ware sought to foreclose on- its note. However, the lumber company was able to refinance its obligation through Associates Discount Corporation (Associates) which gave a note for amounts due to Ware in exchange for cancellation of its security interest. The lumber company defaulted again and Associates repossessed the automobile and sold it at public auction. Commercial Realty claimed the proceeds of the sale by virtue of its recorded security interest. Of course, Associates would have had a priority if it could have succeeded to Ware\u2019s security interest which it could have done through assignment. However, no assignment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Nevertheless, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Associates prevailed by virtue of its subrogation to the rights of Ware. In reaching this conclusion the court remarked: \u201cNo provision of the Code (U.C.C.) purports to affect the fundamental equitable doctrine of subrogation.\u201d 346 Mass, at 719, 195 N.E.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Appellant\u2019s effort at argument to distinguish <em>French </em>on its facts does not persuade us that the Massachusetts court would take any different view here of the non-displacement of equitable sub-rogation by the Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the surety in the case before us, could have perfected a filing under \u00a7 9-312. But in <em>French </em>the refinancing party could similarly have taken an assignment of a prior recorded security interest. That it did not do so did not affect its rights as a subrogee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Finally, the Bank asserts that even if the surety may claim as a subrogee, the Bank has a superior claim in equity. This is so, according to the Bank, where earned progress payments are involved and where the surety has benefitted from the contractor\u2019s application of the loan proceeds to contracts bonded by the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The position espoused by the Bank originated in cases where earned prog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ress payments had been paid to an assignee bank and the surety was attempting, after the default of the contractor, to recover the amounts paid. <em>See, e. g., </em>American Fidelity Co. v. National City Bank of Evansville, 266 F.2d 910 (D.C. Cir. 1959); Coconut Grove Exchange Bank v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 149 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1945); Town of River Junction v. Maryland Casualty Co., 110 F.2d 278 (5th Cir. 1940); National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. United States, 304 F.2d 465, 157 Ct.Cl. 696 (1962).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Here the payments were earned but unpaid prior to- the contractor\u2019s default. Prior to default, the contractor had the right to assign progress payments and had the Bank received payment, it could not (absent circumstances amounting to fraud) have been divested by the surety^ But upon default,'UJ\u00f1T'sur\u00e9ty which is obligated to complete the work steps into the shoes of the government \u2014 not of the contractor/ which on default has forfeited its rights] It is subrogated not only to the right of the government to pay laborers and materialmen from funds retained out of \\progress payments, Prairie State Nat. Bank v. United States, 164 U.S. 227, 17 S.Ct. 142, 41 L.Ed. 412 (1896); Henningsen v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 208 U.S. 404, 28 S.Ct. 389, 52 L.Ed. 547 (1908); Pearlman v. Reliance Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>but also to the government\u2019s right to apply to the cost of completion the earned but unpaid progress payments in its hands at the time of default. United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947); Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. United States, 382 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir. 1967). The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has specifically recognized that a merg^assignee of a contractor, such as appellant here, receives the right to moneys due the latter subject, however, to the dominant right of the otyner to recoup the damages suffered by default. American Bridge Co. of New York v. City of Boston, 202 Mass. 374 (1909).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">That this right of a completing surety to earned but unpaid progress payments is generally recognized is indicated by the authorities noted in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9D\">While appellant has cited many eases where a bank was allowed to retain progress payments made to it, which we have noted <em>supra, </em>its only authority for the proposition .that a bank has priority over a surety with regard to earned but unpaid progress payments is General Casualty Co. v. Second National Bank of Houston, 178 F.2d 679 (5th Cir. 1949). Any distinction between the surety\u2019s rights to retainage and those to unpaid progress payments, however, was eliminated by the later Fifth Circuit case of Trinity Universal Insurance Co. v. United States, 382 F.2d 317 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Our analysis has centered on the interpretation of the Code and of the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>of subrogation as developed by the eases. We have found no basis for injecting other general equitable or policy considerations. We are unmoved by the claims of either the Bank or the surety to inherently superior status. The Bank loan undoubtedly helped minimize the surety\u2019s cost of completion. But completion by the surety was necessary to preserve the fund which is here in issue. The surety could concededly have avoided this litigation by perfecting its filing, but so could the Bank by making inquiry of the arrangements between contractor and surety. It may well be \u2014 although we express no opinion \u2014 that to subject sureties to the filing requirements of the Code would improve and rationalize the system of financing public contracts. 'But equitable subrogation is too hardy <em>'ja </em>plant to be uprooted by a Code which speaks around but not to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"adb-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-9\">.

In view of our disposition of this appeal, we need not, and do not, pass on the question of the effect of the Bank\u2019s failure to give notice of its assignment to the surety as required by the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 203 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b934-8\">. \u201cThe Surety Companies\u2019 representatives convincingly took the position that subsection (7) as it stands is a complete reversal of the case law not only of the Supreme Court of the United States but also of the highest courts of most of the states.

It is true that in <em>French Lumber </em>Ware had filed a financing statement under the U.C.C., and therefore, all subsequent lienors were on notice of the existence of a prior security interest. This, however, does not aid the bank in distinguishing <em>French Lumber, </em>for here the bank knew of the existence of the surety. And even if the bank had no actual notice, it might well be held, at least in a Miller Act case, to constructive notice of the surety\u2019s existence. <em>See </em>Moran v. Guardian Casualty Co., 64 App.D.C. 188, 76 F.2d 438 (D.C. Cir. 1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b935-6\">. Appellant\u2019s only case authorities for the displacement of subrogation by the Code are United States v. G. P.

The authority of both eases as a statement of Pennsylvania law is, we think, negated by Jacobs v. Northeastern Corporation, 416 Pa. 417, 206 A.2d 49, 11 A.L.R.3d 1220 (1965), which states that \u201cBights of subrogation, although growing out of a contractual setting and ofttimes articulated by the contract, do not depend for their existence on a grant in the contract, but are created by law to avoid injustice. Therefore, subrogation rights are not \u2018security interests\u2019 within the meaning of Article 9.\u201d 206 A.2d at 55. While <em>Jacobs </em>involved the surety\u2019s rights to retain-ages and <em>Fleetwood </em>involved unpaid progress payments, we do not see this difference as having any bearing on the surety\u2019s lights, <em>see infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b936-6\">.

Petitioner\u2019s argument is directed at the validity of our interpretation of the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in French Lumber Co., Inc. v. Commercial Realty &amp; Finance Co., Inc., 346 Mass. 716, 195 N.E.2d 507 (1964).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Petitioner raises several points which we consider hereafter only to the extent that our opinion does not reflect them. Before, however, proceeding to a discussion of petitioner\u2019s specific arguments, we note that while <em>French Lumber </em>as an expression of Massachusetts law is central to our holding, it is not inconsistent with existing authority on this issue. But even if it were, we must reject petitioner\u2019s attempt to inter <em>French Lumber </em>by examining the briefs and discovering that the court\u2019s statement was not based on any contention advanced therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Petitioner\u2019s first argument is that whereas here subrogation is a substitute for a security interest, in <em>French Lumber </em>subrogation was employed as an adjunct of general equity principles. This purported distinction is in fact a comparison of the two entirely separate concepts of function and rationale. In both cases subrogation served as a substitute for a security interest, and in both cases the substitution is justified by the invocation of general equity principles. Indeed, subrogation is a creature of equity, and therefore always arises as an adjunct of equitable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument is that since all three lenders in <em>French Lumber </em>had recorded their security interests under the Code, that case involved subrogation within the Code. The important point is, however, that but for subrogation the third lender would have been subordinated to the second lender. In <em>French Lumber </em>subrogation was used to override the priorities of the Code \u2014 possibly exerting more force than here where, arguably at least, the surety\u2019s interests are not covered by Article 9 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Finally, petitioner asserts that the third lender in <em>French Lumber </em>was a \u201cvolunteer\u201d and not entitled to subrogation rights. The general rule is that a mere volunteer is not entitled to subro-gation. That fact would not, of course, bar the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from holding otherwise. But, in fact, the third lender does not fall under the volunteer doctrine, which refers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>gratuitous or quasi-contractual undertakings. The third lender\u2019s rights, as did the surety\u2019s here, arose because of its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-13\"> We discuss the argument \u25a0without much enthusiasm for petitioner\u2019s attempt to comply with our rule 6 by saying that it did not foresee the weight we would assign to that case, not relied upon by the district court. Whether selected for citation by that court or not, the unqualified language of <em>French </em>that \u201cNo provision of the Code (U.C.C.) purports to affect the fundamental equitable doctrine of subro-gation\u201d posed an obvious problem for petitioner, then the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
