On June 12, 1968, the district court entered an order affirming the Secretary's determination, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Appellant, a retired building contractor, alleged back trouble as a result of a 1950 tractor accident and gout as the principal impairments causing him to be disabled within the terms of \u00a7 223(d) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (1) (A); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (2) (A) and (3)]. These statutes.read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">(d) (1) The term \u201cdisability\u201d means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">(d) (2) (A) An individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy * * *. (d) (3) For purposes of this subsection, a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Appellant presented medical evidence from a general practitioner and an orthopedic specialist who had treated him at irregular intervals since the 1950 accident. The examiner, .however, also received reports from an internist at Ochs-ner Clinic, New Orleans, consulted by one of appellant\u2019s physicians, and another Ochsner Clinic internist who examined appellant at the request of the hearing examiner. These later reports indicated that appellant did not suffer from gout and that most of his lower back pains resulted from obesity and fibrositis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the later reports indicated that much of appellant\u2019s physical problem was related to an adverse psychological reaction brought about by his relatively early retirement at age 49.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing examiner concluded that appellant was not disabled prior to December 31, 1964, and that his condition would be greatly eased by a reduction in weight and a return to some form of gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">At the outset, we bear in mind that the scope of judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision is narrowly limited to the issue of whether or not the Secretary\u2019s fact determinations are supported by substantial evidence. Hayes v. Celebrezze, 311 F.2d 648 (5 Cir. 1963). Moreover, credibility findings as to conflicts in the evidence are to be made by the Secretary and not the trial court. Celebrezze v. Zimmerman, 339 F.2d 496 (5 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\"> It is unquestionable that there is substantial medical evidence in the record to sustain the hearing examiner's conclusion that appellant could improve his condition by losing weight and returning to work. There is persuasive evidence that a reduction in weight would ease many of appellant\u2019s problems, including his chronic anxiety, borderline diabetes and fibrositis pains. If an impairment reasonably can be remedied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>treatment, it can not serve as a basis for a finding of disability. Henry v. Gardner, 381 F.2d 191 (6 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In addition to the medical evidence, the record shows that most of appellant\u2019s duties as a building contractor consisted of sedentary activity such as reading blueprints, estimating costs, submitting bids and personally supervising his contracting jobs. Even appellant\u2019s own physician certified that appellant was still capable of sedentary activity, and the evidence indicates that he would be able to engage in such activity without pain if he lost weight as he has been advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">It is true, perhaps, that the evidence could be interpreted to show that appellant does suffer low back pains resulting from his 1950 accident and that this greatly inhibits even his sedentary activity. However, substantial evidence, which we are not at liberty to reject, supports the contrary findings of the trial examiner. Celebrezze v. Kelly, 331 F.2d 981 (5 Cir. 1964). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">. This is the last date upon which appellant met the statutory requirements establishing eligibility for disability insurance benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(i) ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-16\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which ho was a party, * * * may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision * * *.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. Fibrositis is a muscular ailment which could be responsible for appellant\u2019s back pain. However, there is no evidence of arthritis and the medical evaluations indicate that a reduction in appellant\u2019s weight would be expected to relieve Ms pain from this condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">. The medical reports accepted by the trial examiner indicate that appellant also has a minor hypertensive cardiovascular disease and borderline diabetes, both conditions which are not disabling and which could be greatly remedied by loss of weight. In addition, the reports indicated that appellant was restless and felt useless due to his sudden inactivity after a long career of intensive work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
