Garanzini and Robert N. Paille. Appellant\u2019s complaint in the District Court contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">\u201c8. On or about August 28, 1966, at about 3:30 A.M., the plaintiff was brought to the \u2018emergency-operation room\u2019 of the Harper Hospital by his sister (Miss Maryren Khan); then and there nearly bleeding to death from multi-ordinal stab wounds. Actually the doctors there was fighting frantically to attempt to save the plaintiff\u2019s life in the process thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">\u201cThen and there, the individual defendants, and each of them, did enter into the Harper Hospital, shoving, pushing and ordering said doctors and the plaintiff\u2019s sister out of their way; and did the following acts, among others:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">\u201c(A) Defendants Garanzini &amp; Paitte, entered the \u2018emergeney-operation-room\u2019 \u2014 where the said plaintiff was being treated for said multi-ordinal stab wounds. The aforesaid defendants then and there shined their flashlights upon the face of the plaintiff while shouting threatening remarks at the plaintiff\u2019s sister (Miss Maryren Khan); and including the' said attending doctors involved therein. Not getting the attention they desired, the said defendants and each of them immediately pulled their service revolvers out into sight, and pointed them at all of the persons who were in the said room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-17\">\u201cOne of the two defendants commanded the plaintiff to rise from his operation table bed; and walk to the center of the room stark naked this being the result of this command the aforesaid plaintiff was forced to get out of his bed and walk to the center of the room stark naked and completely without clothing or other means to hide his nakedness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-18\">\u201cAt this point the plaintiff\u2019s sister (Maryren Khan) made a vain attempt to come to the plaintiff\u2019s aid \u2014 she was threatened not to come near him, and also not to leave the said room to even call for any help \u2014 family or otherwise ; of which she stated was her intentions. During the course of the aforesaid incident, the defendant Patrolman Gar-anzini, in the presence of Miss Mary-ren Khan, et als., cursed the plaintiff and threatened to shoot him if he did not obey the commands of the two defendants with alacrity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-19\">\u201c(B) While the events stated in paragraph (A) above, the defendants ordered the doctors to produce the plaintiff\u2019s clothes. These clothes were searched separately, meanwhile, the defendants ordered the plaintiff to dress himself. Subsequent to the events related in paragraph (A) the two defendants produced a pair of manacles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>or handcuffs, and with them chained the hands of the plaintiff together. At this point the plaintiff had gained somewhat of a dazed consciousness as to what was taking place \u2014 and, then and there demanded the defendants to show him what lawful reason he was being treated in such an unlawful manner; in answer to the aforesaid question the defendants and each of them said, \u2018You are under arrest for murder\u2019. Then the plaintiff and his sister both demanded to see the warrant for arrest \u2014 the answer to this question was, \u2018We do not need a warrant\u2019 to arrest anybody; and furthermore we are going to take him in \u2018for questioning.\u2019 Thereupon the individual defendants, and each of them, escorted the plaintiff from the aforesaid Harper Hospital to an automobile, which was parked in back of said hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">\u201c(9) None of the individual defendants, at any of the times mentioned herein, and, more particularly, at the time and place of the events alleged in paragraph 8 above, had in his possession any warrant issued by any judge, court, or magistrate authorizing:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">Additional and colorful allegations followed. The complaint was verified by an affidavit which included the averment that appellant had \u201cread the contents of said original complaint and subscribe [d] to the same as being true in substance as well as in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The City of Detroit\u2019s motion to dismiss was appropriately granted upon authority of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); Egan v. City of Aurora, 365 U.S. 514, 81 S.Ct. 684, 5 L.Ed.2d 741 (1961); Puett v. City of Detroit, 323 F.2d 591, 593 (6th Cir. 1963). A Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment was filed on behalf of the police officers, supported by their affidavits in which each denied plaintiff\u2019s allegations and set out his account of the involved events. If true, these affidavits would negative any cause of action asserted by plaintiff. To this motion of defendants, plaintiff filed an unsworn pleading denominated \u201cMotion to Dismiss Motion Filed by Defendants\u201d in which he averred that the police officers\u2019 account of the relevant transaction was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The appellant has, throughout the course of this litigation, acted as his own attorney, being incarcerated in the Michigan State Prison at Jackson. He was acquitted of the charge of second degree murder which was the cause of his arrest at Harper Hospital on August 28, 1966. He was, however, convicted on a different charge of manslaughter and he is presently serving a five to fifteen year sentence therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In granting summary judgment for the police officers, the District Judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">\u201cHowever, plaintiff filed no affidavit controverting under oath any of the factual statements contained in defendants\u2019 affidavits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">We fear that the Corporation Counsel overlooked the fact that appellant\u2019s complaint did, on oath, controvert the material factual statements in the police officers\u2019 affidavits and an issue of fact was thereby framed for trial. The fact that the complaint was verified no doubt was not called to the District Judge\u2019s attention and this fact is not noted in the briefs before us on this appeal. Rule 56(e); Fed.R.Civ.P., provides that summary judgment will be entered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">\u201cIf the <em>pleadings, </em>depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">The verified complaint was part of the pleadings and although Rule 11 provides that pleadings \u201cneed not be verified,\u201d such verification is not forbidden and the plaintiff\u2019s verified complaint here is an affidavit which denies the facts set out in the police officers\u2019 affidavits. It is true that Rule 56(e) states that an adverse party \u201cmay not rest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading,\u201d but we consider that this rule, fairly read, does not forbid use of the affidavit contained in a verified pleading to traverse the affidavits opposing it. Albert Dickinson Co. v. Mellos Peanut Co., 179 F.2d 265, 268 (7th Cir. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s action against appellee City of Detroit is affirmed; summary judgment in favor of appellees Garanzini and Paille is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
