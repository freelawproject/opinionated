An indictment which fails to allege the existence of these two essential statutory elements is fatally defective. Bratton v. United States, 10 Cir., 73 F.2d 795. See Lancey v. United States, 9 Cir., 356 F.2d 407, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 922, 87 S.Ct. 234, 17 L.Ed.2d 145; Neal v. United States, 8 Cir., 102 F.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The indictment alleges in the words of the statute the concealment of the felony and a failure to disclose. The essential elements of the offense are adequately alleged in plain, concise and definite language as required by Rule 7 (c), Fed.R.Crim.P. The rules \u201cwere designed to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleading and are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure. Rule 2, F.R.Crim.P.\u201d United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374, 74 S.Ct. 113, 98 L.Ed. 92. If the accused desired more definite information for the proper preparation of a defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, the remedy was by motion for a bill of particulars as provided for in Rule 7(f), Fed.R.Crim.P. United States v. Debrow, <em>supra,; </em>United States v. Tijerina, 10 Cir., 407 F.2d 349; King v. United States, 10 Cir., 402 F.2d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On direct examination Mrs. Sullivan testified that she had known of the robbery but had never seen any large sums of money; that her husband had worked for a livelihood at \u201cdifferent things.\u201d On cross-examination she stated that she had neither received any of the proceeds of the bank robbery nor seen any large sums of money, but that within four weeks of the robbery she and her husband had purchased real estate in Sapulpa, Oklahoma upon which her husband had made a downpayment of $2,000 in cash. Upon rebuttal the prosecution produced the real estate agent who had negotiated the sale of the real property, and he testified that a partial downpayment of $100 in cash had been made by Mr. and Mrs. Kitchen, and that on the following day the balance of $1,900 then due was paid by Mrs. Kitchen with $100 bills. Clearly the evidence was admissible to rebut the testimony of the witness that she had never seen any large sums of money and had received none of the robbery proceeds. The testimony was material to the substantive issue of concealment of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-18\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-19\">\u201cWhoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-34\">. Pete Kitchen was killed in November, 1965 and Patricia Ann remarried thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
