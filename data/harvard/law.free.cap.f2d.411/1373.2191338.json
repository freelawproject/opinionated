The record does indicate that despite this lack of status the claimant rendered some service of the type normally rendered by the attorney for the trustee in furtherance of the proper administration of the bankrupt estate. However, the failure of counsel to obtain appointment as attorney for the trustee in accordance with General Order No. 44, bars the requested payment of a fee from the bankrupt estate. <em>Cf. </em>In re National Tool and Mfg. Co., 3d Cir. 1954, 209 F.2d 256; In Matter of Hydrocarbon Chemicals, Inc., 3d Cir. March 13, 1969, 411 F.2d 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-16\">The evidence adequately supports the referee\u2019s finding that the claimed disbursements arose in connection with fruitless attempts, in which the trustee did not join, to have a decision reviewed by the Supreme Court. In re Calpa Products Co., E.D.Pa.1965, 249 F.Supp. 71, aff\u2019d 3d Cir. 1965, 354 F.2d 1002, cert. denied Grasberger v. Calissi, 383 U.S. 947, 86 S.Ct. 1204, 16 L.Ed.2d 209. We agree with the district court that the bankrupt estate should not be charged with these disbursements, 275 F.Supp. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-17\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
