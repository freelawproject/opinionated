United States, 290 F.2d 894 (10 Cir. 1961) and Gilbert v. United States, 370 U.S. 650, 82 S.Ct. 1399, 8 L.Ed.2d 750 (1962) and that therefore his conviction was improper. In each of the cases above the defendant endorsed the name of the payee and added further matter. In <em>Selvidge, </em>the defendant after endorsing her employer\u2019s name added, \u201cBy Thelma L. Selvidge.\u201d In <em>Gilbert, </em>after endorsing the names of payees, the defendant added his signature as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">There was no such an endorsement in the case at bar. Nor was there even an oral representation by appellant that he was authorized to endorse the payee\u2019s name. The proof showed the payee\u2019s name was forged but did not show that appellant had forged the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">This case does not come within the authorities above cited. There was no agency endorsement. It was the common variety of an offense where appellant endorsed his own name to cash the check, well knowing the prior endorsement had been forged. He did just what he was charged with, uttering a forged check, knowing the endorsement had been forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-19\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
