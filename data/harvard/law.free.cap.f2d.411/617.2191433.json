On this appeal, Medved presents three contentions. The first is that certain statements given by him to a government investigator were improperly admitted into evidence because the investigator did not adequately warn Medved of the latter\u2019s constitutional rights before the statements were taken. The contention is without merit. In his brief, Medved recites that the questioning occurred \u201cwhile he was not in custody,\u201d and this is the fact. <em>See, </em>Boyle v. United States, 395 F.2d 413 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1089, 89 S.Ct. 861, 21 L.Ed.2d 782 (1969); Whitfield v. United States, 383 F.2d 142 (9th Cir. 1967). <em>See also, </em>Kohatsu v. United States, 351 F.2d 898 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1011, 86 S.Ct. 1915, 16 L.Ed.2d 1017, rehearing denied, 385 U.S. 891, 87 S.Ct. 15, 17 L. Ed.2d 122 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">The appellant\u2019s second and third points challenge, respectively, the district judge\u2019s failure to accept and present a part of one of the jury instructions which Medved proffered and an alleged imperfection in a presented instruction undertaking to define \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d We reject these contentions also. The instructions must be viewed as a whole, and, we, so viewing them, are convinced that they cannot be held to have operated, unfairly and prejudicially, to appellant\u2019s disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
