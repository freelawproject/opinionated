Ferrara, was convicted by a jury in the district court of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. His principal defense in the district court was that since the detectives did not give him the <em>Miranda, </em>warnings when they stopped and questioned him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>there was a tainting of his subsequent arrest and the evidence obtained pursuant thereto. On appeal, his sole contention is that his arrest was not based upon probable cause and therefore the evidence obtained as a result of a search and seizure incident thereto warrants suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Assuming that appellant laid the necessary groundwork below to raise this issue here, we have concluded, based upon the totality of the evidence and a careful study of the entire record, that there was indeed probable cause for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
