See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\"> This appeal from a decision of the tax court involves a deficiency in the income taxes for the year 1963 in the amount of $119.40 plus interest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">The dispute arose when both of the divorced parents of an infant claimed the child as a dependent for 1963. The tax court concluded that appellant\u2019s former wife contributed more than fifty per cent of the child\u2019s support for the year 1963, and allowed the dependency exemption accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Appellant mounts a vigorous attack on the tax court\u2019s decision from a factual standpoint. His position is without merit. We must accept the findings of the tax court unless such findings are clearly erroneous. C. I. R. v. Duber-stein, 1960, 363 U.S. 278, 290-291, 80 S. Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218; Estate of Broadhead v. C. I. R., 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 841, 843; Sas-Jaworsky v. C. I. R., 5 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 337, 338; Blueberry Land Co. v. C. I. R., 5 Cir., 1966, 361 F.2d 93, 99. The conclusion reached by the tax court was amply supported by the record as a whole and there the matter ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">There is no merit whatever in the other assignment of error that the tax court erred in denying a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
