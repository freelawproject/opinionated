It also ordered payment of interest on the determined deficiency from November 17, 1965, together with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">On this appeal, the defendant coal company challenges the District Court\u2019s fact-findings on the ground that they are not supported by the evidence, and further asserts that the trial court erred (1) in not applying \u201cthe Assembled Industrial Plant doctrine or the cost reproduction depreciated approach\u201d in arriving at the fair market value of the property; and (2) in evaluating the qualifications of expert real estate witnesses and their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-25\">On review of the record, we are of the opinion that it amply supports the District Court\u2019s fact-findings as to the fair market value of the coal breaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-26\">We are further of the opinion that the District Court correctly held that the \u201cfair market value\u201d standard was applicable in the instant case under the specific provisions of the Pennsylvania Deficiency Judgment Act, and that it did not err in its construction and application of the standard as established by Pennsylvania decisions exhaustively discussed in Judge Higginbotham\u2019s carefully considered opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Finally, we deem without merit defendant\u2019s contention that the District Court erred in evaluating the qualifications of the expert witnesses and their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">For the reasons stated, the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
