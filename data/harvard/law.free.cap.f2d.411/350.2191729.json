Although in no way connected with appellant or with appellant\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Volkswagen of America, Inc., he specialized in the repair of Volkswagen and Porsche vehicles, taking as his trade name \u201cModern Volkswagen Porsche Service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">This continued to be his trade name until 1960, during which year, in response to objections from appellant, he changed it to \u201cModern Specialist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">At various times, also in response to appellant\u2019s demands, Church incorporated the word \u201cIndependent\u201d into various phases of his advertising, in order to distinguish his business from those of Volkswagen\u2019s authorized or franchised dealers. Thus he began using this term on his business cards in 1960, in his telephone directory advertisements in 1962, on his truck and on various \u201cgiveaways\u201d such as matchbooks, pencils, paper towels, etc., in 1968. A large sign on the front of his premises continued to read \u201cModern Volkswagen Porsche Service\u201d until after the complaint in this action was filed in 1964, when it was changed to \u201cIndependent Volkswagen Porsche Service.\u201d At about the same time Church began to use the word \u201cIndependent\u201d on his repair order forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The word \u201cVolkswagen\u201d and the initials VW are registered trademarks of appellant, as is the familiar encircled \u201cVW\u201d emblem. Volkswagen advertises extensively concerning the service available from its franchised dealers, which it commonly refers to in these advertisements as \u201cVolkswagen Service\u201d or \u201cVW Service.\u201d Volkswagen contends here, as it did at trial, that Church\u2019s many uses of these phrases, though qualified by the term \u201cIndependent\u201d, are infringements of its registered trademarks \u201cVolkswagen\u201d and \u201cVW.\u201d It further contends that \u201cVolkswagen Service\u201d and \u201cVW Service\u201d, although not registered marks, are terms which have acquired secondary meanings, through use in appellant\u2019s advertising and otherwise, and are so associated in the public mind with Volkswagen and its franchised affiliates that their use by Church constitutes unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">The court below, sitting without a jury, found that while Church\u2019s early use of the word \u201cVolkswagen\u201d as part of his business name was unlawful, none of his subsequent practices infringed Volkswagen\u2019s rights, primarily because Church\u2019s extensive use of the word \u201cIndependent\u201d sufficiently distinguished his business from those affiliated with appellant. The District Court also found that the terms \u201cVolkswagen Service\u201d and \u201cVW Service\u201d did not belong exclusively to Volkswagen, but have \u201ccome to mean in the mind of the public only that the advertiser services Volkswagen vehicles.\u201d (Finding of Fact No. 35.) Volkswagen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>contends that these findings, and the conclusions based thereon, are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">It is not disputed that Church may specialize in the repair of Volkswagen vehicles. He may also advertise to the effect that he does so, and in such advertising it would be difficult, if not impossible, for him to avoid altogether the use of the word \u201cVolkswagen\u201d or its abbreviation <em>\u201cVW,\u201d </em>which are the normal terms which, to the public at large, signify appellant\u2019s cars. <em>Cf. </em>Dodge Bros. v. East, 8 F.2d 872, 876-877 (E.D. N.Y.1925). But these terms are not public property; they are registered trademarks. The goodwill inherent in them is Volkswagen\u2019s property. If another uses the marks in a manner which tends to deceive the public, Volkswagen is entitled to protection. Mershon Co. v. Pachmayr, 220 F.2d 879, 883 (9th Cir. 1955). Although he may advertise to the public that he repairs appellant\u2019s cars, Church must not do so in a manner which is likely to suggest to his prospective customers that he is part of Volkswagen\u2019s organization of franchised dealers and repairmen. Ford Motor Co. v. Helms, 25 F.Supp. 698 (E.D.N.Y.1938); Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co. v. Haber, 7 F. Supp. 791, 792 (E.D.N.Y.1934); see Dodge Bros. v. East, <em>supra, </em>8 F.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The question of whether Church\u2019s business was adequately distinguished from appellant\u2019s is <em>one of </em>fact. Each case of this type must be decided on its own facts, <em>see </em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 314 F.2d 149, 160 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In this case, on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances, we hold that the factual determinations of the District Court were not clearly erroneous. <em>We </em>cannot, therefore, overturn the decision that, in the light of the particular circumstances, Church\u2019s prominent use of the word \u201cIndependent\u201d whenever the terms \u201cVolkswagen\u201d or <em>\u201cVW\u201d </em>appeared in his advertising was sufficient to distinguish his business to the eye of the customer \u201c \u2018exercising that care, caution and power of perception which the public may be expected to exercise in the matter which it has in mind.\u2019 \u201d National Van Lines v. Dean, 237 F.2d 688, 692 (9th Cir., 1956), quoting American Automobile Ass\u2019n v. American Automobile Owners\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 216 Cal. 125, 13 P.2d 707, 710, 83 A.L.R. 699 (1932). It was appropriate for the District Court to weigh all of the pertinent factors. The size, style and appearance of the advertising articles and displays were among these factors. Another was the fact that Church did not use Volkswagen\u2019s distinctive lettering style or color scheme, nor did he display the encircled \u201cVW\u201d emblem. Under this view of the case, we need not reach the question whether the phrases \u201cVolkswagen Service\u201d and \u201cVW Service\u201d have become so identified in the public mind with appellant that their use by others constitutes unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Volkswagen further contends that the trial court erred in failing to enjoin Church\u2019s unlawful past practice of using \u201cVolkswagen\u201d as part of his business name, although he had abandoned this usage at the time of trial. There is little or no evidence in the record casting doubt on Church\u2019s good faith abandonment of this infringement, or indicating that it will be resumed, and thus we are unable to say that the District Court erred in refusing such an injunction. Fram Corp. v. Boyd, 230 F.2d 931, 934 (5th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
