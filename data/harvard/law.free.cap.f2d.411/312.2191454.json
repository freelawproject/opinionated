BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Arv\">CONTEMPT</p>\n<p id=\"b401-27\">This is more fallout from Award 282 and the running, ceaseless, undulating controversy between the Brotherhood of Firemen and the Carriers over unneeded firemen on diesel railroad engines. The twist here is that this appeal tests the correctness of a judgment of criminal contempt against the Brotherhood,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> four subordinate local lodges, and various national and local Brotherhood officials in both their representative and individual capacities. The fines levied, varying from $2,500 to $25,000,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were payable to the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The contempt grew out of alleged violation of a temporary restraining order of March 31, 1966, issued by the District Court in Georgia. The immediate facts out of which it grew are set out in the appeal on the merits, this day decided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The full background is reflected in the opinions of the District of Columbia Circuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The appeal by respondents levels two principal attacks \u2014 first, the denial of a jury trial, and second, lack of due process. Since we conclude that the criminal contempt proceedings lacked the rudiments of due process, we reverse without deciding the jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">As the history reflects, the temporary restraining order allegedly violated was a duplicate, unneeded order. On the eve of expiration of Award 282, (12:01 a. m. March 31) the Nation\u2019s Class I railroads on March 24,1966, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking declaratory and in-junctive relief. On March 28, 1966, Judge Holtzoff, of that Court, issued a temporary' restraining order against BLFE prohibiting a strike upon the expiration of the Award. Subsequently, on March 31, Judge Holtzoff expanded his restraining order to cover any strikes in any way relating to the Award. In the meantime, back on the tracks at 12:01 \u0430. m. on Thursday, March 31,1966, BLFE initiated a strike against the Carriers (including Georgia Central).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">Notwithstanding the sweeping injunction in their favor against BLFE and all of its components issued by Judge Holtz-off, on that very day, Thursday, March 31, 1966, Georgia Central and Southern sought identical injunctive relief against BLFE and its components in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The District Court in Georgia issued ex parte a temporary restraining order on Thursday, March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>31, 1966. This order is at the bottom of this Georgia <em>criminal </em>contempt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The strike, hurriedly called, was hurriedly terminated at midnight, Sunday, April 3. With parallel alacrity so ran the Georgia contempt proceedings including the trial on Monday, April 4. With all of the activity transpiring in the District of Columbia, much was happening down in Georgia. Early on Friday, April 1, 1966, the day after the temporary restraining order was issued by the Georgia District Court, Georgia Central and Southern petitioned for a rule to show cause why BLFE should not be held in criminal contempt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It sought a show cause order under F.R.Crim.P. 42 (b) against BLFE, two named individual officers and all Firemen employees of Georgia Central as a class.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By separate order the Court appointed the Carriers\u2019 attorneys<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to prosecute the criminal contempt, and on their application entered a formal, but uninformative show cause order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On Friday, April 1, BLFE, McCollum and Healan were served with a copy of the contempt show cause order (note 12, <em>supra). </em>Many others were served, some of whom got both the restraining order and the contempt show cause order at the same time.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under the show cause order (note 12, <em>supra) </em>the hearing on the criminal contempt citation was scheduled for Monday morning, April 4. The Court persisted in going on with the trial even though the strike had terminated at midnight Sunday, April 3. On the morning of April 4, 1966, attorneys for BLFE and other contempt defendants filed a motion for continuance with supporting affidavits that many had not been served until late Friday evening, April 1, and others as late as Saturday afternoon, April 2. It remains uncontradicted to this day, as the affidavit set forth, that the defendants had been unable to obtain counsel until Saturday, April 2. Moreover, counsel was unable to obtain a copy of the restraining order or the criminal contempt show cause order until late Saturday evening. The persons involved were scattered throughout the state of Georgia. And with the nationwide strike and all high union officials being preoccupied with it and the proceedings then moving swiftly before Judge Holtzoff (Op. [2]), counsel had much difficulty in communicating with clients to ascertain the facts. Counsel actually had only Sunday, April 3, in which to prepare for trial, which was inadequate for defense of such serious charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">With no showing whatsoever why\u2014 with the strike over, all matters firmly in hand in Judge Holtzoff\u2019s Court in-pluding coercive civil contempt proceedings \u2014 there was any need to go forward on such notice, the Court nevertheless denied the continuance as well as the motion for a jury trial. Judgment came swift and fast on Tuesday, April 5, followed by the significant amendment of Wednesday, April 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Although we think it best that the far-reaching issue of mandatory jury trial in a criminal contempt case arising in the context of the Railway Labor Act ought to be reserved to a case inescapably calling for a resolution then and there, it is appropriate to state here that the problem is formidable with much on the Brotherhood\u2019s side. The problem turns on the \u201carising under this Act\u201d term of \u00a7 11 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 111 (1940), 47 Stat. 72, now recodified in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3692<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to \u201carising under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the laws of the United States governing the issuance of injunctions * * * in any ease involving or growing out of a labor dispute\u201d. The complications are a meld of the <em>United Mine Workers </em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>principle that the \u00a7 11 jury trial provision is unavailing in labor disputes to which the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not \u201capplicable\u201d, the court-developed interplaying accommodation concept that \u00a7 4\u2019s positive withdrawal of Federal Court jurisdiction does not prevent injunctions to compel compliance with specific requirements of the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the nominally contrary notion that other provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, notably \u00a7 8\u2019s clean hands doctrine, control the grant or denial of such permissible injunctive relief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">The Government, through the United States Attorney General as court-invited amicus, sides unequivocally with the appealing Brotherhood\u2019s claim that history, language and purpose mandate a jury trial in criminal, if not civil, contempt proceedings involving Railway Labor Act permitted injunctions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With two voices, if not two hearts, the Government \u201cin the relation of Central of Georgia Railway Company and Southern Railway\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> takes just the opposite view. Intriguing as the problem is, we think it best for us also <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> to defer ruling on it since in our view the contempt judgments must be vacated for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-18\">On a consideration of the whole record we conclude that the proceedings did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>meet the demands of due process as to notice and time.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">To begin in the beginning, the underlying petition filed by the Carriers\u2019 counsel (note 10, <em>swpra) </em>which led to the show cause order (note 12, <em>supra) </em>did not even name specifically 6 of the individual appellants and all 3 of the local lodges found in contempt.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This was no technical omission curable or to be cured by an actual awareness of those whom the blunderbuss class action order (note 12, <em>supra) </em>was intended to drag in. The best proof of the real uncertainty, chaos and confusion, was this exchange to \u201carraign\u201d the respondents when the motion for continuance was denied:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201c * * * so will you let the defendants come forward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Mr. Crawford [Brotherhood counsel]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t know who the defendants are, sir. I never have ascertained that fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s high time you were finding out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Mr. Crawford:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">\u201cThat is what I\u2019ve been trying to find out all morning, sir. In their language, they specify all employees, officers, etc., without naming them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">\u201cYou name them, [Mr. Miller].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Mr. Miller:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-16\">\u201cYes, sir, of course, I am going to name them when he gives me time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-23\">\u201cWhen their names are called, just let them come forward and stand up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-24\">The advice that it was \u201chigh time\u201d was all right in itself. But it had better been addressed to the prosecutors, if not the Court itself. For with the almost limitless variety and extent of the punishment which can come from criminal contempt trials, it is not time enough to know who is being tried when the prosecutor calls out a name. Of course this hurt all. For this rubbed on more than these unnamed individuals (or lodges). Both McCollum and Healan and the National Brotherhood were charged in a representative capacity. Agency was working up and down, down and up. Under the loose charges asserted, the National respondents stood to be condemned for conduct of local persons. Who these were, just who did what and when was a mystery.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-25\">Of course this was but part and parcel of the untimeliness of this hearing. Although people were being served by marshals all across Georgia, there was not only uncertainty as to what was charged. In the pressure of the moments there was difficulty and delay in getting counsel. When employed, counsel could not get a copy of the petition and show cause order until late Saturday. This left only Sunday for preparation for a case that might have resulted in a million dollar fine (see <em>United Mine Workers, </em>note 15 <em>supra). </em>Considering the complex problems unfolding in this dynamic area of contempt<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a working day \u2014 much less a Sunday \u2014 is too little time unless there was some real necessity. Unlike cases stressed by the prosecutors <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the processing of Judge Holtzoff\u2019s civil contempt throughout the weekend, each of which called for haste to <em>secure </em>compliance, here the strike had been terminated the night before. Now a proceeding whose goal is to vindicate the integrity of the Court \u2014 not to force a withheld compliance \u2014 could go forward with an efficient but unhurried deliberateness characteristic of criminal cases in which liberty and other punishment of people is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">With conduct, action, and accountability intertwined in both directions among national and local officials, Brotherhood and local lodges, there was a need for the opportunity for an investigation beyond the activities of local persons in Georgia.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">As we look objectively at this record there is no doubt concerning the genesis of this due process deficiency. It flows directly from the fact that the governance of the whole criminal contempt proceeding was delivered into the hands of counsel for private parties, not the National Sovereign. This transcends the matter of competence, character and professional trustworthiness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, it is the highest claim on the most noble advocate which causes the problem \u2014 fidelity, unquestioned, continuing fidelity to the client. For while we would readily agree on this record that none of these distinguished counselors would have perverted a demand of the law in the prosecution of these respondents simply because it was detrimental to the interest of their railroad clients, the fact is that, continuing as they are in the related <em>merits, </em>case (note 4 <em>supra) </em>to the vigorous support of the Carriers\u2019 positions, they have a duty faithfully to assert every \u2014 the word is every \u2014 contention, refute every \u2014 the word is every \u2014 counter contention which they may legitimately and honorably do, which is disadvantageous to their carrier clients in this controversy. One such objective is to marshal and generate\u2014 through court orders if obtainable \u2014 pressures which will, or may, bring the Brotherhood earlier to book. To move fast, to get punitive orders which might put the Brotherhood in an awkward or disadvantageous position was therefore a desired goal on April 4. On the other hand, as prosecutors for the court, \u2014 !, <em>e. </em>the National Sovereign \u2014 there was an obligation to make sure that the respondents\u2019 rights were scrupulously preserved. No one would suggest now that in any way these fine lawyers submerged one interest over the other. But that is not the point. The point is that those conflicting claims of undivided fidelity present subtle influences on the strongest and most noble of men. The system we prize cannot tolerate the unidentifiable influence of such appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">It is the experience of this Court that the National Sovereign, through its chosen law officers, should be in control of criminal contempt proceedings.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Only in this way can we have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>assurances that the contentions, both factual and legal, of the prosecution are thought by responsible governmental officials to be the policy that the court should adopt. Nothing better illustrates the working of these than the spectacle of the United States speaking with two divergent voices on the jury trial issue (see notes 19 and 20 <em>supra, </em>and related text) ,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and the order (note 11 <em>supra) </em>appointing carrier counsel as prosecutors. On remand, the District Court, if it determines that the prosecution should go forward, should designate the United States Attorney and his Assistants. The case will be fresh for whatever motions or other proceedings are appropriate or required. Bearing certainly on the extent and nature of punishment to be imposed, if and when there is a retrial and second conviction, is the fact that the Holtzoff restraining order and injunction has now been declared invalid by the D. C. Circuit, and that is binding on the carriers here, for noncompliance with \u00a7 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. See Part III, Supplemental Opinion, Op. [1] pp. 613-614. Of course, that Court was careful to point out, consistent with the invulnerability principle (note 20 <em>supra), </em>that by \u201csaying that the restraining order was erroneously entered, we do not mean that would excuse a contemptuous violation.\u201d Op. [1] p. 614. But it would certainly bring into play for evaluation the principle that ultimate declaration of invalidity might have a powerful effect on the kind or extent of punishment, if any, to be meted out.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Of course we intimate no opinion on whether further prosecution should be had or what the outcome in result or penalty should be. These are initially for the District Court starting anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Judgment vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-14\">.

This Court, on seeing that counsel for the parties, not the United States Attorney, had been designated by the Judge to prosecute the contempt, (see note 11 <em>supra) </em>called on the Attorney General to brief and argue the criminal contempt appeal. This followed our rewarding experience in Clark v. Boynton, 5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 992, in which, through court-requested intervention of the Attorney General, the misconceptions of District Court and all counsel in this complex field of contempt were exposed for corrective action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b405-20\">.

[2], Although this was a civil, not criminal, contempt, that court analogized a <em>coercive </em>civil contempt fine to a criminal, punitive, contempt judgment to give the order invulnerability to appellate review of the intrinsic validity of the underlying injunction. See Op. [2] p. 583, and p. 581, and n. 31. This expanded the case into something exceeding a pure civil contempt fine situation and may have led the Supreme Court into its enigmatic deferral of review of the jury trial attack until \u201cnecessary.\u201d The Court vacated its earlier order denying certiorari and in a brief per curiam denied the writ on the ground that the case was not yet ripe for decision, (see note 5 <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"AL8p\">On invulnerability see United States v. United Mine Workers, 1947, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884, recently revitalized in Walker v.

Did the Court intend to forbid all picketing? Or only such as might ultimately be determined to be permissible under the Railway Labor Act. This may, we admit, sound super-technical but so is so much of the folklore of the Railway Labor Act, and it was at least worthy of considered exploration by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\">. No possible whisper of a suggestion of a remote reflection on the counsel (note 11 <em>supra) </em>is intended or implied. The professional, personal competence and character of each of these distinguished Georgia lawyers is well known to this Court. It would have no hesitancy in committing to any or all of them under court-appointment the defense of the most difficult criminal ease. The criticism is not directed to <em>them, </em>but rather to the <em>role </em>assigned them by the District Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b407-13\">.

Had not this Court itself been apprehensive and called on the Attorney General for amicus briefs (see note 18 <em>supra) </em>the position of the \u201cex rel government\u201d presumably would have been that advanced by the prosecutors. Of course, we would have been conscious of their position and would not have credited it as an authoritative \u201cgovernment\u201d position.
