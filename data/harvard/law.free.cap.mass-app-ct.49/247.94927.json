Following the attempt of a bouncer to head off a fight, Whidden, who was taller and heavier than the defendant, approached and stood facing the defendant at a distance of three to four feet. The defendant fired a shot at the floor between Whidden\u2019s legs and said, \u201cDo you want to f_ with me now?\u201d Whidden turned, raised his buttocks in the air, and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stick it in my a_and pull the trigger?\u201d 'Whidden turned again to face the defendant, who, according to one witness, said, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going go kill you, you mother f_,\u2019 or something like that,\u201d then shot him. Whidden stumbled, then took a step toward the defendant, who shot him again twice. The defendant walked out of the bar and left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>jurisdiction. The date of these events was July 1, 1981. Eleven years later, the defendant was found in Canada, living under an alias.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">At his trial, the defendant testified that he had shot Whidden in self-defense \u2014 that Whidden had broken the top off a brandy snifter and, as he approached, was threatening to cut the throats of the defendant and his friend Mike Kelly, who was on the next barstool. That evidence required the judge to instruct the jury on self-defense and on provocation. \u201cInherent in the defendant\u2019s argument that he was not guilty because he had acted in self-defense was his reliance on provocation to mitigate the charge of murder to manslaughter, if the self-defense claim were to fail.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 663 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">This the judge understood. In giving her instructions, however, the judge made the same error that caused the Supreme Judicial Court to reverse the convictions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 715-717 (1998), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carlino, </em>429 Mass. 692, 694-696 (1999), and this court to reverse the conviction in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, ante </em>169 (2000). That is to say, she repeatedly instructed the jury that to prove the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth had an affirmative burden to prove that the defendant killed Whidden as a result of sudden combat in the heat of passion. While it is true that the jury were also instructed correctly that, to prove murder, the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion, our reading of the judge\u2019s whole charge convinces us that the jury retired to consider the case under conflicting impressions regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s burden as to provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>supra. That is borne out by the jury\u2019s return with two questions, whether if they should find the killing was unlawful and there was malice aforethought, \u201cmust we find second degree or can we still consider manslaughter?\u201d; and whether \u201cmitigating circumstances, such as passion, etcetera, . . . negate malice aforethought?\u201d In response, the judge gave supplemental instructions which included one correct and one incorrect statement of the burden of proof regarding provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The confusion in the instructions given here was not uncommon, as is illustrated by the cases cited, as well as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderick, </em>429 Mass. 271, 278 (1999). The same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>confusion will be eliminated in the future by adherence to the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s new model homicide instructions, see Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7 2.4.2 (MCLE 1999), which contain a clear instruction that if there is evidence of provocation the Commonwealth, to sustain a murder charge, has the burden of proving the absence of provocation. If the jury should find that, even though the other elements of murder are present, the Commonwealth has not met that burden, the jury would be justified in finding voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The appeal raises no issue concerning the conviction on the firearms charge, which the defendant in effect conceded at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judgment of guilt of murder in the second degree is reversed, and the case is to stand for further proceedings on the indictment. The judgment of guilt on the firearms charge is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
