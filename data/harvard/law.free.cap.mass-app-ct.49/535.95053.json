L. c. 93A violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">On February 25, 1995, the seller (David) granted to the broker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>(Discover) an exclusive right to sell Lot 1 on Sampson Circle (also known as Sprague Street) in Dedham.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time, a paper street known as Hemlock Street abutted Lot 1 along its entire back length. When the seller entered into the listing agreement with the broker, he represented that he had obtained releases from the three abutting property owners of their rights in Hemlock Street. In fact, this representation was false. Of the three abutters to Hemlock Street, only two had agreed to release their rights and the seller was \u201cin the process of obtaining\u201d the third release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In marketing the property, the broker relied upon this false representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On April 21, 1995, the broker produced the DeChristofaros, buyers who were ready, willing, and able to purchase Lot 1 at a price (the full asking price) and terms agreeable to the seller.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the same day, the seller and the DeChristofaros entered into a purchase and sale agreement in which the seller agreed to pay the broker a commission of $11,250, which was five percent of the sales price.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In paragraph 43 of the purchase and sale agreement, the seller, who was an experienced real estate attorney, warranted and represented that \u201creleases have been received from any abutters having rights in [Hemlock] street and that . . . any releases have been recorded with the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The seller, who did not have the three releases \u201cin hand,\u201d subsequently ignored a number of requests from the DeChristofaros\u2019 attorney to produce copies of the documents allegedly recorded at the registry of deeds. Unable to perform, the seller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>defaulted and returned the DeChristofaros\u2019 deposit. The seller refused to pay the broker\u2019s commission for procuring the DeChristofaros. In the fall of 1995, the broker sold Lot 1 to different buyers and received a \u201cproportional commission\u201d for its role in co-brokering the sale.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Based upon these subsidiary findings, the judge found that the seller had engaged in \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d by misrepresenting the status of the three releases to the broker at the time the listing agreement was executed and at the time the purchase and sale agreement was entered into, and that that misrepresentation had prevented the closing of the DeChristoforo sale. Therefore, she concluded, the broker came within the exception to the <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing </em>rule <em>(Tristram\u2019s Landing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wait, </em>367 Mass. 622, 627 [1975]) requiring that a sale be actually consummated for a commission to be due, and was entitled to the commission specified in the listing agreement. See <em>Hillis </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>421 Mass. 537, 545-546 (1995) (if seller\u2019s wrongful conduct prevents the closing, broker is entitled to commission).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The judge went on, however, to conclude that the seller\u2019s misrepresentation, upon which the broker\u2019s c. 93A claim was premised, did not descend to the level of an unfair and deceptive act or practice within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), because she found that the elusive third release was unnecessary to sell Lot 1 as a marketable title.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The findings, as they now stand on the record before us, are sketchy and ambivalent and do not support that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">First, the judge\u2019s c. 93A analysis is devoid of any reference to or acknowledgment of her earlier findings concerning the seller\u2019s \u201cfalse representation\u201d of fact, his \u201cwrongful conduct,\u201d and the broker\u2019s rebanee upon the seller\u2019s misrepresentation in marketing the property and inducing the DeChristofaros to enter the purchase and sales agreement. Those subsidiary findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>conflict with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the seller\u2019s conduct was not unfair or deceptive. Compare <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 616-619 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Second, the judge\u2019s finding that the third release was \u201cnot necessary in order to sell Lot 1 with clean title,\u201d if read as a finding that the seller\u2019s false representation was immaterial, does not comport with her earlier finding that the same misrepresentation prevented the DeChristofaro sale from closing, thereby entitling the broker to a commission. To the extent that the language is read as a finding that the broker suffered no detriment from the seller\u2019s misrepresentation, that conclusion is contradicted by her earlier ruling and finding that the broker was entitled to a full commission of $11,250 with respect to the DeChristofaro transaction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The reasons the judge concluded that the seller\u2019s misrepresentation did not constitute a c. 93A violation were ultimately left unexplained in her decision. Compare <em>Heller Financial </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. America, </em>410 Mass. 400, 409 (1991); <em>Shawmut Community Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Zagami, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 371, 375-377 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>411 Mass. 807 (1992). We appreciate that \u201cnot every unlawful act is automatically an unfair (or deceptive) one under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Mechanics Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Killeen, 377 </em>Mass. 100, 109 (1979). <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979). However, if that is the basis for the judge\u2019s decision, it requires further explication.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment on count V finding the seller not liable for a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and remand the case for a reconsideration of the findings and conclusions under the appropriate standard and for a clarification and more comprehensive and connected explanation of the c. 93A subsidiary findings with respect to the issues of materiality, causation, and detriment. The judgments on the other claims are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The second issue raised on appeal by the plaintiff broker \u2014 whether the judge erred in finding that an agreement concerning payment of a commission had been modified \u2014 raises a question of fact. See <em>Roddy &amp; McNulty Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. A.A. <em>Proctor &amp; Co., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 536 (1983). A judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Lubin &amp; Meyer, P.C. </em>v. <em>Lubin, </em>427 Mass. 304, 308 (1998). As the plaintiff has failed to provide this court with a transcript of the evidence presented at trial, we are unable to assess whether any of the findings were clearly erroneous, and we assume that the findings are adequately supported by the evidence. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>400 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In the listing agreement, the seller agreed to pay the broker a five percent commission if during the listing period the broker procured a buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase the property on terms and at a price acceptable to the seller, <em>regardless of whether the transaction proceeded.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The seller\u2019s efforts to obtain the third release ultimately failed. The judge did not make any finding as to whether the seller\u2019s representation was made negligently, recklessly, or intentionally. For purposes of this appeal, we have assumed that the judge found implicitly that the misrepresentation <em>to the broker </em>was made negligently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The DeChristofaros, who had apparently expressed deep concern about the possibility of strangers traipsing all over the backyard of Lot 1, had been assured by the broker and the seller that the paper street had been abandoned by the town of Dedham and that the seller had obtained <em>in hand </em>the necessary releases from any abuttors who had rights in the street. This assurance, the judge found, induced the DeChristofaros to enter into the final purchase and sales contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The exact amount of that commission is not disclosed on this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">So far as appears on the record before us, in order to resolve the issue of the broker\u2019s entitlement to a commission, there was no need to reach the issue whether the seller\u2019s conduct fell within the <em>Hillis </em>exception. Pursuant to the express terms of the listing agreement executed by the seller, the broker was entitled to a commission upon the procurement of a ready, willing, and able buyer without the necessity of title actually passing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\">In making her c. 93A fairness determination, the judge applied an incorrect standard. The judge should have focused on \u201cthe nature of [the] challenged conduct and on the purpose and effect of that conduct.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Propac-Mass, Inc., </em>420 Mass. 39, 42 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">As to detriment, there was testimony that the broker was concerned about the loss of his professional reputation in the brokerage community. Compare <em>Bump </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 310-312 (1987) (broker undertook a course of conduct \u2014 unknowingly disseminating false information to prospective buyers that had been provided by the seller \u2014 he would not otherwise have followed).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
