(BAA Massachusetts), SLJ Group, Inc., doing business as Lionstone International (Lion-stone), and AB Logistics, Inc., doing business as Adcom Express (Adcom), have appealed from a Superior Court decision allowing the motion of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) for judgment on the pleadings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with respect to the three consolidated cases. The Superior Court affirmed the commission\u2019s decisions which (i) revoked the package store license of BAA Massachusetts, (ii) revoked Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance to export alcoholic beverages from Illinois into Massachusetts, and (iii) suspended Adcom\u2019s permit to transport alcoholic beverages within the Commonwealth for six days.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Certain material facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beer Across America, Inc., an Illinois corporation (BAA Illinois), in conjunction with various other entities, operates Beer Across America, a mail order beer and wine of the month club, throughout the United States. In December, 1994, BAA Illinois first submitted to the commission a proposal to operate a mail order beer and wine of the month club business within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">The commission has described the Massachusetts \u201cthree-tier\u201d requirements for a mail order business originating with an out-of-State supplier and directed to Massachusetts consumers:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">1. A supplier (i.e., certificate of compliance holder, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18B<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) furnishes the product to:</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>2. A wholesaler/importer (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), which is licensed to sell to:</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">3. A Massachusetts retail licensee (either a \u201cpouring license\u201d under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, or a \u201cpackage store license\u201d under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15), which is licensed to sell to a consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The commission\u2019s description continues: \u201cThe out of state supplier must be a Certificate of Compliance Holder in Massachusetts. The beer must be imported into the State by a licensed Massachusetts Wholesaler/importer and sold to a properly licensed Massachusetts package store. Only a properly licensed Massachusetts package store may sell beer to consumers. The beer may be delivered to consumers only by vehicles properly licensed with a valid Massachusetts transportation permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">On April 6, 1995, the commission and the plaintiffs signed an \u201cAgreement and Approval\u201d (Approval) detailing the conditions under which the commission would permit the operation of a beer and wine of the month club business in the Commonwealth. According to the Approval, BAA Illinois would provide marketing services for the business; Lionstone, the holder of a certificate of compliance, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>would be the supplier, exporting alcoholic beverages from Illinois into the Commonwealth; the wholesaler/importer would be International Beverage, Inc. (International), the holder of a \u00a7 18 license, see note 6, <em>supra-, </em>the retail package store receiving beverages from International would be BAA Massachusetts (referred to in the Approval by a predecessor\u2019s name<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>), the holder of a package store license under c. 138, \u00a7 15; and the express transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>company which would deliver the alcoholic beverages to Massachusetts consumers would be Adcom, the holder of a permit to transport and deliver alcoholic beverages in Massachusetts. See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 22. The signatory parties, including BAA Illinois, Lionstone, International, and Adcom, each agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Approval recites that \u201c[a]ny deviation from this Approval,\u201d or any deviation from any regulation of the commission, or any regulation of the local licensing authority, \u201cby BAA [Illinois] or any other participant shall be grounds for disciplinary action, jointly and severally against BAA [Illinois] or any other participant, including . . . revocation of license and withdrawal of this Approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">1. <em>Scope of review. </em>Our review of the commission\u2019s decisions under the Liquor Control Act, G. L. c. 138, is undertaken within the context of the commission\u2019s considerable statutory powers. \u201cRegulation of the liquor industry in Massachusetts is comprehensive and pervasive. See G. L. c. 138. \u2018The powers of the States in dealing with the regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors are very broad. What they may wholly prohibit, they may permit only on terms and conditions prescribed by the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cellarmaster Wines of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (1989), quoting from <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>334 Mass. 613, 619 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 44, confers upon the commission \u201cgeneral supervision of the conduct of the business of . . . selling alcoholic beverages . . . .\u201d See <em>Howard Johnson Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 491 (1987). The commission also has \u201ccomprehensive powers of supervision over licensees, including the power to revoke, modify, or suspend licenses. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), \u201cpermits the commission\u2019s decision to be set aside if based upon an error of law . . . .\u201d <em>Van Munching Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 310 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">2. <em>Revocation of Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Based on uncontradicted evidence at the hearings held on July 22, 1997, and November 18, 1997, the commission found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>that on January 14, 1997, the cargo of a truck operated by Trans-Continental Distributors, Inc. (Trans-Continental), was unloaded into the delivery door of Adcom in East Boston. Investigators of the commission who witnessed the unloading identified themselves and asked the driver to produce his license, registration, and transportation permit under G. L. c. 38, \u00a7 22, which requires each \u201cgeneral express or trucking business\u201d to obtain and carry a permit in order to \u201ctransport and deliver alcoholic beverages\u201d within the Commonwealth. The driver produced his license and the registration, but he was unable to produce a \u00a7 22 permit. The driver also produced a bill of lading (signed by Tony Cortez on behalf of BAA Massachusetts) which showed that the truck had transported and delivered 1,496 packages of alcoholic beverages from Lionstone, of Lake Bluffs, Illinois, to International, in Holbrook, Massachusetts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The interstate carrier, Trans-Continental, carried Lionstone\u2019s alcoholic beverages from Illinois and delivered the cargo in Massachusetts, and under the eighth paragraph of \u00a7 22, the <em>knowing </em>transportation of such beverages in the Commonwealth without a permit is punishable by a fine or imprisonment. Transcontinental (not a party to these proceedings) was obviously in violation of \u00a7 22, and the commission concluded that Lionstone was also in violation of \u00a7 22 because the carrier, Transcontinental, was in violation of the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On that basis, the commission revoked Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance. The judge concluded, and the commission now argues, that without such an interpretation of \u00a7 22, Lionstone would be \u201ccircumventing\u201d the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Section 22, as previously stated, requires carriers transporting alcoholic beverages in Massachusetts to obtain a permit from the commission, and any carrier that \u201cknowingly\u201d fails to comply with the permit requirement is subject to a fine or imprisonment. The thrust of \u00a7 22 is to put the burden of obtaining a permit squarely on the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We look to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18B (the section under which Lion-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>stone received its certificate of compliance and which governs the conduct of a certificate holder), to determine the statutory duties of holders of a certificate of compliance such as Lionstone. Certificate holders are required to submit to the commission periodically information concerning \u201call shipments or sales of alcoholic beverages made by him to <em>licensees in this commonwealth, </em>and that he comply with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations made under authority contained therein <em>which pertain to a licensee of the same class, </em>type or character, doing business in this commonwealth under a license issued by the commission\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no provision in \u00a7 18B that establishes the duty of the holder of a certificate of compliance to determine \u2014 at the certificate holder\u2019s risk of non-compliance with \u00a7 18B and the revocation of its certificate of compliance \u2014 whether the carrier it hires for a shipment into Massachusetts has a \u00a7 22 permit. See and compare <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Norwood Country Club, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 126, 133 (1996) (the court declined the commission\u2019s suggestion that G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, which prohibits sales to any person under the age of twenty-one, means that a licensee is required \u201c \u2018to exercise reasonable . . . care in preventing the delivery of liquor to a minor,\u2019 \u201d since the statute contains no language requiring the exercise of reasonable care). Moreover, Lionstone delivered to Adcom, and it was Adcom who did possess a \u00a7 22 permit (and who delivered to a minor as described below). The Approval is <em>silent </em>as to the duties of Lionstone regarding the common carrier it engages to transport alcoholic beverages to a Massachusetts carrier holding a \u00a7 22 permit such as Adcom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">So too, there is no provision in \u00a7 22 (providing for the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>anee of permits to carriers) which places <em>any </em>burden, or responsibility, on the person or entity delivering alcoholic beverages to a carrier, here, Lionstone, for transportation within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">To treat the failure of Trans-Continental to obtain a permit as the failure of Lionstone is to make Lionstone absolutely hable for the omission of an act which it had no obligation to perform under the statutes of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The commission\u2019s decision revoking Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance was based upon an error of law, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">3. <em>The six-day suspension of Adcom\u2019s transportation permit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Based on uncontradicted evidence at the hearing before the commission on November 18, 1997, the commission found these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">On December 16, 1996, a nineteen year old woman, who was working as a decoy for the commission, telephoned Beer Across America in Illinois (described more fully below) and placed an order for alcoholic beverages to be delivered to her. The order was for a three-month membership. When the order was placed, the decoy was asked whether she was over twenty-one. She replied in the afiSrmative. The order was accepted by a credit card charge of $24.95 in favor of \u201cBeer Across America, Lake Bluff Ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">On January 10, 1997, an Adcom employee delivered two packages of beer to the decoy\u2019s house in Massachusetts. The employee asked the decoy whether she was over twenty-one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>and she again replied in the affirmative. The employee then asked the decoy for identification, and she refused. After the Adcom employee informed her that identification was necessary to complete the delivery, she instructed the employee to take the beer back. The employee thereupon left the beer with the decoy without obtaining any identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">On these facts the commission concluded that Adcom had violated G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, which prohibits the sale or delivery of alcoholic beverages to a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Adcom argues that the commission\u2019s decisions were \u201c[m]ade upon unlawful procedure,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(d), because the sting operation conducted against the plaintiffs violated commission guidelines.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiffs assert that commission investigators instructed a minor to misrepresent her age during a sting operation in violation of a guideline requirement that \u201c[a]t no time shall the underage person attempt to misrepresent their age or provide any identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The sting guidelines provide that they are to be \u201cused when conducting underage drinking stings <em>on licensed </em>premises\u201d (emphasis added). The sting operation in this case occurred at private, not licensed, premises, and the guidelines were inapplicable to the events relied upon by the commission.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">There was no entrapment, as Adcom claims. Its employee was instructed by the decoy to take back the beer, but instead the employee insisted on leaving the package with the decoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">The commission\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence, and because there was no error of law, the commission was justified in ruling that Adcom had violated G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, which prohibits the sale or delivery of alcoholic beverages to a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">4. <em>Revocation of the license of BAA Massachusetts. </em>After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>hearings held on July 22, 1997, and November 18, 1997, the commission found that a customer in Massachusetts desiring to place an order would call an \u201c800\u201d number for Beer Across America. A customer calling this number would reach a customer service representative in Illinois.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The customer\u2019s order would then be received and accepted by BAA Illinois in Illinois and paid for by a credit card charge in favor of \u201cBeer Across America, Inc., and Beer Across America, Lake Bluff, Illinois,\u201d and not in favor of BAA Massachusetts, the licensed package store in Massachusetts. On these subsidiary findings, the commission, relying on G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15 (sales of alcoholic beverages shall be conclusively presumed to have been made in the store wherein the order was received from the customer), concluded that BAA Massachusetts had made sales of alcoholic beverages \u201cat other than the described licensed premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The commission was in error. The order of a customer was, as the commission found, \u201ctaken and received\u201d by BAA Illinois in Illinois, and the order was accepted, and payment was received, in Illinois. There was no sale of alcoholic beverages by BAA Massachusetts; indeed, as discussed below, BAA Massachusetts had ceased to conduct its licensed business. Thus, the presumption imposed by \u00a7 15 is not applicable to BAA Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The commission made additional findings of fact regarding BAA Massachusetts which do justify the action taken by the commission. BAA Massachusetts held a license to sell beer and wine for off-premises consumption at 50 Terminal Street in Charlestown. Undisputed evidence established that BAA Massachusetts kept no inventory of alcoholic beverages, no implements of sale of alcoholic beverages, and no telephones at its licensed location. At the time of the commission\u2019s investigation, the licensed site was being used as storage space for another company. These observations were made on January 14, 1997, January 17, 1997, and January 24, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">While shipments of alcoholic beverages stopped at the licensed location in Charlestown, they were neither inspected by BAA Massachusetts employees nor unloaded at that point. BAA Massachusetts merely paid an employee (Tony Cortez) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the warehouse in which BAA Massachusetts was located to sign for deliveries to BAA Massachusetts and send them along to their next destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The license manager was interviewed on February 3, 1997. She admitted that she had not been to the licensed premises since early December, 1996, and that the premises were not open for business a minimum of thirty-five hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The commission found that the license manager did not know, or was not sure of, any of the following pieces of information: who pays for the transportation of the alcoholic beverages from BAA Massachusetts to the licensed express company used by BAA Massachusetts to make its deliveries to its Massachusetts consumers; who pays for deliveries of alcoholic beverages to BAA Massachusetts; how BAA Massachusetts receives payment for the product it sells; how a Massachusetts consumer places an order to purchase alcoholic beverages with BAA Massachusetts; or who pays her for her work at BAA Massachusetts. The commission found that there was no credible effort to rehabilitate the license manager, or to mitigate the effect of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">On these subsidiary findings, for which there was substantial evidence, the commission justifiably concluded that BAA Massachusetts had ceased to conduct its licensed business in Massachusetts. For that reason, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 77 (a licensing authority may cancel any license issued under c. 138 \u201cif the licensee ceases to conduct the licensed business\u201d), authorized the commission to cancel the license of BAA Massachusetts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Moreover, paragraph 18 of the Approval expressly contemplated that BAA Massachusetts would receive all new orders for packaged beer commencing with the issuance of its \u00a7 15 license. As stated above, new orders were not received or accepted by BAA Massachusetts. Paragraph 18 of the Approval was violated, and under the express provisions of paragraph 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>of the Approval, see note 18 and related text, <em>infra, </em>BAA Massachusetts was responsible for that violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">5. <em>Sanctions. </em>BAA Massachusetts challenges the commission\u2019s revocation of its package store license as unreasonably harsh. A reviewing court will not, however, interfere with the agency\u2019s imposition of a penalty except in the most extraordinary circumstances, <em>Vaspourakan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 347, 355 (1987), citing <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 528-529 (1979), and there are no such circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 77, described above, specifically authorizes the commission to cancel a license if it finds that a licensee has ceased to conduct its licensed business. Because the revocation was authorized by the statute, it has a reasonable relation to the plaintiff\u2019s unlawful conduct. See <em>Blue Moon Saloon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 890, 891 (1980). Even the Approval, upon which the plaintiff relies, authorizes the revocation of the plaintiffs\u2019 respective licenses if any of the plaintiffs violate the terms of the Approval or statutory requirements.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Given that the range of penalties is for the agency, the fact that the commission imposed more lenient penalties for similar violations in the past does not render the sanctions against the plaintiffs arbitrary or capricious. See <em>Vaspourakan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. at 355 n.7. Thus, the discipline imposed by the commission did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Thq commission\u2019s decision revoking Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance is reversed; its order suspending the license of Adcom for six days is affirmed; and its decision revoking the license of BAA Massachusetts is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The pleadings included the entire administrative record. Our review is confined to that record. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The commission issued three decisions, one for each of the three actions taken by it. The preliminary facts we recite are gathered from the three decisions of the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The commission\u2019s description, which was admitted as an exhibit, appears in a letter dated April 5, 1995, from the commission to a third party which had inquired about the legal requirements affecting an out-of-State supplier who desired to engage in a mail order beer business in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Section 18B provides, in part, \u201cThe commission shall issue a certificate of compliance to a licensee having a place of business located, and a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>granted, outside the commonwealth and whose license authorizes the exportation or sale of alcoholic beverages to licensees in this commonwealth . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Section 18, in part, authorizes the issuance of licenses to importers and wholesalers for the purpose of selling alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, to businesses holding licenses for the resale of such beverages to consumers either on premises (\u201cpouring licenses\u201d) or off premises (\u201cpackage store licenses\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b869-11\">At the time the commission issued the Approval, Great American Beers, Limited (GAB), a retail package store licensed under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, to sell alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption at 50 Terminal Street in Charlestown, Massachusetts, received and filled orders in the Commonwealth for Beer Across America. While the Approval permitted GAB to fulfill existing orders, it explicitly required that BAA Illinois apply for and obtain a retail package store license prior to accepting any new orders from Massachusetts customers. Because retail licenses can only be held by Massachusetts corporations, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, BAA Illinois incorporated BAA Massachusetts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>whose two individual stockholders (so the commission found) obtained a license to run a package store at GAB\u2019s former location in Charlestown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Presumably, Trans-Continental carried the cargo from International\u2019s premises in Holbrook, to BAA Massachusetts in Charlestown, and from there to Adcom\u2019s premises in East Boston.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The commission also relied on \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 41 of G. L. c. 138. Neither section is applicable here. Section 41 makes the delivery of alcoholic beverages from any commercial structure \u201cprima facie evidence that such delivery is a sale.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The term \u201clicensee\u201d in \u00a7 18B is a term of art referring to the holder of an importer\u2019s or wholesaler\u2019s license under \u00a7 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Paragraph 16 of the Approval \u2014 upon which the judge relied \u2014 provides, \u201cDeliveries shall be made only in vehicles carrying a valid transportation permit.\u201d However, paragraph 7 of the Approval, which discusses common carriers, makes no reference to Lionstone, and instead refers only to Adcom and SNAP Express Corporation (SNAP) of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, each of which had a \u00a7 22 permit. Paragraph 14 provides that Adcom and SNAP are responsible to conform to Massachusetts law and will be responsible for any \u201cdelivery to underage persons.\u201d Paragraph 15 provides that Adcom and SNAP \u201cshall deliver only in-person and shall make such delivery only to individuals 21 years of age or older.\u201d It is in this context that we construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>paragraph 16 to refer only to deliveries made by Adcom and SNAP to the consumer and not to out-of-State deliveries made by Lionstone to an intermediate carrier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Furthermore, although paragraph 1 of the Approval authorizes the commission to revoke all licenses and permits in the event that any \u201cparticipant\u201d is in violation of Massachusetts law or the commission\u2019s regulations, Transcontinental was not a \u201cparticipant\u201d involved in the agreement. We note also that the commission did not invoke its power under paragraph 1 as against Lion-stone based on violations by Adcom and BAA Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The commission\u2019s decision to revoke Lionstone\u2019s certificate of compliance was based upon two additional reasons which the commission subsequently abandoned. See note 17, <em>infra. </em>Thus, our reversal on the grounds indicated in the text is sufficient to nullify the commission\u2019s conclusion that Lionstone \u201cshows a systemic disregard for the requirements of the lawful conduct of business in Massachusetts under the Liquor Control Act,\u201d and to reverse the judgment against Lionstone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The sting guidelines, which were attached as an addendum to the commission\u2019s brief, were never made part of the administrative record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Core, </em>370 Mass. 369, 371 (1976) (generally, an addendum to a brief which has not been made part of the record is not properly before the reviewing court). Both the plaintiffs and the commission, however, refer to these guidelines in support of their assertions, and there is no dispute as to the accuracy of the guidelines. Thus, we consider the sting guidelines as if they were part of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">Adcom also argues that the sale to the decoy was a sale for the use of the commission and therefore not a sale for the use of a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 34. That argument was rejected in <em>Fran\u2019s Lunch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>45 Mass.

In the Superior Court the commission stated that it would not, as a result of a decision in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, rely on these alleged violations to justify its decisions sanctioning these two companies. In its appellate brief, the commission explains that because it did not rely on these alleged violations in the Superior Court, it does not rely on them in this court. Thus, we make no comment on these alleged violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">As set forth earlier in this opinion, the first paragraph of the Approval provided that \u201c[a]ny deviation from this Approval, any regulation of the [commission], any regulation of the local licensing authority or any law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by [BAA Illinois] or any other participant shall be grounds for disciplinary action, jointly and severally against [the participants], including but not limited to revocation of license and withdrawal of this Approval.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
