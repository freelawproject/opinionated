The judge restored to the jury two of the women whom the defense had challenged, and both sides thereafter announced themselves content with the jury\u2019s makeup. After five days of trial, the jury returned verdicts for all defendants. The plaintiff now urges as her sole ground on appeal that the jury was unconstitutionally purged of women. We decide that the plaintiff waived unspoken objections, if any, that she had to the composition of the jury, and we affirm the judgments. The nature of the case on trial was an action claiming unlawful discharge by the University of Massachusetts Medical School in retaliation for the plaintiff having made a complaint that her department chairmen had created a sexually hostile working environment. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>In the recent case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 Mass. 804, 807-811 (2000), the court reviewed in some detail and brought current the law, first announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), that governs the prohibition against the use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of discrete groups from juries solely on the basis of that group membership. Gender is such a discrete group. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>429 Mass. 313, 319 (1999). We need not cover all the ground of the <em>Rodriguez </em>opinion. By way of summary, after the judge recognizes a prima facie pattern of group exclusion, the burden shifts to the party exercising the peremptory challenge to provide a legitimate reason for that challenge, one that is personal to the juror rather than based on the juror\u2019s group affiliation. The judge then makes a finding whether the challenge was legitimate or a pretext for group exclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>431 Mass. at 808-809, and cases cited. Civil litigants, as well as parties in criminal cases, are entitled to a jury that has not been unfairly skewed. <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 128 (1994). See <em>Edmonson </em>v. <em>Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 627-628 (1991). Cf. <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 170-171 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">1. <em>The jury impanelment. </em>In the instant case, there were fifty-five persons on the venire when jury selection began: thirty-four men and twenty-one women. Of those fifty-five, the judge determined that twenty-eight stood indifferent: twenty-one men and seven women. Ten men and four women were then seated.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The plaintiff exercised seven peremptory challenges, six against men and one against a woman. Five men and two women replaced the jurors who had been challenged. The plaintiff then challenged one of the male replacements, and a woman took his place. Now the jury stood at eight men and six women and the plaintiff pronounced herself content. When defense counsel made her peremptory challenges, they were directed against five of the women who had been seated in the jury box. The judge\u2019s antennae went up; he called defense counsel to the side bar and asked her why she had challenged \u201cevery woman on the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel protested, \u201cMy reasons had nothing to do with gender, nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Defense counsel explained that the first two jurors she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>challenged worked at nearby colleges and might not put aside policies and procedures they had become familiar with which differ from those of the University of Massachusetts. As to the third juror that she had struck, defense counsel explained that the juror was unsatisfactory because she was a housewife. The fourth struck was unsatisfactory because she worked, and the fifth because she worked in an industry that was prone to complaints of sexual harassment. Counsel for the plaintiff remarked: \u201c[Tjhey don\u2019t want women who work in similar jobs, they don\u2019t want women who work in different jobs, they don\u2019t want women who don\u2019t work at all. What\u2019s left?\u201d The trial judge agreed. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears to me you\u2019re knocking off all the women. That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d The judge decided, however, to let the challenges stand until the remainder of the impanelment played out. The five challenged women were replaced by five men and the jury then stood at thirteen men and one woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">At that point in the impanelment process, plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested a mistrial. The judge expressed his displeasure with the last round of challenges. Defense counsel again protested that her motives were pure. The judge said he was prepared to accept the first three challenges by the defense<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but was bothered by the last two, and that he thought it was clear what defense counsel was trying to do. At that point, defense counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cPut them back on if that is going to create some issue on appeal that is worrisome to Your Honor. Let them back on</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel said, \u201cI would prefer to put them back.\u201d The two prospective women jurors were identified and reseated, replacing the last two men chosen from the venire. The judge asked, \u201cIs that everything now?\u201d to which plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cThe plaintiff is content.\u201d The defendants also pronounced themselves satisfied. The jurors \u2014 eleven men and three women \u2014 were sworn, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>This is not a case like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fruchtman, </em>418 Mass. 8, 12 &amp; n.7, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 951 (1994), in which the defense claimed it had been denied peremp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>tory challenges, made objections to those denials at trial, but declared itself content with a jury ultimately chosen. The objection, having been lodged, was not lost. The defense could be read as content, but under protest, much as a party who makes an unsuccessful request for a jury instruction need not announce further objection to the judge\u2019s failure to give the desired instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Biancardi, </em>421 Mass. 251, 254 (1995). Here, the judge, when he said he was putting two of the five challenged jurors back, also asked, \u201cIs that everything now?\u201d If the plaintiff objected to all or any of the other three challenges of women, that was the time to say so. Instead, plaintiff\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cThe plaintiff is content.\u201d Cf. <em>Caldwell </em>v. Maloney, 159 F.3d 639, 647 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1009 (1999) (both parties declared themselves content, but before the jury were sworn, the defendant restated his objection that all persons of color on the venire had been peremptorily challenged).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">An objection to any aspect of how a judge conducts a trial must be made sufficiently timely so that the judge can reflect upon the objection and correct a mistake. Rule 46 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 811 (1974), embodies this principle in civil cases. The rule dispenses with formal objections to rulings but requires \u201cthat a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, make[] known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court and his grounds therefor . . . .\u201d The trial judge in this case had broad discretion in diagnosing and remedying the efforts of a party to exclude women from the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 101-102 (1993). If the plaintiff had an objection to the composition of the jury, she waived it by unmistakably letting the judge understand that he had remedied the defendants\u2019 attempt to purge the jury of women. She led the judge and the jurors into a five-day trial. She may not now base an appeal on objection to the composition of the jury, an issue that had been raised and resolved to the plaintiff\u2019s apparent satisfaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Parenthetically, the trial judge dealt appropriately with the selection of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Actually, counsel had left unchallenged one woman juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">At an earlier stage of the proceedings the judge had remarked as to the third juror challenged by the defense, \u201cI don\u2019t buy the reason you\u2019re giving me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">At the time plaintiff\u2019s counsel expressed himself content with the jury, he still had several peremptory challenges to bum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
