The landlord claimed an ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>rearage of $9,340 through April, 1998. The tenants filed counterclaims alleging (1) violations of the State Sanitary Code, including the presence of lead paint in their unit; (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14); and (3) retaliation (G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">A trial was held before a judge of the Worcester Housing Court. In his written decision, the judge concluded that the landlord was entitled to back rent in the amount of $8,970.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He found for the tenants on their counterclaim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in the amount of $2,700, and he awarded the tenants $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. See G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. The judge concluded that under G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, he would enter a judgment for possession in favor of the landlord unless the tenants paid the sum of $6,270<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the landlord within seven days of their receipt of the decision. The tenants did not pay the landlord within the specified time period, and judgment for possession was subsequently entered for the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On appeal, the tenants argue that (1) the landlord\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed because it was retaliatory; (2) the amount of back rent awarded to the landlord should have been based solely on the portion of the rent that they were obligated to pay as subsidized tenants rather than on the full contract rent payable by the tenants <em>and </em>by the Worcester Housing Authority (WHA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; (3) the damage award on their counterclaim was improperly calculated, as the trial judge simply awarded them three months\u2019 rent without making any findings regarding actual damages; (4) the trial judge abused his discretion in awarding them only $1,000 in attorney\u2019s fees; and (5) the trial judge should have granted their motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">1. <em>The facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the judge. The tenants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> moved into their unit in July, 1996. The monthly rent provided in the \u201cSection 8\u201d lease, see <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Fall River </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Hous. Authy., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 304 (1989); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301 et seq. (1995), was $900 (the contract rent) payable in part by the tenant and in part by the WHA. Initially, the tenants\u2019 share of the rent was $370<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> per month, but after July 1, 1997, their share was decreased to $330 per month. The balance of the rent was to be paid by the WHA with rent subsidy funds provided by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under a program of aid for the rehabilitation of existing housing. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>On June 28, 1996, the landlord and the WHA entered into a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract, under which the WHA agreed initially to pay $530 of the contract rent per month. The amount of the monthly housing assistance payment was subject to change during the term of the HAP contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The tenants made their last rent payment in February, 1997. They stopped paying rent because they learned that four of their eight children had elevated levels of lead in their blood. At trial, the landlord testified that the WHA made its last subsidy payment in August, 1997. The WHA had ceased making the subsidy payments because the tenants\u2019 unit had not been satisfactorily deleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The judge found that the landlord failed to inform the tenants of the presence of lead paint in their unit at the beginning of their tenancy and that the landlord had neglected to give the tenants the notice that was required before any work was done on the premises. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 197A. The judge also found that the deleading process was undertaken by two licensed deleaders and by the landlord and his family members who worked as \u201ctrained low risk\u201d deleaders and that this process took \u201can unreasonably long time.\u201d The judge also observed that the attitude of the tenants toward the deleading work and repair that needed to be done was \u201cgenerally confrontational and marginally cooperative.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on these findings, the judge concluded that there had been a substantial interference with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tenants\u2019 right to quiet enjoyment of the premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">2. <em>Landlord\u2019s back rent award. </em>The judge found that the landlord was entitled to recover $8,970 in back rent. In calculating this award, the judge held the tenants liable for the entire amount of the contract rent ($900 per month) from September, 1997, through April, 1998. This included the months in which the WHA did not make subsidy payments to the landlord (as described below). The tenants argue that any award of back rent to the landlord should be limited to that portion of the rent for which the tenants were individually responsible under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The landlord claims that he is entitled to recover the full contract rent from the tenants for all of the months in which the WHA did not make subsidy payments. Under the HAP contract between the landlord and the WHA, the WHA had the right to stop subsidy payments to the landlord if the tenants\u2019 unit was not maintained in a satisfactory manner. The landlord claims that he attempted to maintain the premises in a satisfactory manner but was prevented from doing so by the tenants. Because the tenants engaged in \u201cconfrontational and marginally cooperative\u201d conduct, the landlord argues that the tenants should be held accountable for the consequences of such conduct, including the payment of the entire contract rent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reject the argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">First, the judge did not find that the \u201cmarginal\u201d conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the tenants interfered with the performance of the landlord\u2019s obligations, and the landlord\u2019s contrary assertion is purely speculative. More important is the fact that there is no provision in the lease which provides for liability of the tenants for the entire contract rent in the event the WHA terminates its housing subsidy payments. Indeed, the lease between the landlord and the tenants provides that \u201c[t]he tenant rent as determined by the [WHA] is the <em>maximum amount </em>the Landlord can require the Tenant to pay as rent for the dwelling unit\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, the HAP contract between the WHA and the landlord provides that \u201c[t]he family is not responsible for payment of the portion of contract rent covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the [WHA]. The owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the [WHA] housing assistance payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The language contained in these documents is unambiguous, and it is \u201celementary that an unambiguous agreement must be enforced according to its terms.\u201d <em>Schwanbeck </em>v. <em>Federal-Mogul Corp., </em>412 Mass. 703, 706 (1992). See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1999). Regardless of the \u201cmarginally cooperative\u201d conduct of the tenants during the deleading process, and even though the WHA terminated the HAP contract with the landlord and ceased making subsidy payments, the tenants never assumed the responsibility of paying the entire contract rent and cannot be forced to do so now.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Federal regulations regarding the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s housing assistance program are consistent with the conclusion we have reached. For example, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 982.310(b)(1) and 982.451(b)(4)(iii) (1995) both provide that \u201c[t]he family is not responsible for payment of the portion of . . . rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract between the owner and the [housing authority].\u201d Furthermore, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.310(b)(2) (1995) provides that \u201c[t]he [housing authority\u2019s] failure to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the housing assistance payment to the owner is not a violation of the lease between the tenant and the owner. During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the . . . housing assistance payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the tenants may be held liable only for that portion of the contract rent that they assumed and agreed to pay. As a result, the landlord is entitled to recover $370 per month from March, 1997, through June, 1997, which amounts to $1,480. He is also entitled to receive $330 per month from July, 1997, through April, 1998, which amounts to $3,300. The trial judge properly credited the tenants with the payment of one month\u2019s rent at $370. Thus, the total arrearage owed by the tenants is $4,410.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">3. <em>Measure of damages for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. </em>The tenants contend that the trial judge improperly calculated the damage award on their counterclaim. The judge found that the landlord had breached the tenants\u2019 right to quiet enjoyment of their premises under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and awarded them three months\u2019 rent in damages. The award was based on the full contract rent of $900 per month; thus, the tenants received a total of $2,700 on their counterclaim. The tenants claim that the judge erred in awarding them three months\u2019 rent pursuant to G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, without comparing this figure to their actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14, provides that \u201c[a]ny person who commits any act in violation of this section shall ... be liable for actual and consequential damages or three month\u2019s rent, whichever is greater.\u201d In an action involving a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the tenant remains in possession of the premises, actual damages \u201care measured by the difference between the value of what the lessee should have received and the value of what he did receive.\u201d <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>378 Mass. 758, 761 n.4 (1979). See <em>Charles E. Burt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seven Grand Corp., </em>340 Mass. 124, 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(1959).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If actual damages are greater than three month\u2019s rent, \u201cthe triple rent measure has no function.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 110-111 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">While the judge did not explicitly find that the award of three months\u2019 rent was greater than the tenants\u2019 actual damages, it is sufficiently clear from his written findings that he took into consideration the factors that were necessary to calculate a proper damage award. See, e.g., <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 168, 171 (1975) (in valuing defective premises, \u201cconsideration is to be given to various factors including, but not limited to, the nature, duration and seriousness of defects and whether they may endanger or impair the health, safety or well being of the occupants\u201d). The judge properly took the conduct of both parties into account in determining the damage award.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although it would have been preferable for the trial judge to give a detailed explanation of his calculations, his informed opinion is, we think, sufficiently reflected in the award. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>LeClair, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 976, 978 (1985) (\u201c[Rjent abatement cases are not capable of precise measurement. \u2018While the damages may not be determined by speculation or guess, an approximate result is permissible if the evidence shows the extent of damages to be a matter of just and reasonable inference\u2019 \u201d); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Patukonis, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 910 (1987). Thus, we conclude that there was no error in calculating the damage award for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Allowing the tenants to recover on their counterclaim on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>basis of the full contract rent, while allowing the landlord to recover on his claim for back rent based only upon the tenants\u2019 share of the rent, does not result in a windfall to the tenants or in an award of punitive damages. \u201cWhether or not the tenant is required to pay in rent the full value of the apartment as warranted, the tenant is nonetheless entitled to damages based upon the value of the premises in a liveable condition. It is, after all, the tenant who suffers when conditions in an apartment violate [the covenant of quiet enjoyment].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cruz Mgmt. Co. </em>v. <em>Wideman, </em>417 Mass. 771, 775-776 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>After trial, the judge awarded the tenants attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,000 based on the fee provision of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. The tenants claim that the judge abused his discretion in rendering the award. Their attorney submitted an affidavit to the trial judge in which he indicated that he performed 38.5 hours of work on the tenants\u2019 case at a rate of $200 per hour, for a total of $7,700 in fees. The tenants claim that the issues in the case were complex and were worth more than an award of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The guidelines for determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee authorized by statute have been set forth in <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 629 (1978), and in <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979). Here, the trial judge considered these guidelines and found that an excessive amount of time had been devoted to the issues. However, he also found that time spent before the landlord\u2019s notice to quit, given February 9, 1998 \u2014 eleven months after the tenants first exercised their right to withhold rent \u2014 was not cognizable under \u00a7 14. We disagree. The tenants were certainly well advised to consult counsel promptly after the discovery of the lead paint in February, 1997. Four of their eight children, the judge found, had been diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels. The landlord, as we have said, failed to inform the tenants of the presence of lead paint at the beginning of their tenancy in July, 1996, and the continuing unresolved condition of lead paint in the leased premises was, the judge found, a substantial interference with the tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment. There being a violation of \u00a7 14 at least as early as February, 1997, the tenants are entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees for legal services that were required beginning in February, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The tenants also argue that they should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. \u201cWe have recognized the explicit language of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, which provides for payment of attorney\u2019s fees, and this language is <em>not </em>limited to attorney\u2019s fees for trial proceedings\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989). However, because the tenants did not prevail on their appeal for additional damages pursuant to this statute, they are not entitled to costs and attorney\u2019s fees arising from that appeal. See <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. at 20. While the tenants were successful in reducing the damages on the landlord\u2019s claim for back rent, \u00a7 14 is available only for fees incurred in connection with violations of \u00a7 14, and the landlord\u2019s claim to unpaid rent was hot such a violation. Thus, we see no reason to depart from the traditional American rule that the prevailing party is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. at 18-19; <em>PGR Mgmt. Co., Heath Properties </em>v. <em>Credle, </em>427 Mass. 636, 641 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is vacated. The case is remanded to the Worcester Housing Court for entry of an amended judgment as follows. The award of fees of trial counsel in the amount of $1,000 shall be vacated, and a new order for counsel fees, calculated on a basis consistent with this opinion, is to be entered. Prior to entering the new judgment, the Housing Court shall give written notice to the tenants of the balance due on their rent, i.e., the amount due based solely on the tenants\u2019 share of the rent. That is to say, the landlord is entitled to an award of $4,410, from which the tenants\u2019 award of $2,700 on their counterclaim for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment should be deducted. Pursuant to G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A, the court shall allow the tenants seven days from receipt of notice to pay the clerk of the court the sum of $1,710. If the tenants pay this sum within the specified time period, judgment for possession and for attorney\u2019s fees shall enter for the tenants. If the tenants fail to pay this sum within the specified time, then judgment for possession and $1,710 shall enter for the landlord, and judgment for attorney\u2019s fees shall enter for the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The tenants were credited with a payment of one month\u2019s rent in the amount of $370 against the $9,340 that the judge found they owed to the landlord.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The judge deducted the amount that he awarded to the tenants on their counterclaim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment from the arrearage owed to the landlord.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\">As described below, the Federal subsidy funds were administered by the Worcester Housing Authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\">At the time of trial, the tenants lived in their unit in Worcester with their eight children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The trial judge stated at one point in his written decision that the tenants\u2019 initial share of the rent was $360 per month, but the uncontroverted testimony at trial was that the tenants paid $370 per month. We note that the judge did use the $370 figure in calculating the landlord\u2019s award for back rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The judge found that \u201c[tjhis fact is only partially explained by the acknowledged logistical effort required to deal with a family of ten.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">On appeal, the tenants claim that the landlord\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed because it was retaliatory under G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 2A. The judge made no findings in regard to this claim. \u201cRetaliation\u201d was mentioned in passing in the tenants\u2019 counterclaim (dismissal of the summary, process complaint was not sought by the tenants) and was not directly addressed at the hearing in the Housing Court. In addition, on appeal, the tenants\u2019 argument is conclusory and does not rise to the level of appellate argument. For these reasons, we do not consider this claim. See <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, 786 n. 3 (1999); Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">During trial, the judge stated that the issue of whether the landlord had contractually agreed to hold the tenants liable only for their share of the rent was a question of law for the court. Counsel for the tenants stated that he would leave the decision to the court. However, the judge did not offer any explanation for his decision to calculate the landlord\u2019s back rent award based on the entire contract rent rather than the tenants\u2019 share of that rent. The interpretation of a contract is generally a question of law; thus, the trial judge\u2019s conclusions regarding this issue are subject to plenary review on appeal. See <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lanco Scaffolding Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 729 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">This analysis also disposes of the landlord\u2019s alternate argument that, at the very least, he is entitled to recover the full contract rent from the tenants for March, 1998, and April, 1998, because the HAP contract contains a provision which states that the contract \u201cterminates automatically 180 calendar days after the last housing assistance payment to the owner.\u201d Regardless of when the HAP contract was terminated, the tenants never assumed liability for paying the full contract rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In relevant part, this statute imposes civil and criminal liability on a landlord who \u201cdirectly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.\u201d G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Defective conditions in leased premises may constitute an interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 99 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Darmetko, </em>the court noted that the remedies for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the remedies for a breach of the implied warranty of habitability are \u201cquite similar.\" <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>378 Mass. at 761 n.4. Thus, we regard decisions involving the implied warranty of habitability as persuasive authority in resolving the issue of damages in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">For example, the judge noted the \u201cmarginally cooperative\u201d conduct of the tenants, as well as the fact that the deleading effort of the landlord took \u201can unreasonably long time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The tenants briefly argue that they were aggrieved by the trial judge\u2019s ruling that any award regarding the landlord\u2019s violations of the State Sanitary Code \u201cwould be subsumed in the greater recovery under General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14.\u201d There was no error in this ruling. The tenants may not recover cumulatively for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and for violations of the State Sanitary Code based upon the same lead paint violations. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>378 Mass. at 761. Furthermore, to the extent that some of the sanitary code violations did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>involve the presence of lead paint in the unit, the trial judge found that these violations were \u201cde minim[i]s\u201d and therefore afforded no recovery to the tenants. Again, we perceive no error in this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
