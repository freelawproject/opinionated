Leith was being held in a car by the defendant and one Edgar Smith on route 91 in Massachusetts, going north. Alerted by the call, police officers found Leith\u2019s empty car in a rest area. Nearby, they saw someone waving in a parked car. When that vehicle began to move, the officers followed and forced it to stop. Huddled in the back seat was a woman (Leith), crying, \u2022shaking, and mouthing the words \u201chelp me, help me.\u201d The defendant, who was driving, was arrested, as was Smith, seated in the front passenger seat. Each was subsequently charged with kidnapping, assault with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to commit murder, and assault and battery. The men were tried separately<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; the defendant was found guilty on all four charges. Only the defendant\u2019s appeal is before us. He claims numerous errors, including violations of his right to counsel, insufficient evidence to convict him of conspiracy to commit murder,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> improper closing argument by the prosecutor, and improper instructions by the trial judge. We affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the jury were warranted in finding the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>lowing. Leith, at the request of her brother, the defendant, drove from Florida to Massachusetts to help him find his four year old twins as his former wife would not let him see them. After spending several days scouting, in her car, the homes of the defendant\u2019s former wife and of his former father-in-law, Leith became suspicious that the defendant was about to do something illegal. When she informed him that she was going to return to Florida, he told her that she could not leave until the job was done. He threatened to kill her husband and two of her friends if she left. Later, each in their separate cars drove to a rest stop. When communication by car phone became difficult, the defendant induced Leith to get in the back seat of his car. Once there, he wrenched her keys from her hands and asked Smith to lock the doors. While Smith held Leith down, the defendant punched her in the face. He asked Smith for a knife, put it in his fist and hit Leith over the head. He told her that she was hurting his kids and that he was going to kill her. Smith, at the defendant\u2019s bidding, took a pillow, shoved Leith down onto the seat, and covered her face. She briefly lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">When she came to, she heard the defendant tell Smith that she should be killed with a baseball bat and heard \u201cboth of them\u201d discussing that she should be dumped fifty feet in the woods. While they were driving, the defendant sometimes reached back and hit her as Smith held her. When Leith begged Smith to let her go, Smith replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of this screaming bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">They subsequently returned to the rest stop where Leith\u2019s car was parked. The defendant suggested to Smith, \u201cMaybe we should just stab her and dump her in the back seat.\u201d Smith demurred, saying, \u201cIf we kill her now, then we\u2019ll have to leave off to Chicago now, and I\u2019m F-ing tired. So let\u2019s wait until morning.\u201d The defendant then added that Leith had \u201cbetter thank him [Smith] for letting [her] live until morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">While at the rest stop, the defendant, using his car phone, called Leith\u2019s friend Rochelle Kaminski in Florida and gave Leith the phone to tell Kaminski what a mistake she, Leith, had made by not finding his children. When Leith blurted out that she was on route 91 north, the defendant snatched the phone and told Kaminski that he would kill her after he killed Leith. Kaminski testified that she heard another male take the phone and say, \u201cthey were going to kill Carol and they were coming to kill me next.\u201d Leith overheard Smith talking to Kaminski. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>indicated earlier, Kaminski called the police, and the two men were apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency and admissibility of evidence on conspiracy to murder charge. </em>We treat these issues first as they, more than the others, are dependent on the foregoing evidence. A conspiracy requires a \u201ccombination of two or more persons, by some concerted action [or plan], to accomplish some criminal or unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some purpose, not in itself criminal or unlawful, by criminal or unlawful means.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, 4 </em>Met. 111, 123 (1842). Here, the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant combined with Smith with the intention of murdering Leith. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantres, </em>405 Mass. 238, 244 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The conversations between the defendant and Smith recounted by Leith were not, as argued by the defendant, solely attributable to the defendant. In context, Smith\u2019s comment concerning the need to get rid of Leith could reasonably be viewed as neither a joking nor an exaggerated remark. His statements to Kaminski and his comment about postponing the murder could reasonably be considered by the jury as indicating the intent of both Smith and the defendant to act in concert to murder Leith.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In his supplemental brief, the defendant faults his trial counsel for not objecting to the introduction of Kaminski\u2019s testimony on the ground that what Smith stated to her was inadmissible hearsay. He claims that the Commonwealth failed to establish by evidence independent of Smith\u2019s hearsay statements that Smith was involved in the conspiracy to murder Leith, and that it was therefore error to admit Smith\u2019s statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was, however, sufficient nonhearsay evidence to warrant a reasonable inference that the two men who had jointly committed other offenses also had conspired to commit murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nascimento, </em>421 Mass. 677, 681 (1996). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>379 Mass. 117, 145-146 n.26 (1979). These other offenses, such as Smith almost suffocating Leith, locking her in the vehicle, holding her down while the defendant punched her, and giving the defendant a knife for use against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Leith, were also indicative of the conspiracy to commit murder. \u201c[T]he mere fact that evidence tends to prove the commission of some other crime does not render it inadmissible as long as it is relevant to the crime being tried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagan, </em>357 Mass. 585, 589 (1970). Thus, even if the recounting of Smith\u2019s statements is considered to be hearsay, the testimony was admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Moreover, and more significant, both Kaminski\u2019s and Leith\u2019s testimony as to Smith\u2019s statements did not involve hearsay. Smith\u2019s words themselves are evidence of a legal relationship and are admissible not for the truth of the matters asserted, \u201cbut as proof of an \u2018operative\u2019 statement, i.e., existence of a conspiracy. As such, [they are] not hearsay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 246 (2000). <em>Telecon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson-Swan, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 673 (1984) (contract). Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2. 5 (7th ed. 1999). What counts is the fact that such words were spoken. See 5 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence \u00a7 801.11 [3] (2d ed. 2000); 4 Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 385 (2d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Similar testimony was held not to be hearsay in <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>253 Conn. 354 (2000). A former passenger in a car with the defendant and another was permitted to testify that he had heard the other person say that if they saw the intended victim \u201cit was on,\u201d meaning \u201cthey\u2019d start shooting.\u201d The court held that the statement \u201cwas not hearsay because it was admissible as circumstantial evidence of the conspiracy, not to establish its truth. The statement made by [the other passenger in the car] to the defendant was evidence of the agreement to shoot [the intended victim] in which both the defendant and [the other person] had played a part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">There was thus no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice or ineffective assistance of counsel, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 624-625 n.4 (1994), in admitting the evidence of Smith\u2019s statements, and there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">3. <em>Violation of right to counsel, </em>a. On the day of the defendant\u2019s arraignment, October 15, 1991, Attorney Alan Rubin, regional supervisor of the Hampshire County office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), was appointed to represent the defendant. After being informed less than a week before the day scheduled for trial that the Commonwealth intended to call a new witness to testify to statements allegedly made by the defendant while both men were incarcerated, Mr. Rubin prepared a motion to withdraw based on a conflict of interest. His motion set forth the following. The witness named by the Commonwealth was the husband and codefendant of a woman represented by an associate of Mr. Rubin. In his capacity as regional supervisor, Mr. Rubin had discussed the woman\u2019s cases with his associate on various occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The prosecutor in the defendant\u2019s case had informed Mr. Rubin that, in return for the witness\u2019s cooperation, the Commonwealth would seek a reduction of the witness\u2019s sentence and the dismissal of all charges against his wife. This created a conflict because one client of the office (the wife of the witness) was to receive a benefit at the expense of the defendant. Moreover, the wife\u2019s counsel had to be conflict-free to enable him to ensure that her husband\u2019s agreement with the Commonwealth concerning his testimony in the defendant\u2019s case was enforced. There was an additional conflict because of Mr. Rubin\u2019s supervisory role. Information obtained from the witness\u2019s wife could be used in cross-examination of her husband to her detriment. Were Mr. Rubin to limit his cross-examination of the husband to prevent any possible use of information gained from his wife, this would be detrimental to the defendant. Mr. Rubin ended his motion as follows: \u201cFor all the above reasons, counsel <em>must </em>be allowed to withdraw in this matter\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The motion was heard on April 28, 1992, at which time the Commonwealth opposed the motion, and the defendant, too, requested that Mr. Rubin not be permitted to withdraw. Another hearing on the matter was held on May 4, 1992. Mr. Rubin informed the judge that he had conferred with the other attorneys in his office, the chief counsel of CPCS, and an attorney at the Board of Bar Overseers. They all had agreed that Mr. Rubin was in a \u201cconflicted situation\u201d and he \u201cwas instructed that he had no choice [but to withdraw] under that situation.\u201d The judge allowed the motion to withdraw.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The defendant argues that he was entitled to waive and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>waive the right to have counsel unhindered by a conflict of interest. We assume for purposes of argument that there was here a.sufficient, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver or that such a waiver would have been forthcoming. The Commonwealth counters that waiver is irrelevant as Mr. Rubin was appointed counsel. Since the right to appointed counsel does not include the right to dictate who. shall be appointed, the defendant, in the view of the Commonwealth, has no legal basis for urging error in the judge\u2019s disqualification of counsel. We disagree. In an analogous situation, the California Supreme Court rejected the claim that an indigent defendant has no cause to complain about the removal of his attorney, noting that the attorney-client relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\u201cis independent of the source of compensation .... [Ojnce counsel is appointed to represent an indigent defendant, whether it be the public defender or a volunteer private attorney, the parties enter into an attorney-client relationship which is no less inviolable than if counsel had been retained. To hold otherwise would be to subject that relationship to an unwarranted and invidious discrimination arising merely from the poverty of the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>68 Cal. 2d 547, 561-562 (1968). See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 22-23 &amp; n.5 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in result) (\u201cconsiderations that may preclude recognition of an indigent defendant\u2019s right to choose his own counsel . . . should not preclude recognition of an indigent defendant\u2019s interest in continued representation by an appointed attorney with whom he has developed a relationship of trust and confidence\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>381 Mass. 500, 504 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>(1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Goldman, 395 Mass. 495, 505-506, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 906 (1985), the defendant points out that disqualification of conflict-ridden counsel is a \u201cdrastic action\u201d \u201cto be exercised sparingly and when the need is apparent and pressing and only after careful consideration.\u201d <em>Connor, </em>381 Mass. at 503, quoting from <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>324 Mass. 574, 579 (1949). It is only to be exercised in a rare instance. <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Those decisions, however, do not indicate that the judge was in error in allowing Mr. Rubin\u2019s motion. Both cases acknowledge that a judge must have some discretion to disqualify a conflict-burdened attorney to protect the fair and proper administration of justice and, in each of the cases, the court left the door open to the trial judge to determine whether he or she on remand should exercise discretion to override the defendant\u2019s waiver, should it be exercised. See <em>Connor, </em>381 Mass. at 504, 506; <em>Goldman, </em>395 Mass. at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Moreover, unlike those cases, here, counsel himself sought withdrawal and, after seeking advice from knowledgeable sources, felt required by the Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules to withdraw. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101, as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981) (Preservation of Confidences and Secrets of a Client); S.J.C. Rule 3:07 Canon 5, DR 5-105, appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981) (Refusing to Accept or Continue Employment if the Interests of Another Client May Impair the Independent Professional Judgment of the Lawyer).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our cases encourage \u201cdeference to the exercise of an attorney\u2019s best judgment as to whether such employment will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>bring the attorney into conflict with the [rules of professional conduct].\u201d <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>400 Mass. 494, 502 (1987). See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 787-788 (1979); <em>Gorovitz </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>394 Mass. 246, 250 (1985); <em>Adoption of Erica, </em>426 Mass. 55, 63 (1997). See also Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 202 comment b (Tent. Draft No. 3, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Also significant is that both the <em>Connor </em>and <em>Goldman </em>cases considered waiver of the right to the assistance of an attorney \u201cunhindered by a conflict of interests\u201d (see <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 483 n.5 [1978]) under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to those decisions, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 163 (1988), a case involving multiple representation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> held that a trial judge has much broader discretion than suggested by <em>Connor </em>and <em>Goldman </em>in refusing waivers of conflict of interest. While there is a Sixth Amendment presumption in favor of a defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, <em>Wheat, supra </em>at 162, 164, where there is a conflict of interest or a serious potential for conflict, a Federal District Court \u201cmust be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163. A court should not be \u201crequired to tolerate an inadequate representation of a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>570 F.2d 1177, 1184 (3d Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the discussion in <em>Wheat </em>involved a Federal trial court, because the decision was based on Sixth Amendment concerns, the case applies equally to State courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>In sum, we conclude that because of the circumstances of the conflict described by Mr. Rubin, the judge acted within his discretion. Moreover, in view of the actual conflict, and the fact that Mr. Rubin held an important position in the office of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the judge acted appropriately even under the more restrictive <em>Connor </em>and <em>Goldman </em>standards in rejecting the waiver. His comments, see <em>supra </em>at note 4, suggest that he acted in order to protect the fair and proper administration of justice, i.e., the rights of the defendant to a fair trial and the appearance of fairness to defendants represented by public counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>396 Mass. 549, 559 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">b. For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims he was deprived of his right to counsel at the two hearings in which Mr. Rubin\u2019s motion to withdraw was discussed and determined. Accordingly, we only consider the issue in terms of whether there has been a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. There was none. The defendant stated his view that he wanted to continue with counsel, thus clearly raising the issue of waiver. Moreover, a determination whether a waiver should be denied because of concerns relating to the proper administration of justice is a question on which the judge has \u201can independent duty,\u201d apart from the interest of the defendant. <em>Wheat, supra </em>at 161. The judge has an \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160. We also note that the defendant, now represented on appeal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has not cited any authority for the requirement of counsel at such hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s additional argument that the consequence of the hearing without being represented was to delay the defendant\u2019s trial and to determine adversely his prospect of a joint trial with Smith. Once the waiver was denied, a continuance was necessary for the defendant\u2019s new counsel to become familiar with the case. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>289 Mass. 441, 454, cert. denied, 295 U.S. 765 (1935) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>(defendant need not be present at motion for postponement of trial). That the trials of the defendant and Smith were to be severed had been decided earlier as a result of Smith\u2019s motion to sever, and it was highly unlikely that the decision would have been changed<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> if independent counsel for the defendant had been present.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">c. Attorney Scott Hamilton was appointed successor counsel on May 4, 1992. On July 8, two weeks before trial, Mr. Hamilton, too, moved to withdraw, stating: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I just did not appreciate the complexity of the issues that were going to be involved in this case. And as I\u2019ve expressed to Mr. Jordan, I do not feel that I am really able to deal with those issues effectively.\u201d In his motion, Mr. Hamilton indicated that the defendant had consented to be represented by other counsel, Attorney Geri Laventis, who would be willing to take the case. She, however, would only take the assignment conditioned on a continuance. After hearing the prosecutor argue that the case was simple, that witnesses were coming from Florida, and that the victim had been receiving numerous communications in the mail from the defendant\u2019s father, the judge denied the motion, indicating that he would be receptive to appointing co-counsel chosen by Mr. Hamilton. The case was to go forward on the July date set previously in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Although counsel characterized himself as unprepared, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 54 (1976), he had been appointed in May, had the transcript of Smith\u2019s trial, and had attended a portion of that trial. In these circumstances, and with the additional protection of co-counsel, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Mr. Hamilton\u2019s motions for withdrawal and a continuance filed so close to the date for trial. The trial judge allowed counsel to present his reasons and appropriately balanced the need for additional time against the increased costs, including prejudice to the victim, taking into account also \u201cthe interest of the judicial system in avoiding delays which would not measurably contribute to the resolution of a particular controversy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 711 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>4. <em>Right to self-representation. </em>On June 17, 1992, a month and one-half after Mr. Hamilton was appointed as counsel, the defendant filed a pro se motion to proceed pro se. The defendant alleged that Mr. Hamilton had failed to meet with him to discuss trial strategy, had not accepted his phone calls, had not responded to four letters sent by the defendant, and had not taken the minimal steps necessary in preparing for the defense. The defendant requested that new counsel be appointed or in the alternative that he be allowed to proceed pro se. No action was taken on this motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">On July 7, 1992, the defendant refiled the same motion. As recounted earlier, on July 8, 1992, Mr. Hamilton filed a motion to withdraw. At that time, the judge indicated he would appoint co-counsel. On July 13, 1992, the defendant filed his motion a third time, with identical requests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Again, no action was taken on this motion. On the same day, Mr. Hamilton filed a motion on behalf of the defendant to appoint attorney David Pritchard as co-counsel. The motion was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">A defendant has the right to defend himself without the assistance of counsel if he knowingly and voluntarily elects to do so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>388 Mass. 655, 659 n.5 (1983), citing <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 818-832 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention the defendant\u2019s motion to proceed pro se was not equivocal. The defendant asserted that he wanted new counsel appointed, but made it clear that if his request was denied he wanted to represent himself. \u201cA request to proceed pro se is not equivocal merely because it is an alternative position, advanced as a fall-back to a primary request for different counsel.\u201d <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>808 F.2d 214, 216 n.2 (2d Cir. 1986), citing <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. at 810 n.5, 835-836; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>348 F.2d 12, 14 n.1, 16 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied sub nom. <em>DiBlasi </em>v. <em>McMann, </em>384 U.S. 1007 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>\u201cOnce asserted, however, the right to self-representation may be waived through conduct indicating that one is vacillating on the issue or has abandoned one\u2019s request altogether.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>204 F.3d 33, 37 (2d Cir. 2000), quoting from <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>44 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 1994). \u201cThus, \u2018[a] waiver may be found if it reasonably appears to the court that defendant has abandoned his initial request to represent himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 607, 611 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">At the hearing on July 8, when the judge refused to substitute Ms. Laventis as counsel but agreed to appoint co-counsel to assist Mr. Hamilton, the defendant did not voice any objection. The defendant\u2019s motion dated July 7, 1992, was endorsed \u201cJuly 8, 1992[.] No action taken[.j See counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw this date which was denied.\u201d As the Commonwealth argues, the judge could reasonably have concluded that the defendant had abandoned his requests, believing that the defendant\u2019s concerns had been remedied by the decision to appoint co-counsel. The defendant\u2019s third motion, which repeated the reasons set forth in his previous motions was filed on July 13 (obviously prepared earlier), the same day that Mr. Hamilton moved on behalf of the defendant to have Mr. Pritchard appointed as co-counsel. Mr. Hamilton\u2019s motion was allowed, and the defendant did not make any written or oral complaint to the court after that appointment. Again, the court could reasonably have believed that the defendant was satisfied with the assistance of additional counsel. Moreover, the defendant did not speak out during the remainder of the pretrial proceedings or at trial. The defendant\u2019s silence stands in contrast to his willingness to address the court on Mr. Rubin\u2019s motion to withdraw. See <em>Wilson, </em>204 F.3d at 39. In summary, from the defendant\u2019s failure to object after Mr. Pritchard was appointed, and \u201chis decision not to reassert his previously asserted right to represent himself, it \u2018reasonably appears\u2019 that [the defendant] \u2018abandoned his initial request to represent himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Brown, </em>665 F.2d at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">5. <em>Jury instructions on conspiracy to murder. </em>The judge instructed the jury that the \u201cessence of a conspiracy is the agreement of two or more people to do an unlawful act. . . . And as to a conspiracy to murder, of course murder is taking the life of another person without any justification or excuse or reason. . . . There must be some word or deed by which you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>can find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the two expressed their willingness to agree to this plan and to come to this agreement to murder Carol Leith . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">There was no objection to the charge but on appeal the defendant argues that the essential elements of murder \u2014 (1) an unlawful killing of another person (2) committed with malice aforethought \u2014 were not described to the jury. He concedes, in his brief, that the jury, \u201cin finding conspiracy, necessarily found that [the defendant] and Smith actually planned to kill Leith. Such a killing would be intentional, and thus done with malice aforethought.\u201d What he complains of is that \u201cthe jury had no instructions defining when a killing is unlawful, nor when the objective of an agreement is unlawful (which makes the agreement conspiracy), nor when a killing might be justified or excused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stack, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 236 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">\u201cThe commonsensical view is that \u2018[i]f the offense which was the object of the conspiracy were some technical or unusually complex offense of which the trier of fact has no general impression, a suitable instruction explaining such an offense would be mandatory,\u2019 but not so where \u2018[t]he jury as ordinary laymen have a general knowledge of what constitutes armed robbery [the target offense involved in the case] which is self-defining.\u2019 <em>People </em>v. <em>Ambrose, </em>28 Ill. App. 3d 627, 632-633 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The jury here would have had a general knowledge of what constitutes murder. We do not consider that a rational jury in this case where the defendant and Smith spoke of killing Leith with a baseball bat or stabbing her and dumping her in her car needed definitions of unlawful killings, justified or excused killings, or instructions as to when the objective of the agreement would be unlawful. Such definitions, had they been given, would not have affected the verdict. The defendant in no way contended at trial that the killing, if it had taken place, was justified or, for any other reason, was not unlawful. In any event there was here no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). The instructions first challenged on appeal concern an issue not actively contested at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Picher, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 409, 411 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>6. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing, </em>a. The defendant claims the comment reproduced in the margin<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> impermissibly refers to the contrast between his sister\u2019s testimony and his failure to take the stand. This is too strained an interpretation. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks taken in their ordinary meaning merely pointed out that decisions as to credibility of witnesses are not easy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">b. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the prosecutor did not improperly endorse the credibility of the victim. \u201cIt is not improper to make a factually based argument that, due to the demeanor, disclosed circumstances, and appearance of a witness, a particular witness should be believed or disbelieved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 521 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Moreover, the prosecutor did not rely on excluded evidence to argue for Leith\u2019s credibility. She had testified to the matter argued and her testimony had not been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">c. The prosecutor may have exceeded the bounds of appropriate argument when he stated, \u201cYou must, to some extent, put yourselves, as people who use their common sense, into the shoes of a sister who is in a public courtroom testifying about the deeds of her very own brother.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The invitation to the jury to put themselves in the position of the victim is usually improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 165, 176 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The prosecutor also should not have suggested that the Commonwealth expected guilty verdicts,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 375 (1989), nor that the jury must return a verdict.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions did much to mitigate these errors. He correctly cautioned the jury that they \u201cdo not decide a case on the basis of any gut feeling or any feeling of sympathy for anybody or sorrow,\u201d but that they must \u201cdecide the case solely on the facts [they had] heard, applying [their] common sense and logic to those facts.\u201d Prior to closing arguments, he warned them that, \u201c[closing argument] is not an expression of personal opinion by a lawyer as to what the results should be, whether the verdict should be guilty or not guilty . . . [or] whether a particular witness is credible or not credible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">When read in the context of the overwhelming evidence at trial, and the judge\u2019s instructions, any improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that counsel was ineffective in not raising the issues we have dealt with under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard does not present a separate additional ground for reversal. As pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. at 624 n.4, \u201c[I]f an omission of counsel does not present a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in a situation such as this, there is no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under either the Federal or the State Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Smith was convicted of kidnapping and assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-13\">The defendant filed a supplemental brief pro se in which he raised this issue, among others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The exception provides that \u201ca conspirator\u2019s extrajudicial statement is admissible against a coconspirator if made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy . . . once the Commonwealth establishes the existence of the conspiracy by a preponderance of other admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 248 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">It would have been helpful for the judge to have made findings.
