L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c). Subsequently, the judge found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>defendant guilty of committing a second or subsequent offense. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32A(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Before trial, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion in hmine to exclude all references to the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, and he allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to permit the introduction of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, but only \u201cto prove intent to distribute.\u201d The judge acknowledged the defendant\u2019s objection to the allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the prosecutor read into the record, without objection from the defendant, (i) the defendant\u2019s conviction on January 24, 1989, for having manufactured, distributed, or dispensed a class B controlled substance, and (ii) the defendant\u2019s conviction on January 29, 1992, for possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute. The judge again instructed the jury, without objection by the defendant, that these prior convictions were \u201conly relevant on the question of intent [to distribute] not possession. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The Commonwealth presented'evidence of the defendant\u2019s purchase and possession of crack cocaine, and the defendant\u2019s transfer of the cocaine to a female undercover police informant (informant).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The defendant took the stand and, in substance, claimed that he did not intend to distribute cocaine. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>In brief, his defense was that the informant was a friend with whom he had gotten \u201chigh\u201d for eight years, and when she asked the defendant whether he \u201chad anything,\u201d he hoped this would be another chance to get \u201chigh\u201d with her. It was for this reason that he took the informant to a location where he purchased two rocks of cocaine for $30.00. After the purchase, the defendant handed the cocaine to the informant in exchange for $30.00. He maintained that he made no money on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>transaction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon seeing a police vehicle following them, the defendant and a companion fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On this factual basis, the defendant claimed that at worst he was guilty of simple possession. The Commonwealth, on the testimony of its witnesses, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>argued that there was sufficient proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt, as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge\u2019s ruling, which permitted the admission of prior convictions on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent to distribute, is inconsistent with the governing statute, the case law, and the scholarly commentary. The ruling was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 21, provides that the \u201cconviction of a witness of a crime may be shown to affect his credibility . . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 646 (1997) (\u201cEvidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions ... is . . . admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching a defendant\u2019s credibility\u201d); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.10.2 (7th ed. 1999) (a witness \u201cmay be impeached by evidence that he or she has been convicted of a crime .... [T]he jury is implicitly asked to infer a readiness to lie from the witness\u2019s prior involvement in criminal activity\u201d [footnote omitted]). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delrio, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 712, 719 &amp; n.11 (1986), upon which the Commonwealth relies., involved evidence of prior drug transactions, not prior convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass. 803, 809 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Given the failure of the defendant at trial to object to the introduction of the prior convictions, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>our review is limited to whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions was highly persuasive that the defendant\u2019s intention on this occasion, as was determined to be his intention on past occasions, was to distribute a controlled substance. The judge, moreover, emphasized the importance of the prior convictions by instructing the jury that they could consider those convictions on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent to distribute a controlled substance. That instruction provided the jury with a sound and persuasive reason for a guilty verdict. The admission of the prior convictions, we conclude, would have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>After the Commonwealth rested, however, the defendant elected to testify, as described earlier. He acknowledged that he had purchased cocaine for cash, and that he transferred the cocaine to the informant, thereby conceding the evidence necessary to establish his intent to distribute cocaine. An essential element of the crime charged is \u201cintent to distribute,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. <em>777, </em>788 (1978), and the judge so instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The defendant\u2019s testimony describing exactly what occurred between him and the informant provided evidence of all the elements of the crime charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s error did not leave the defendant in any worse position than the position the defendant made for himself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-14\">The Commonwealth\u2019s brief states that the defendant was found guilty of distributing cocaine. The indictment tracks the language of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c), and charges the defendant with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance <em>or </em>distributing a controlled substance. The judge, however, instructed the jury only as to the elements of the charge of possession with intent to distribute. Without objection from either party, he said that an element of this crime was the specific intent to distribute a controlled substance in the defendant\u2019s possession. That instruction became the law of the case, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>400 Mass. 676, 681-682 (1987), and we proceed on the premise \u2014 as does the Commonwealth from time to time in its brief \u2014 that the defendant was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute, even though the transcript reveals that the verdict slips referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the charge of distributing cocaine. The verdict slips are not included in the record appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">The defendant did not object to the introduction of the prior convictions or to the judge\u2019s instructions, and the objection is therefore waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>398 Mass. 1, 7 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 681 (1999). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1454 (2d ed. Supp. 2000) (\u201cA defendant who fails to object to the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of evidence after the denial of his motion in limine to prevent its introduction, has waived his right to appellate review\u201d), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s witness testified that the exchange was with an undercover officer, not the informant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">A motion for a required finding of not guilty was not filed, either at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, or at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Namely, intentional possession of a controlled substance, knowing it to be a controlled substance, with intent to distribute the substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In his summation the prosecutor told the jury, \u201cThe statute doesn\u2019t say sale \u2014 it says distribute .... That\u2019s what Jose Diaz did ... . Jose Diaz himself got on the stand and said yep I handed him [sic] two rocks of crack cocaine, I gave it to the [informant].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
