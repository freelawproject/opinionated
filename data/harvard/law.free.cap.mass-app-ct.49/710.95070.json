He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the Authority, a self-insured entity, and he continued to receive such benefits at all times material to this litigation. The plaintiff claims that he is entitled to participate, beginning in 1995, in the Authority\u2019s early retirement process (ERP). The Authority\u2019s employees\u2019 retirement board concluded that the plaintiff was ineligible, and an appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>On a statement of agreed facts, the administrative magistrate, to whom CRAB referred the case for a hearing, ruled in favor of the plaintiff. That ruling was rejected by CRAB, which held in favor of the defendant. The decision of CRAB was affirmed by a judge of the Superior Court, who entered judgment for the defendants. We affirm the order of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Authority\u2019s ERP was authorized by the Legislature in 1993. See St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 312. Section 312 provides that, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 [n] otwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ... is hereby authorized to develop and implement an early retirement process for its employees. . . .\u201d Eligibility to participate in the ERP required the satisfaction of certain criteria set out by the Authority. At issue here is the stated requirement that the member \u201cbe on the active payroll of [the Authority] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The plaintiff relies on G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 14(1), which provides, in relevant part, \u201c[a]ny employee who was a member in service at the time of sustaining an injury ... on account of which he becomes entitled to . . . [workers\u2019 compensation payments under G. L. c. 152] shall, during the period while he is receiving weekly payments for total incapacity . . . , retain all the rights of a member in service while he is living . . . .\u201d We assume that the plaintiff was a member in service, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(a)(i), but we reject the claim that being a member in service satisfies the \u201cactive payroll\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The argument that c. 32, \u00a7 14(1), quoted above, controls the outcome in this case would, if sustained, work a modification to the Authority\u2019s ERP by extending the opportunity to participate in the ERP to each \u201cmember in service\u201d receiving disability compensation but who is <em>not </em>currently performing services for the Authority. There is nothing to support such an assertion. To ignore the plain language of the Authority\u2019s ERP, or equate the words \u201con the active payroll\u201d with a reading that encompasses those persons receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits by reason of an inability to work would effectively amend the ERP. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 8 (distinguishing between an employee in \u201cactive service\u201d and a \u201cmember in service\u201d). Compare <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Newton, </em>425 Mass. 468, 471 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Whatever latent ambiguity may reside in the phrase \u201con the active payroll\u201d was removed by the decision of CRAB in this case which construed the phrase to mean \u201cpersons who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>actively employed and receiving a payroll check, not persons who are receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d We accept that plain, commonsense definition. \u201cAs a reviewing court we \u2018accord due weight and deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute within its charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Newton, </em>425 Mass. at 470, quoting from <em>Boston Neighborhood Taxi Ass'n. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>410 Mass. 686, 692 (1991). We must also \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The plaintiff was not on the Authority\u2019s payroll for work performed; he was being paid for his disabling injuries which prevented him from working. There was no error in the decision of the Superior Court affirming the decision of CRAB.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Relying on a letter from the Authority dated May 18, 1995, in which the Authority notified the plaintiff that he was \u201celigible\u201d to participate in the Authority\u2019s ERP, the plaintiff also argues that the Authority is estopped to deny the plaintiff\u2019s claim. We reject the argument. This case comes up on \u201cA Statement of Agreed Facts and Disputed Issues\u201d; one section of the written agreement was a \u201cSummary of Appellant\u2019s Argument.\u201d That section made no mention of the present claim of estoppel. The plaintiff\u2019s argument comes too late. See <em>Foxboro Harness Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 85 (1997) (\u201cA party is not entitled to raise arguments on appeal that he could have raised, but did not raise, before the administrative agency\u201d). Moreover, the written agreement contains no statement of facts which would support the claim that the plaintiff relied, to his detriment, on the alleged representation of the Authority, or that the Authority intended any such reliance. See <em>Clickner </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>422 Mass. 539, 544 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
