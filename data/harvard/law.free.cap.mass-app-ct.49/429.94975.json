See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. Although the complainant and the defendant were husband and wife on the date of the alleged offense, they divorced sometime in 1995. The theory of defense at trial was that the alleged offense never happened and that the complaint was brought because of a postdivorce dispute between the parties concerning Florida real estate. On appeal, the defendant argues that his daughter\u2019s testimony that he abused drugs and alcohol and kept weapons in his car and home created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>1. <em>The evidence. </em>Mary Joan Wilson (Mary) testified that on January 29, 1994, she arrived at Logan Airport after a trip to Florida. The defendant was there to meet and drive her to their marital residence, an apartment in Quincy. Once inside the lobby of the apartment building, the defendant told Mary to call their daughter, Lisa. Lisa resided in Ipswich with her husband and children. Because Mary had had the telephone in their apartment disconnected months earlier on account of the defendant\u2019s excessive calls to someone in Florida, she went to a pay phone in the lobby. After Mary completed her brief conversation with Lisa, the defendant said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this nice that we have to call our daughter this way, you . . . [expletive],\u201d smashed her head against the cement wall three times, and then went up to their fifth-floor apartment. Hurt and frightened, Mary left the building and drove to the home of her daughter and son-in-law. The drive to Ipswich took about seventy-five minutes. Mary stated that her head was swollen and that she was bleeding from a laceration. Although it was late when she arrived, her daughter had not yet retired. While Lisa applied ice cubes and face cloths to Mary\u2019s injuries, Mary told her what had happened. Mary testified that she remained at Lisa\u2019s home for about three days and then decided to return to the marital residence in Quincy. She stated that she returned to Quincy because she did not want to intrude upon her daughter and son-in-law any longer, and she had no other place to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On cross-examination, Mary readily acknowledged that she did not complain to the police about the defendant until 1997, and that prior to that date, she told no one other than her daughter about the assault and, even then, only to explain her unexpected arrival in Ipswich. She also stated that, before leaving her daughter\u2019s home to return to Quincy, she first called her son, Richard, who also resided in the apartment, to tell him what had happened and to make certain that he would be home should she need his protection against the defendant. Mary stated that she brought the complaint after a three-year time lapse because the defendant \u201chad returned to [Massachusetts].\u201d She also acknowledged that, subsequent to the divorce, the defendant initiated legal claims against her regarding a Florida condominium and that the dispute was resolved in her favor \u201cin the past year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Lisa testified and corroborated her mother\u2019s arrival in Ipswich and her injuries. She also related that, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>defendant had always been good to her \u2014 indeed, she thought of herself as the \u201cMafia Princess\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 there had been little contact between the defendant and her family in the \u201cpast few years,\u201d and her children had asked her why the defendant \u201cwas mean to Grammy.\u201d Lisa described the relationship between her mother and father as \u201cstormy\u201d and stated that she tried to convince her mother \u201cto get out of the situation . . . [s]he [Mary] was fearful, afraid of him.\u201d The transcript next reflects tire following exchange between the prosecutor and Lisa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd so how many days did she stay with you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">A.: \u201cThree nights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd then what happened after that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">A.: \u201cAnd they talked on the phone. I don\u2019t know if they made up. She went back. She had to get to work. She wanted to check on my brother. She didn\u2019t know how stable that situation was with him there \u2014 the two of them were abusing drugs and alcohol together . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">The court: \u201cYeah. Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">A.: \u201cMy brother and my father were abusing drugs and alcohol together and there were weapons in the home and in the trunk of the car and things like that. And she just tried to keep the peace and tried to go on for me and my kids, basically. My other brother\u2019s in California and has no contact with my father and tells people that his father\u2019s dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">Testifying on behalf of his father, Richard related that on January 29, 1994, his father and mother returned home and came into the apartment. He and his mother exchanged pleasantries and sat down to dinner. The defendant, as was his custom, took his meal in his bedroom. According to Richard, his father, as a result of medical problems, had difficulty eating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>and chose to do so alone. Richard also testified that, during the three days following his mother\u2019s return from Florida, she followed her usual routine, that is, going to work at 7:00 a.m. and returning home at about 5:00 p.m. He further stated that the first time he heard anything about his mother\u2019s allegation against his father was about eight months prior to trial, when his father called him after his arrest. Richard also testified that, had he heard that his father had assaulted his mother, he would have ascertained whether she needed medical attention and then confronted his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Richard if he was confused about the events of January 29, 1994, and whether he had been drinking or taking drugs that day. Richard answered no to each of the questions. The prosecutor next asked him about his mother\u2019s testimony concerning her telephone call to him three days after the incident, and Richard stated that he never had such a conversation with his mother. When asked to describe his relationship with his mother, Richard stated that they were \u201cextremely close,\u201d both in 1994, and at the time of trial. The prosecutor asked whether Richard had heard his sister\u2019s testimony, and he answered that he had. Next, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAre you saying your sister\u2019s lying?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Richard responded, \u201cThat\u2019s her . . . remembrance of the truth. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the truth. That is her recollection of the truth. I don\u2019t want to call my sister a liar. We\u2019re very close as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Relying upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875 (1984), the Commonwealth argues that Lisa\u2019s testimony was relevant to the issue of Mary\u2019s credibility on the question of why, in the circumstances related by Mary, she nonetheless decided to return to Quincy within three days of the assault. However, we think <em>Errington </em>readily distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In <em>Errington, </em>the complaining witness was questioned about her delay in making a complaint against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 876-877. Here, Mary, the complaining witness, was specifically asked why she returned to Quincy after staying in Ipswich for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>only three days. She said nothing about drugs, alcohol, or weapons, and explained that she returned to the marital residence because she did not want to intrude upon her daughter and son-in-law any longer and that she had nowhere else to go. There is nothing to show that Lisa\u2019s different explanation for her mother\u2019s departure was based upon Lisa\u2019s personal knowledge. We, therefore, conclude that the defendant\u2019s objection to Lisa\u2019s testimony, that her mother wanted to check up on Richard because Mary was worried that he and the defendant were abusing drugs and alcohol and had firearms in their possession, should have been sustained. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. 187, 189-190 (1994) (witness\u2019s belief and suspicion irrelevant because not based upon either first-hand knowledge or fact). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. at 881 (complaining witness\u2019s explanation for delayed complaint held relevant and competent). See generally Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.5 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In arguing that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed, appellate counsel proceeds on the premise that trial counsel failed to preserve the claim by failing to object a second time after Lisa repeated and enlarged upon the earlier response that triggered the first objection. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>417 Mass. at 191. Because we conclude that the error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967), we need not consider whether reversal would be warranted under a more favorable standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">To determine whether an error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, \u201cwe consider the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant (without consideration of any evidence erroneously admitted), the nature of the error, whether the error is \u2018sufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the [jury\u2019s] result might have been otherwise but for the error,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986), and whether it can be inferred \u2018from the record that counsel\u2019s failure to object was not simply a reasonable tactical decision.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We do not think that the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant can be \u201ccharacterized as one in which the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 22. There were no percipient witnesses to the assault, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Mary returned to the marital residence where she thereafter resided until the defendant left Massachusetts, there was a three-year time lapse between the assault and the complaint during which the parties were divorced and embroiled in postdivorce legal proceedings, and there was an absence of any medical evidence concerning Mary\u2019s injuries. In short, this was a \u201cclassic duel of credibility,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 127 (1977), in which corroboration of Mary\u2019s flight to Ipswich and her injuries was significant to the Commonwealth. Lisa described Mary\u2019s condition upon her arrival. On the other hand, Richard testified to the effect that his mother never went to Ipswich, that she arrived home as expected, that she went about her normal routine, and that, had she appeared bruised or otherwise harmed, he would have sought medical attention for her and then confronted the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Lisa went too far when she went beyond her description of Mary\u2019s condition upon her arrival in Ipswich. Not only did the jury hear her describe herself as a \u201cMafia Princess\u201d (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>she related how her children questioned her about the defendant\u2019s \u201cmean\u201d treatment of Mary. Even assuming this testimony was admissible, Lisa was next allowed to put her thumb on her mother\u2019s side of the scales when she claimed, contrary to Mary\u2019s testimony, that her mother left the safety of Ipswich because the defendant and Richard were substance abusers in possession of firearms. Lisa\u2019s testimony not only directly prejudiced the defendant, it also significantly harmed him by giving the jury an unfounded basis for disbelieving his sole witness, Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It is immaterial that the prosecutor made no mention of Lisa\u2019s inadmissible testimony in his closing argument. He argued, instead, that Richard\u2019s testimony that on the day in issue his mother\u2019s activities were consistent with her normal routine should not be believed because of the passage of time. Although hardly decisive, we note that the jury, during their deliberations, requested record repetition of the testimony given by Mary and the officer to whom she reported the incident three years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Based upon the circumstances presented, we are unable to conclude that Lisa\u2019s inadmissible testimony did not have a material influence upon the jury\u2019s verdict. Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s additional claim, that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument also gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. It is enough to state that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>event of a retrial, the prosecutor should not argue or suggest that the defendant had abused Mary for thirty-four years, the length of their marriage, until and unless evidence of such prolonged abuse is offered by the Commonwealth and deemed admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR5\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\"> Although the defendant\u2019s objection to that statement was sustained, he did not move to strike it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Trial counsel did not object to this improper question, and appellate counsel does not pursue the matter on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 400 (1983) (single improper question did not require reversal). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 708-710 (1984) (improper question repeatedly put to witness required new trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
