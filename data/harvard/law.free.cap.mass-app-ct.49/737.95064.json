Pacheco, has resisted the Falmouth conservation commission\u2019s attempt to compel him to rectify what the commission deemed his unauthorized 1990 filling of a \u201cwet spot\u201d on his land lying within the buffer zone to a wetland, in asserted violation of the State Wetlands Protection Act (G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40) and the wetland protection by-law of the town of Falmouth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>periods of apparent acquiescence to the commission\u2019s orders, Pacheco has succeeded in doing essentially nothing, beyond the shuffling of papers, in response to the commission\u2019s almost pretematurally patient efforts to secure his compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Pacheco now faces a mandatory injunction to do the evaded work, entered by a Superior Court judge in response to the commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its long-deferred complaint for enforcement of its order to restore the disturbed area. On this appeal he admits his noncompliance but attempts to justify it by reiterating a position he unsuccessfully took before both the commission and the Superior Court: namely, that the commission lacks \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over his property. The continued incantation of this contention finds no more success here, and we affirm the judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In sum, this is not a case impheating the doctrine on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Pacheco exclusively relies \u2014 that the issue of \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d is nonwaivable and can be raised at any point in a proceeding. That undeniably fundamental principle applies only when the jurisdictional issue has not been previously addressed and when \u201cit is <em>first </em>raised,\u201d at whatever stage of litigation, by either the parties or the trial or appellate court on its own motion. <em>Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981) (emphasis added). See <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>227 Mass. 336, 337-338 (1917); <em>Morse </em>v. <em>O'Hara, </em>247 Mass. 183, 185 (1924); <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Suffolk Law Sch., </em>295 Mass. 489, 495 (1936); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>310 Mass. 126, 129 (1941); <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilhome Sales, Inc., </em>15 Mass.

App. Ct. 668, 670 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Here, Pacheco challenged the commission\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d from the beginning, by claiming that the locus was too small and isolated to fall within wetlands protection. The commission explicitly addressed his objection in its 1990 order of conditions. After hearing evidence and conducting an on-site field inspection, it made specific findings supporting the validity of its exercise of authority (including findings that Pacheco had improperly minimized the size of the locus in his application, that the locus was significant for groundwater supply and flood control purposes, that it contained or was proximate to irrefutable wetlands vegetation, and that it was connected by an intermittent stream channel to a nearby cedar swamp). See Pacheco\u2019s admissions in note 1, <em>supra </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The commission\u2019s response to Pacheco\u2019s jurisdictional objection was proper. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number><em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn.

Regs. \u00a7 10.05[7][a], [j] [1989]). Nor did he (as he could have, had he requested such DEP action) seek judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of any adverse agency determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having forgone his opportunity to do so, he is precluded from relitigating his jurisdictional contention. <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>32 Mass.

Even had we any, however, the course of subsequent proceedings would remove it. On December 23, 1993, the commission issued an enforcement order informing Pacheco that the 1990 order of conditions had expired, that another on-site inspection revealed that his violation at the locus still existed, and that fines would be imposed daily until he filed a new notice of intent. Pacheco filed such a new notice on January 24, 1994, proposing to do the same work as described in the 1990 notice. A hearing on the new notice was held on February 16, 1994, resulting in the commission\u2019s issuance of a new order of conditions on February 24, 1994. That new order contained the same findings and mandates as its 1990 predecessor, but added as reasons for requiring the work \u201cprevention of pollution\u201d and \u201cprotection of wildlife habitat\u201d and also imposed a deadline of May 30, 1994, for its completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">On May 31, 1994, Pacheco, having done nothing in response to the new order, filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking a preliminary injunction to restrain the commission from enforcing its order (and fines) against him. In his \u201cverified complaint\u201d Pacheco did not contest the commission\u2019s jurisdiction but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>merely noted his \u201cdispute[]\u201d with the commission\u2019s position that the \u201cwet pocket\u201d and the stream channel connected to other wetlands \u201chad visible water and hydraulic soil conditions.\u201d The gravamen of the complaint, however, was the allegation that certain special conditions imposed by the commission in its order were inconsistent with the DEP\u2019s mandated general conditions and required \u201cprohibidve[ly]\u201d expensive work to complete. After a hearing, injunctive relief was denied Pacheco on June 8, 1994. He took no further steps to prosecute his action, and it was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation in 1995.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Pacheco did not appeal the commission\u2019s new order of conditions to the DEP (or, as he could have, proceeded pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, see note 4, supra) but simply continued to ignore it. On February 14, 1995, the commission finally issued an enforcement order. On February 21, 1995, Pacheco filed a request with the DEP for a superseding order of conditions \u2014 a procedure not authorized by the governing statute or regulations \u2014 which was promptly rejected by the DEP. The commission, through town counsel, provided him with yet another locus poenitentiae before becoming subject to enforcement, by letter dated July 27, 1995, but his inaction continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On October 17, 1995, the commission\u2019s instant enforcement complaint was filed, for injunctive relief to compel Pacheco\u2019s long-withheld compliance. On December 8, 1995, the DEP notified Pacheco of its awareness of his continued wetlands violations and his noncompliance with the commission\u2019s prior orders and threatened its own enforcement proceeding unless restoration work was completed within four months, observing in passing the commission\u2019s statutory and regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the order it sought to enforce. Pacheco failed to respond to the DEP notification or meet the DEP deadline. Nor did he plead \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction\u201d in his answer to the commission\u2019s complaint or in any motion, instead raising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the issue at the June, 1997, hearing on the commission\u2019s summary judgment motion for injunctive enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Against this procedural background, Pacheco must be precluded from relitigating the jurisdictional issue which he raised, lost, and twice failed to appeal; and which on a third occasion (his injunction suit) he waived by failing to advance it, actually acquiescing in the commission\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over the locus (complaining only of certain conditions imposed) and then dismissing the suit with prejudice. See <em>Tuite &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 754-755 (1997) (stipulated dismissal with prejudice is an adjudication on the merits and has same res judicata effect).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">On this record, the judge was amply justified, when rejecting Pacheco\u2019s jurisdictional objection, in declaring \u201cthat ship has sailed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since there was no genuine issue of material fact before the judge regarding either jurisdiction or Pacheco\u2019s (conceded) failure to comply with the 1994 order of conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the judge correctly ordered summary judgment and injunctive relief for the commission on its complaint for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The judgment is affirmed. The commission has requested \u201cjust costs and damages\u201d in connection with this appeal. Having prevailed on appeal, the commission \u201cmay . . . submit [its] petition for [appellate] fees together with the necessary back-up material and details as to hours spent, precise nature of the work, and fees requested,\u201d within fifteen days of the issuance of the rescript in this case. <em>Eldim, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 125, 131 (1999), quoting from <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989). Pacheco shall have fifteen days to respond to the commission\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-14\">General Laws c. 131, \u00a7 40, as here pertinent, prohibits any person from \u201cfilling] ... or altering] any . . . fresh water wetland, . . . marsh, meadow or swamp bordering on . . . any . . . creek, river, stream, pond or lake, or any land . . . subject to . . . flooding\u201d without local conservation commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>sion approval. See <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 12-16 (1979). It also identifies as areas subject to protection those areas a conservation commission determines, after hearing, to be \u201csignificant ... to the groundwater supply, to flood control, ... to prevention of pollution, . . . [or] to the protection of wildlife habitat.\u201d The Falmouth wetlands protection by-law has established what the commission views as a \u201cmore expansive jurisdictional scheme\u201d than that of \u00a7 40 (which local communities are free to do, <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 125-126 [1994]), by adding \u201cwet meadows,\u201d \u201cbogs,\u201d \u201cvernal pools,\u201d \u201clands subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater or surface water . . . and lands within 100 feet of any of the aforesaid resource areas\u201d to the areas requiring administrative approval before filling or altering. Pacheco himself identified the activity and area involved as \u201c[proposed filling within the buffer zone of a swamp and wetland\u201d in his August 22, 1990, notice of intent to do the restoration work the commission thought necessary; and the plan prepared by his own expert described the locus Pacheco had filled as a \u201cwet pocket\u201d and located it within 100 feet of two separate wetlands areas. Although Pacheco contends that the Falmouth wetlands protection by-law is not involved in this case and should not be considered, his assertion is belied by the record. Not only did his answer admit the allegation of the commission\u2019s verified complaint that the commission sought enforcement of its order under both the State statute and the town by-law, but the commission also invoked both from the first as the sources of its enforcement authority, a position adopted by both the Department of Environmental Protection and the Superior Court. In that connection, Pacheco\u2019s motion to strike all references to the by-law in the commission\u2019s brief is denied. See note 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The instant situation brings to mind Justice Kaplan\u2019s observation in <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 703 (1985): \u201c[T]he history of administrative law shows [that] attacks, mounted ostensibly under the banner of \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 have on occasion been used to delay, if not to abort, legitimate agency undertakings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The commission\u2019s determination \u2014 unchallenged by Pacheco \u2014 that the area was significant for flood control and groundwater supply purposes would alone be sufficient for jurisdiction under the statute and by-law. Moreover, the Department of Environmental Protection regulations define a \u201cstream\u201d as \u201ca body of running water . . . which moves in a definite channel in the ground due to hydraulic gradient, and which flows within, into or out of an Area Subject to Protection Under [the wetlands protection statute] .... Such a body of running water which does not flow throughout the year (i.e., which is intermittent) is a stream except for that portion upgradient of all bogs, swamps, wet meadows and marshes.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (1989). That definition also supports the commission\u2019s findings. Pacheco argues before us that the commission failed to make explicit findings as to the gradient of the \u201cstream channel\u201d observed by the commission and whether the locus was \u201cbordering on\u201d an appropriate body of water, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.02(1)(a) (1989) (contentions the record does not reveal were made below, which we could accordingly reject out of hand, <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number><em>of Rockland, </em>423 Mass. 690, 701-702 [1996], but which the commission\u2019s finding regarding the stream channel\u2019s connection of the locus to a swamp sufficiently answers). Yet he makes not the slightest acknowledgment of the well-established deference courts owe an agency\u2019s findings of fact and interpretation of a statute (or regulations) within it's charge. That deference prevents a court from interfering with an administrative determination (regulatory or adjudicatory) unless it is shown to be arbitrary or capricious, <em>Tarin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 743, 750-751 (1997); or is one supported by \u201cno ground which \u2018reasonable men might deem proper\u2019 to support it,\u201d <em>T.D.J. Dev.

App. Ct. at 128, quoting from <em>Cotter </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>329 Mass. 314, 318 (1952); or is devoid \u201cof any conceivable ground upon which [the action] may be upheld,\u201d <em>American Grain Prod.

He has failed to argue, much less demonstrate, how the challenged administrative action falls afoul of these agency-friendly standards, or how the findings he contests are unsupported by the requisite \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d (a test they appear easily to pass, see above-cited cases and <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 695-696 [1998]). He also has ignored the basic rules of appellate review mandating that, \u201c[i]f the agency has, in the discretionary exercise of its expertise, made a \u2018choice between two fairly conflicting views,\u2019 and its selection reflects reasonable evidence, \u2018[a] court may not displace [the agency\u2019s] choice,\u2019\u201d <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass.

Indeed, penetrating to the substance and essence of Pacheco\u2019s argument here rather than accepting its form, we observe that it is not really a challenge to \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in any fundamental sense, nor even a claim that the commission\u2019s action was legally erroneous or inconsistent with statutory language or policies. It is rather a fairly routine complaint that the agency\u2019s fact-finding was defective and was an insufficient basis on which to exercise its statutory authority. Even if his challenge had been timely made at the appropriate points in the prior proceedings \u2014 which we hold, <em>infra, </em>it was not \u2014 we would have little difficulty sustaining the validity of the Superior Court\u2019s ruling upholding the commission\u2019s order under the recognized standards and criteria for review of administrative actions set forth in the authorities cited above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b769-6\">If a local wetlands protection by-law is more stringent than G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and the conservation commission operates thereunder, the DEP appears to lack the power to supersede the commission\u2019s decision on a notice of intent to do work altering wetlands, and the appropriate avenue of judicial review is not via G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, but rather through an action in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 367-370 (1981). Neither party has raised this issue, however; and in any event it does not affect our analysis or decision, since Pacheco availed himself of neither appellate remedy and since the standards of appellate review are essentially the same in both routes.

As <em>Tuper, Stowe, </em>and <em>DeCarolis, supra, </em>indicate, the doctrine has been applied in both its prongs to the decisions of administrative agencies and covers unappealed agency final orders. See Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 431 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1999). Several of the cited authorities recognize the existence of certain narrow exceptions to the rule against relitigating decided jurisdictional issues \u2014 chiefly, if the exercise of jurisdiction constituted a clear usurpation or abuse of power, or if the tribunal asserting jurisdiction lacked the capacity for making an adequately informed determination as to its own jurisdiction \u2014 but Pacheco has made no argument in this respect, and we see no evidence in this record that any such exceptions would be applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Although the papers themselves were not made part of the record on appeal, the facts of Pacheco\u2019s complaint and the denial of the injunction he sought were explicitly alleged in the commission\u2019s verified enforcement complaint, admitted in Pacheco\u2019s answer, and referenced by the judge below. We have examined the papers pursuant to our inherent power under Mass.

App. Ct. 738 (1985), is entirely misplaced, for those cases do not stand for the proposition asserted \u2014 that he is free to raise the jurisdictional issue in this appeal. In those cases the judicial proceedings occurred entirely outside the administrative scheme. In the former case (where this court\u2019s ruling that the record did not establish that the locus was a wetland was reversed by the Supreme Judicial Court), the local conservation commission did not decide it had jurisdiction nor issue an order of conditions, so there was nothing for the landowner to appeal; in the latter, the landowner did not submit to the administrative process at all (and the decision turned on whether the word \u201calter\u201d in G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, encompassed certain \u201crepairs\u201d to a retaining wall at the base of a seawall, in the course of which the court noted that any \u201cfill\u201d by the landowner would be covered by the Wetlands Protection Act and defined \u201cfill\u201d so as to include precisely the activity undertaken by Pacheco, i.e., the placing of material that alters the elevation of a wetland). In contrast, not only did Pacheco choose to avail himself of the commission\u2019s process by filing his notice of intent; he also received a final agency decision that expressly included a jurisdictional determination. At that point, the only manner by which to raise a challenge to the commission\u2019s authority was first by the regulatory, then by the statutory, appeals process within the required time periods, which Pacheco twice failed to do. See <em>supra </em>at 741-742 &amp; n.4. See also <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>350 Mass. at 57; <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 352; <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 614-615; <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. at 423-424.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Although in making this point the judge emphasized what she (erroneously) thought was Pacheco\u2019s failure to have raised the issue in prior proceedings, we can affirm her correct summary judgment conclusion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>undisputed material facts in this record for the reasons set forth in this opinion. See <em>West Broadway Task Force </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>414 Mass. 394, 397-398 (1993); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 703 n.10 (1999). Even were we to view the entire saga of the commission\u2019s striving to make Pacheco comply with the wetlands protection laws as continuing proceedings in a single case \u2014 an issue Pacheco does not mention but which we address to forestall another dilatory maneuver on his part \u2022\u2014 the judge\u2019s refusal to consider his effort to reopen the jurisdictional question could be affirmed as well within her discretion under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine. See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 599 (1940); <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>424 Mass. 1, 7-8 (1996).
