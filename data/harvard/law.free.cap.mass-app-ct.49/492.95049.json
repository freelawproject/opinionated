L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[1][a][1]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no merit in any of his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">1. The defendant has failed to present an adequate record for reviewing his claim that the judge below erred in denying his \u201cmotion to dismiss [for] lack of jurisdiction\u201d on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the Brookline police performed an invalid extraterritorial stop and arrest in Boston just over the Brookline border.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, we have no transcript of the hearing. The motion judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law upholding the validity of the stop and arrest have not been shown to be erroneous on this record. To the contrary, the evidence relied on by the judge reflects an arrestable criminal violation occurring, and observed by the Brookline police, in Brookline. The defendant failed to stop for a Brookline police officer after the officer observed the defendant driving through a red light without stopping, activated his cruiser\u2019s lights and siren, and signaled the defendant to pull over.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officer commenced lawful fresh pursuit in Brookline thereafter (see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98A), culminating in the arrest when the defendant finally stopped just across the line in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">2. The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion in limine (to exclude reference to a liquor bottle seized by the police from the defendant\u2019s car after the arrest) was correctly denied on the bases of its untimeliness (see Dist./Mun.Cts.R.Crim.P. 6[a][2] [1996]) as well as the prior adjudication of the validity of the extraterritorial stop and arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">3. The defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to attack on appeal the judge\u2019s instruction admonishing the jury not to draw any inference from the absence of a breathalyzer test. His counsel expressly requested such an instruction at trial, and the defendant personally participated in the side bar col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>loquy regarding that instruction which followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He may not try his case on one theory and then obtain appellate review on a theory not advanced below. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lazarovich, </em>410 Mass. 466, 476 (1991). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 539, 544 (1987). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>428 Mass. 469, 475 (1998) (\u201c[E]ven structural error is subject to the doctrine of waiver\u201d). Counsel\u2019s decision to request the instruction was concededly strategic \u2014 responding to the fact that the jury had seen a videotape of the defendant\u2019s booking that included references to a breath test. It was not, therefore, manifestly unreasonable and could not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bart B., </em>424 Mass. 911, 914 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>4. There is nothing to the defendant\u2019s assertion that his trial counsel\u2019s assistance was constitutionally ineffective, because the record before us does not indisputably present the factual bases for such a claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 344 (1994). The contention that counsel was unprepared is in fact belied by the record, which reveals only a scheduling problem satisfactorily resolved without prejudice to the defendant. His argument that counsel failed to impeach police witnesses is legally insufficient (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bart B., </em>424 Mass. at 915-916) and fails to demonstrate how lack of \u201cbetter\u201d cross-examination materially weakened his defense or made a difference in the outcome (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 [1977]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>398 Mass. 838, 839 [1986]). Finally, his complaint about counsel\u2019s request for an \u201cabsence of breathalyzer\u201d instruction does not, as noted <em>supra, </em>give rise to a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-17\">The defendant\u2019s additional conviction for failure to stop for police (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25) and a verdict of responsible for the civil infraction of failure to stop/yield, all arising out of the same incident, were filed with the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The incident occurred in 1996, before the enactment of St. 1998, c. 212.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">This evidence also established that the defendant committed the arrestable offense of driving to endanger in Brookline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The defendant has provided nothing to show that the judge erred on the basis of the information before him. The same argument was again made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, on the basis of supposed \u201cinferences\u201d drawn by defendant\u2019s counsel from the videotape of the defendant\u2019s booking, introduced at trial, that the police had actually arrested him for operating under the influence but later realized the jurisdictional problem and only informed the defendant at booking that he was being charged with failure to stop for an officer. Based upon the arresting officer\u2019s testimony at trial, we see no error in the judge\u2019s refusing to draw such inferences and continuing to reject the defendant\u2019s claim of an invalid extraterritorial arrest. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>407 Mass. 70 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zorrilla, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 77 (1995), as legal authority for his invalid arrest argument is unavailing, since those cases involved extraterritorial stops for purely civil infractions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Although the Commonwealth asserts that the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zevitas, </em>418 Mass. 677 (1994) (which declared unconstitutional the statute mandating such an instruction as a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination), did not limit a defendant\u2019s right to request such an instruction, it has provided us with no pertinent authority to support its contention that the judge would have erred in refusing to grant such a request. It would appear to us that, in the absence of the defendant himself requesting the instruction and explicitly acknowledging that he was thereby waiving his privilege against self-incrimination, a judge should not give such an instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass. 426, 436 (1978). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 651 n.23 (1997) (indicating reluctance to add new rights to the \u201cvery short list of rights . . . that must be waived personally by a defendant and cannot be waived by his counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Here, however, the colloquy regarding the requested instruction, which actively involved the defendant, essentially satisfied those conditions. The judge in particular emphasized to the defendant his \u201cabsolute rights\u201d to refuse to take a breathalyzer test and not to have such refusal mentioned \u201cin any way\u201d at the trial and told him to think the matter over carefully. In addition, the judge asked the very sort of questions regarding the defendant\u2019s competence (age, schooling, freedom from alcohol, drugs or medications, understanding of the questions, absence of promises or pressures) as would characterize a plea colloquy. Upon receiving direct responses to the questions manifesting the defendant\u2019s awareness of the situation and voluntary acquiescence in his counsel\u2019s request, the judge inquired of defense counsel (still in the defendant\u2019s presence) if counsel knew of any factor that would impair the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to make a knowing, free and voluntary waiver of this right,\u201d to which counsel replied \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d The judge then gave the defendant \u201ca full chance to speak to his counsel\u201d about the matter and provide a final answer after the luncheon recess. At that time, still out of the jury\u2019s presence, the defendant, through counsel, informed the judge that he \u201cwould like that instruction.\u201d The judge then read the precise instruction he proposed (apparently from the statute at issue in <em>Zevitas), </em>to which defense counsel assented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
