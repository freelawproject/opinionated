Defense counsel objected, and a judge of the Chicopee District Court, who was hearing the case jury-waived, denied the motion. The prosecutor, following argument to persuade the judge to reconsider, was told by the judge, \u201cYour motion has been denied. You have a right to appeal.\u201d At that, the prosecutor remonstrated, \u201cI didn\u2019t make a decision not to proceed at this point.\u201d The judge made it abundantly clear that he regarded the case over and said, once again, \u201cYou have the right to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>my decision.\u201d We conclude that the judge dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint, and that this was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">1. <em>Status of case at conclusion of proceedings in the District Court. </em>Purportedly, the case comes to us under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, which, among other things, authorizes a district attorney to appeal a decision in the District Court allowing a motion to dismiss a complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither the docket nor the transcript of proceedings shows a motion by the defendant to dismiss the complaint or the allowance of such a motion. Indeed, the District Court docket, by a check mark, records a finding of not guilty. Although the transcript does not contain such a finding, the Commonwealth acknowledges that the judge uttered, \u201cnot guilty,\u201d as he strode off the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">If there was a finding of not guilty, principles of double jeopardy prevent a retrial of the defendant on the same charge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 333 (1986). In considering \u201cthe exact nature of the action taken by the District Court judge,\u201d however, we are not bound by labels or check-marks on a form, but we inquire whether there was a resolution of any of the facts that make up the offense charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>389 Mass. 275, 281 (1983). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 96 (1978). A reading of the transcript of the trial \u2014 before it came to an abrupt end \u2014 discloses that the testimony of the first witness, a security officer at Westover Air Reserve Base, did not proceed beyond a description of the roads into the base and a question about whether he had noticed a car that aroused his suspicion. Then the prosecutor started to ask, \u201cAt around 11:40 or so in the evening,\u201d and at that point, hesitated and interjected, \u201cActually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>we\u2019re, Your Honor, I\u2019m going to have to make an oral motion to amend the date of the offense. I just noticed that it\u2019s September 21st.\u201d Defense counsel objected, the government\u2019s motion to amend was denied, and, as described above, presentation of evidence came to a conclusion. There was no testimony that would have enabled the judge to decide whether the defendant on September 21 or 22, 1998, was driving an automobile on a public way and, if so, whether the defendant was impaired by alcohol while driving. At the point the judge ended the trial, he could not have made a finding of any essential fact and, therefore, could not have decided that the defendant was entitled to a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is apparent from the record that the judge cut off the trial because he thought there was a fatal variance between the facts and the complaint and he had determined not to permit an amendment of the complaint. The true nature of the judge\u2019s action, therefore, was to dismiss the complaint with prejudice in light of the defense objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>389 Mass. at 281. That action may be reviewed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">2. <em>Whether the dismissal was correct. </em>One gathers from the uncompleted question of. the prosecutor that he was going to ask the witness about an observation at 11:40 p.m. on September 21, 1998, i.e., twenty minutes short of September 22, 1998, the date of the offense as typed onto the complaint form. There was a State trooper, presumably the arresting officer, waiting in the wings as a witness. By the time that officer prepared a complaint, it would likely have been into the early hours of September 22. Whether there was a variance between the facts of the offense and the complaint may have been arguable. To the extent there was a variance between the proof and the complaint as to the day of the offense, it was immaterial, unless the defendant was prejudiced in his defense. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35. Mass.R.Crim.P. 4(d), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 683 (1992). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A. Graziano, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 69, 74 (1993). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 482, 488-489 (2000). Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 741 (2d ed. 1983). Moving to amend the complaint was a belt-and-suspenders caution. A motion to amend is allowable, even though trial had begun, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sitko, </em>372 Mass. 305, 307-308 (1977), <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 754, 761-762 (1981), unless the defense would be prejudiced by the amendment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>415 Mass. 161, 165 (1993). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kapsalis, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 454 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">There is not even a hint of prejudice to the defendant flowing from a one-day change of date in the complaint. The date is not an essential ingredient of the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Apprehension of the defendant may have occurred during a twenty-minute span before the time the date cited, September 22, 1998, began. The defendant could hardly have been in doubt as to the occasion which led to the complaint against him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saya, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 509, 511 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">It is apparent from the transcript of the trial that the judge acted as he did not because he thought the defendant might suffer prejudice by the proposed amendment to the complaint but because he thought the government should do better and get it right the first time. In explanation of his ruling, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cMy problem is this has happened before, not with yourself, but it\u2019s happened before. And I\u2019ve heard the same argument from the District Attorney that the date of the offense doesn\u2019t matter. Well if that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s put all cases on for the year 2,000 and something date of offense because if it doesn\u2019t matter, it does matter. It does matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We are not without understanding of \u201ca show of evanescent irritation \u2014 a modicum of quick temper that must be allowed even judges.\u201d <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 17 (1954). In a situation such as this, however, there is an interest beyond the prosecutor, the defendant, and the judge, and that is the interest of the general public in just disposition of the case. If a defendant has committed a second offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor it is a serious offense and there is a serious public safety concern that the defendant be punished as prescribed by law. That concern may not be subordinated to a judge\u2019s wish to give a course of instruction in pleading to a district attorney\u2019s office. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983) (\u201cAbsent egregious misconduct or at least a serious threat of prejudice, the remedy of dismissal infringes too severely on the public interest in bringing guilty persons to justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The order dismissing the complaint is vacated and the complaint shall be brought forward for trial in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The first paragraph of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as amended by St. 1991, c. 488, \u00a7\u00a7 11 &amp; 12, provides: \u201cAn appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney from the district court to the appeals court in all criminal cases and in all delinquency cases from a decision, order or judgment of the court (1) allowing a motion to dismiss an indictment or complaint, (2) allowing a motion to suppress evidence, or (3) denying a motion to transfer pursuant to section sixty-one of [c. 119].\u201d Subsequent paragraphs in the statute deal with appeals to the Supreme Judicial Court from decisions in the Superior Court to dismiss an indictment or complaint or the allowance in the Superior Court of a pretrial motion to suppress evidence.
