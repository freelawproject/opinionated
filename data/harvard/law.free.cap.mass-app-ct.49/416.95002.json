L. c. 209A, claiming then and on appeal that he and the plaintiff Heather Sorgman did not have the relationship necessary under the statute to subject him to its mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">The pertinent facts emerged at an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion. The plaintiff was a toddler in 1967 when her mother married the defendant; they were divorced about ten years later in 1977. During the ten-year marriage, the plaintiff lived with her mother and the defendant in the same household. The plaintiff is not the defendant\u2019s biological or adopted child, but he permitted her to take his last name to facilitate her receipt of health benefits, and she continues to refer to him as her father. Following the divorce, the plaintiff and defendant remained in some manner of contact with each other over the years, albeit not always happily. Over some period of time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the early 1990\u2019s, the plaintiff stored in her home some of the defendant\u2019s furniture and belongings. We need not recount, given the limited issue before us, testimony concerning the conduct which precipitated the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to obtain orders against the defendant under G. L. c. 209A.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The defendant contends that the statute by its terms does not apply to the parties here and, accordingly, that no order should have entered against him. The statute permits \u201c[a] person suffering from abuse from an adult or minor family or household member\u201d to seek protection from such abuse. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. Section 1 defines \u201cfamily or household members\u201d so as to include persons who <em>\u201c(b) </em>are or were residing together in the same household,\u201d and \u201c(c) are or were related by blood or marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that he and the plaintiff are not now, or were they in the recent past, either residents of the same household or related to each other by blood or marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We interpret G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, \u201caccording to \u2018its words construed by the ordinary and approved use of the language,\u2019 examined in light of the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 634 (2000), quoting from <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 487-488 (1984). The statutory provisions at issue suffer from no apparent ambiguity and do not support the defendant\u2019s view. The use of the word \u201cwere,\u201d together with the word \u201care,\u201d in both subsections <em>(b) </em>and (c), brings past as well as present relationships within the ambit of those subsections. Here, the evidence shows that the parties \u201cwere residing in the same household\u201d from 1967 to 1977, as subsection <em>(b) </em>requires. By virtue of the marriage between the defendant and the plaintiff\u2019s mother in that same period, it would seem as well that the parties \u201cwere related ... by marriage,\u201d as stepfather and stepdaughter, as subsection (c) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The defendant resists this result by suggesting that the statute was not meant to protect \u201cex-stepchildren\u201d such as the plaintiff, particularly those whose \u201cex\u201d status has persisted for so many years. Nothing in the statute or case law supports this. Had the Legislature intended to exclude stepchildren as a group from those who would otherwise be included in subsections <em>(b) </em>or (c), or had it intended to impose a time limitation on the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>plication of those subsections, it could surely have done so. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the Legislature by implying limiting factors to plain statutory language. See <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 547 (1976). Particularly where, as here, the parties continued to have contact and involvement with each other long after the marriage and living arrangements which initially gave rise to their relationship ended, the defendant\u2019s suggestion that we imply such limitations is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the order entered under G. L. c. 209A.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The parties agree that the categories of persons set forth in the remaining subsections <em>(a), (d), </em>and <em>(e) </em>have no application here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
