L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(6), and illegal possession of a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), or alternatively a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These charges arose after the defendant was identified as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>person who fired several shots from a handgun into the air outside an apartment building in Lowell where a birthday party was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">1. <em>Motion for a required finding of not guilty. </em>The indictment under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(6), expressly accused the defendant of \u201can assault upon occupants [of the building where the party was held].\u201d The defendant argues the evidence was insufficient to show that the firing of shots in the air satisfies the intent element of the immediately threatened battery branch of assault as required by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Musgrave, </em>38 Mass. App. <em>Ct. </em>519, 524 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>421 Mass. 610 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The relevant factual evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth is as follows. The birthday party took place in two rooms on the first floor of an apartment building, reached through a door located about twenty to twenty-five feet down a hallway from a street entrance. It was a \u201cvery crowded\u201d party. The defendant was observed during the evening \u201cdrifting around [and] going from one room to another.\u201d Near midnight two fights broke out, one in the hallway and another in the room where there had been dancing. A degree of chaos followed during which many of the partygoers ran to the street.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Some of them were observed standing \u201cin front of the doorway\u201d to the building while \u201ctwo or three guys\u201d were standing on the street (about twenty to twenty-five feet from the building), \u201cyelling back and forth . . . one of them had his hand in the air.\u201d At that time, the one whose hand was \u201cin the air\u201d was observed firing several shots into the air from what appeared to be a small handgun and was heard to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He later was identified as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The firing of the shots, in this factual and evidentiary context, supports a reasonable inference that the defendant engaged in \u201cintentionally menacing conduct [which] gives rise to a reasonable inference of intent to cause apprehension [of harm].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Musgrave, supra. </em>The shots were fired in close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>temporal and physical proximity to partygoers who were leaving the party. Although there is no evidence that the defendant pointed the gun at any of them, or directed any express verbal threats to them, he was one of those \u201cyelling back and forth\u201d at the group of partygoers near the doorway, and his \u201cvoluntary and conscious act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 525, of firing the shots in the air at that time reasonably could be viewed as menacing conduct \u201cintended or calculated to make the [partygoers] fearful or apprehensive of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty properly was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the judge\u2019s instructions were not deficient in stating the intent element for the charged crime. The specific instruction included: \u201cThere must be proof of an intent to cause the victim[\u2019s] or victims^] fear or apprehension of immediate harm. There must be an actual intention to cause fear or apprehension.\u201d Preceding this section was an instruction on the meaning of intent which the judge introduced by stating that \u201cthe offenses in this case involve intent.\u201d Viewed as a whole, and not parsed as the defendant does, we conclude a reasonable juror would not have used the instruction incorrectly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 (1996). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kushner, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 918 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">3. <em>Identification testimony. </em>Material to the defendant\u2019s conviction of illegal firearm possession are his claims of error with respect to his identification. He asserts that there was a significant variation between the testimony of a police officer who, shortly after the events at the party in this case, observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>a witness pick a photograph of the defendant from an array<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> presented to her at the police station, and the witness\u2019s testimony stating that she had selected a photograph of the shooter. Although the witness acknowledged at trial, over a year after the events, that she would not be able to identify that person in court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> there was no equivocation in her testimony concerning her selection of the photograph at the police station. Similarly, there was nothing equivocal about the officer\u2019s testimony, given without objection, that the witness had selected a photograph, and that the photograph was that of the defendant. The officer\u2019s testimony properly was admitted as corroboration of the extrajudicial identification. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 60 &amp; n.8 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">There also is no merit in the further assertion that the judge erred in allowing the officer\u2019s testimony that the selected photograph was that of the defendant. Defense counsel, properly cautioned by the judge not to probe the officer as to how he knew the defendant (there was a very real risk that the officer might state he had previously arrested the defendant),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> decided not to pursue the matter, withdrawing his earlier objection intending to challenge how the officer knew that the photograph was that of the defendant. The judge did not err, nor was trial counsel ineffective. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 255-256 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-16\">The sentences imposed were (1) two and one-half years in the house of correction for the conviction of illegal possession of a firearm, and (2) after release from that sentence, a five-year term of probation for the assault by means of a dangerous weapon conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">There is no indication that the Commonwealth prosecuted the case under the \u201cattempted battery\u201d branch of assault. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 303 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\">A number of partygoers remained in the hallway. Hearing \u201cbangs\u201d or \u201cfirecracker noises\u201d and also screaming of people outside, one witness testified that he did not open the front door because he was \u201c[s]cared.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-10\">This witness testified that she \u201cwas yelling at him to stop\u201d shooting. The defendant was facing her and there was a group of partygoers behind her at the doorway to the building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\">There is no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the indictment should be narrowly construed and limited to \u201coccupants.\u201d He argues it would be unreasonable to infer that the partygoers inside the building would have had any apprehension of harm from the shots fired outside the building. He further claims that those who left the party and went into the street no longer were \u201coccupants\u201d and could not be considered victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The use of the word \u201coccupants\u201d in the indictment did not limit proper notice to the defendant of the charged crime or its essential elements, nor was he prejudiced in his defense. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 869-870 (1982), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kope, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945 (1991). Moreover, given the evidence of partygoers congregating at the doorway of the building in which the party was held, the distinction between these recent occupants and those still in the building is one of more form than substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The array was not introduced in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The officer identified the defendant in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The prosecutor stated at side bar that the photograph was taken \u201cthe last time [the defendant] was involved in a shooting and was arrested as a juvenile.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
