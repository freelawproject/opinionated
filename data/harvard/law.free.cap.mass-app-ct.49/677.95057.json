Dunston lived in the Warren Gardens area of the Roxbury section of Boston, the neighborhood lived in and frequented by the defendant and his group of friends. Gross lived in the St. Joseph\u2019s neighborhood of Roxbury, and Adams lived in the Dorchester section of Boston. During their walk, they saw the defendant and several of his friends standing some distance away. Gross testified that he often saw this group congregate in Warren Gardens and that he did not \u201cget along\u201d with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Gross and Adams were met by Dunston\u2019s mother, who informed them that Dunston was not at home. She testified that Adams seemed nervous when he came to her door. Gross and Adams left, taking a different route home to avoid the defendant and his group, which included (according to Gross) Roland Worrell, Wayne Hogan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Richard Ashby. Gross had known the group for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Gross testified that, as they began to walk, he saw the defendant up on a hill, approximately twenty feet away, aiming a silver revolver directly at them and shooting. Nothing, according to Gross, obstructed his view. He heard five or six shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Adams was struck by a bullet in the back. Gross initially tried to drag Adams to safety but fled when unsuccessful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Gross contacted police on January 15, 1995, eleven days after the shooting, and identified the defendant from a photo array. At trial Gross again identified the defendant as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">On cross-examination the defendant challenged Gross\u2019s credibility. He elicited a seven year old incident in which Gross had given a false name and address to the police. He also brought out several inconsistencies in Gross\u2019s version of events. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>example, Gross had told police that he saw three men on the hill but testified at trial that there were five or six. He admitted that he had lied to police when he told them that he had previously seen the defendant\u2019s gun. He acknowledged various criminal proceedings against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further admitted that in December, 1994, and January, 1995, he and the defendant had a dispute concerning their respective girlfriends.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The defendant also challenged the believability of Gross\u2019s identification of the defendant by eliciting from Detective Paul Bamide that a bus driver had given the police a description of the shooter that differed markedly from the defendant. The bus driver had observed the shooter from 200 feet away and across three lanes of traffic, and did not pick out the defendant\u2019s photograph from an array.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Other testimony at trial tended in significant respects to corroborate Gross\u2019s story. See note 7, <em>infra. </em>Moreover, while the defendant had been a fixture in Warren Gardens until the day of the shooting, he was not seen there after the shooting. Police visits to his home were unfruitful. In October, 1995, the defendant was arrested in Buffalo, New York, using a student identification card with a false name. When confronted by police, he gave a false name and a false address.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">1. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant urges this court to reverse his conviction on the grounds that in his closing argument the prosecutor excessively played on the jury\u2019s sympathy, misstated the evidence, and rendered his personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We consider the challenged comments in light of the entire argument, the judge\u2019s instructions, and the evidence at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 643-644 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Mass. 745, 749 (1999). So viewed, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury adequately counteracted any improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The defendant was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">a. <em>Improper appeal to sympathy. </em>Because the defendant did not object at trial to the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks on grounds of an excessive appeal to sympathy, \u201cour review is limited to determining whether there has been a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. at 747, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 471 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The Commonwealth concedes, and we agree, that the prosecutor crossed the line of proper argument when, at the beginning of his oration, he launched into a plea for sympathy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201c[H]e was a scared, skinny, fifteen year old kid running for his life. Envision that scene. Running for his life as this man stood on a hill with a pistol and started shooting at these two. Sometimes we can lose sight of that.. . . [Sjometimes you can lose sight of that fact, that a fifteen year old young man is dead because of Bums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cRonell Adams\u2019s life means as much as mine, yours, respectfully, the judge or anyone in this courtroom .... \u25a0 His life counts as much as anyone\u2019s, is as valuable as anyone\u2019s. Ronell Adams was fifteen years old. He\u2019s dead and buried because of him. Ronell Adams, fifteen years old, no longer exists. He\u2019s not coming home to his mother. He\u2019s not going to walk through this door right now. He\u2019s dead and buried. Fifteen years old. I want you to reflect on that for a minute how young that is. He\u2019s just a kid, he\u2019s a baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201c[Tjhe priority in his fife should be making the varsity teams, having a good time for himself. Instead, he\u2019s dead and buried because of him. And we can lose sight of that if we keep on pointing fingers at him and Gross.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Toward the end of his argument the prosecutor renewed the theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">\u201c[A] fifteen-year-old kid, running for his life . . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>How do you portray that scene? The panic in his mind as he rounds that corner and a bullet enters his back and goes through his chest and destroys everything in the middle. Destroys his heart. That\u2019s the brutal reality of murder. Stumbling up the sidewalk and dropping dead, as he turns around and flees and jets off to New York later on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">He then said, \u201cI\u2019m asking each and every one of you to do something about it. I\u2019m asking you to convict him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks bear a close resemblance to those held improper in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 494 (1997).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Santiago, </em>the defendant objected, the evidence was far from overwhelming, and the judge never told the jury to disregard sympathy in their deliberations and did not correct a prejudicial misstatement of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 500-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The defendant also relies upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 266-268 (1998). In that case, the prosecutor not only improperly appealed to sympathy and stated to the jury, \u201cI\u2019m asking you respectfully to do something about it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 264, but also impugned the defendant\u2019s character by suggesting that the defendant used drugs and had a criminal record simply because there was evidence that his friends did. <em>Id. </em>at 263-265. Because the case turned on the defendant\u2019s credibility, and the evidence was not overwhelming, we reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 267-268.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Circumstances are materially different in the present case. The defendant did not object at trial' to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement or closing argument, which is \u201csome indication that the tone [and] manner ... of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s argument were not [in the context of the trial deemed] unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. at 471, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 380 (1995). Indeed, the absence of an objection could derive from the fact that the greater part of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument focused upon the evidence in this case; his pleas for sympathy did not suffuse the entire argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 857 (1999). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 789 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>(conviction reversed where unwarranted characterization of defendant as drug dealer saturated entire case from beginning to end).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Although the Commonwealth\u2019s case turned heavily on Gross\u2019s testimony, testimony by other witnesses corroborated details of his story,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, as mentioned earlier, there was strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, namely, his disappearance after the shooting and his turning up living in New York under an assumed name with a false student identification card. When confronted by police, he gave a false name and nonexistent address.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Furthermore, the judge specifically instructed the jury to disregard sympathy<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that closing arguments are not evidence in the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. at 857-858. The jury\u2019s adherence to these instructions and their disregard of the prosecutor\u2019s appeal to sympathy are evident from the jury\u2019s requests that the judge again instruct on reasonable doubt and on the distinction between first and second degree murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, </em>425 Mass. 279, 287-288 (1997) (new trial not required where, although defendant objected at trial, judge told jury to disregard sympathy and jury questions evinced focus on key issues); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Depradine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 409 (1997) (motion for mistrial properly denied where jury instructions and jury\u2019s focus on pertinent issues negated claim of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Although the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of permissible argument, given the lack of an objection by the defendant, the strong evidence of guilt, the judge\u2019s very specific instructions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the jury, and the jury\u2019s focus upon the primary issues in the case, we conclude that his excesses did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 582 (1997) (conviction affirmed where, although defendant objected, evidence was strong, judge told jury that closings are not evidence, and prosecutor asked jury to not decide case based on sympathy).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">b. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">i. <em>Testimony of Roland Worrell. </em>In his closing, the prosecutor incorrectly argued that Roland Worrell, a friend of the defendant, testified at trial that he had seen the defendant in Warren Gardens on the day of the shooting. Worrell <em>had </em>so testified before the grand jury, but at trial he testified to the contrary, and then had been impeached with his grand jury testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s substantive use of Worrell\u2019s grand jury testimony was improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>412 Mass. 147, 156 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">After the argument, the defendant objected. The judge indicated he would tell the jury that their memories of the evidence controlled. This he did. The defendant did not lodge a further objection. In these circumstances, we review the remark in light of the entire argument, the judge\u2019s instructions, and the evidence, looking for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 150, 154 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 601 &amp; n.16 (1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 714 (1998). We find no such risk in this isolated reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">ii. <em>The defendant\u2019s flight to New York. </em>The prosecutor did not exceed the evidence in arguing that the defendant fled to New York the day of the shooting. The evidence at trial established that the defendant was seen on a daily basis in Warren Gardens and that he was not seen after the shooting. Given the defendant\u2019s arrest over nine months later in New York and his use of a false name and identification card, the prosecutor could properly argue the inference that the defendant had fled to New York shortly after the shooting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>427 Mass. 434, 443-444 (1998) (prosecutor could reasonably argue that defendant\u2019s disappearance from place which he regularly frequented during weeks prior to murder manifested consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">c. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to defendant\u2019s guilt. </em>In his closing, the prosecutor several times argued that innocent men do not lie or use false addresses but that guilty men do. Although he did not object at trial, the defendant now equates these statements to a personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. We do not so construe them. In any event, they did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowels, </em>425 Mass. at 288 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">2. <em>Admission of motive evidence. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge admitted evidence that in 1992 Karee Lewis shot Roland Worrell and Rodney Ashby, friends of the defendant who were seen with him prior to tire shooting, and two other individuals, one of whom died. There was no evidence that Gross, the victim, or the defendant were present at this incident. However, Gross testified that he was friends with Karee Lewis, who was also from the St. Joseph\u2019s neighborhood, and that he (Gross) did not like and did not get along with a group of young men from Warren Gardens, comprised of the defendant and his friends. The judge instructed the jury that the evidence of the 1992 shooting was admitted only to show motive, which we take to refer to the standing hostility between the two groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Testimony bearing on motive is admissible in evidence, of course. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 73 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ashley, 427 Mass. 620, 624-625 (1998). \u201cDetermination of the weight of such evidence is for the jury, and evidence which merely suggests rather than \u2018clearly shows\u2019 a motive for the crime may still be ruled admissible. There is no requirement that evidence [of motive] be conclusive in order to be admissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Germain, </em>381 Mass. 256, 271 (1980). The question presented is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in ruling that the probative value of the motive evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 504 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 678 (1985). The judge could reasonably conclude that Gross\u2019s testimony concerning the continuing animosity between himself and the young men who frequented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Warren Gardens and his and the victim\u2019s anxiety upon encountering this group on the day of the incident rendered the evidence of the 1992 incident relevant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 215-216 (1984). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 349 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">a. <em>Instruction on mistaken identification. </em>Although at trial the defendant did not request a mistaken identification instruction, he now urges this court to find that the absence of such an instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. A judge is compelled to give such an instruction when requested by the defendant and warranted by the facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>428 Mass. 76, 78 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Here, it is manifest from his cross-examination of Gross and his opening and closing remarks that the defendant pursued a theory that Gross was biased and lied when he testified that the defendant was the shooter. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odware, </em>429 Mass. 231, 237 (1999) (defendant argued mistaken identification in opening and closing and requested instruction). The defendant clearly eschewed a mistaken identification theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Furthermore, the evidence did not warrant such an instruction. The shooting occurred during daylight hours, Gross had known the defendant for several years, and Gross testified that the shooter stood only twenty feet away. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 48 (1995) (instruction not required where victim had known defendant for over one year, was within several feet of the perpetrator, never recanted the identification, and defendant never offered alibi); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 906-907 (1997) (instruction not required where witness observed defendant clearly from 100 feet away during daylight hours, view was unobstructed, and witness knew defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">b. <em>Unanimity instruction. </em>The defendant\u2019s assertion that the judge coerced the jury to reach a verdict by instructing the jury that their verdict must be unanimous and by failing to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the jurors to vote according to their own consciences is without merit. The judge specifically told the jury, \u201cYou need not . . . surrender your convictions,\u201d which is virtually identical to instructions approved of in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 102-103 (1973). Cases concerning instructions to deadlocked juries are not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have considered all the arguments, and we have found no error by the judge that presents a serious obstacle to affirming the judgment. We must register our dismay, however, that what would otherwise have been an essentially error-free trial was significantly complicated by the prosecutor\u2019s resort to passion in beginning and ending his closing argument, a resort that came perilously close to requiring a retrial. Especially dismaying is that the histrionics seem to have been studied, not careless: the prosecutor in effect created an issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We write this postlude to caution offending prosecutors again to the needless risk of reversal that they run in transgressing the well-defined boundaries of relevance in argument, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 537-539 (1991), and cases cited \u2014 needless, because inflamed oratory is probably of little pedagogical value in a court, where passion is more likely to be stirred by understatement than by overemphasis and exaggeration. We admonish such prosecutors to show more faith in the intelligence of jurors, who can be trusted to empathize with victims and to understand that criminals should be punished without having those simple ideas belabored. A trail of unnecessarily vulnerable convictions does little to enhance a prosecutor\u2019s reputation for professionalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Gross had omitted Hogan in his statement to police.

He received a suspended sentence on that charge and was placed on probation. In addition, from August, 1995, until February, 1996, Gross had a probation surrender hearing pending in Roxbury District Court. After testifying before the grand jury in the present matter, his case in Roxbury was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Appellate counsel was not the trial prosecutor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b707-10\">The relevant factors considered in measuring the cumulative effect of all the errors in context of the entire argument and the case as a whole are whether the defendant objected at trial, whether the judge\u2019s instructions had any curative impact, whether the errors went to the heart of the case, whether the jury could sort out the excessive claims by the Commonwealth, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 643-644 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Also clearly wrong was the repeated return to the victim\u2019s young age, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., 427 </em>Mass. 754, 761 (1998), and the exhortation to the jury to \u201cdo something about it.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>44 Mass. App. 258, 264 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">For example, Gross reported that the defendant fired repeatedly with a revolver; a revolver does not eject shell casings, and no shell casings were recovered from the scene. Herbert Callwood testified that, while he was working in an apartment in Warren Gardens at the time of the shooting, he heard a group of youths walk by and a person say, \u201cEight Dabney,\u201d which is where Roland Worrell lived. Marjorie Johnson, who worked across the street from the site of the shooting, testified that she heard shots and then saw Gross trying to lift or carry Adams.
