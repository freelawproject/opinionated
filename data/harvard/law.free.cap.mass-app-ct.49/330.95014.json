(club). He then filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendants as officers and employees of the club<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recover for his injuries, claiming that the defendants\u2019 negligent maintenance of the ice surface and failure to warn him of its defective condition resulted in his injuries. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that a release executed by the plaintiff barred this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge ruled that the release was valid and entered judgment for the defendants from which the plaintiff has appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201cAs a general proposition, releases of liability for ordinary negligence are valid.\u201d <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 608 n.2 (1989). See <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Natl. Safety Council, </em>416 Mass. 286, 288 (1993). However, a release may not shield a defendant from responsibility for violation of a statutory duty. <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Mansfield Beauty Academy, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 507, 511 (1968). <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>In this case, the plaintiff argues that the release does not bar his action because the defendants had a statutory duty under the State Building Code (code) to maintain the ice skating rink in a safe condition, 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 104.1 (1990), and the release is void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Under G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3A, the State Building Code is applicable and enforceable in every municipality in Massachusetts. Under its provisions, an \u201cowner\u201d shall be responsible for maintaining all \u201cbuildings\u201d and \u201cstructures\u201d in a \u201csafe and sanitary condition.\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 104.1, 104.2 (1990). An owner is defined as \u201c[ejvery person[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] who alone or jointly or severally with others (a) has legal title to any building or structure; or (b) has care, charge, or control of any building or structure in any capacity including but not limited to agent ... of the estate of the holder of legal title . . . .\u201d 780 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Mass. Regs. \u00a7 201.0 (1990). In this case, there is no dispute that the rink was owned and under the control of the club and that the defendant Donna was its president; the defendant Crosier, its executive director; and the defendant Martin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> its employee. Because of their respective capacities in the club and the breadth of the code\u2019s definition of \u201cowner,\u201d it would appear that each of the defendants arguably qualifies as an \u201cowner\u201d of the rink under the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We also assume, without deciding, that an ice skating rink meets the definition of a building or structure under the code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That said, however, we do not believe that the regulation applies to the circumstances of this case. The intent of the code is to \u201cinsure public safety, health and welfare insofar as they are affected by building construction through structural strength, adequate egress facilities, sanitary conditions, equipment, light and ventilation and fire safety . . . .\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 100.4 (1990). In this case, the plaintiff claims that his injury was due to a soft spot in the ice surface which we view as unrelated to the structural components of the rink and outside the scope of the code\u2019s enumerated objectives. Consequently, the defendants are not precluded from relying upon the waiver to shield them from liability, for the waiver does not \u201cdo violence to the public policy underlying the [code\u2019s] enactment.\u201d <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 378 (1990), quoting from <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 413 (1981). See <em>Matteo </em>v. <em>Livingstone, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 661 (1996) (\u201cviolation of a [building code] regulation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>relevant to the question of negligence only if the risk that materialized was within the contemplation of the regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We also reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the waiver is per se against public policy. We have repeatedly recognized that, at least in the case of ordinary negligence, the \u201callocation [of] risk by agreement is not contrary to public policy.\u201d <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Central Mass. Chapter of the Natl. Safety Council, </em>416 Mass. at 289 &amp; n.1. <em>Zavras </em>v. <em>Capeway Rovers Motorcycle Club, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 18 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-16\">The club was not named as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The release reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cI and my parents and/or guardian assume all risk of injury to person or property resulting from, caused by, or connected with, any and all activities of the Pittsfield Parks Speed Skating Club from October 1996 through April 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201cI hereby, for myself, heirs, executors, and administrators, waive and release any and all rights and claims for damages I may have against the City of Pittsfield, Massachusetts; ... the Department of Parks and Recreation of the City of Pittsfield; the Pittsfield Parks Speed Skating Club; the Pittsfield Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club; Vietnam Veterans Memorial Skating Rink or their agents, representatives, successors, or assigns and for all injuries suffered by me during the duration of the above mentioned activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">A corporation is included in the definition of person. 780 Code Mass.

A building is defined under the code as \u201c[a] structure enclosed within exterior walls or firewalls, built, erected and framed of a combination of any materials, whether portable or fixed, having a roof, to form a structure for the shelter of persons, animals or property. For the purpose of this definition, \u2018roof\u2019 shall include an awning or similar covering, whether or not permanent in nature. The word \u2018building\u2019 shall be construed where the context requires as though followed by the words \u2018or part or parts thereof.\u2019 \u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 201.0 (1990). A structure is defined under the code as \u201c[a] combination of materials assembled at a fixed location to give support or shelter, such as a building, framework, retaining wall, tent, reviewing stand, platform, bin, . . sign, flagpole, recreational tramway, mast for radio antenna, or the like. The word \u2018structure\u2019 shall be construed, where the context requires, as though followed by the words, \u2018or part or parts thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
