No. 94-430, 90 Stat. 1346 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796-3796c (1994)). The Court of Federal Claims reversed the Department\u2019s denial of benefits and remanded for further proceedings. The court ruled that (1) the Department\u2019s hearing officer had an affirmative obligation to develop the record in support of a claim for benefits, and that the Department failed to give proper weight to both (2) the local police department\u2019s decision that the officer\u2019s death occurred in the line of duty and (3) factual determinations in the police department\u2019s reports of the event. We disagree with the court\u2019s first two rulings, but affirm the third. Accordingly, we modify the remand decision of the Court of Federal Claims and, as thus modified, affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">A. The Benefits Act provided for a Federal payment of $100,000 to the surviving spouse and children of a public safety officer (which includes a police officer, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(5)) who \u201cha[d] died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796 (1994). Administration of the Act is assigned to the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (\u201cBureau\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to statutory authority, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3796c(a), the Bureau has promulgated detailed regulations that define various terms in the statute and prescribe the administrative procedures the Bureau will follow in adjudicating claims under the Act. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.1.40 (2001). Those regulations provide that a police officer\u2019s injury occurred \u201cin the line of duty\u201d if it arose out of \u201c[a]ny action which [the] officer ... [was] obligated or authorized by rule, regulations, condition of employment or service, or law to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">A claimant seeking death benefits under the Act must file a claim with the Bureau, which will preliminarily determine eligibility for benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.23. A claimant who is ruled ineligible for benefits may obtain a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, whose decision is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>viewable by the Director of the Bureau. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.24(a), (h)(1). The Director\u2019s decision is the Bureau\u2019s final decision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.24(h)(2). That decision is judicially reviewable by suit in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. United States, </em>169 F.3d 1196, 1197 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Wydra v. Law Enforcement Assistance Admin., </em>722 F.2d 834, 837 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>see also Yanco v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1356 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">B. The underlying facts are set out in detail in the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 opinion. <em>See Demutiis v. United States, </em>48 Fed. Cl. 81 (2000). Only a brief recitation follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Police Officer Nicholas R. Demutiis (\u201cDemutiis\u201d), off duty and out of uniform, was driving to work in his personal vehicle on January 24, 1994, around eleven p.m. A few blocks from the precinct house, he entered an intersection on a green light and was struck by a vehicle entering the intersection against a red light. That vehicle was being pursued by police officers from Demutiis\u2019 precinct in police vehicles, and, according to civilian eyewitnesses, was traveling about seventy to ninety miles an hour with its lights off in the darkness when it collided with Demutiis\u2019 car. Demutiis was killed as a result of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The report of the New York City Police Department (\u201cPolice Department\u201d) on the incident, which was used to determine eligibility for worker\u2019s compensation and accidental death benefits, stated that Demutiis entered the intersection in \u201can apparent attempt to assist the On-Duty officers in apprehending the suspect vehicle,\u201d and thus that his death was \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d <em>Demutiis, </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 84. The Bureau, however, preliminarily denied benefits under the Act, based on its finding that Demutiis was most likely unaware of the chase, and probably had not been attempting to assist the other officers. <em>Id. </em>It ruled that Demutiis\u2019 death was not in the line of duty, and thus did not qualify for benefits under the Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Demutiis\u2019 wife and son, the appellees here, administratively appealed the preliminary determination. After an evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer concluded that the evidence did not show that Demutiis had entered the intersection in an attempt to aid the other officers, and thus that his death was not \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. After the Director of the Bureau upheld that ruling the appellees filed the present suit in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking benefits under the Act. They contended that \u201cDemutiis was assisting his fellow officers by obstructing the path of the fleeing vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the Bureau\u2019s decision was \u201cin some respects, contrary to law, and, in others, not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. It reversed that decision and remanded for the Bureau to conduct \u201cfurther proceedings leading to a redetermi-nation of plaintiffs\u2019 eligibility for compensation under the [Benefits Act] and its implementing regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">The government\u2019s appeal challenges only three of the court\u2019s rulings: (1) the hearing officer did not comply with the requirement in the Bureau\u2019s regulation that the hearing be conducted \u201cin such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant\u201d because he did not discharge his \u201cactive and affirmative responsibility to develop the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93. (2) The hearing officer failed to give adequate weight, as required by the Bureau\u2019s regulations, to the Police Department\u2019s determination that Demutiis\u2019 death occurred in the fine of duty. (3) \u201c[I]n several other instances\u201d the hearing officer improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>\u201cfailed to attach any weight to the fact findings of the city officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The court also made two additional rulings, which the government does not challenge: (1) The Bureau misinterpreted and misapplied its regulation requiring it to resolve \u201cany reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death or permanent and total disability in favor of payment of the death or disability benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88. (2) Various findings of the Bureau were not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 95-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">There is a preliminary jurisdictional question: whether the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision, which remanded the case to the Bureau for redetermination of Demutiis\u2019 eligibility for benefit payments, is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d over which we have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). Generally, remand orders are not final and hence are not appealable. <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed.Cir.1986) (noting that \u201can order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final\u201d); <em>see also Caesar v.West, </em>195 F.3d 1373,1374 (Fed.Cir.1999). A remand order is appealable, however, \u201cwhen a court determines that an agency\u2019s statutory or regulatory interpretation is unreasonable or contrary to law, and remands the matter to the agency to implement the court\u2019s alternative interpretation.\u201d <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. United States, </em>226 F.3d 1349, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2000) (citing <em>Travelstead v. Derwinski, </em>978 F.2d 1244, 1248-49 (Fed.Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">That is precisely the basis on which the Court of Federal Claims remanded to the Bureau in this case. The court concluded that the Bureau had misinterpreted its regulations, and remanded for \u201credetermi-nation of plaintiffs eligibility for compensation under the [Benefits Act] and its implementing regulations, consistent .with this opinion,\u201d <em>Demutiis, </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 99, i.e., for the Bureau to reapply the Act and the regulations as the court had interpreted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">In many, perhaps most, cases in which such remand orders have been held final, the result of a successful appeal is a reversal of the remand. Here, however, even if we were to accept all of the government\u2019s contentions, the remand order would still stand \u2014 although the scope of the remand would be narrower. This is because the government\u2019s appeal has not challenged some of the grounds on which the Court of Federal Claims based the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">This result, however, does not render the remand order non-final and non-ap-pealable. The government\u2019s failure to challenge the other portions of the remand order does not change the nature of the portions the government does challenge, and those portions themselves make the order final and appealable. If the Bureau were to reconsider the case under the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 interpretation of the regulations, its decision on remand might not be reviewable. The government then would have the unfavorable precedent of the Court of Federal Claims in this case without opportunity to challenge it on appeal. <em>See Dambach v. Gober, </em>223 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201cBecause this interpretation will alter the evidentiary burdens ... in the remand proceedings and the remand may make unreviewable [certain determinations], there is jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">Section 32.24(c) of the Bureau\u2019s regulations states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-14\">In conducting the hearing, the hearing officer shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>or by Chapter 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 <em>et seq.), </em>but must conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For this purpose, the hearing officer shall receive such relevant evidence as may be introduced by the claimant and shall, in addition, receive such other evidence as the hearing officer may determine to be necessary or useful in evaluating the claim. Evidence may be presented orally or in the form of written statements and exhibits. The hearing shall be recorded, and the original of the complete transcript shall be made a part of the claims record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24(c) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">The Court of Federal Claims interpreted this provision as imposing on the hearing officer an \u201cactive and affirmative responsibility to develop the record.\u201d It then cited several instances in which the hearing officer failed to \u201cmeet this important responsibility.\u201d <em>Demutiis, </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 93. Among these were the fact that the hearing officer \u201cmade no attempt to obtain live testimony from these [civilian] witnesses to explain what they actually saw, so as to ensure that their statements truly were different from those of the officers, ... [or] to obtain the written reports that the officers had earlier filed to see whether they corroborated the testimony,\u201d and that he \u201cmade no attempt to conduct a site visit to determine what Officer Demutiis might actually have seen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. The court stated in addition that the hearing officer \u201cmay not weigh gaps in the record against a claimant without first making reasonable attempts to obtain available evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">We disagree with the Court of Federal Claims that this regulation requires the hearing officer affirmatively to develop the record. The subject matter of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24 is the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cconducting [of] the hearing.\u201d It begins by stating that \u201c[i]n conducting the hearing,\u201d the hearing officer is not bound by rules of evidence or formal procedural rules, but \u201cmust conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24(c) (2001). It then states that \u201c[f]or this purpose, the hearing officer shall receive such relevant evidence as may be introduced by the claimant and shall, in addition, receive such other evidence as the hearing officer may determine to be necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">The requirement that the hearing officer \u201cmust conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant\u201d relates to how the hearing is to be conducted, not to what additional functions the hearing officer must perform before deciding the case. The \u201cconduct\u201d of the hearing involves such questions as what evidence may be introduced, the order of proof, the scope of cross-examination, etc. The regulation directs the hearing officer to receive evidence introduced by the claimant and evidence offered by others that the hearing officer determines is \u201cnecessary or useful in evaluating the claim.\u201d It appears to contemplate a broad standard of relevancy, and also presumably permits the hearing officer to obtain and receive evidence that he deems \u201cnecessary or useful,\u201d even though none of the parties offers it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Although the hearing officer has discretion to seek additional evidence, the regulatory requirement that he \u201cconduct the hearing in such a manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant\u201d cannot properly be read as imposing the additional affirmative obligation of obtaining further evidence to fill gaps in the claimant\u2019s case. The role of the hearing officer ordinarily is to conduct a hearing, not to investigate and develop a case. Neither the Benefits Act nor the regulations indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>that the hearing officer under that Act is to perform anything other than his traditional role or to have the additional responsibility the Court of Federal Claims imposed upon him. If the presiding official is to be required affirmatively to assist the claimant in developing his case, far more explicit language would be required to impose that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">An example of such explicit language is found in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5, discussed below. After stating that the Bureau \u201cwill give substantial weight to the evidence and findings of fact presented by State, local, and Federal administrative agencies,\u201d it provides: \u201cThe Bureau will request additional assistance or conduct its own investigation when it believes that the existing evidence does not provide the Bureau with a rational basis for a decision on a material element of eligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 32.5. Another example from a different statute is 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A, which provides that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \u201cshall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant\u2019s claim for a benefit under a law administered by the Secretary.\u201d 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5103A (West Supp.2001). Nothing in \u00a7 38.24(c) is comparable to those requirements imposing specific obligations to develop the evidence or assist the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Another Bureau regulation confirms that the hearing officer is not required to obtain additional evidence. Section 32.21 states that \u201c[w]henever a claimant ... has submitted no evidence or insufficient evidence of any material issue or fact,\u201d the Bureau shall so inform the claimant and request him to submit such evidence. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.21(b) (2001). It then states that a claimant\u2019s failure to submit such evidence \u201cshall be a basis for determining that the claimant fails to satisfy the conditions required to award a benefit or fee or any part thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provision is inconsistent with the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 view that under the regulations the Bureau \u201cmay not weigh gaps in the record against a claimant without first making reasonable attempts to obtain available evidence.\u201d <em>Demwtiis, </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Section 32.5 of the regulations states: The Bureau will give substantial weight to the evidence and findings of fact presented by State, local, and Federal administrative and investigative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"AsNZ\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The Court of Federal Claims held that the Bureau violated this provision in two respects: (A) it failed to give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d \u2014 indeed, any weight \u2014 to the Police Department\u2019s determination that De-mutiis\u2019 death occurred in the line of duty and (B) failed to give any weight to the factual findings of the Police Department. <em>Demwtiis, </em>48 Fed. Cl. at 91-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">A. The Police Department\u2019s \u201cfine of duty\u201d determination involved the same ultimate question as that under the Benefits Act \u2014 did Demutiis\u2019 death occur in the fine of duty? That is a legal determination. <em>Cf. Davis v. United States, </em>50 Fed. Cl. 192, 206, 208 (Fed.Cl.2001); <em>Chacon v. United States, </em>32 Fed. Cl. 684 (1995), <em>aff'd, </em>48 F.3d 508 (Fed.Cir.1995). The regulation, however, requires the Bureau to give substantial weight only to \u201cthe evidence and findings of fact presented by ... administrative and investigative agencies,\u201d not to their legal conclusions. Although the Bureau could give the Police Department\u2019s legal conclusion whatever weight, if any, it deemed appropriate, it was not required to give it any weight. Of course, the Police Department\u2019s legal line of duty determination rested on subsidiary factual determinations to which, as we discuss be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>low, the Bureau was required to give substantial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">The Court of Federal Claims relied heavily on <em>Harold v. United States, </em>225 Ct.Cl. 168, 634 F.2d 547 (1980), in ruling that the Bureau erred in failing to give substantial weight to the Police Department\u2019s line of duty determination. <em>Harold </em>involved a police officer who was killed when his loaded police revolver was discharged while he was cleaning it. The question was whether the officer\u2019s gross negligence precluded a determination that his death occurred in the line of duty. Our predecessor court ruled that it did not. The court\u2019s precise ruling was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArB\">In sum, we conclude that the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress did not intend that the term \u201cline of duty\u201d should exclude instances in which the death of a safety officer is caused by his gross negligence in the performance of his duties. To the contrary, we think Congress recognized the distinction between the nature of the acts being performed at the time of an officer\u2019s death and the manner in which they were being performed, and that except for deaths due to intentional misconduct and intoxication, Congress intended only the nature of the acts to be relevant to a determination of whether the death occurred in the line of duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A23\"><em>Id. </em>at 552 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\"><em>Harold </em>thus involved the substantive question whether grossly negligent conduct could be in the line of duty. The Court of Claims answered that question affirmatively. The present case, however, does not involve any question about the substantive content of the \u201cline of duty\u201d concept. Instead, it involves the quite different question of what weight the Bureau was required to give to the Police Department\u2019s fine of duty ruling. <em>Harold </em>does not answer that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">B. We agree with the Court of Federal Claims, however, that the Bureau improperly ignored the Police Department\u2019s factual determinations and the evidence upon which they rested. This included the testimony of the two officers in the pursuing vehicle that they saw Demutiis\u2019 vehicle come to a stop in the intersection before it was hit, the statements in the police reports that civilians at the scene stated that immediately before the collision Demutiis\u2019 vehicle was going \u201cslow\u201d or \u201cnot very fast,\u201d and photographs of the scene of the accident that allegedly indicated whether Demutiis could or could not have seen the approaching fleeing vehicle before his car entered the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The government contends that the factual findings in the police reports are highly speculative because they are inconsistent with the statements made by the civilian eyewitnesses, and that the Bureau therefore properly ignored them. That contention, however, goes to the weight the Bureau could give those findings, not to whether it could ignore them. The regulation states that the Bureau will give not just weight, but \u201csubstantial\u201d weight, to such findings. Although the Bureau may have some discretion to determine the weight to be accorded those findings and evidence, it must accord, them at least \u201csubstantial\u201d weight and cannot ignore them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">The remand order of the Court of Federal Claims is modified as set forth in this opinion to eliminate the requirements (1) that the hearing officer develop the record in support of the claimant and (2) that the Bureau give substantial weight to the Police Department\u2019s determination that De-mutiis\u2019 death occurred in the line of duty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>With these modifications, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
