The Court of Federal Claims summary judgment decision denied NDC\u2019s tax refund claim. <em>Nat\u2019l Data Corp. &amp; Subsidiaries v. United States, </em>50 Fed. Cl. 24, 25 (2001). NDC argued that certain amounts it expended for leasehold improvements qualified for the \u201cworld headquarters exception\u201d to the repeal of the investment tax credit. The exception is codified in \u00a7 204(a)(7) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Court of Federal Claims holding depends predominantly on its interpretation of the phrase \u201cagreement to lease\u201d in sub-paragraph (B) of \u00a7 204(a)(7). This court finds the Court of Federal Claims interpretation of such phrase to be correct. Therefore, we adopt as this court\u2019s opinion the Court of Federal Claims interpretation of this particular phrase and similarly adopt the Court of Federal Claims application of such interpretation to the facts of this case. As a result, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
