Jacobs\u2019 appeal as untimely. Jacobs opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">The certified list reflects that judgment was entered by the Court of Federal Claims on March 20, 2001. On May 25, 2001, the trial court denied \u201cPlaintiff Jacobs Appeal,\u201d received on May 21, 2001, which the trial court treated as a request for relief from judgment under CFCR 60(b). On August 6, 2001, Jacobs filed a notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s order relating to \u201cthe issue of Jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">In response to the court\u2019s August 24, 2001 order and the United States subsequent motion to dismiss, Jacobs stated that the document received by the Court of Federal Claims on May 21, 2001, \u201cPlaintiff Jacobs Appeal,\u201d constituted his notice of appeal. On October 12, 2001, this court advised the parties that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 file does not contain this document, and directed the parties to provide a copy. The United States responds that it has \u201cnever received or seen a copy of \u2018Plaintiff Jacobs Appeal.\u2019 \u201d Jacobs has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">An appeal to this court from the Court of Federal Claims must be filed within 60 days of the entry of final judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2107(b), 2522. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Jacobs\u2019 appeal on March 20, 2001. Jacobs\u2019 notice of appeal was due by May 21, 2001. In light of Jacobs\u2019 failure to produce the document he claims constituted his notice of appeal and because the Court of Federal Claims treated the document as a Rule 60(b) motion, Jacobs\u2019 appeal of the March 20, 2001 judgment is dismissed as untimely. Jacobs\u2019 appeal of the May 25, 2001 denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Rule 60(b) motion is also dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
