West Virginia Department of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), to the fee-shifting provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The United States Court of Federal Claims, in a decision dated June 29, 2001, held that Brickwood Contractors Inc.\u2019s (\u201cBrickwood\u201d) recovery of attorney fees under the EAJA is not barred by <em>Buckhannon. </em>Because we disagree with the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 conclusion that <em>Buckhannon </em>does not apply to the EAJA and its alternative theories that attorney fees in this case are permissible under <em>Buckhannon, </em>we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">On February 9, 1999, the Department of the Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d) issued an Invitation for Bids (\u201cIFB\u201d) to repair elevated water storage tanks at the Naval Air Station, Patux-ant River, Maryland. Thereafter, the Navy issued amendments to the solicitation adding Polychlorinated Biphenyl (\u201cPCB\u201d) contamination testing to the base requirements and adding three options related to removing PCB contamination from the water storage tanks. Five bids (base bid plus options) were received and publicly opened on April 6,1999, with Brickwood identified as the apparent lowest bidder. As a result of further testing, however, the Navy determined there was no evidence of PCB contamination and on May 5, 1999, announced that the bids on the options were no longer needed and would therefore be excluded from the final price evaluation. Because of this change, Brickwood no longer had the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">On June 15, 1999, the Navy further amended the solicitation, converting it from an IFB, or a solicitation of bids, to a Request for Proposals (\u201cRFP\u201d), or a negotiated procurement, deleting the Evaluation of Options and eliminating the requirements regarding PCBs. The Navy intended to negotiate with the bidders whose bids did not include the now determined unnecessary PCB testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">On June 18, 1999, Brickwood filed a bid protest in the Court of Federal Claims seeking to enjoin the Navy from converting the IFB to an RFP and to direct the Navy to award the contract to Brickwood. A hearing was held on Brickwood\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) on June 21, 1999. On July 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>1999, prior to any court decision on that TRO request, the Navy filed a Motion to Dismiss informing the court that \u201c[a]fter further consideration of both the circumstances surrounding the solicitation and the governing FAR provisions, and in light of the Court\u2019s comments at the TRO hearing, the Navy has cancelled the solicitation and plans to re-solicit using a new IFB.\u201d The court dismissed Brickwood\u2019s protest on July 22, 1999, \u201cwithout reaching the merits of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Thereafter, on August 23, 1999, Brick-wood filed an EAJA application seeking attorney fees and expenses for work performed on the lawsuit protesting the Navy\u2019s attempted conversion to an RFP and on the EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In its opinion dated April 9, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims found that Brick-wood satisfied the requirements necessary for entitlement to attorney fees and expenses under the EAJA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. United States, </em>49 Fed.Cl. 148, 150 (2001) <em>(\u201cBrickwood I </em>\u201d). Applying the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d of \u201cprevailing party\u201d status pursuant to the EAJA, the court found that Brickwood was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d because it had succeeded on a significant issue in the litigation that resulted in a benefit to the plaintiff. In so doing, the court relied on what it termed the \u201cadvice\u201d offered by the Supreme Court in <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987), a case interpreting the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement with respect to attorney fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. That \u201cadvice\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">A lawsuit sometimes produces voluntary action by the defendant that affords the plaintiff all or some of the relief he sought through a judgment \u2014 e.g., a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiffs grievances. When that occurs, the' plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence of a formal judgment in his favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-9\"><em>Id, </em>at 760-61, 107 S.Ct. 2672.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Notably, in applying <em>Hewitt\u2019s </em>interpretation of the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 to the same term in the EAJA, the court observed that \u201cthis construction of prevailing party is consistent with the policy behind EAJA, to compensate parties who cause the government to conform to the law.\u201d <em>Brickwood I, </em>49 Fed. Cl. at 154-55. The court further found that the government\u2019s position in litigation (and its underlying conduct regarding the procurement) was not substantially justified, and that there were no special circumstances that would make the award of fees unjust. <em>Id. </em>at 163. Final judgment was issued on May 1, 2001, awarding plaintiff $10,939.00 in attorney fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">On May 29, 2001, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Buckhannon </em>denying the plaintiffs fee claim under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c)(2) (\u201cFHAA\u201d) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (\u201cADA\u201d). In so doing, the Court rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d as a basis for attorney fee awards under fee shifting statutes because it allows a fee award \u201cwhere there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">On June 8, 2001, the government filed a motion for relief from the court\u2019s prior judgment awarding attorney fees to Brick-wood pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>of the United States Court of Federal Claims, arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision invalidated the basis of that judgment. The court concluded, however, that <em>Buckhannon </em>did not bar recovery by Brickwood and thus denied the government\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the court held that <em>Buckhannon </em>does not apply to the determination of \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA, stating broadly that \u201c[t]he standards for meeting the \u2018prevailing party requirement recently set forth in <em>Buckhannon </em>conflict with the plain language and the legislative history of the EAJA.\u201d <em>Brickwood II, </em>49 Fed.Cl. at 745 n. 5. The court based its conclusion on the fact that while <em>Buckhannon </em>applied to two specific statutes (the FHAA and the ADA) and referenced three others, the EAJA was not mentioned. Further, the court contrasted the EAJA and the five cited fee-shifting statutes, noting that the former stated that an award <em>\u201cshall </em>be made unless the court finds that the position of the United States was <em>substantially justified,\u201d </em>whereas the latter allowed broad discretion to trial courts by use of the term \u201cmay\u201d without any further \u201csubstantial justification\u201d requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 746-47 (emphases added). The court concluded that these distinctions were significant in the context of construing the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d: \u201cBecause the \u2018substantially justified\u2019 analysis directs the court to consider the merits of the case underlying the EAJA application, a plaintiff cannot prove the legal merits of the case solely through the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747. Thus, based on this analysis, the court concluded that the term \u201cprevailing party,\u201d as it appears in the EAJA, means something different from that same term in other fee-shifting statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Second, the court concluded that the facts in <em>Brickwood II </em>were materially distinguishable from those in <em>Buckhannon </em>since the latter involved a change by the legislature in eliminating the requirements at issue in the litigation. Thus, in <em>Buck-hannon </em>neither the Court nor the plaintiffs had a direct role in the action that engendered resolution of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Finally, the court held, in the alternative, that Brickwood is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d even if <em>Buckhannon </em>applies by virtue of the comments made by the court at the June 21, 1999, TRO hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 747-49. According to the court, although it did not issue a written opinion, at the TRO hearing it \u201cannounced its acknowledgement of the merits of plaintiffs claims, the rectitude of plaintiffs position, and the error of defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748. Those remarks, the court concluded, \u201camounted to a finding that the Navy had acted unlawfully ...\u201d and \u201crepresent the necessary \u2018judicial imprimatur\u2019 that caused the change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749. In this regard, the court also expressed its \u201cstrong\u201d opinion that \u201cto interpret <em>Buckhannon </em>as requiring formal written judgments on the merits or formal findings of unlawful conduct will inhibit settlements and discourage parties from taking self-corrective action such as that taken by defendant in <em>Brickwood.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">The United States filed a timely notice of appeal on July 2, 2001, from both the May 1, 2001, judgment and the June 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>2001, order denying the Rule 60(b) motion. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">This court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision to award fees and expenses under the EAJA for an abuse of discretion. <em>Giesler v. United States, </em>232 F.3d 864, 869 (Fed.Cir.2000). This court also reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Info. Sys. &amp; Networks Corp. v. United States, </em>994 F.2d 792, 794 (Fed.Cir.1993). We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 legal interpretation of the EAJA <em>de novo. Levernier Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>947 F.2d 497, 499 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">In <em>Buckhannon, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the use of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d in construing whether one is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under federal fee-shifting statutes such as the FHAA and the ADA. The \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d grants prevailing party status to a plaintiff \u201cif it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d 532 U.S. at 601,121 S.Ct. 1835. The Court held that \u201cenforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the \u2018material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u2019 necessary to permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (citing <em>Tex. State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dish, </em>489 U.S. 782, 792, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866, (1989)). Both the majority and dissent in <em>Buckhannon </em>acknowledged that the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d had previously been recognized by the majority of Federal Courts of Appeals. <em>See id. </em>at 602, 121 S.Ct. 1835; <em>see also id. </em>at 625-26, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In <em>Buckhannon, </em>the named plaintiff, an operator of assisted living homes, failed a state fire marshal\u2019s inspection because some of its residents were incapable of \u201cself-preservation,\u201d i.e., removing themselves in such dangerous situations as fires. <em>Id. </em>at 600,121 S.Ct. 1835. Plaintiffs sued the state seeking declaratory and in-junctive relief and alleging that this self-preservation requirement violated the FHAA and the ADA. While the case was pending in District Court in West Virginia, that State\u2019s legislature enacted two bills that eliminated the \u201cself-preservation requirement.\u201d The State\u2019s motion to dismiss the case as moot was granted by the District Court and the plaintiff then sought attorney fees as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d pursuant to the FHAA and the ADA, basing its entitlement on the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The Court in <em>Buckhannon </em>affirmed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision that the \u201ccatalyst theory,\u201d which allows a fee award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties\u2019 legal relationship, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change to establish \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. Thus, the Court concluded it is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney fees under the FHAA and the ADA. According to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-10\">Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d The question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s conduct. We hold it does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 600, 121 S.Ct. 1835. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon, </em>the Court of Federal Claims rejected the government\u2019s argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Buckhannon </em>compels a rejection of the award of attorney fees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number><em>Brickwood II </em>on three alternative grounds: (1) <em>Buckhannon </em>does not apply to attorney fees under the EAJA; (2) even assuming <em>Buckhannon </em>applies to the EAJA, its holding is limited to its facts \u2014 a purely voluntary change by the legislature not prompted by a lawsuit \u2014 and those facts are distinguishable from the facts in <em>Brick-wood II; </em>and (3) even if <em>Buckhannon </em>applies to the EAJA and to the facts of this case, the court\u2019s statements at a prior TRO hearing met the requirements of <em>Buckhannon. </em>We reject all of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 alternative theories and discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The Court of Federal Claims concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon </em>rejecting the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement does not apply to the EAJA notwithstanding that the term \u201cprevailing party,\u201d as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Buck-hannon, </em>appears in virtually all fee-shifting statutes including the EAJA. Instead, examining the text of the EAJA and its legislative history, the court concluded that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d has a different meaning when used in the EAJA than when used in other fee-shifting statutes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Buckhannon, </em>under the \u201cAmerican Rule, we follow \u2018a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 602, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (citing <em>Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 809, 819, 114 S.Ct. 1960, 128 L.Ed.2d 797 (1994)). In the numerous statutes in which Congress has provided for an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d by permitting certain designated parties an award of their litigation costs, Congress has used the term \u201cprevailing party,\u201d a legal term of art. <em>Id. </em>at 603, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Although two particular fee-shifting statutes, the FHAA and the ADA, were at issue in <em>Buckhannon, </em>the Court made it clear that its analysis applied to \u201cthe award of attorney\u2019s fees to the \u2018prevailing party\u2019 in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here.\u201d 532 U.S. at 602, 121 S.Ct. 1835. Indeed, while <em>Buckhannon </em>specifically listed three fee-shifting statutes in addition to the FHAA and the ADA, the Court also expressly cited to the Appendix to Justice Brennan\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Marek v. Chesny, </em>473 U.S. 1, 43-51, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), which lists over 100 federal fee-shifting statutes. In a footnote immediately following the reference to the <em>Marek </em>Appendix, the Court stated: \u2018We have interpreted these fee shifting provisions consistently ... and so approach the nearly identical provisions at issue here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603 n. 4, 105 S.Ct. 3012 (citing <em>Hensley v. Ecker-hart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). <em>Hensley, </em>which considered fees under the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, held that the standards used to interpret the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d under any given fee-shifting statute \u201care generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <em>see also Schultz v. United States, </em>918 F.2d 164, 166 n. 2 (Fed.Cir.1990), 500 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 1686, 114 L.Ed.2d 80 (1991) (\u201cIndeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that the definition of \u2018prevailing party\u2019 does not differ from rule-to-rule or statute-to-statute.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The Court of Federal Claims, however, differentiated between \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA and that same legal term of art found in numerous other fee-shifting statutes because the EAJA differs from other fee-shifting statutes in two other respects: (1) the EAJA mandates the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>of fees if specified conditions are met by-use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d whereas such awards in other statutes are left to the court\u2019s discretion; and (2) in contrast to other statutes, the EAJA includes an additional hurdle for an award of attorney fees by only permitting an award if the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded that this substantial justification hurdle alleviates the concerns of the Supreme Court that motivated its elimination of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d since it requires the court to review the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The Appellant responds that the inclusion of the additional \u201csubstantial justification\u201d requirement in the EAJA does not warrant an alternative interpretation of \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA. First, the Appellant points out that if an application for fees under the EAJA fails because the litigant is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d, the court never reaches the merits of the government\u2019s position in litigation. Also, the Appellant points out that the inclusion of the additional hurdle of \u201csubstantial justification\u201d represents the fact that the bar under the EAJA awards was intended to be higher than other fee shifting statutes, whereas the application of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d to only the EAJA would have the opposite result. These are simply two separate and distinct hurdles one seeking such fees from the government must overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">We agree with the Appellant\u2019s construction of the statutory language. The Court of Federal Claims is obviously correct that there are certain differences between the EAJA and other fee-shifting statutes. The question, however, is not simply whether there are certain differences, but whether these differences would reasonably lead one to conclude that the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement in the EAJA should therefore be construed differently than in other statutes. Our examination of the text and the legislative history of the EAJA leads us to conclude that there is no basis for distinguishing the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the EAJA from other fee-shifting statutes. <em>See Perez-Arellano v. Smith, </em>279 F.3d 791, 794 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cwe discern no reason to interpret the EAJA inconsistently with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u2018prevailing party in the FHAA and the ADA as explained in <em>Buckhannon.\u201d) </em>The unique aspects of the EAJA demonstrate that when Congress wanted the EAJA to operate in a certain way, it did so explicitly by adding certain criteria. In contrast, it chose to use the same term \u2014 \u201cprevailing party\u201d \u2014 in the EAJA as it appears in other fee-shifting statutes. As the Ninth Circuit has observed, explicitly disagreeing with the Court of Federal Claims decision in <em>Brick-wood II,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-10\">[a]ll three statutes [the FHAA, the ADA, and the EAJA] use the identical term, \u201cprevailing party.\u201d There is no reason to assume this term has a different meaning simply because under the EAJA a \u201cprevailing party\u201d \u201cshall\u201d be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees absent substantial justification for the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>ernment\u2019s position, whereas under the FHAA and ADA the court \u201cmay\u201d award fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\"><em>Perez-Arellano, </em>279 F.3d at 794 n. 20; <em>see also Thayer v. Principi </em>15 Vet.App. 204, 211 (2001) (\u201cthe language of all of [the EAJA] as compared to the FHAA and ADA, coupled with the structure and content of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Buckhannon, demonstrates that the definition of \u2018prevailing party\u2019 set forth by the Supreme Court in Buckhannon applies to the appellant\u2019s EAJA application in this case.\u201d) As the Appellant also points out, the fact that the EAJA is mandatory and other fee shifting statutes are discretionary by no means warrants a different interpretation of the term \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In fact, under certain statutes the term \u201cmay\u201d has been construed in such a way that the scope of discretion is narrow. <em>See Chicano Police Officer\u2019s Ass\u2019n v.

Boorstin, </em>561 F.2d 340 (D.C.Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">With respect to the legislative history, we note first the doubt expressed in <em>Buck-hannon </em>regarding whether legislative history can overcome the rather clear meaning of \u201cprevailing party,\u201d the term actually used in statute. <em>See Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 608, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (\u201cParticularly in view of the \u2018American Rule\u2019 that attorneys fees will not be awarded absent \u2018explicit statutory authority,\u2019 such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term.\u201d). In any event, we disagree with Brickwood as to the import of the legislative history it cites. Indeed, to the extent it is arguably relevant to congressional intent regarding the construction of the term \u201cprevailing party,\u201d it confirms our view that the term was intended to have the same meaning and interpretation in the EAJA as in other fee-shifting statutes. In fact, the statement relied on by Brickwood and cited above is preceded by the statement: \u201cIt is the committee\u2019s intention that the interpretation of the term [\u2018prevailing party\u2019] be consistent with the law that has developed under existing statutes.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, at 11 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4984, 4990. Thus, what is probative about the comments found in the legislative history is not that Congress wished to apply the holding of one particular case dealing with another statute, but that it intended, overall, that the meaning and interpretation of \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the EAJA match and be consistent with its construction and interpretation in other federal fee-shifting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">In sum, we reject the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 analysis that the text or the legislative history of the EAJA compels a reading or construction of the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d different from other federal fee-shifting statutes and thus conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of that term as not allowing for the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d applies with equal force and effect to the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">As previously noted, <em>Buckhannon </em>involved a suit against the state of West Virginia alleging that its effort to close assisted living residences pursuant to a \u201cself preservation\u201d requirement violated the FHAA and the ADA. After the state legislature acted to eliminate this statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>requirement and the case was dismissed as moot, Buckhannon moved for an award of attorney fees under the \u201ccatalyst theory.\u201d In part, the Court of- Federal Claims reached its conclusion in <em>Brickwood II </em>by distinguishing its facts from those in <em>Buck-hannon. </em>In this regard the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2FL\">[I]t appears from the facts articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Buckhannon </em>that neither the court nor the plaintiffs had a role in bringing about the resolution of the case.... Although according to the dissent in <em>Buckhannon, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that their lawsuit caused the statutory change, a direct causation is unlikely given the independence normally exercised by legislatures when enacting laws. Moreover, the lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs did not cause a change in the defendant\u2019s behavior.... Under these circumstances, a plaintiff should not be entitled to claim and receive attorney\u2019s fees under <em>any </em>fee-shifting provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">49 Fed.Cl. at 744 (emphasis added). This statement by the court, read broadly, suggests a view that the plaintiff in <em>Buckhannon </em>might not even qualify as a prevailing party under the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d and thus the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d might be alive and well \u2014 even under FHAA and the ADA \u2014 if litigation rather than legislative action is found to cause a change. We reject such an analysis. In our view, the Supreme Court in <em>Buckhannon </em>unambiguously rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d except in instances where there is an enforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, both of which create a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Buckhannon </em>leaves no room for a distinction to be drawn between whether a change is brought about by the legislature, as in <em>Buckhannon, </em>or by the government\u2019s cancellation of the solicitation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Finally, the Court of Federal Claims held that \u201ceven if the <em>Buckhannon </em>standards were to be applied to recovery under the EAJA, the court\u2019s May 1, 2001 judgment need not be altered because the plaintiff Brickwood factually establishes itself as the \u2018prevailing party1 by meeting the concerns described in <em>Buckhannon.\u201d Brickwood II, </em>49 Fed.Cl. at 747. Specifically, the court referenced remarks it made at the TRO hearing at some length and concluded that \u201c[i]n this exchange, the court, although it did not issue a written opinion, announced its acknowledgment of the merits of plaintiffs claim, the rectitude of plaintiffs position, and the error of defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">We disagree. As a preliminary matter, we note that the excerpt from the TRO hearing cited by the court is preceded by the following comment: \u201cSo, obviously, this is a bare-bones record and those are very conclusory and very preliminary thoughts, but it should be enough for you to work from, from this point forward.\u201d The court proceeded to set a schedule for further proceedings in this case. In any event, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 conclusions regarding remarks at a TRO hearing miss the mark. In our view, the cited comments are clearly not sufficient to establish a judicial imprimatur and they do not constitute a \u201ccourt-ordered change in the legal relationship\u201d of the parties as <em>Buckhannon </em>requires. All we have in this case are simply \u201cvery preliminary\u201d remarks at a TRO hearing and no TRO ever issued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>The Court of Federal Claims concluded its analysis in this regard by observing that \u201c[a]s a trial court, this court is of the strong opinion that to interpret <em>Buckhan-non </em>as requiring formal written judgments on the merits or formal findings of unlawful conduct will inhibit settlements and discourage parties from taking self-eorrec-tive action such as that taken by the defendant in Brickwood.\u201d <em>Brickwood II, </em>49 Fed. Cl. at 749. It is, of course, by no means clear why one would assume that the Navy in this case would be more likely to rescind its solicitation if it had to pay attorney fees than if it did not. What is clear is that there was neither a written nor an oral judgment in this case. More importantly, however, the Supreme Court in <em>Buckhannon </em>considered and rejected various policy arguments in favor of the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d and it is certainly not this court\u2019s role to insert our own policy views to reach a different result. As the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-5\">Given the clear meaning of \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the fee-shifting statutes, we need not determine which way [the] various policy arguments cut. In <em>[Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 260, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) ], we said that Congress had not \u201cextended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted.\u201d To disregard the clear legislative language and the holdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a \u201croving authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-8\"><em>Buckhannon, </em>532 U.S. at 610, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">.
