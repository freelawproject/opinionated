Along with Conti Corporation, he filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking compensation under the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment. In his complaint, Mr. Conti alleged that the government\u2019s 1999 prohibition on drift gillnet swordfishing in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery had deprived him of all economic value in his swordfishing permit, his vessel, the <em>F/V Providenza </em>(owned by Conti Corporation), and his swordfishing gear. The Court of Federal Claims granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint under its Rule 12(b)(4) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Conti v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Cl. 532 (2001). The court held that the swordfishing ban did not deprive Mr. Con-ti of the possession of his vessel and swordfishing gear and thus did not constitute a compensable taking of that property. <em>Id. </em>at 537. The court also held that Mr. Conti\u2019s swordfishing permit did not give rise to a property interest cognizable under the Fifth Amendment and that it therefore could not be the subject of a taking. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38. Mr. Conti now appeals the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>conclude that the swordfishing ban did not take any of Mr. Conti\u2019s property, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The following facts either are undisputed or are taken from Mr. Conti\u2019s complaint. Swordfish are caught using drift gillnets, longlines, or handgear. The drift gillnet technique, utilized by Mr. Conti, consists of deploying specially designed nets (pelagic drift gillnets). The nets are attached to a vessel and are deployed to catch swordfish by entangling them.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Mr. Conti began his swordfishing career in the Pacific Ocean in 1979. Complaint of Plaintiffs-Appellants Paul Conti and Conti Corporation (hereinafter \u201cComplaint\u201d) at 113. That year, he acquired and launched the <em>Providenza, </em>which was specifically designed for driftnetting. <em>Id. </em>Six years later, he moved his base of operations from Seattle, Washington, to Gloucester, Massachusetts, and deployed his vessel and gear off the Atlantic Coast. <em>Id. </em>at If 5. Between his arrival in Massachusetts in 1985 and the government\u2019s permanent ban on drift gillnets in 1999, Mr. Conti harvested swordfish in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery using the <em>Providenza. </em>According to Mr. Conti, drift gillnet fishing for swordfish accounted for 100% of his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">During the period that he fished in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, Mr. Conti faced a regulatory regime that increasingly restricted his activities. Pursuant to the 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 (\u201cMSA\u201d) (1994), the Secretary of Commerce possesses the power to regulate fisheries within an Exclusive Economic Zone (\u201cEEZ\u201d) that extends from 3 to 200 miles off the United States coast.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary manages the fisheries by approving Fishery Management Plans, which may \u201cprohibit, limit, condition, or require the use of specified types and quantities of fishing gear, fishing vessels, or equipment,\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(b)(4) (2000), in order to effectuate the MSA\u2019s purpose of preserving the fisheries\u2019 health, stability, and fish stocks. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(a)(1)(A) (2000). Regulations implementing Fishery Management Plans, often promulgated by the National Marine Fisheries Service (\u201cNMFS\u201d), have the force and effect of law. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1854-1855; <em>Alaska Factory Trawler Ass\u2019n v. Baldridge, </em>831 F.2d 1456, 1464 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Despite the government\u2019s broad <em>de jure </em>power to regulate the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery under the MSA, Mr. Conti alleges that he harvested swordfish without <em>de facto </em>regulatory interference until 1986, when NMFS enacted regulations which had the effect of requiring him to apply for a revocable, non-transferable permit. <em>See Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, </em>50 Fed.Reg. 33,952, 33,957 (Aug. 22,1985). Subsequent regulations that were promulgated pursuant to the M.S.A. \u00a7 and other statutes, including the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 971 (1994), the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1994), and the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 (1994), created an increasingly onerous regulatory environment. Many of these regulations were specifically directed to reducing drift gill-net fishing, which had aroused national and international concern on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>that fact that drift gillnets ensnare significant numbers of sea turtles and marine mammals, including whales. <em>See, e.g., Taking of Marine Mammals Incidental to Commercial Fishing Operations; Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan Regulations, </em>62 Fed.Reg. 39,157 (July 22, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In 1989, the United Nations banned the use of drift gillnets in international waters, which led Congress to enact the Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990. G.A. Res. 225, U.N. GAOR, 44th Sess., 85th p\u00eden, mtg., U.N. Doc. A/44/225 (1989); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826 (1994). The amendments provided for implementing the international moratorium on the use of drift gillnets of a certain length beyond the EEZ and for the imposition of sanctions against nations whose vessels or nationals were not in compliance. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826. In 1991, the government began to implement increasingly severe quotas that limited each fisherman\u2019s catch using drift gillnets, <em>see Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, </em>56 Fed.Reg. 65,007 (Dec. 13, 1991), and the NMFS closed the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery entirely from December of 1996 through July of 1998. <em>See Atlantic Swordfish Fishery; Drift Gillnet Emergency Closure, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 64,486 (Dec. 5, 1996); <em>Atlantic Swordfish Fishery; Extension of Drift Gillnet Emergency Closure, </em>62 Fed.Reg. 30,775 (June 5, 1997); <em>North Atlantic Swordfish Fishery; Closure, </em>63 Fed.Reg. 41,205 (Aug. 3, 1998). Finally, in its ongoing effort to reduce bycatch<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and preserve the swordfish stock, the NMFS issued a final regulation in January of 1999, prohibiting the use of drift gillnet gear entirely in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery. <em>Atlantic Swordfish Fishery; Management of Driftnet Gear, </em>64 Fed.Reg. 4055 (Jan. 27, 1999); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 635.71(a)(17), (e)(8) (2000). The object of the ban was to reduce marine mammal and sea turtle .catch while conserving swordfish and other marine resources. <em>See </em>64 Fed.Reg. at 4055. Since the regulation permitted the harvesting of swordfish in the fishery using methods other than drift gillnet fishing, the NMFS sought to mitigate the ban\u2019s economic impact by allowing permit holders, for the first time, to sell permits for use with non-drift gillnet gear. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 635.21(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">In December of 1999, Mr. Conti brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims, alleging that the January 1999 ban on harvesting swordfish using drift gillnets constituted a regulatory taking of his fishing permit, the <em>Providenza, </em>and his gillnet gear without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Complaint at U14. Mr. Conti asserted that the ban had \u201cinversely deprived him of the economically viable use and enjoyment of his property.\u201d Complaint at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">In due course, the government moved under RCFC 12(b)(4) to dismiss Mr. Con-ti\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Addressing the motion, the Court of Federal Claims applied the two-part test for regulatory takings claims that is set forth in <em>M &amp; J Coal Co. v. United States, </em>47 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (Fed.Cir.1995). That test requires a claimant to establish 1) a compensable property interest that 2) the government took through regulation. After considering the several property interests asserted by Mr. Conti, the court concluded that none of them could form the basis for a viable taking claim. <em>Conti </em>48 Fed.Cl. at 536 540. The court first considered Mr. Conti\u2019s fishing vessel and drift gillnet gear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>While the court acknowledged that Mr. Conti\u2019s ownership of the <em>Providenza </em>and its gear \u201chas traditional characteristics of personal property,\u201d the court concluded that the drift gillnetting ban did not take that property. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37. The court reasoned that Mr. Conti\u2019s continuing ability \u201cto sell the vessel and the gear, fish in a different fishery, or put both the nets and the vessel to other uses\u201d precluded a finding that a regulatory taking had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 537. As for Mr. Conti\u2019s efforts to characterize the right to use the permit and his vessel and gear to earn a living as the relevant property interest taken by the regulation, the Court of Federal Claims determined that continued use of Mr. Con-ti\u2019s property for harvesting swordfish with drift gillnets did not constitute a compen-sable property interest. Therefore, the court held, the right could not qualify as an interest that could be the subject of a Fifth Amendment taking claim. Finally, in the setting of the pervasive regulatory environment circumscribing Mr. Conti\u2019s ability to harvest swordfish using drift gill-nets in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, the court viewed the interest conferred by the swordfishing permit as resembling a revocable license instead of a compensable property right. <em>Id. </em>at 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (2000). When reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(4), we \u201cmust accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint and we must indulge all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Sommers Oil Co. v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citations omitted). The question that the court must answer in reviewing a Rule 12(b)(4) dismissal order is whether the trial court was correct in concluding that the facts asserted in the complaint do not entitle the plaintiff to a legal remedy. <em>Id. </em>A trial court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless it is \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Ponder v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 549, 552 (Fed.Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Whether the Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed a complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(4) is a question of law that we review independently and without deference. <em>Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery Cent. Sch. Dist. v. United States, </em>48 F.3d 1166, 1170 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The Fifth Amendment provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V, cl. 4. The language of this clause and the jurisprudence interpreting it evince a policy of prohibiting the \u201cGovernment from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 123, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978) (quoting <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960)). While a taking often occurs as a result of a physical invasion or confiscation, the Supreme Court has long recognized that \u201cif regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922). Real property, <em>see Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992), tangible property, <em>see Andrus v. Allard, </em>444 U.S. 51, 65, 100 S.Ct. 318, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979), and intangible property, <em>see Ruckelshaus v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number><em>Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. 986, 1003-04, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984), all may be the subject of takings claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">As the Court of Federal Claims recognized, this court has developed a two-part test to evaluate claims that a governmental regulation constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation. <em>See M &amp; J Coal, </em>47 F.3d at 1153-54; <em>Karuk Tribe v. Ammon, </em>209 F.3d 1366, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2000). First, a court must evaluate whether the claimant has established a \u201cproperty interest\u201d for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See M &amp; J Coal, </em>47 F.3d at 1154. Second, once a court has determined that a property interest exists, it must determine whether a taking occurred. In that regard, we have stated that \u201cit is often important to determine at the outset whether a particular claimed taking was \u2018categorical\u2019 or not.\u201d <em>Rith Energy, Inc. v. United States, </em>247 F.3d 1355, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2001). A categorical taking has been defined as one in which \u201call economically viable use, i.e., all economic value has been taken by the regulatory imposition.\u201d <em>Palm Beach Isles Assocs. v. United States, </em>231 F.3d 1354, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2000). A categorical taking is distinct from a taking \u201cthat is the consequence of a regulatory imposition that prohibits or restricts only some of the use that would otherwise be available to the property owner but leaves the property owner with substantial economic use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a taking is determined to be non-categorical, the court must embark on a fact-based inquiry in which it applies the standard promulgated by the Supreme Court in <em>Penn Central </em>to evaluate whether the governmental action at issue constituted a cognizable taking of the property interest at issue. <em>Rith Energy, </em>247 F.3d at 1362. The <em>Penn Central </em>analysis involves \u201cseveral factors that have particular significance.\u201d 438 U.S. at 124. Those factors are the character of the governmental action, the economic impact of the action on the claimant, and the extent to which the action has interfered with the claimant\u2019s distinct, investment-backed expectations. <em>Id. </em>However, if a claimant fails to demonstrate that the interest allegedly taken constituted a property interest under the Fifth Amendment, a court need not even consider whether the government regulation was a taking under the analysis set forth in <em>Penn Central. M &amp; J Coal, </em>47 F.3d at 1154; <em>Karuk Tribe, </em>209 F.3d at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">At the outset, it is important to understand the precise nature of the taking claim that Mr. Conti is asserting. In his complaint, Mr. Conti points to three items of property that allegedly have been taken by the ban on drift gillnet swordfishing: (i) his swordfish permit; (ii) his vessel, the <em>Providenza; </em>and (iii) his gillnets and related gear. Mr. Conti acknowledges that these items were not physically taken from him. After the ban on drift gillnets, his permit remained valid for other types of swordfishing, and he maintained possession of the <em>Providenza </em>and his gear. Rather, what Mr. Conti alleges in his complaint is that \u201c[b]oth his property and his business have been taken by government regulation, which has inversely deprived him of the economically viable use and enjoyment of his property.\u201d Complaint at H 12. Mr. Conti states that he has been economically deprived of the use and value of his vessel, nets, gear, and permit and that he has been forced out of the sword-fishing business and left with no alternatives for employment. He explains his predicament in U 7 of his complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-9\">By reason of a combination of unique factors, including but not limited, to Plaintiffs age, his economic limitations, his acquired fishing skills, the relatively small size of the <em>F/V PROVIDENZA, </em>the design of the vessel and its gear, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>mesh size and configuration of Plaintiffs nets, the limited permits issued to him by NMFS, the season and location for the harvesting of swordfish, and the average annual days at sea, or Plaintiffs historical fishing effort, and the moratoriums, closures and limits placed by NMFS on other fisheries, Plaintiff cannot transfer or convert either his personal effort or his vessel and gear to any other fishery, and is therefore dependent for his livelihood on the Atlantic swordfish driftnet fishery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">In short, Mr. Conti contends that, while he still is in possession of his permit, the <em>Providenza, </em>and his gear, there has been taken from him the ability to use those things in a particular way: to fish for swordfish in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery using drift gillnets. According to Mr. Conti, because of his unique circumstances, that is the only livelihood that he is capable of pursuing. It is in that respect that he argues his property has been taken. Armed with this understanding of Mr. Conti\u2019s taking claim, we turn now to the analysis mandated by <em>M &amp; J Coal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Our first task under the <em>M &amp; J Coal </em>analysis is to determine whether Mr. Conti has established a \u201cproperty interest\u201d for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. We begin with the swordfishing permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">A. The Constitution neither creates nor defines the scope of property interests compensable under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Instead, \u201cexisting rules and understandings\u201d and \u201cbackground principles\u201d derived from an independent source, such as state, federal, or common law, define the dimensions of the requisite property rights for purposes of establishing a cognizable taking. <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1030, 112 S.Ct. 2886.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These existing rules often involve and define \u201cthe citizen\u2019s relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of it.\u201d <em>United States v. Gen. Motors, </em>323 U.S. 373, 378, 65 S.Ct. 357, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Applying these principles, courts have held that no property rights are created in permits and licenses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fuller, </em>409 U.S. 488, 493, 93 S.Ct. 801, 35 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973); <em>Alves v. United States, </em>133 F.3d 1454, 1457 (Fed.Cir.1998). In <em>Fuller, </em>the government condemned 920 acres of the respondents\u2019 fee lands. 409 U.S. at 489, 93 S.Ct. 801. The respondents also held grazing permits for certain nearby lands. The permits were issued under the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315. During the condemnation proceeding, the parties disputed whether the \u201cvalue accruing to the fee lands as a result of their actual or potential use in combination with the Taylor Grazing Act \u2018permit\u2019 lands\u201d was compensable. <em>Fuller, </em>409 U.S. at 489, 93 S.Ct. 801. In addressing the question, the Supreme Court focused on the revocability of the grazing permits and the clear congressional expression in 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315b that the issuance of a permit under the Act \u201cshall not create any right, title, interest, or estate in or to the lands.\u201d The Court noted that section 315b makes \u201cclear the congressional intent that no compensable property be created in the permit lands themselves as a result of the permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 93 S.Ct. 801. Under these circumstances, the Court held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment does not require the Government to pay for that element of value based on the use of respondents\u2019 fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>lands in combination with the Government\u2019s permit lands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 93 S.Ct. 801. This was the case even if this \u201celement of value\u201d would warrant a higher selling price for the fee lands on the open market than if the fee lands were offered for sale without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">In <em>Alves, </em>we adjudicated a petitioner\u2019s claim that his grazing preference, which accorded a priority position for procuring a grazing permit under the Taylor Grazing Act, constituted a property interest com-pensable under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See </em>43 C.F.R. \u00a7 4100.0-5 (1996) (defining a grazing preference). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Fuller </em>and the similarity and connection between grazing permits and grazing preferences, we held that \u201cneither constitutes a property interest compensable under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Alves, </em>133 F.3d at 1457. Instead, \u201c[w]hat is compensable is the fee interest only, divorced from other governmentally-created rights or privileges appurtenant to the fee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Mr. Conti argues that his swordfishing permit bears no legal resemblance to the grazing permits discussed above, which simply allowed their holders to use property owned by the government. By contrast, Mr. Conti states, the government does not own the fish in the ocean. Mr. Conti\u2019s argument is not on point. First, the government has never asserted ownership of the fish in the Atlantic. Rather, pursuant to the regulatory scheme outlined above, the government has broad authority to regulate fishing off the coastline of the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801 (1994) (delegating power to the Secretary of Commerce to regulate fisheries within the EEZ that extends from 3 to 200 miles off the United States coast). More importantly, however, Mr. Conti\u2019s argument ignores the crucial point that it is his relationship with the asserted permit \u2014 not the government\u2019s \u2014 that determines whether a property right exists. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>General Motors, </em>323 U.S. at 378, 65 S.Ct. 357, property interests for purposes of the Fifth Amendment flow from \u201cthe citizen\u2019s relation to the physical thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Applying traditional notions of property and existing rules and understandings, we conclude that Mr. Conti\u2019s swordfishing permit, like the grazing permits in <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Alves, </em>falls short of conferring a cognizable property interest. As noted above, the Department of Commerce required that Mr. Conti obtain a permit to harvest swordfish in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery in the exercise of its authority under the MSA. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811; <em>Atlantic Swordfish Fishery, </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 33,957. While Mr. Conti could and did utilize his permit to fish for more than a decade, he could not assign, sell, or otherwise transfer the permit. <em>Atlantic Swordfish Fishery </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 33,957. The rights to sell, assign, or otherwise transfer are traditional hallmarks of property. <em>See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 435-36, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982) (describing rights to dispose of property and to sell it as part of an individual\u2019s bundle of property rights). Further, since the swordfishing permit did not confer exclusive fishing privileges, permit holders like Mr. Conti lacked the authority to exclude others from the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery. <em>See Dolan v. City of Tigard, </em>512 U.S. 374, 384, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 129 L.Ed.2d 304 (1994) (the \u201cright to exclude others is \u2018one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 176, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979)). In addition, the .government at all times retained the right to revoke, suspend, or modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>permit. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 635.4(a)(3) (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the M.S.A. \u00a7 itself states that the limited access authorization system \u201cshall not create any right, title, or interest in or to any fish,\u201d and that the Department of Commerce may adopt regulations that limit or terminate a particular permit system \u201cwithout compensation to holders of any limited access system permits.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(d)(3)(D), (d)(2)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The absence of crucial indicia of a property right, coupled with the government\u2019s irrefutable retention of the right to suspend, revoke, or modify Mr. Conti\u2019s sword-fishing permit, compels the conclusion that the permit bestowed a revocable license, instead of a property right. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 635.4. A contrary holding, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Fuller, </em>coun-terintuitively would compensate a claimant for \u201cthe value of a right that the Government ... can grant or withhold as it chooses.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>409 U.S. at 493, 93 S.Ct. 801 (quoting <em>United States v.

We turn now to Mr. Conti\u2019s claim that the ban on drift gillnet fishing resulted in a taking of the <em>Providenza, </em>his gillnets, and related gear. As explained above, the gist of the claim is that there was a taking because, in .light , of Mr. Con-ti\u2019s unique circumstances, the ban deprived Mr. Conti of the \u201ceconomically viable use and enjoyment of his property.\u201d Complaint at U12. The Court of Federal Claims rejected the claim. As we have seen, the court recognized that the <em>Providenza, </em>the gillnets, and the related gear were property that qualified for Fifth Amendment protection. The court concluded, however, that there had not been a categorical taking of this property because Mr. Conti retained possession of it. The court also concluded that Mr. Conti\u2019s ability to put the vessel, gillnets, and gear to other uses precluded a holding that a <em>Penn Central </em>regulatory taking had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Mr. Conti contends that the Court of Federal Claims erred by failing to apply the factors announced in <em>Penn Central, </em>as required in a partial takings analysis. According to Mr. Conti, to the extent that the court correctly recognized his property interest in the <em>Providenza </em>and its gear, it erred by not drawing inferences in his favor and by improperly rejecting his factual assertions that the drift gillnet ban had rendered his property valueless. Accordingly, Mr. Conti argues that we should vacate the trial court\u2019s dismissal under RCFC 12(b)(4) and remand the case for a factual determination as to whether a taking occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">As a preliminary matter, we observe that, by citing to <em>Penn Central, </em>Mr. Conti appears to recognize that his case does not present a categorical taking. That is because the ban on drift gillnet fishing plainly did not render his vessel and gear valueless, even though Mr. Conti contends that, in view of <em>his </em>unique circumstances, his property has been rendered valueless to <em>him. </em>The question we must answer, then, is whether the Court of Federal Claims erred in dismissing Mr. Conti\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(4) without undertaking a <em>Penn Central </em>analysis with respect to the vessel, gillnets, and gear. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">As we have seen, Mr. Conti\u2019s taking claim relating- to the <em>Providenza, </em>his gill-nets, and related gear is based on his unique circumstances. This is made clear by If 7 of the complaint, which we have quoted above. In brief, Mr. Conti argues that he could only use the specified property for the harvesting of swordfish in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery using drift gill-nets and that the 1999 ban made that use no longer possible. Hence, there was a taking of his property. We are unable to accept Mr. Conti\u2019s argument that the limitation on the use of his property that was imposed by the ban on drift gillnet fishing resulted in a taking of that property. We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that Mr. Conti\u2019s continuing ability \u201cto sell the vessel and the gear, fish in a different fishery, or put both the nets and the vessel to other uses,\u201d <em>Conti </em>48 Fed.Cl. at 537, precluded a finding that a regulatory taking had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Mr. Conti is arguing that a regulatory taking occurred in this case because the 1999 ban on drift gillnet fishing deprived him of a particular use of his property. The law, however, does not recognize a taking in such circumstances. In <em>Andrus v. Allard, </em>444 U.S. 51, 100 S.Ct. 318, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979), the Court confronted regulations that were issued by the Department of the Interior pursuant to the Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 668(a), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. The regulations provided that migratory birds and eagles, and their parts, that were lawfully acquired prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>the effective dates of the statutes could be possessed and transported without a federal permit, but that such birds and their parts could not be purchased, sold, or traded, or offered for purchase, sale, or trade. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.2(a) (1978) (promulgated pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.2(a) (1978) (promulgated pursuant to the Eagle Protection Act). The appellees in the case were engaged in the trade of Indian artifacts. A number of the artifacts were partly composed of the feathers of birds protected by the statutes and regulations, and these artifacts existed before the statutory protections came into force. <em>Andrus, </em>444 U.S. at 54, 100 S.Ct. 318. The appellees argued that the prohibition on commercial transactions in pre-existing avian artifacts embodied in the regulations constituted a taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment because the prohibition wholly deprived them of the opportunity to earn a profit from the artifacts. The Supreme Court rejected the claim. In so doing, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-4\">The regulations challenged here do not compel the surrender of the artifacts, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them. Rather a significant restriction has been imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts. But the denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full \u201cbundle\u201d of property rights, the destruction of one \u201cstrand\u201d of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety. In this case, it is crucial that appellees retain the rights to possess and transport their property, and to donate or devise the protected birds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">It is, to be sure, undeniable that the regulations here prevent the most profitable use of appellees\u2019 property. Again, however, that is not dispositive. When we review regulation, a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 318 (citations omitted). In <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1465, 1481, 152 L.Ed.2d 517 (2002), the Court cited <em>Andrus </em>in the course of explaining that, in deciding whether a particular governmental action has effected a taking, the Court focuses \u201cboth on the character of the action and on the nature and extent of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole.\u201d Citing to <em>Andrus, </em>the Court continued: \u201cThis requirement that \u2018the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety5 explains why, for example, a regulation that prohibited commercial transactions in eagle feathers, but did not bar other uses or impose any physical invasion or restraint upon them, was not a taking. <em>Andrus v. Allard, </em>444 U.S. 51, 66, 100 S.Ct. 318, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\"><em>Andrus </em>compels our rejection of Mr. Conti\u2019s claim that the ban on drift gillnet fishing resulted in a taking of the <em>Provi-denza </em>and its gear. We accept as true all of the factual allegations in Mr. Conti\u2019s complaint. The problem is that those allegations make out less of a taking claim than the allegations that were advanced in support of the taking claim that was rejected in <em>Andrus. </em>Following the ban on drift gillnet fishing, Mr. Conti is in a far better situation vis-a-vis his vessel and its gear than the appellees in <em>Andrus </em>were vis-a-vis their artifacts in the wake of the Eagle Protection Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act regulations. Most importantly, Mr. Conti can offer for sale, and can sell, his property, whereas the appellees in <em>An-drus </em>could do neither. We are sympathetic to the situation in which Mr. Conti finds himself following the ban on drift gillnet fishing in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery. However, as a matter of law, we are un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>able to hold that, on the alleged facts, he has asserted a cognizable taking claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Mr. Conti\u2019s regulatory taking claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted is <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\">. Although both Mr. Conti and Conti Corporation were plaintiff's in the Court of Federal Claims, and although they both have appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>the court\u2019s decision, in this opinion we refer only to Mr. Conti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b979-11\">. The M.S.A. \u00a7 defines a fishery as \u201cone or more stocks of fish which can be treated as a unit for purposes of conservation and management and which are identified on the basis of geographical, scientific, technical, recreational, and economic characteristics.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(13)(A) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. \u201cBycatch\u201d is defined in the M.S.A. \u00a7 as \"fish which are harvested in a fishery, but which are not sold or kept for personal use, and includes economic discards and regulatory discards.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\">. Though the Supreme Court in <em>Lucas </em>considered a property interest protected by state law, this court has recognized that such an interest may also derive from federal law. <em>See, e.g., Hendler v. United States, 952 </em>F.2d 1364 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">. For all intents and purposes, Mr. Conti is asserting a property interest in the government\u2019s discretionary decision not to exercise its explicitly granted authority to revoke, suspend, or modify the permit. We decline to recognize such a property interest. <em>See Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 </em>U.S. 41, 55, 106 S.Ct. 2390, 91 L.Ed.2d 35 (1986) (holding that the federal government\u2019s exercise of its preexisting statutory right to amend an agreement precluded the existence of a Fifth Amendment property right in a provision of that contract.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b985-8\">. Plainly, the MSA's disavowal of the permit's creation of \"any right, title, or interest in ... <em>any </em>fish,\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(d)(3)(D) (emphasis added), is not facially commensurate with a statement that the law does not create any right, title, or interest in the <em>permit. </em>However, to the extent that the right to harvest and thus possess fish in the fishery is inextricably tied to the possession of a permit, the language certainly suggests that since the permit does not confer any cognizable property right to harvest fish, the M.S.A. \u00a7 creates no property right in the permit. In the grazing permit cases, courts interpreting similar language, providing that \"a permit ... shall not create any right, title, interest, or estate in or to the lands,\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315b, reached the corollary result that the Taylor Grazing Act created no property interest in the grazing permit. <em>See, e.g., Alves, </em>133 F.3d at 1456.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b985-9\">. Mr. Conti relies upon <em>Todd v. United States, </em>155 Ct.Cl. 87, 292 F.2d 841 (1961), and <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>122 Ct.Cl. 197, 103 F.Supp. 1019 (1952), for the proposition that fishermen enjoy property rights in the continued right to fish. <em>Todd </em>and <em>Jackson </em>do not help Mr. Conti, however. In each case, the plaintiff held a permit that had been issued by the State of Maryland that gave the plaintiff the exclusive right to fish in a specified area of Chesapeake Bay. <em>Todd, </em>292 F.2d at 843; <em>Jackson, </em>103 F.Supp. at 1019-20. In each case, the permit right could be sold or passed by inheritance. <em>Todd, </em>292 F.2d at 843; <em>Jackson, </em>103 F.Supp. at 1020. During World War II, the government severely restricted use of the areas covered by the plaintiffs' permits. The restrictions had the effect of requiring the plaintiffs to cease their fishing activities. In <em>Jackson, </em>the court stated that \"the plaintiff had a sort of property right in his fishing ground, and ... the Government took that property from him.\u201d 103 F.Supp. at 1020. The court held that the plaintiff had an equitable and a legal claim against the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1021. In <em>Todd, </em>the court held that the plaintiff had an equitable, but not a legal claim against the government. 292 F.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Several considerations make this case different from <em>Todd </em>and <em>Jackson. </em>First, the terms of Mr. Conti\u2019s swordfishing permit distinguishes it from the permits in <em>Todd </em>and <em>Jackson. </em>Mr. Conti\u2019s permit did not give him exclusive control of an area of the swordfish fishery, and it was not devisable at the time the drift gillnet ban went into effect. Moreover, NMFS, which issued the permit to Mr. Conti, retained the authority to alter the manner in which he used the permit. Finally, both <em>Todd </em>and <em>Jackson </em>were decided before <em>Fuller. </em>We do not need to address here whether they remain viable after <em>Fuller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b988-9\">. It is worth noting that Mr. Conti\u2019s taking claim fails for an additional reason. Mr. Con-ti's ability to use his vessel and gear to catch swordfish using drift gillnets in the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery was dependent upon a permit that was revocable at all times and that, as we have seen, did not constitute a property right for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In <em>Mitchell Arms, Inc. v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 212, 217 (Fed.Cir.1993), we rejected the claim that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms' decision to revoke a permit allowing the importation and sale of certain firearms constituted a taking of the claimant\u2019s right to use the permit for those purposes. We stated: \"Mitchell's ability to import the rifles and sell them in the United States was at all times entirely subject to the exercise of ATF\u2019s regulatory power. Consequently, any expectation which arose on Mitchell's part as a result of the import permits did not constitute a property right protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. Likewise, the drift gillnet regulation at issue here has banned a particular use of Mr. Conti\u2019s vessel and gear \"which was not inherent in its ownership\u201d and was \"totally dependent upon the ... permit issued by\u201d the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
