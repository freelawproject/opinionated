Petitioners are property owners who participated in a federal program to promote development of affordable rental housing in areas not traditionally served by conventional lenders. In exchange for low-interest mortgage loans issued by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), petitioners agreed to devote their properties to low- and middle-income housing and to abide by related restrictions during the life of the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">Petitioners allege that the promissory notes governing their loans guaranteed the borrower the right to prepay at any time and thereby gain release from the federal program and the restrictions it places on the use of a participating owner\u2019s property. In the suits that yielded the judgments before us, petitioners charged that Congress abridged that release right in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1997\">*1997</page-number>the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA or Act), 101 Stat. 1877, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. V). That Act placed permanent restraints upon prepayment of FmHA loans. Petitioners asserted in their complaints that ELIHPA effected both a repudiation of their contracts and a taking of their property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Federal Circuit held petitioners\u2019 claims time barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, which prescribes that all Tucker Act claims must be filed within six years of the date they \u201cfirst acerue[d].\u201d In the Federal Circuit\u2019s view, passage of ELIH-PA constituted an immediate breach of the FmHA loan agreements and therefore triggered the running of the limitations period. Petitioners filed suit not \u201cwithin six years of,\u201d but over nine years after, ELIHPA\u2019s enactment. On that account, the Federal Circuit held their claims untimely, and their suits properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Accepting for purposes of this decision that the loan contracts guaranteed the absolute prepayment right petitioners allege, we reverse the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment. ELIHPA\u2019s enactment, we conclude, qualified as a repudiation of the parties\u2019 bargain, not a present breach of the loan agreements. Accordingly, breach would occur, and the six-year limitations period would commence to run, when a borrower tenders prepayment and the Government then dishonors its obligation to accept the tender and release its control over use of the property that secured the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 515 and 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, 76 Stat. 671, 82 Stat. 551, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1485, 1490a, the FmHA makes direct loans to private, nonprofit entities to develop and/or construct rural housing designed to serve the elderly and low- or middle-income individuals and families.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 515 loans require the borrower, <em>inter alia, </em>to execute various loan documents, including a loan agreement, a promissory note, and a real estate mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Before December 21, 1979, each petitioner entered into a loan agreement with the FmHA under \u00a7\u00a7 515 and 521 \u201cto provide rental housing and related facilities for eligible occupants ... in rural areas.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. A165. In the loan agreements, each petitioner certified that it was unable to obtain a comparable loan in the commercial market. See <em>id., </em>at A177. The loan agreements contained various provisions designed to ensure that the projects were affordable for people with low incomes. Those provisions included restrictions as to eligible tenants, the rents petitioners could charge, and the rate of return petitioners could realize, as well as requirements regarding the maintenance and financial operations of each project. See <em>id., </em>at A170-A174. Each loan agreement also specified the length of the loan, ordinarily 40 or 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">The promissory notes executed by petitioners required payment of the principal on each mortgage in scheduled installments, plus interest. See <em>id., </em>at A176-A177. The notes also contained the prepayment provision curtailed by the legislation involved in the litigation now before us. That provision read: \u201cPrepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time at the option of Borrower.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at A176. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1998\">*1998</page-number>other provision of the loan documents addressed prepayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">In 1979, Congress found that many \u00a7 515 participants had prepaid their mortgages, thus threatening the continued availability of affordable rural housing. Concerned that \u201cthese projects [remain] available to low and moderate income families for the entire original term of the loan,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-154, p. 43 (1979), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1979, pp. 2317, 2359, Congress amended the National Housing Act to stem the loss of low-cost rural housing due to prepayments, see Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1101. In these 1979 amendments, Congress prohibited the FmHA from accepting prepayment of any loan made before or after the date of enactment unless the owner agreed to maintain the low-income use of the rental housing for a 15-year or 20-year period from the date of the loan. 93 Stat. 1134-1135. That requirement could be avoided if the FmHA determined that there was no longer a need for the low-cost housing. <em>Id., </em>at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The 1979 amendments applied to all program loans, past, present, and future. In 1980, however, Congress further amended the National Housing Act to eliminate retroactive application of the \u00a7 515 prepayment limitations imposed by the 1979 legislation. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1614, provided that the prepayment restrictions would apply only to loans entered into after December 21, 1979, the date that amendment was enacted. \u00a7 514, 94 Stat. 1671-1672. The 1980 Act also required the Secretary of Agriculture to inform Congress of the repeal\u2019s adverse effects, if any, on the availability of low-income housing. <em>Id., </em>at 1672.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">By 1987, Congress had again become concerned about the dwindling supply of low- and moderate-income rural housing in the face of increasing prepayments of mortgages under \u00a7 515.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A House of Representatives Committee found that owners were \u201cprepaying] or ... refinancing] their FmHA loans, without regard to the low income and elderly tenants in these projects.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 100-122, p. 53, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1987, pp. 3317, 3369.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Responsive to that concern, Congress passed ELIHPA, which amended the Housing Act of 1949 to impose permanent restrictions upon prepayment of \u00a7 515 mortgages entered into before December 21, 1979. This legislation, enacted on February 5, 1988, provides that before FmHA can accept an offer to prepay such a mortgage,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-11\">\u201cthe [FmHA] shall make reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement with the borrower under which the borrower will make a binding commitment to extend the low income use of the assisted housing and related facilities involved for not less than the 20-year period beginning on the date on which the agreement is executed.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(c)(4)(A) (1994 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">The legislation further provides that the FmHA may include incentives in such an agreement, including an increase in the rate of return on investment, reduction of the interest rate on the loan, and an additional loan to the borrower. \u00a7 1472(c)(4)(B) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Under ELIHPA, if the FmHA determines after a \u201creasonable period\u201d that an agreement cannot be reached, the owner who sought to prepay must offer to sell the housing to \u201cany qualified nonprofit organization or public agency at a fair market value determined by 2 independent appraisers.\u201d \u00a7 1472(c)(5)(A)\u00ae (1994 ed.). If an offer to buy is not made by a nonprofit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1999\">*1999</page-number>organization or agency within 180 days, the FmHA may accept the owner\u2019s offer to prepay. \u00a7 1472(e)(5)(A)(ii). The offer-for-sale requirement may be avoided if the FmHA determines that prepayment will not \u201cmaterially affee[t]\u201d housing opportunities for minorities and one of two other conditions is met: Prepayment will not displace the tenants of the affected housing, or there is \u201can adequate supply of safe, decent, and affordable housing within the market area\u201d and \u201csufficient actions have been taken to ensure\u201d that such housing \u201cwill be made available\u201d to displaced tenants. \u00a7 1472(c)(5)(G)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">ELIHPA\u2019s implementing regulations establish a process by which the FmHA addresses prepayment requests. Under those procedures, the FmHA first \u201cdeve-lo[ps] an incentive offer,\u201d making a \u201creasonable effort ... to enter into an agreement with the borrower to maintain the housing for low-income use that takes into consideration the economic loss the borrower may suffer by foregoing [sic] prepayment.\u201d 7 CFR \u00a7 1965.210 (2002). Only if the borrower rejects that offer will the FmHA attempt to make the determinations \u2014 regarding the effect on minority housing opportunities, the displacement of tenants, and the supply of affordable housing in the market \u2014 required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(c)(5)(G) before prepayment can be accepted. 7 CFR \u00a7 1965.215(a) (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Petitioners in <em>Franconia </em>filed this action in the United States Court of Federal Claims on May 30, 1997. Plaintiffs included petitioners \u2014 all of whom had entered into loan agreements before December 21, 1979, and were therefore subject to ELIH-PA \u2014 and others, who had entered into loan agreements after December 21, 1979, and were therefore unaffected by the Act. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A3, n. 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners alleged that ELIHPA repudiated their loan contracts, which, they asserted, gave them the right \u201cto terminate them participation in the Government\u2019s housing program by exercising their option to prepay at any time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at A112. Their complaint sought relief on two theories: breach of contract and a violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s proscription against taking property without just compensation. See <em>id., </em>at A132-A133.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">The Court of Federal Claims granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss petitioners\u2019 contract claims as barred by the six-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. 43 Fed.Cl. 702 (1999). That provision states: \u201cEvery claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\u201d The court concluded that petitioners\u2019 contract claims first accrued on May 23,1988, the effective date of regulations implementing ELIH-PA. <em>Id., </em>at 709. That was so, the court said, because those regulations breached the only performance required of the Government under the promissory notes: \u201cto keep its promise to allow borrowers an unfettered prepayment right.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 710. The court also dismissed petitioners\u2019 takings claims <em>sua sponte; </em>because \u201cthe [government] conduct ... alleged to have constituted a taking\u201d was \u201cCongress\u2019s change of the prepayment option,\u201d the court reasoned, any claim based on that conduct \u201caccrued at the time of the 1988 legislation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal of petitioners\u2019 claims on timeliness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2000\">*2000</page-number>grounds. 240 F.3d 1358 (2001). The Court of Appeals agreed with the Court of Federal Claims on the respective benefits and burdens generated by the promissory notes: Petitioners enjoyed \u201can unfettered right to prepay their loans at any time,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1363, while the Government had an obligation \u201cto continue to allow borrowers\u201d that option, <em>ibid. </em>If the Government\u2019s \u201ccontinuing duty was breached,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cthe breach occurred immediately upon enactment of ELIHPA because, by its terms, ELIHPA took away the borrowers\u2019 unfettered right of prepayment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the court ruled, the statute of limitations began to run on February 5, 1988, the date of ELIHPA\u2019s passage, see <em>id., </em>at 1364;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> given that limitations-triggering date, the court held, petitioners\u2019 claims, filed over nine years post-ELIHPA, were time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In holding petitioners\u2019 claims untimely, the Federal Circuit rejected the argument pressed by petitioners that the passage of ELIHPA qualified as a repudiation. Were ELIHPA so regarded, petitioners\u2019 suit would be timely if filed within six years of either the date performance fell due (the date petitioners tendered prepayment) or the date on which petitioners elected to treat the repudiation as a present breach. \u201cAn anticipatory repudiation occurs,\u201d the Court of Appeals recognized, \u201cwhen an obligor communicates to an obligee that he will commit a breach in the future.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1363 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe doctrine of anticipatory repudiation does not apply in this case,\u201d the court reasoned, because after ELIHPA revoked the promise to allow unrestricted prepayment, the Government owed no future performance under the contracts. <em>Id., </em>at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Petitioners\u2019 takings claims were time barred for essentially the same reason, the Federal Circuit held. The \u201cproperty\u201d allegedly taken without just compensation was petitioners\u2019 contractual \u201cright to prepay their FmHA loans at any time,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 1365; the takings claim thus arose when, upon passage of ELIHPA, the Government \u201ctook away and conclusively abolished\u201d the unrestricted prepayment option, <em>id., </em>at 1366.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">On September 16, 1998, the <em>Grass Valley </em>petitioners, all of whom had entered into \u00a7 515 loan agreements before December 21, 1979, joined by other plaintiffs with post-1979 loans, filed an action in the Court of Federal Claims virtually identical to the <em>Franconia </em>action. On April 12, 2000, that court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the <em>Grass Valley </em>petitioners\u2019 contract claims for the reasons it had dismissed the claims of the <em>Franconia </em>petitioners. 46 Fed.Cl. 629, 633-635 (2000). The Federal Circuit affirmed without opinion. Judgt. order reported at 7 Fed.Appx. 928 (2001).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2001\">*2001</page-number>We granted certiorari, 534 U.S. 1073, 122 S.Ct. 802, 151 L.Ed.2d 688 (2002), and now reverse the two judgments of the Federal Circuit before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">A waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States \u201ccannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969). That requirement is satisfied here. Once the United States waives its immunity and does business with its citizens, it does so much as a party never cloaked with immunity. Cf. <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 363, 369, 63 S.Ct. 573, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943) (\u201cThe United States does business on business terms.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Another threshold matter conf\u00ednes this controversy. For purposes of this case, the United States agrees, it may be assumed that petitioners obtained precisely the promise they allege \u2014 a promise that permits them an unfettered right to prepay their mortgages any time over the life of the loans, thereby gaining release from federal restrictions on the use of their property. See Brief for United States 18-19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. The sole issue before us is thus cleanly presented: were petitioners\u2019 complaints initiated within the six-year limitations period prescribed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501?</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">\u201cWhen the United States enters into contract relations, its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Exploration &amp; Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 604, 607, 120 S.Ct. 2423, 147 L.Ed.2d 528 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under applicable \u201cprinciples of general contract law,\u201d <em>Priebe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 407, 411, 68 S.Ct. 123, 92 L.Ed. 32 (1947), whether petitioners\u2019 claims were filed \u201cwithin six years after [they] first accrue[d],\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, depends upon when the Government breached the prepayment undertaking stated in the promissory notes. See 1 C. Corman, Limitations of Actions \u00a7 7.2.1, p. 482 (1991) (\u201cThe cause of action for breach of contract accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, at the time of the breach.\u201d (footnote omitted)); see also 18 S. Williston, Law of Contracts \u00a7 2021A, p. 697 (3d W. Jaeger ed.1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">In declaring ELIHPA a present breach of petitioners\u2019 loan contracts, the Federal Circuit reasoned that the Government had but one obligation under those agreements: \u201cto continue to allow borrowers the unfettered right to prepay their loans at any time.\u201d 240 F.3d, at 1363; see also 43 Fed.Cl., at 710 (Government\u2019s contractual duty was \u201cto keep its promise to allow borrowers an unfettered prepayment right\u201d). If that continuing duty was breached, the court maintained, the breach occurred <em>immediately, </em>totally and definitively, when ELIHPA took away the borrowers\u2019 unfettered right to prepay. See 240 F.3d, at 1363. The Court of Appeals so ruled despite petitioners\u2019 insistence that \u201cthe government\u2019s performance obligation under the contracts was to <em>accept </em>prepayment\u201d whenever tendered during the long life of the loans, even decades into the future. <em>Id., </em>at 1362 (emphasis added); see also 43 Fed.Cl., at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">The Federal Circuit, we are persuaded, incorrectly characterized the performance allegedly due from the Government under the promissory notes. If petitioners enjoyed a \u201cright to prepay their loans at any time,\u201d 240 F.3d, at 1363, then necessarily the Government had a corresponding obligation to accept prepayment and execute the appropriate releases. See Brief for Petitioners 5-6. Absent an obligation on the lender to accept prepayment, the obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2002\">*2002</page-number>gation \u201cto allow\u201d borrowers to prepay would be meaningless. A loan contract of such incomplete design would be illusory. See J. Murray, Contracts \u00a7 2, p. 5 (2d rev. ed.1974) (promise required to create a binding contract must be an \u201cundertaking or commitment to do or refrain from doing [something in the future\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Once the Government\u2019s pledged performance is properly comprehended as an obligation to accept prepayment, the error in the Federal Circuit\u2019s reasoning becomes apparent. Failure by the promisor to perform at the time indicated for performance in the contract establishes an immediate breach. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 235(2) (1979) (hereinafter Restatement) (\u201cWhen performance of a duty under a contract is due[,] any nonperformance is a breach.\u201d); Murray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 206, at 417. But the promisor\u2019s renunciation of a \u201ccontractual duty <em>before </em>the time fixed in the contract for ... performance\u201d is a repudiation. 4 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 959, p. 855 (1951) (emphasis added); Restatement \u00a7 250 (repudiation entails a statement or \u201cvoluntary affirmative act\u201d indicating that the promisor \u201cwill commit a breach\u201d when performance becomes due). Such a repudiation ripens into a breach prior to the time for performance only if the promisee \u201celects to treat it as such.\u201d See <em>Roehm v. Horst, </em>178 U.S. 1, 13, 20 S.Ct. 780, 44 L.Ed. 953 (1900) (repudiation \u201cgive[s] the promisee the right of electing either to ... wait till the time for [the promisor\u2019s] performance has arrived, or to act upon [the renunciation] and treat it as a final assertion by the promisor that he is no longer bound by the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Viewed in this light, ELIHPA effected a repudiation of the FmHA loan contracts, not an immediate breach. The Act conveyed an announcement by the Government that it would not perform as represented in the promissory notes if and when, at some point in the future, petitioners attempted to prepay their mortgages. See Restatement \u00a7 250, Comment <em>b </em>(\u201c[A] statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract constitutes a repudiation.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Murray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 208, at 421. Unless petitioners treated ELIHPA as a present breach by filing suit prior to the date indicated for performance, breach would occur when a borrower attempted to prepay, for only at that time would the Government\u2019s responsive performance become due.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">In sum, once it is understood that ELIHPA is most sensibly characterized as a repudiation, the decisions below lose force. To recapitulate, \u201c[t]he time of accrual ... depends on whether the injured party chooses to treat the ... repudiation as a present breach.\u201d 1 G. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7 7.2.1, p. 488 (1991). If that party \u201c[e]lects to place the repudiator in breach before the performance date, the accrual date of the cause of action is accelerated from [the] time of performance to the date of such election.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 488-489. But if the injured party instead opts to await performance, \u201cthe cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations commences to run, from the time fixed for performance rather than from the earlier date of repudiation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">The Government draws no distinction \u201cbetween a duty to allow petitioners to prepay and a duty to accept tendered prepayments\u201d; \u201cany such distinction,\u201d the Government acknowledges, \u201cwould be without significance.\u201d Brief for United States 33. Indeed, the Government recognizes, if petitioners had an \u201cunfettered right to prepay,\u201d then, \u201cof course,\u201d that right would be complemented by an \u201cobli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2003\">*2003</page-number>gation to accept any prepayment tendered.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In defense of the judgment below, the Government relies on two other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">First, the Government draws upon the text of \u00a7 2501, which bars any claims not \u201cfiled within six years after [the] claim first accrues.\u201d The words \u201cfirst accrues,\u201d the Government contends, are key. See <em>id., </em>at 11. Those words, according to the Government, convey Congress\u2019 intent to guard the sovereign against claims that might be deemed timely under statutes of limitations applicable to private parties. <em>Id., </em>at 28. As the Government reads \u00a7 2501, the \u201cfirst accrues\u201d qualification ensures that suits against the United States are filed on \u201cthe earliest possible date,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 17, thereby providing the Government with \u201creasonably prompt notice of the fiscal implications of past enactments,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 16. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201c[S]trict construction of [\u00a7 2501] ... serves the salutary purpose of ensuring that a Congress close to the one that enacted the statute [alleged to have caused a breach of contract]\u2014 rather than a Congress serving perhaps many decades later \u2014 may and must address the consequences.\u201d); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We do not agree that \u00a7 2501 creates a special accrual rule for suits against the United States. Contrary to the Government\u2019s contention, the text of \u00a7 2501 is unexceptional: A number of contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties also tie the commencement of the limitations period to the date a claim \u201cfirst accrues.\u201d See J. Angel\u00ed, Limitations of Actions 536-588 (6th ed. 1876) (quoting state statutes of limitations). Equally telling, in its many years of applying and interpreting \u00a7 2501, the Court of Federal Claims has never attributed to the words \u201cfirst accrues\u201d the meaning the Government now proposes. Instead, in other settings, that court has adopted the repudiation doctrine in its traditional form when evaluating the timeliness of suits governed by \u00a7 2501. See <em>Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related Cases v. United States, </em>37 Fed.Cl. 174, 183-184 (1997), aff'd. <em>sub nom. Ariadne Financial Services Pty. Ltd. v. United States, </em>133 F.3d 874 (C.A.Fed.1998). In line with our recognition that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government \u201cin the same way that\u201d they apply to private parties, <em>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), we reject the Government\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 2501. That position, we conclude, presents an \u201cunduly restrictiv[e]\u201d reading of the congressional waiver of sovereign immunity, <em>Bowen v. City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986), rather than \u201ca realistic assessment of legislative intent,\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">Two practical considerations reinforce this conclusion. Cf. <em>Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, </em>386 U.S. 503, 517, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1967) (the words \u201cfirst accrues\u201d must be interpreted \u201cwith due regard to those practical ends which are to be served by any limitation of the time within which an action must be brought\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Reading \u00a7 2501 as the Government proposes would seriously distort the repudiation doctrine in suits brought under the Tucker Act. Assuming a claim could \u201cfirst accrue\u201d for limitations purposes on the date of repudiation, but see <em>supra, </em>at 2002, a party aggrieved by the Government\u2019s renunciation of a contractual obligation anticipating future performance would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2004\">*2004</page-number>compelled by the looming limitations bar to forgo the usual option of awaiting the time performance is due before filing an action for breach. The Government\u2019s construction of \u00a7 2501 would thus convert the repudiation doctrine from a shield for the promisee into a sword by which the Government could invoke its own wrongdoing to defeat otherwise timely suits. As Professor Corbin explained, \u201c[t]he plaintiff should not be penalized for leaving to the defendant an opportunity to retract his wrongful repudiation; and he would be so penalized if the statutory period of limitation is held to begin to run against him immediately.\u201d Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 989, at 967; see <em>Roehm v. Horst, </em>178 U.S., at 10, 20 S.Ct. 780 (\u201c[I]t seems reasonable to allow an option to the injured party, either to sue immediately, or to wait till the time when the act was to be done, ... which may be advantageous to the innocent party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">There is also reason to doubt that the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7 2501 would inure to the benefit of the United States. Putting prospective plaintiffs to the choice of either bringing suit soon after the Government\u2019s repudiation or forever relinquishing their claims would surely proliferate litigation. Every borrower of FmHA loans, for example, would be forced to sue the Government within six years of ELIHPA\u2019s enactment in order to preserve a claim stemming from that Act. Faced with the prospect of forever forgoing such a claim, even a borrower that had not previously wished to prepay might well conclude that early exit from the FmHA program is the only safe course. The Government would thus find itself defending against highly speculative damages claims in a profusion of lawsuits, most of which would never have been brought under a less novel interpretation of \u00a7 2501. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The Government also seeks to avoid the repudiation doctrine by attacking as \u201cfutile\u201d petitioners\u2019 \u201csearch for an exact parallel in contracts solely between private parties.\u201d Brief for United States 13. The law of repudiation does not govern this case, the Government ultimately contends, because the \u201cstatement of intent not to perform\u201d on which petitioners base their claim is an Act of Congress. <em>Id., </em>at 24. According to the Government, a congressional enactment like ELIHPA that precludes the Government from honoring a contractual obligation anticipating future performance always constitutes a present breach. This is so, the Government maintains, because \u201cthe promisor\u201d \u2014 the agency or official responsible for administering the contract \u2014 does not \u201cremai[n] free to change its mind and render the requisite performance\u201d without violating binding federal law. <em>Id., </em>at 27. Accordingly, the Government concludes, the essential purpose of the repudiation doctrine \u2014 to avoid an unnecessary lawsuit by allowing the promisor an opportunity to adhere to its undertaking \u2014 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">We reject the Government\u2019s premise, and therefore its conclusion. Just as Congress may announce the Government\u2019s intent to dishonor an obligation to perform in the future through a duly enacted law, so may it retract that renouncement prior to the time for performance, thereby enabling the agency or contracting official to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2005\">*2005</page-number>perform as promised. Indeed, Congress \u201cchange[d] its mind\u201d in just this manner before it enacted ELIHPA. <em>Ibid. </em>In the 1979 amendments to the National Housing Act, Congress repudiated the promissory notes at issue here by conditioning prepayment of all \u00a7 515 loans on the borrower\u2019s agreement to maintain the low-income use of its property for a specified period. See Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 98 Stat. 1134-1135. One year later, Congress removed those conditions on pre-1979 loans, thereby retracting the repudiation. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1671-1672; <em>swpra, </em>at 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">We comprehend no reason why an Act of Congress may not constitute a repudiation of a contract to which the United States is a party. Congress may renounce the Government\u2019s contractual duties without triggering an immediate breach because Congress may withdraw that repudiation if given the opportunity to do so. \u201cHence, ... the fact that [the Government\u2019s] repudiation rested upon the enactment of a new statute makes no significant difference.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil, </em>530 U.S., at 620, 120 S.Ct. 2423; see <em>id., </em>at 619, 120 S.Ct. 2423 (\u201c[I]f legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President is not a \u2018statement by the obligor\u2019 \u201d capable of triggering a repudiation, \u201cit is difficult to imagine what would constitute such a statement.\u201d (quoting Restatement \u00a7 250)).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">To answer the question presented\u2014 when does the statute of limitations on petitioners\u2019 claims begin to run, see Pet. for Cert, i \u2014 we need not separately address petitioners\u2019 alternative theory of recovery based on the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Federal Circuit\u2019s holding that takings relief was time barred hinged entirely on its conclusion that petitioners\u2019 contract claims accrued upon passage of ELIHPA. See 240 F.3d, at 1365-1366. Because that conclusion was incorrect, we hold, the Federal Circuit erred in dismissing petitioners\u2019 takings theory on grounds of untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">^ H\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Concluding that each petitioner\u2019s claim is timely if filed within six years of a wrongly rejected tender of prepayment, we reverse the judgments of the Federal Circuit and remand the <em>Franconia </em>and <em>Grass Valley </em>cases reviewed herein for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-10\">. Since 1994, the program has been entrusted to the Rural Housing Service, known between 1994 and 1996 as Rural Housing and Community Development Services. That agency was created by the Secretary of Agriculture under authority provided by the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 3219, as amended, 110 Stat. 1128, 1131. See also 7 CFR \u00a7 2003.18 (2002) (functional organization of Rural Housing Service). Our references to the FmHA should be understood to include these successor agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. In 1986, Congress had passed a temporary moratorium that precluded \u00a7 515 prepayments in most cases. The moratorium originally was to expire in 1987, but it was extended into 1988 by another temporary measure. See note following 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472, p. 163 (1994 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. In 1992, Congress passed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 3672, codified in relevant part at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(c) (1992 legislation). That provision, which had no effect on petitioners\u2019 loans, extended ELIHPA's restrictions to loans made after those of petitioners, <em>i.e., </em>loans made from December 21, 1979, through 1989. See 106 Stat. 3841.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b961-14\">. The claims of the latter group of <em>Franconia </em>plaintiffs remain pending before the Court of Federal Claims.

The Federal Circuit thus disagreed with the Court of Federal Claims in one respect: The former concluded that petitioners\u2019 claims had accrued on the date of ELIHPA\u2019s enactment, while the latter held that those claims had accrued on the effective date of regulations implementing the Act. 240 F.3d, at 1365, n. 3. This disagreement is irrelevant to, and rendered academic by, our resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. Like the Court of Federal Claims, see 43 Fed.Cl. 702, 708-709 (1999), the Federal Circuit rejected petitioners\u2019 \u201calternative argument\u201d that even if the limitations period commenced to run upon enactment of legislation installing prepayment restrictions, the 1992 legislation, rather than ELIHPA, served as the operative provision. 240 F.3d 1358, 1365, and n. 4 (2001). Petitioners contended that ELIHPA represented an emergency measure that curtailed prepayment rights only temporarily; the definitive legislative action, they maintained, occurred later, when the 1992 legislation made curtailment of their prepayment rights permanent. <em>Id., </em>at 1365. The Federal Circuit concluded that although Congress had designated certain provisions in EL-IHPA \"interim measures,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), \"no similar language ... indicated] that [ELIHPA\u2019s] restrictions on FmHA loan prepayments were anything but permanent as to\u201d borrowers in petitioners' situation, <em>ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b962-12\">.

The record indicates that at least one petitioner has attempted to prepay, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A157-A158, but contains no information about how many others have done so or when any such attempts took place, see 43 Fed.Cl., at 707. Application of our holding to each petitioner in light of such determinations is a task for the lower courts on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. As petitioners observe, see Reply Brief 6, n. 6, the \"first accrues\u201d qualification might serve a meaningful purpose in the context of tolling of disabilities for successive claimants. In that context, the qualification would ensure that suit could be delayed only during the disability of the claimant to whom a right of action first accrued; successive claimants laboring under a disability would be unprotected by any tolling proviso. See J. Angel\u00ed, Limitations of Actions 488, and n. 2 (6th ed. 1876).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b966-5\">. The Government\u2019s reliance on <em>McMahon v. United. States, </em>342 U.S. 25, 72 S.Ct. 17, 96 L.Ed. 26 (1951), is misplaced. Brief for United States 29-30.

The reasoning in that case does not apply to petitioners' claims, which arise out of contracts in which the Government allegedly granted borrowers an option to demand performance, and thereby precipitate breach, at anytime. See <em>supra, </em>at 2001. And unlike the position rejected in <em>McMahon, </em>our ruling today ensures that suit must be brought within a fixed period after the date of injury \u2014 in this case, no later than six years after the Government's refusal to accept prepayment in accord with the terms of the promissory notes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
