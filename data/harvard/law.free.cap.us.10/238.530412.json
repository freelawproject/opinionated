That a part of the merchandise agreed to be furnished consisted of plate, jewelry, &amp;e. purchased by the defendant of .Messrs. <em>Lemuel Wells </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>to the amount, as was then supposed, of 2,300 dollars; and, in consideration of its being brought into the joint stock, the plaintiff agreed to pay one half of the debt due to <em>Wells </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>thereior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">That the business of the concern was conducted in two separate stores, viz. a hardware store r incipallv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>under the management of the plaintiff; and a jewelry store under the management of the defendant, containing the stock of jewelry, See. brought into the joint concern by the defendant, and that which was purchased of <em>Wells </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>The business of the copartnership was carried on until the 1st of March, 1805, when a dissolution took place. During that period goods were bought and carried into the jewelry store, and at the time of the dissolution \u201c the <em>jewelry store was indebted to said </em>concerti\u201d in the sum of 2,825 dollars and 27\" cents, besides which the <em>concern </em>had paid <em>Wells Co. </em>in part of their debt, the sum of 26S dollars and 56 cents. That the dissolution was upon the following terms, viz. that the defendant shoujd <em>withdraw all the property put into the joint stock, by him; </em>and should have the <em>goods in the jewelry </em>store, and aU the <em>debts due to that </em>store, as a compensation and in lieu of the <em>profits </em>arising upon the <em>whole </em>business. And the plaintiff was to take, on his account the goods in the hardware store, and the goods which were ordered for the spring; and was' to <em>indemnify </em>the defendant from' all claims or demands upon the concern, or which might arise from goods then ordered, and not at that tmie received; which articles of dissolution were under Seal. That when the plaintiff signed the articles of dissolution he did not intend to commit himself to the payment \u00f3f the debt due to Wells &amp;\u2022 Co. For although, by the articles of copartnership, he had agreed to pay half the debt, yet as the goods were given up to the defendant upon-the dissolution, he considered himself absolved from that obligation. And the plaintiff contends that the defendant ought to have, been satisfied when the plaintiff \u201c returned to him the <em>whole jewelry </em>store, with the accession of nearly 3,000 dollars worth of merchandise, and gave up to him the-<em>profits of the said </em>store, which he believes to be equal to 2,500 dollars more.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">That upon the dissolution the plaintiff agreed to give the defendant security for his performance of the terras of the dissolution, and the defendant hada bond prepared, which was signed by the plaintiff and his sureties; that the plaintiff did not see the bond until he was called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>on to sign it, and that he is satisfied he never read it? taking it for granted that it was a bond to compel him to perform what he was bound to perform by the terms of the dissolution; and that his sureties executed it under \u25a0the same circumstances and impression. That the defendant did not claim payment of the-debt due to Wells &amp; Co. for a year after the bond, was executed, although Wells &amp; Co. before the dissolution had brought suit against the defendant therefor; that the defendant had rendered the plaintiff some accounts in which that debt was not mentioned. That the defendant afterwards brought suit upon the plaintiff\u2019s bond, and-gave notice that-he should claim the whole amount of' the debt due to Wells St Co. That the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was of opinion that the bond was so worded as to bind the' plaintiff to the paymeht of that -debt, whereupon the plaintiff confessed a judgment at law, saving his right to relief in equity. That, the bond was executed under a mistaken impression of its contents? and that the defendant will take out execution upon the judgment at law. \u2022 The bill-then prays an injunction to stay execution, until the matter in dispute can be heard and decided in equity, and the accounts between the plaintiff and defendant examined and settled, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">The injunction was granted by one. of the judges out of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">\u25a0 In the articles of C9partnership, after stating- what stock the plaintiff should bring into the joint concern, the debt to Wells &amp; Co. is mentioned in the following manner, viz.- u And on the part of Adam Lynn, his gold and silver manufactory, two lots in the city of Washington, all his stock of merchandise, (the said O.

And a statement of hardware imported on the joint account before March, 1805, amounting to 7,653 dollars and- S\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>cents.

It denies.that the. plaintiff advanced the 5,000 dollars in .cash.-; and avers that the profits of the ship United States never came to the use of the concern, but-were retained by Rickets &amp; Newton, to whom the plaintiff had transferred his halt of that ship. It avers that by the articles of copartnership,- each party was to bring into-the joint stock 11,000 dollars. That the defendant brought in 2,429 dollars more than his proportion, which was the reason of making the debt to Wells &amp; Co. a partnership, debt; alter which there was still an excess of capital, amounting to 129 dollars furnished by the defendant, for which he had credit upon the first' opening of the partnership books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">* The entry of stock en the 1st of March, 1804, was as. follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>L s. d.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">Cash in England, 1,500 O O</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\">One half ship U.

It denies that the account exhibited by the plaintiff against the jewelry store is correct; and' avers that il a true account had been kept, the balance. would have been i-n favour of that store. It avers that it was\u2019 the intention of the defendant, and he believes of the plaintiff also, in the articles of dissolution, to include the debt due to Wells &amp; Co. under the description of \u201call claims and demands on-.the. concern.\u201d That it\u2019 was adopted as a social debt by the articles of copart* nership, and was placed to the credit of Wells' &amp; Co. on the books of the concern, and a-partial payment made out of the joint funds. That if this credit had not been so given, the -defendant would have been a creditor of the concern to the amount of 2,429 dollars instead of 129. That the plaintiff had paid mauy of the debts due from the jewelry store which were sit\u00faa* ted exactly'like that of Wells &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-4\">The answer expressly avers that the plaintiff did <em>'read, </em>examine, and, as the defendant believes,, perfectly understand the bond of indemnity before he executed it. -That it was left with him some hours before he signed it. And it avers also, positively, that the plaintiff\u2019s sureties read it and made remarks to the defendant in the presence of -the plaintiff upon the manner in which it was drawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">It states that the defendant offered the plaintiff two propositions as the basis of the dissolution. One was, that a dividend should be made of the debts, the profits, and the stock; and if ahy difference should arise, on settlement, it should be submitted to three merchants. 'Ihe 9ther was, that the defendant should have the merchandise in the jewelry store, and the debts due to that store, as a compensation in lieu of the profits of the whole business; th^t the plaintiff should hold the merchandise in the hardware store, and the debts due to it, and the profits of the trade,. and should pay all debts ttrid contracts as stated in. the bond ;. the latter of which propositions was accepted by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The answer dentes that the defendant received bacfc the jewelry store with the accession o/ 3,000 dollars worth of merchandise, pr that the profits were equal to \u00a3,500 dollars. It avers that the defendant believes they did not exceed 1,250 dollars, and were less than those of the- hardware store. That the profits of the ship United States were at least 4,000 dollars. These the defendant relinquished to obtain indemnity against the debts of the concern, That the plaintiff refused to take an inventory at the time of dissolution, so that an accurate account cannot be taken. Thv.t the reason why he did -not sooner claim from the plaintiff the amount due to. Wells &amp; Co, was, that he was under an erroneous opinion th^t he could have no recourse to the plaintiff until he should first have paid and discharged that debt,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-4\">The answer denies any agreement between the plaintiff and defendant to acquit each other of their private debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">The only testimony in the' cause related to the profits of the ship United States; and the accounts exhibited being true copies from the books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">The. court below, conceiving that the whole equity of the bill was completely denied by the answer, and not supported by the evidence in the cause, dissolved the injunction, and,-upon final hearing, dismissed the bill; whereupon the plaintiff brought his writ of error,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-7\"><em>Swann </em>and Youngs, for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">. 1. That Finley was not bound to pay the debt du to Wells &amp; Co.; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\">.2, That Finley was entitled to the amount standing pn the books of the concern to the debit of the jewelry store, it being (as they contended) a debt due to the <em>hardware </em>store, and that, by the true construction of. the articles of dissolution, Finley was entitled to the debts due to that store.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>1. In support of the..first point it was said that by \u25a0the articles of dissolution- Finley was bound to indemnify Lynn from \u201c <em>claims </em>and <em>demands </em>upon the <em>concern\u201d </em>only. That the claim of Wells &amp; Co. was .against Lynn only for goods originally sold to him upon his sole credit, and-that although the goods-after-wards came to the use of' the concern,..and although Finley and Lynn might agree between themselves to Consider it as a joint debt, yet that would give Wells &amp; Co. no claim upon the <em>concern. </em>-Thatthe bond was given merely to carry into effect the articles of dissolution, and wiil not in equity be extended beyond the expressions of those articles; The bond does not alter the equitable obligations of the parties. 1 <em>Fonb. </em>106. 188. 192. 2 <em>Atk. </em>203. 2 <em>F. Wms. </em>349. 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">2. Although the articles of , dissolution do not expressly give Finley the debts due to the hardware store, yet it is t\u00f3 be implied from the principle of reciprocity 'which seems intended between the parties, and from the circumstance that he was bound to pay all the debts' of the concern. 1 <em>Fonb. 427. </em>Although the accoupt makes the jewelry store debtor to Finley and Lynn, yet it means Finley and Lynn\u2019s hardware store, because that store was carried on in the name of <em>Finley </em>&amp; Lynn, the jewelry store in the name of <em>Lynn only.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">Although the plaintiff has not in his bill cjaimed this balance, yet that is no objection to his recovery. He has. prayed for <em>general </em>relief, and the court will give him every thing which in equity he ought to have. 3 <em>Atk. </em>523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">Although the defendant denies that balance to be due, because he says goods, of which no account was taken, had been carried from the jewelry to the hardware store, yet he admits that, the goods charged in the account were furnished and sent to the jewelry' store, and his answer is no evidence that goods were carried, from the jewelry to the hardware store. It is not an averment responsive to' the bill, and must be proved, by other evidence than the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>One witness will authorize a decree against an answer. 1 <em>Atk. </em>19. And here was a witness who testified that both the parties admitted the entries in that account to be correct.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-4\"><em>E. J. Lee </em>and Jones, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-5\">The whole equity of the bill consists in the allega-. tion . that the \u2022 bond does not agree with the articles of dissolution, and was'obtained by surprise. It-contains. .bo other ground of complaint. The answer completely denies this equity, and there is no proof to support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">The bond is- warranted by the articles of dissolution and the artilles of copartnership. The ground of surprise and mistake is denied absolutely b\\ thean-' sWer. It is a rule in equity that the ground of mistake- or surprise must be clearly proved before a court? of equity will interfere. 1 <em>Vezey, 317. </em>In this case there is -a total failure of proof, altogether. Nothing can be clearer than - the liability of the plaintiff to pay the debt of Wells &amp; Co. The articles of copartnership are express and pointed ' to. that effect. The articles of dissolution, taken in connection with the articles-of copartnership, are equally explicit, and the-bond is unequivocal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">With regard to the account raised against the jewelry store, it is no more than a. memorandum of the amount of goods placed there for sale* The account is with the <em>toricern. </em>The-plaintiff in his bill expressly states it to be so; If is;no more than if the company had chosen to keep, a separate account of the profits arising from any particular article of merchandise. It is very common for merchants to open an account against flour, or rum, or tobacco, br wide, or any other article in which th\u00e9y have large dealings, y\u00e9t ho one ever thought that such an account .created a' <em>4ebU' </em>If this account against the jewelry store created a debt, it was Finl\u00e9y &amp; Lynn\u2019s debt to Finley fkLynn. The jewelry store was Finley &amp; Lynn\u2019s store. An account against the store was, therefore, an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>against Finley &amp; Lynn. It was merely the right hand made debtor to the left.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-4\">Besides, it was cleany the intention of-the. parties that something should be given to Lynn in lieu of his share of the profits of the trade. If you give him the goods in the jewelry.store, and still make himdebtor for the goods, you give him nothing. He might as well have bought the goods elsewhere. The plaintiff in his bill <em>makes a merit </em>of having given up to the defendant the <em>whole jewelry </em>store, 'with the accession of <em>nearly </em>3,000 <em>dollars worth of </em>merchandise, and- the <em>whole profits </em>of that store to the amount of 2,500 dollars. This could not possibly have been the case if the defendant'was to be made debtor for those goods. Although a person is not bound in equity by- the admission of a principle of law, yet he is by the admission of a fact; and here is a clear admission of a fact, as to the understanding and the intention of the parties at'the time of the dissolution.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b255-11\">\n<em>March 7.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-5\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfQu\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The plaintiff and defendant had been copartners in trade, and had carried on their business'; in two stores ; the one a jewelry store in the name of Lynn, to be conducted exclusively by, him; the other a hardware store in the name of Finley &amp; Lynn, to be under the joint management of the partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Previous to the commencement of their partnership, Lynn had contracted a debt to Lemuel Wells &amp; Co. of New-York, for goods ordered for.\u00ab jeweliy store carried on by himself, which goods it was mutually agreed to transfer to the new concern, and the debt to Lemuel Wells. &amp; Co. should become a debt chargeable on th^ social fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In Fenruary, 1805, it was agreed to dissolve the co-partnership; and articles were entered into to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>effect on , the first day of March. . The terms' were,. \u201c that Adam Lynn shallwithdraw all the. property \u25a0put into the joint stock by him, and that be shall have the goods in the jewelry store, and all the debts due to that store, as a compensation in lieu of thfe profits arising from the. whole business; and the said Finley agrees to take, on his own account, the goods in the hardware store, and the . goods which are ordered, in the spring, and to indemnify the said Adam Lynnfropa all claims or demands upon the said' .concern, or which may .arise for goods now ordered, and not yet ' arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On the second oLM\u00e1rch, a bond of indemnity'wafe&gt; executed, the condition of which, after stating the dis-solution, proceeds thus <em>: On </em>which ' dissolution it was, among other things, agreed that the said Oliver P. Finley .should satisfy and pay all debts and con-' tracts due from, or entered into by, the said copartnership, or either of the said copartners, for of on account of or for the benefit of the said copartnership,- including., certain debts due from the said Adam Lynn for goods-by him ordered^ which have been received by the said copartnership, and also ail debts which may arise,from merchandise hereafter shipped to\u2019the said Concern, in-consequence of any order's heretofore made.-</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Now the condition of the above obligaticin, is-such, that if the .said . Oliver P. Finley shall -.veil and truly satisfy and' discharge all the,debts &lt;.nd contracts herein before described, so as to indemnify and save .harmless the said Adam Lynn from the payment of the same, andffrom \u2019 any suit or prosecution in law or equity for or on account, of the said debts and contracts, then this obligation to be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Some time- previous to the dissolution, an action-had been brought by Lemuel Wells &amp; .Co. against-' A'dam Lynn for the \u2022 recovery .of this ' debt which was then depending.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In December, 1806, Adam Lynn, for the first time,, claimed, under the bond of indemnity, the anaount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the. debt to. Lemuel^ Wells &amp; Co* and, payment being refused, instituted a suit on the bond. Supposing that no defence could be made at law, judgment was confessed, with a reservation of all equitable ob\u00ab jections to the payment. A bill, was then filed suggest\u00bb ing that the bond was executed by mistake, add in the confidence that it was in exact conformity with the articles, and praying that it might be restrained by the articles. Several extrinsic circtimsfances are also detailed and. relied upon as demonstrating that Lynft himself did not suppose, until so informed by counsel, that the bond comprehended this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">An injunction was granted which, on the coming in of\"the answer, was dissolved, and, on a final hearings the bill was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The answer denies all the allegations of the hill VrhicH go to the. mistake under which the bond was executed; insists that it conforms to the true meaning \u00f3f the articles and intent of the parties; and endeavours to explain those extrinsic circumstances on which th\u00a9' plaintiff relied. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">. That a bond, executed in pursuance of articles, may be restrained by those articles, if the departure from them be clearly shown, is, not to be controverted. But in this case, jthe majority of the court is of .Opinion that no such departure is manifested with sufficient clearness to justify .the interposition of a court of equity. .</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">By the articles of copartnership, the de t to Lemuel Wells &amp; Co. was assumed by th.e firm, \u00a9f Finley &amp; Lynn, and was payable out of the partnership fond* It is true that, at law, it did not constitute \u00e1 demand against the partnership, but the court is jnuch inclined to the opinion, that, had Lynn become insplvent, a suit in equity might have be'en sustained, on this claim, against Finley &amp; Lynn.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">If it might in equity, though not in law, be a \u201c claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>or demand upon the concern,\u201d there does not appear to be such a repugnancy between the bond and the articles as to induce the court to say that the bond,, which, so far its is shown in this, cause, was executed without imposition, and with a knowledge of its contents, binds the obligors further than they intended to be bound. The extrinsic circumstances relied on are certainly entitled to much consideration; but they, are not thought sufficiently decisive and unequivocal in their character to justify a court Of equity in restraining legal rights acquired under a solemn contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Though this is the principal object of the bill, it may be understood to contemplate something further. . It prays for a settlement of all accounts, and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">So far as the accounts between the. parties are closed by' the. articles of dissolution, no reason car' be assigned for opening th\u00e9m. But if rights, growing out of those articles, require a settlement, the plaintiff is entitled to ap account.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">By a majority of the court it is conceived that if any profits had arisen on the jewelry store, independent of the goods oh hand and of the debts due to the store, the plaintiff is entitled to them.. It is not probable that there are such profits ; but it is very possible that there may be. Large sums of money may have been received, and might either be on hand when the dissolution took place, or have been diverted to various uses. If such be the fact, the majority of the court is of opinion that any fair construction of the articles gives those profits to the plaintiff. The contract is,, that. Adam Lynn shall have \u201c the goods in the jewelry store, and all the debts due to that store, as a compensation in lien of the profits arising from the <em>whole business. \u25a0' </em>Now the profits of the jewelry store, if any, not existing in debts or goods, were certainly a part of the \u201c profits of the whole business,\u201d and ar\u00e9, \u2022consequently \u00bf yielded to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">That this was the deliberate intention of the defend-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ant, is avowed in his answer. A proposition for a dissolution was, he says, made by him in writing and accepted by the plaintiff. That proposition is, \u201c that the defendant should have the merchandise in the jewelry store, and the debts due to that, store, as a compensation in lieu of the profits of the whole bus? - ness; that the complainant should hold the merchant dise in the hardware store, and the debts due to it, <em>end\u25a0 the profits of the trade</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">Now the profits of the jewelry store are certainly a part of the ^ profits of the trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The plaintiff also claims a debt said to be due <em>ftoxa </em>the jewelry store to the hardware store.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">As all the debts due to the hardware store are obviously assigned to Finley, this debt becomes his property, unless his claim to it is relinquished by the undertaking to pay all debts due from the concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The words of this undertaking are to be looked for in the condition of his bond. He is to- \u201c satisfy and pay all debts and contracts due from, or entered into by, the said copartnership, or either of the said copartners,, for or on account of or for the benefit of the said Copartnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The terms of this stipulation appear to the court to be applicable to claims upon the copartnership, and not to claims of a part of the company on the other part. He is to satisfy and pay all debts and contracts due fyom, or entered into by, the said copartnership, not to release the claim of one store upon the other. This is a claim which did not exist upon the copartnership, and which grows out of the articles of dissolution. Those articles assign'to the plaintiff ali the profits of the hardware store, as well as the debts due to it. They separate what was before united. They draw the distinction between the hardware and the jewelry store, and make the debt -due to the hardware store a part of the profits of that store.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The residue of the condition does not affect tjje question, and need not'be recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">It is, then, the opinion of a majority of the court that, if there was really a debt due from the jewelry store to the hardware store, Finley is entitled to that debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">This is a proper subject for an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The plaintiff has probably not applied for this account in the court below, and it. does not. appear to be a principal object of his bill. This court, therefore, doubted whether it would be most proper to affirm the -decree dismissing the bill with the addition that it should be without prejudice to any future claim for profits, and for the debt due from one store to the other, or to open the decree and direct the account. The latter was deemed the more equitable course. The decree, therefore, is-to be reversed, and the cause remand* ed, with directions to take an account between the two .stores, and an account of the profits of the jewelry-store, if the same shall be required by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Todd, J. concurred in the opinion of the court that the debt of <em>Wells &amp; Co. </em>was a debt to be paid by Finley, but he differed upon the other part of the case, being of opinion, that the complainant was not entitled to a relief which by his bill he had made a merit of Waiving. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"><em>Decree </em>reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to reinstate the injunction, and take an account, &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-12\"> Judge Johnson wan absent</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
