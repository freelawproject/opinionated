The cause .of action against Jamesson only- isi merged in the judgment; not' the joint cause of action against Mandeville &amp; Jamesson. The reason why the cause of action merges in the judgment is, that the party has obtained a remedy of a higher nature against his debtor. But a judgment against .Jamesson gives no remedy against Mandeville.- The plaintiff could not.lose his remedy upon the note against Mandeville until he.had obtained another remedy of a higher nature against him. This he has not obtained, and, therefore, has not lost his remedy upon the note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-3\">In the former action the declaration does not state it to be a <em>joint </em>note. If it had, there might perhaps be some doubt. But it was sued as the separate note of Jamesson. If the note had been in terms <em>joint and several, </em>a judgment against one would- not have been a bar to a subsequent action upon the note against the other. '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-4\"><em>Youngs </em>and <em>C. </em>Lee, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">The contracts made by copartners are joint, and not <em>several. </em>It is true that tbe effect of a; judgment is <em>several, </em>that is, the execution may be served on both, or either of the defendants; but that does not alter the nature of the <em>contract.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">In joint contracts, both are bound, or neither is bound. If one be discharged, the other is discharged; a release to pne is a release to both. If the contract be destroyed, or vacated, as to one, it js as to the other also. When it has once passed into a judgment it is extinct; a plaintiff may.if-he pleases sue only one of the copartners, arid if the defendant does not plead in abatement, the action may be maintained; and if the plaintiff obtains a judgment against one he cannot have another action upon the; same original cause' of action against the othe.r. This would, enable the plaintiff to split and multiply actions at his pleasure. Upon a joint cause of action you cannot have <em>several </em>judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ments as you can in trespass, although the defendants-should plead severally,</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-4\">If a not\u00e9 he given for a precedent debt, you cannot have an action on the original cause of action, unless you can prove the note to be lost. 1 <em>Johns. </em>36. 4 <em>Esp.

Mandeville a defendant to the first suit. It ought at least to have stated that the plaintiff did not know that Mandeville was a partner at the time of, obtaining the judgment against Jamesson. .if the plaintiff has any remedy, it must be in equity. If there-can be a remedy at i\u00e1w, it must be upon a very special action on the case, setting forth all the circumstances,</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">If the plaintiff had at first an option to sue for goods sold abd delivered, or upon the note, he has made his election to sue on the note, and having prosecuted that suit to judgment, he cannot afterwards' sue for the goods sold and delivered. A man cannot have two judgments for the same cause of action. If the note did'not destroy the right of action for goods sold, yet a judgment upon that note does.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-10\">A written instrument cannot-be contradicted by par\u00f3! evidence, The note purports to he the separate note of Jamesson, To show that it was. a joint note is to contradict the tenor of the instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-11\">If the defendants in a joint action of <em>assumpsit </em>sever in their pleas, this does not make it a separate action against each: and if the plaintiff does not show a joint cause of action against both, he cannot recover against either, Tnere could be no doubt that' itw.ould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>be a good-plea for Jamesson to say that the plain-tiff had already recovered a- judgment, against him upon the same cause of action,' which judgment .was still in force. And a plea that would discharge James-son would discharge Mandeville also, because the plaintiff having declared upon a <em>joint </em>cause of action . must prove it as-laid; and if he had .no cause of action against Jamesson, as well.as against Mandeville, he had no joint cause of action as laid in his declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-4\"><em>Jones, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7z\">A judgment against <em>one </em>severally, upon a joint cause of action is no bar to a subsequent action attains!, the others, upon the same cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">A note given by <em>one, </em>for ? precedent debt due by <em>two, </em>is <em>nudum pactum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\"><em>A </em>note cannot be a <em>satisfaction </em>of a precedent debt, unless payment be actually made of the note. 2 <em>Cro. </em>152. 5 <em>Co. </em>119. <em>Whelpdale's </em>case. 14 <em>Vin. </em>607. 6 <em>Co. </em>40. b. <em>Cro.

Afterwards, supposing the other defendant Mandeville to be a secret partner, he instituted a-suit against Mandeville. and Jamesson. The declaration contains .three counts. The. first is on the note, and charges it to have been made by the defendants under the name, firm and style of Robert B. Jamesson. . The 2d and 3d counts are for goods,'wares and merchandise sold and delivered to the defendants, trading under the firm of Robert B. Jamesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The defendant Mandeville pleads two pleas in bar. The-first goes to. the whole declaration, and'the second applies only to the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The first commences,with a protestation that the goods, See. in the declaration mentioned were not sold to the defendants jointly, and. then pleads in bar the promissory note which is averred to have been given and received for, and in discharge o'f, an account for sundry goods, wares and merchandise, sold and delivered to the said Jamesson, and that the goods in the declaration mentioned are the same which were sold and' c\u00ede\u00bb \u2019 livered-t\u00f3 the said Jamesson, and for which-the said \u25a0 note was given. The plea also avers, that a suit was . .instituted and judgment obtained on the note, and concludes in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The second plea pleads the judgment -in bar of the action.'</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">To the first plea the plaintiff demurs specially, and assigns for cause-of demurrer,</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">1. That the defendant does not ir\u00e1verse the <em>assumpsit </em>laid in .the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">2. That he does not expressly confess or deny that the goods, &amp;c. were sold avid delivered to the defend--, ants, trading under,the firm of R. B. Jamesson, pr that the note was given by the said firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>3. Because an unsatisfied judgment against James-son is no bar to an action against Mandeville.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">4. It is not averred that the judgment has be'en satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">5. The defendant does not deny or admit that he assumed to pay for the goods, &amp;c., in the declaration ihentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">6. Because, the plea'is no answer to the declaration, or any count thereof, and is informal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The defendant joins in demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">To the second plea the plaintiff also demurs specially, and assigns, for cause of demurrer, the same, in, substance, which had been assigned to the- first plea, and the defendant joins in the demurrer to this plea likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The other defendant, Jamesson, has put in no plea, nor are there any proceedings against him subsequent . to the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Although the first plea is not expressly limited to the 2d and 3d counts, yet it would, seem, from its' terms, to be intended to apply to the'm. alone. It sets up a bar to an action on an <em>assumpsit </em>for goods, wares,, and merchandise sold and delivered, and no such <em>.assumpsit </em>is laid ih the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">If,-however, it be considered a? pleaded to the first count, it is clearly ill on demurrer. For it does not deny or avoid the joint <em>assumpsit </em>laid in that' couht.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">It remains to inquire whether-this plea contains'\u00bb sufficient bar to the 2d and 3d .counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">The plea, is, that the note was given <em>and received </em>for, and in discharge.of, an account or bill for goods, wares and merchandise sold and delivered by the plaintiff to Robert B. Jamesson, which \u00e1re the same goods, &amp;c, that are mentioned in the -plaintiffs declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Th\u00e1t a note, without a special contract, would apt, \u00b0f itself, discharge the- original cause of aption, is not denied. But it is insisted that if, by express agreement, the note is received as payfn\u00e9nt, it satisfies the original contract, and the party receiving it must 'take his remedy on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">This principle appears to be well settled. The note \u25a0of one of the parties or of a third person may, by agreement, be received in payment. The doctrine of <em>nudum pactum </em>does no.t apply to such a case; for a man may, if such be bis will, discharge his debtor without any consideration. But,- if it did apply, there may be inducements to Cake a note from one partner liquidating and evidencing a claim on a firm which might be a sufficient consideration for discharging the firm. Since, then, the plaintiff has not taken issue on the averment that the. note was given and received in discharge of the,account; but has demurred, to the plea, that fact is admitted; and, being admitted, it bars the action for the goods.'</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The special causes of demurrer which are assigned do not, in any manner, affect the case. Whether the promise was made by Mandeville,- or not, ceases, to be material, if a note has been received in discharge of that promise, and the payment of the note need not be averred, since its non-payment cannot revive the extinguished <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">fbe next subject of consideration is the second plea, which applies simply to the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">That count is on a note charged to have bisen made by Mandeville and Jamesson, trading under the firm of Robert B. Jamesson. This, not being denied, must be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The plea is, that a judgment was rendered on this note against Robert B. Jamesson..</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Were it admitted that this judgment bars'an action against Robert B. Jamesson, the inquiry still remains, if Mandevillp was originally bound; if a suit could be originally maintained against him; is the note, as to him, also - merged in tne judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">. Had the action, in which judgment was obtained against Jamesson, been brought against the firm, the-whole note would most probably have merged in that judgment. But that action was not brought against the firm. It was brought against Robert' Brown Jamesson singly, and whatever other objections- may be made to any subsequent proceedings on the same note, it cannot be correctly said that it is -carried into judgment, as respects Mandeville. If it were, the judgment ought in some manner to bind him, which, most certainly it does not. The doctrine of merger (even admitting that a judgment against one of several joint obligors would terminate the whole obligation, so that a distinct action could not afterwards be maintained against the others,, which is not admitted) can be-applied only to a case in which the.original declaration was on a joint covenant, not to a case in which the declaration in the first suit was on a sole contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Irt point of real justice there can be no reason why( an unsatisfied judgment against Jamesson should bar a claim upon Mandeville ; and it- appears to the court\" that this claim is not barred by any technical rule of law, since the proceedings in the first action were instituted upon the <em>assumpsit </em>of Jamesson individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It is not necessary to decide whethei ...;s action -could have been maintained against Mandeville singly with an averment that the note was made by Mandeville and Jamesson. The declaration being against both partners, that question does not arise. The ' declaration is clearly good in itself, and the plaintiff may recover under it, unless he be barred by a sufficient plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Admitting, for the present, that a previous judg- . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ment against J\u00e1messon would be a sufficient- bar, as to him, had Jamesson and Mandeville joined in the same plea,, it would -have presented an inquiry of some intricacy, How far the benefit of that bar could be extended to Mandeville.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">But they have not joined in the same plea. J hey have severed ; and as the whole note is not merged in a judgment obtained against Jamesson, on his individual assumpsit, the court is not of opinion that Mandeville has so pleaded this matter as to bar the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In this plea it was necessary to negative the averment of the declaration, that the note was made by Mandeville as well as-Jamesson, or to show that the judgment was satisfied. The. defendant .has not done so. He has only stated affirmatively new matter in bar of the action, which new matter, as stated, does not furnish a sufficient bar. It is not certain that this plea would have been good on a general demuribut on a special demurrer it is clearly ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The judgment, therefore', is to be reversed, and, ap no other plea is pleaded,'judgment must be rendered, on the first count, in favour 'of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The judgment of the court was as follows 2 This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record; and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof the court is of opinion, that there is error in the judgment of the circuit court in overruling the demurrer to the first plea, so far as the same is pleaded- in bar of the first count in the declaration, and-that there is\" error in overruling the demurrer to the second plea; wherefore it is considered by this court, that the judgment of the circuit court be revers\u00e9d and annulled, and that the cause be remanded to the circuit court, with directions to sustain the demuifer,. to the-first plea so far as the same is pleaded- in bar of the first count, in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and also to sustain the demurrer to. the second plea, and to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>judgment in favour of the plaintiff on nis said first count, and to award a writ of inquiry of damages.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-5\"> After the opinion was given, C. <em>liet </em>moved for a direction to the court below to allow a plea \u00f3f non <em>assumpsit. </em>The court said they had never given directions respecting amendments, hut had left that question to' the court below. This court cannot now undertake to say whether the court below would be justified in granting leave to amend.,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
