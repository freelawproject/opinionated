To which direction the defendants objected, and prayed the court if they gave the jury any instruction upon the subject, to direct them to find the smaller sum in damages, if the court should be of opinion that it was competent for the jury to hear evidence concerning the mis-' representation as to the agey built,- and tonnage of the Vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-4\">. But the court refused to give the instruction prayed by the defendants, having before retused to suffer -the defendants to give evidence of misrepresentation by the plaintiff in obtaining the policy, under either of tile issues of fact joined in this cause, to which refusal the defendants had taken a bill of exceptions. But the plaintiff having consented to permit the defendants to give evidence' of the real value of the vessel' at the ' time the risks insured commenced, (saving the objection to the competency of any parol evidence upon, any of the said issues of fact, concerning the real value of the said subject insured,)- the court directed the jury \u2022to find their verdict as prayed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">To which refusal and instruction the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The jury found a verdict in the form directed by the court, and filled the first blank with the sum of 11,452 dollars and 34 cents, and the other with the sum of 6,441 dollars and 71 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">The court, after consideration., rendered judgment for the largest sum, being of opinion that the value stated in the policy was conclusive between \u2019the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">The\u2018defendants brought their writ of error,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-9\"><em>C. </em>Lee, for the plaintiffs in <em>error.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-10\">1.

Ferrer's </em>case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">The court ought,to have received evidence of fraud and misrepresentation upon the first issue, which was in the nature of a general issue. The plea might perhaps have been adjudged bad upon.demurrer; but it is aided by the joinder of issue upon it, and every thing which'could show that the defendants were riot bound by their covenant to do any thing, was admissible upon this issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\"><em>System of Pleading, </em>321. 5 <em>Com.

The contract of insurance' is only a contract for indemnity; and if, upon a total loss, the insured receive the full value of the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>insured, it is all that he can in equity and good faith require. 4 <em>Burr. </em>1966. <em>Da Costa </em>v. <em>Perth. </em>Cowp. 583. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Parkinson.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-5\">In this very case this court has intimated an opinion that the misrepresentation might tie a subject, of consideration in-inquiring of damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">Upon a total loss, \u00a1the value stated in the' policy is' only <em>prima facie </em>evidence. <em>Marshall, </em>1 O, 111. 199. 612. 701. 3 <em>Atk. </em>554. <em>Sadlers\u2019 Company </em>v. <em>Babcock.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">The court ought to have admitted the deposition of Murray to be read froVn the record of the vice-admiralty'. By the British treaty the whole proceedings are made evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-9\">The court also erred in rendering judgment upon the verdict for the larger sum. It was competent for the jury to hear evidence ol the real value ot the vessel, and to assess damages accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-10\">Swann, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-11\">The court below committed no error in rejecting the 9th and 10th pleas. They were offered after the cause nad been remanded from this court. There will be no end to delay, if the party be permitted to amend after judgment against him upon a writ of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-12\">As a matter, of discretion also, the court did right in rejecting the 9th plea. They ought not to have indulged the defendants with filing a plea at that late stage of .the cause, which tendered the same issue which, they had refused to join when tendered by the plaintiff in his replication to the 6th plea. Besides, the matter of the plea was covered by the implied warranty of seaworthiness; for if the-facts stated in the plea were at all material, -they must have been so only in regard to the ability of the veSsr\u00bb to perform the voy'age.. The substance of this plea was therefore included in the issue of seaworthiness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-13\">The admission or rejection of a plea after an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>is joined, is not an error for which' jhe. judgment can reversed. It is a mere matter of discretion; the can have no legal ground' to insist upon it. <em>7 Term </em>Rep. <em>703. </em>I\u2019he principle that this court will' not reverse a judgment for a proceeding in the court below which was within its discretion, has been decided, \u25a0in regard to the, continuance of causes, and the granting new trials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\">If it be a case in which a writ of ef ror lies, still ntf ef fon was co.m mltted by*the court in the exercise of its discretion in rejecting the IOth plea. It. is ncft a direct allegation of fraud, nor does it aver that.any damage was sust\u00e1iVied by th\u00e9 defendants in consequence of the fraud* . The plea is not sufficiently explicit in -charging' the Fraud; it does not state in what,particulars theiraud consisted. Neither of the pleas coif'd be considered as a fair plea to the merits. They must have produced demurrers, and additional delay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">There Was no error' in rejecting\" the \u2019evidence of he facts stated in the 9th and'IOth pleasvbecause th\u00e9rei-as no'issue to which- those-facts could apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvR\">' The piea that the defendants had performed all that they were <em>bound </em>to perform must be considered as aa averment of a matter of fact, not of a matter of la.Wi' The tinly act Which the def\u00e9nd\u00e1nts were bound, to perform was'to pay the miohey if a-loss happened.- The plea therefore amounts to an averment that they had paid the .money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">There was no error iti rejecting the copy' of Murray\u2019s deposition; for it! was not taken ' in the cause. \u2022 The plaintiff had no opportunity to cross-examine him. It. was entirely \u00e1n <em>ex parte </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">.There co\u00fcld,be no error in the direction given'by the court to the jury to find their damages in the alter-' native, or conditional manner; it is often done when a' question of law is to be.saved. It is a kind of special verdict. The error, if any, must have been in render-' ing the judgment,for the largest sum..</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The correctness of this judgment depends upon the question whether, it was competent for the jury, upon either of the issues, to hear parol evidence of the value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\">The policy 'was <em>sealed, </em>and subject to all the incidents-of a sealed iristrumerit at common law. The value agree.d upon by the parties, under seal, cannot be denied by parol evidence. 4 <em>Bac. </em>106. Salk. 276. 2 <em>Burr. </em>1171; <em>Lewis </em>v. Rucker. 4 <em>Burr. </em>2228. <em>Leave </em>v. <em>Peers.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">But even if it were a policy without seal, the agreed value in the policy would be conclusive.. <em>Park, </em>104. 267. 1167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">The agreed value is conclusive unless it appears to b'\u00e9 a cover.for a wager. An inquiry of the actual valu\u00e9 is never made upon a valued policy but with a view to ascertain whether it be a wager policy. There-is nof an instance in the English books of the agreed Value . ever being reduced to a smaller siim. Upon a total-loss, the, agreed value is to be recovered, or nothing. If this be not the case; and you. can go into the question of the actual value, every policy is reduced to an open policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">Suppose a man should, make a bad bargain, and purchaser vessel for 10,000 dollars, not worth 5,000. He insures, and it.is agreed that the vessel shall be valued at 10,000 dollars*. A total loss happens; shall he be obliged to receive only the value of the vessel to be ascertained by a jury ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">This is like every other case of liquidated damages ; if is conclusive between the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">As. to plea of fraud, if was too vague. The preee* dent cited from W entworth is- against them j the vessel irt that case Was stated to 'have been fraudulently <em>consumed by fire. </em>The case from Dallas is not relevant* The, case of Pollard and -Dwigpt is against them. The court ther\u00e9 ref\u00fcsed to direct the amendment t\u00f3 be made. The case from 1 <em>Wash. </em>313. was upon a. <em>special </em>demurrer, and it was most clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>justice of the case required the amendment.. It was a case clearty within the equity of the statute of jeofails. In the case from 7 <em>Term Rep. </em>703. the court did give leave to amend under the statute of jeofails, bi&gt;t it was in the exercise of its <em>discretion.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-5\"><em>E.

By that rejection the defendants were entirely shut Out from the benefit of these facts upon the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-8\">The misrepresentation was material to the <em>risks </em>of the voyage, aiid ev&lt;?ry such misrepresentation^ whether fraudulently or innocently made, destroys the policy. <em>Marshall, </em>335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">Fraud vitiates every contract, and may be examined into by a court of law.

That they had performed all things which, by the policy,, they W.ere bound to perform; 2. That the vessel insured was not -captured and condemned -as in the declaration is mentioned; and, 5. That the vessel insured was not seaworthy: on which pleas is s ues, vv'e taken by \u00a1the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">There were, also, five special pleas, to which there, were demurrers, all of which were allowed by the circuit court, except the one to the sixth plea, which, on a writ of error to this court, heretofore .brought, was allowed here, and the cause then remanded to the-circuit court,, for further proceedings to be had therein. - On the return of the cause to the circuit court, the defondants moved for leave to file,two additional pleas; Which motion was denied; and is-now relied on as one of the errors for which the present judgmen should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">This- court does not think that the, refusal of an inferior court to receive an additional plea, or to amend ohe already filed, can ev\u00e9r be assigned as error. This depends so much on the discretion of the court below, which must be regulated more by the particular circumstances of eyery case, than by any precise and known rule of law, and of which the superior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>can never become fully possessed, that there would be' \u2122ore- danger of injury in revising matters of this kind, than what might result now and then from an arbitrary or improper exercise of this discretion. It may be very hard not to grant a new trial, or not to continue a cause, but in neither case can the party be relieved by a writ of error: nor is the court apprized, that a refusal to amend or to add a plea was ever made, the subject of complaint in this way. The court, therefore, does not, feel itself obliged to give any opinion, on the conduct of the inferior court, in refusing to receive these pit-as. At the same time, it has no difficulty in saying that, even in that stage of the proceedings, the circuit court might, if it had thought proper, have received these additional pleas, or admitted of any amendment in those already filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The court below having refused to receive these pleas, the trial proceeded on the three on which issues were joined; and the defendants offered, under them, or some of them, to prove that it was one of the rules of their office, that every order for insurance shall contain as full a description as can be given of the age, tonnage, and equipment of the vessel ; and that it was always their practice to make no insurance on a vessel beyond her reasonable value, according to the representation given of her age, tonnage, and equipment; and that such rule.was known to the plaintiff; and that, to induce them to insure -eight thousand dollars on the brig Hope, the plaintiff represented her as a stout, well built vessel of about 250 tons burden, and from six to seven years old, and that she was worth ten thousand dollars; in consequence of which, they insured her tor eight thousand dollars; that, on the contrary, she was not a well built- vessel of 250 tons burden, and was not from six to seven-years old, but was more\"than eight- and a half years old, and had been ill built; and that this difference between her true and her represented built, age, and tonnage, was material to the risks of the voyage insured. This evidence, being objected to, was deemed inadmissible.;'and this court is now called on to say whether, in this opinion, there was any error,.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>However desirable it maybe td admit in evidence, on th.e general issue in an a'ction of covenant oh a policy . of insurance, every thing which may avoid the-contract, or lessen the damages, as is done in actions on the case,' this court does not know that it possesses the power of changing the law of pleading, or to admit of evidence inconsistent with the forms which it has prescribed. No rule oh this sjibject is more - inflexible than that, in actions on deeds, all special matter qf defence must be pleaded, ' Of this rule it is very certain,,from a.mere inspection of the record^ that the defendants cannot alleg\u00e9 ignorance. If every thing, then,, which is relied Or\u00ed to avoid a contract under seaUmust'.be: pleaded, it .will, at once, be conceded'1 that nobe of the; matter of. fere'd'in evidence .applied to either of the-pleas/.- The defendants could not1, thus' set up an \u00e9xc\u00fase- for-not doing'that which, by one of the pleas, they professed to have-done ; ancT, sis to the other pleas, Which-denied the capture \u00e1nd : seaworthiness of -,the vessel, it will .not be pretended that any of this matter supported either of them. \u2022 The' same remarks- apply to the second and third bills of- exception.'' Neither -fraud npr misrepresentation, as to the value of the vessel, or her age, or'tonnage, could be received in evidence, -under \u25a0either of these -issues, ho more than infancy or cover* ture, on a plea of <em>non est factum; </em>for, most certainly, nohe of the matters here offered by the defendants, the rejection of which occasioned these exceptions, .went, ip any- degree, to prove either of the pleas on which isr sue had been joined..</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The fourth exception is to the refusal of-the court to admit the deposition of William Murray, which appeared among the admiralty proceedings,/and-which was offered by the- defendants to prove that the vessel was not in the due course of her voyage When she was captured, and the condition she was in, at1 the time of capture. As the defendants have not, iii either of their. \u2022pleas, relied on a deviation, itinay be doubted whether any evidence of that feet were admissible; but, if it were proper, for the purpose of discrediting any testimony which had been offered'by the plaintiff, to show where the Hope had been taken, it is not thought that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that the deposition Murray was not competent evidence t\u00ae prove that fact. If all the proceedings in the admirally had been read by the plaintiff without any pre. vious agreement, on' the part of the defendants, to save every objection to their contents, excepting the matter of authentication, the court will not say that the defendants might not have insisted on using any deposition, among the papers, which made in their favour: but, as' the plaintiff could have read them for-no other purpose than to prove the libel and condemnation, and must have attempted to prove no other fact by them, for which . purpose it is expressly stated that they were offered, and .as the defendants had, by their agreement, explicitly reserved to themselves every objection to their contents, it does not appear reasonable to permit them to select a deposition, as evidence \u00a3 them, while the -plaintiff could not have madeu\u201ee of that, or any other, if ever so favourable to himself. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in the instruction which it gave to the jury on this subject.' This court cannot forbear remarking here, that it can never be necessary, in order to prove a condemnation, to produce any thing more than the libel and sentence; although it is a frequent but useless practice to'read the proceedings at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The fifth exception is taken to a refusal of the circuit court to direct the jury to find.damages for the value of the vessel, as agreed in the policy, and, conditionally,.for her actual v\u00e1lue, if, in the' opinion of the court, it was competent for the jury, urider any of the issues joined, to inquire jnto the real value of the vessel. As it had already been decided, and, as this court thinks, correctly, to receive no evidence of the real value of the vessel, there was no error in refusing to. give this direction : and, although the' plaintiff, at length, consented to permit the defendants to give evidence of the real value of the- vessel, saving objections to the competency of such evidence, upon any of the issues of fact, and the jury, thereupon, found conditional damages, this court is of opinion that, as evidence of the real value of the vessel, under any of these issues, was incompetent, and as objections to its competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>were saved to the plaintiff, the circuit court did right in giving judgment for the damages found by the jury, according to the value of the vessel, fixed in the policy; which judgment this court affirms with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
