The deed of'Cession ought to have been under the plaintiff\u2019s seal, or a power of attorney, under seal, should be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-13\">3.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-4\">In a mercantile tr\u00e1nsaeti\u00f3n no instrument under seal is necessary. The letter is found which states the fact of abandonment, and the jury find the agency of Dannenberg. The letter states the authority of Bot rstler, and the jury have found his authority. This throws the burden of proof on the other side. The deed of cession from Dannenberg states that he acts for Stark, and as his attorney.. The jury find that it was done.by Dannenberg <em>for </em>Stark. It was not necessary that .the deed should have been executed in the name of Stark. It is as well ifc it be signed by Dannenberg, as his agent or attorney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">After the, abandonment Parker became the agent of the underwi' :ers, who were then the owners. It is a general print pie that all acts \u2022 done <em>bona fide </em>for the best interest d,r all concerned, are the acts of the underwriters, aftdr a rightful abandonment. The assured cannot then revoke ; nor can the underwriters throw back the property, without the consent.of the assured.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>Martin, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">The question is, whether the assured can <em>elect </em>by-attorney to abandon. Parker could not be considered as the agent of the underwriters, in doing an act which <em>could </em>not benefit them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-8\">The plea of <em>non infregit </em>was decided, before the statute of jeofails, to be an informal, but not an immaterial plea. 1 <em>Sid. </em>83. 1 <em>Lev. </em>290. It would have been bad upon special demurrer, but it is aided by the ver- . diet. No other form of pleading has ever been used in Maryland, upon a sealed policy.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>March </em>14.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-5\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azm\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On the principal question in this case the cpurt can entertain no doubt.' On the capture of the'Minerva, the right to abandon was complete, and this right was exercised during her detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The objections to the form of .the abandonment are not 'deemed substantial. The agent who made the insurance might certainly be crt dited, and, in transactions of this kind, always is credited, when he declares that, by the order of his principal,' he abandons to the underwriters. In this case, the jury find .that the abandonment was made for the plaintiff; and tljis finding\u2019 establishes that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The informality of the deed of cession is thought unimportant, because, if the abandohment was unexceptionable, the property vested immediately, in the. underwriters, and the deed was not essential toffhe right of either party. Had it been demanded andlrjsfosed, that circumstance might have altered the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">If the abandonment was legal, it put the underwriters completely in the place of the assured, and Parker became their agent. When, he contracts on behalf of the owners, of the goods, he. contracts on behalf of the underwriters, who have become owners, not on behalf of Stark, who has ceased to be one. His act is no\u2019 longer the act of Stark, and is m \u2019 to b\u00e9 consi- ' dered as an interference, on his part, which may affect the abandonment. If any particular instructions bad been given on this subject, if any act of ownership ' had been exerted by Stark himself, such conduct might be construed into a relinquishment of an abandonment which had not been accepted ; but as nothing of'the kind exists, the act of the- supercargo is to be considered as the act of the persons interested, whoever they may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The only point which' presents any difficulty in the opinion of the court, is the objection founded on the omission, in the verdict, to find that the abandoninent was made in reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The law is settled that an abandonment, to be effectual, must be made in reasonable time ; 'but what time is reasonable is a question compounded of fact and law, which has- not yet been reduced to such certainty as to enable the court to pronounce upon i% without the aid of a jury. Certainly the delay may be so great as to enable every man to declare, without hesitation, that it is unreasonable, or the abandonment may be so immediate, that all will admit it to have been made .in reasonable time : but there may be such a tmedium between these extremes, as to render it doubtful whether the delay has been reasonable or otherwise. If it was a mere question of law which the court might decide,'then .the law would determine, to a day or an hour, on the time left for dt liberation, 'after receiving notice of the loss. But the law has not so determined, and it therefore remains a question compounded of fact and law, which must be found by a jury under the direction of the court.-</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In this case the jury have found an abandonment, but have not found whether it was made in- due time or otherwise. The fact is, therefore, found defectively ; and for that reason a <em>venire facias de novo </em>must be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">It may . not be amiss to remark that tbe judicial ppinions which we generally find in the books, on these subjects, are usually given by way of instruction to tbe jury, or on a motion for a new trial, not on special verdicts. The distinction between the cases deserves consideration,.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded, with direction to award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
