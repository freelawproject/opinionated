Wheth\u00e9r the endorsement on the said process of subpoena would, after service thereof, create any legal impediment to the payment of the money over to the said Johnston by the said Bryan Hampson, and would, in case of such payment after service, make, the' said Bryan Hampson personally liable for the amount-'so paid over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">\u201c If the court should be of opinion that the said marshal was not bound to have served the said process, if in his power to do so at any time previous to the 20th of June, 1805, (unless he was specially required by the plaintiff to serve the same, notwithstanding die received the same as marshal on the day on Which the said process issued,) then the judgment is to be rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">\u201c And if, under the circumstances mentioned in the second question, the court should be of opinion, that the said Bryan Hampson would not be personally liable for the amount so' paid over,. and that his not being personally liable would be sufficient to discharge the marshal from any liability in this case, then judgment is to be rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">\u201c But if both those questions are decided for the plaintiff, then judgment upon the verdict is to be ren-. dered for him.\u201d . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">The court below, was of opinion that the statement of the case was not full enough to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, and directed'judgment tobe entered up for the defendant; whereupon the plaintiff brought, his writ of error..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Swann, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-4\">The marshal is bound to serve all process put into bis hands fot service, as soon as possible, and if he does not, he is liable, in a special action on the case, to any party who suffers any injury by his neglect. <em>Bac.

If there should be a decree against him he could not avoid it by showing that he paid away the money after notice. The decree would relat\u00e9 back to the time of notice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-6\"><em>E.

The marshal is not bound to serve process as soon \u00e1s he pan by any pqssibility serve it, which was the principle which the court below was called upon, by the case stated, to sanction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-8\">It is sufficient in such' a case as this, if he serve it at any time before the return day. The endorsement is no part of the process. The marshal was not bound to serve <em>that,, ox </em>to give notice of it to the defendant. AH that he was commanded to do was to summon the defendant to answer the bill according to the command of. the subpoena. The endorsement was a mere private notice. It might have been served by any person, and would have been as obligatory upqn Hampson as if served by the marshal. This was the opinion of <em>Chancellor Wythe, </em>in the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Fulton.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b199-9\"><em>February </em>28.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b199-10\">Marshall, Ch.
