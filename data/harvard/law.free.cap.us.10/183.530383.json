At the July term, \u00cd 808, his \u2022 death was suggested,and a <em>scire jactas </em>awarded against I. G. Ladd, his administrator. At the July term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>1809,. .(being the fpurth term after the office judgment,) Ladd appeared; by his. attpmeyj, and offered tp plead \u00e1 special plea of <em>plene apmihistravit, </em>by himself, as administrator of Craig, to which the plaintiff objected, but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the plea to be filed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ae5\">In all cases \u00aef reversal, if this court direct the court' below to'enter judgment for the <em>plaintiff </em>in error, the court below will, of course, enter the judgment .with the costs of that court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">The sjtbstance .of the- plea was, that Craig had made a deed of trust of'certain <em>real </em>estate, fo secure L\u00e1dd for his endorsements, for Craig at the bank, by which deed . Craig covenanted to indemnify Ladd. That Ladd had endorsed the notes of \u00a1Craig to the amount of \u00bf,000 dollars, which were discounted at the bank, and continued the endorsements to the time of Craig?s death.

T,hat the estate, mentioned in the deed of trust, having been sold, producedonly 4,095'dollars, whereby the estate of-Craig became indebted-to Ladd hi the sum of 5,138 dollars,, and so much of t,he? estate of Craig is liable to be retained by1 Ladd in satisfaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">That Craig was bound to several other creditors by . specialties in large sums, amounting.to 10,000-,dollars, and suits thereupon have, been brought -against Ladd, apd are now pending; that he has in his hands personal estate of Craig to the amount of960 dollars only, which is liable tp be retained by him in satisfaction of the damage h,e has sustained by his endorsements for Crpig, by virtue of the covenant for his indemnification, and to pay the specialty creditors aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">To this plea the plaintiff replied the -office judgment and writ of inquiry awarded against Craig\u2019in hie life-time in this suit ; the subsequent death of Craig, and the scire <em>facias </em>against Ladd, \u00e1s his administrator, returnable to November term, 1\u201980'\u00bf. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">The defendant rejoined that Craig diedion the day ofin the year 1807.-/ '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>To this'rejoinder the plaintiff demurred, and as signed as cause of demurrer, that the rejoinder is no answer to the replication, and is a departure from the.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-3\">. The court beloiy being of opinion that the plea was good, and the replication bad, rendered judgment upon the demurrer for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">The plaintiff sued out his writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-5\">E. <em>J. Lee, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">1. That the office judgment against Craig in his life-time, is a debt superior in dignity to the debts stated in the plea; and,</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\">2. That the defendant, coming in upon <em>scire judas, </em>can only plead such plea as his intestate could have;, pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-8\">1. The office judgment was regularly obtained agreeably to the act of assembly of Virginia, <em>P. P. </em>80. \u00a7 36. Arid according to the forty-second section of the same act, it became final after the ne$t succeeding court, it not having then been set aside. It being an action of <em>debt, </em>the judgment was not interlocutory, but final. 3 <em>Bl. </em>Com. 395. 1 <em>Tidd, </em>508. .Being a final judgment in the life-time of Craig, it is entitled to apriority of payment before specialty debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-11\">2. But if it was only an interlocutory judgment, yet; the <em>defendant', </em>upon the <em>scire facias, cov\\d ftettd </em>nothing but what the intestate could have pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-12\">The act of assembly of Virginia, <em>P. P. </em>HO. \u00a720. is copied almost <em>verbatim.' </em>from the English <em>statute of 8 and </em>9 <em>W. </em>III. c. 11; and is in these worqs;</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-13\">\u201c And if the defendant die after such interlocutory judgment, and before final judgment, such action shall not abate, if the same were originally maintainable against the executors or administrators of such defendant, but the plaintiff shall and may have a <em>scire facias </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>against his executors or administrator^ to show* cause w^&gt; <em>damages in such action should not be assessed </em>and recovered by the plaintiff, and if such .executors or admmjstrators shall appear at. the return of st\u00edch \u2022 writ, \u25a0 and <em>not show or allege any matters sufficient to arrest the final </em>judgment, &amp;c. a writ of inquiry of damages shall thereupon be awarded, which being executed, judgment final shall be given for the said plaintiff \u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-4\">After such interlocutory judgment the int\u00e9state could only allege matter in <em>arrest of judgment, </em>and his administrator can only do the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">Upon this point the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Harmon, 0 Mod. 142. </em>and 1 <em>Salk. </em>315. is decisive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-6\"><em>Swann, </em>contra;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqT7\">An <em>office </em>judgment in Virginia is a very different thing from an interlocutory judgment in England. It may be set aside, as a matter of right, by the defendant at the next succeeding court, and he may plead any matter whatever in the same manner as if no such judgment had been rendered. And by the long esta\u00bb, blishee! practice of Virginia, he may set it aside at <em>any subsequent </em>term, by pleading an issuable plea to. the merits. It is not true, therefore, that Craig could only have alleged matter in <em>arrest of judgment. </em>He might have-pleaded anything that went to show that the plaintiff ought not to r\u00e9cover judgment against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaA\">Upon the death of the defendant, and the appearance of his administrator, it becomes a new suit, and the administrator ought to be permitted to plead any thing that goes to show that the plaintiff ought not to recoVer judgment against <em>him.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">A debt founded upon a <em>devastavit </em>is not of so high dignity as a debt upon specialty.. It is in nature of damages for a <em>tort. </em>It is a claim depending upon proof of matter of fact <em>in pais.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>February </em>19. .</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-5\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZY\">delivered' the opinion, of. the spurt to the following effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The. act of assembly of Virginia, is copied almost literally from the.English <em>statute of </em>8 <em>and </em>9 <em>W. </em>III. c. 11. The case in 6 <em>Mod. </em>is a. decision expressly upon that statute, and is precisely in point, that the defendant upon the <em>scire.facias </em>can only plead what the intestate could have pleaded; and that it is not to be considered as a proceeding against the representative of die deceased, but a continuance of the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The plea is such as could not have been pleaded in the original action, and is therefore bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The judgment must be reversed, and the .emanded for the defendant to plead to me original action, if he should think proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">To a question by <em>E. J. Lee, </em>the Chief Justice answered, that \u2019if the plaintiff, in error should obtain a judgment in the court below, it will of course be <em>with costs. </em>So in all cases of reversal, if this court direct .the court\u2019 below to enter \u2022 judgment for the plaintiff in error, the court below will,.of course, enter the judgment with the costs of that court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A9M\"> The .court below considered this case as coming wit\u00fcin the act of congress, <em>vol Up </em>71. <em>passed </em>24 <em>th </em>1789, Authorizes the court <em>(t to </em>render judgment for or against the <em>executor </em>gr <em>adminisvr.qtor, </em>as the case may require.\u201d It does not appear whether that act. was taken into consideration by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
