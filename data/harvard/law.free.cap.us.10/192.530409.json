When a person ceased to be <em>assured </em>'he ceased to be a member, and was no longer liable to new calls. If the property of <em>Korn Wisemiller </em>had been destroyed by fire after the 27th of February, 1801, (the day of the separation of Alexandria-from Virginia,)-the society would not have Deen liable; <em>Korn &amp; Wisemiller, </em>therefore, cannot be liable for- a share of the losses which have happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>since that time. It was a fundamental principle of the charter, jthat the insurance should be mutual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-3\">The act of congress of the 27th of February, 1801, which adopts the laws of Virginia as the laws .of that part of the district of Columbia; does not aid the society, for the. law of Virginia authorized insurance to be made upon houses in Virginia only.. \"Any person might withdraw' from the company- by refusing to pay a quota, or by refusing tp accept a policy;</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-4\">Swann, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">The original charter gave the majority of the members a right to bind the residue, as well by alterations in the charter itself, as by rule's', by-laws and regulations ; a majority could accept a <em>new </em>charter, and thereby bind all the members.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">The cession of the district of Columbia did not destroy private rights; it only changed the political relation of the inhabitants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">JNo person' could \u2018 withdraw from the company otherwise than'by the-mode pointed out in the. act of Virginia, after giving the notice prescribed.- The suspension of the insurance- of .a' person refusing or neglecting to pay, his quota, is a mere penalty, he does not cease to be a member, he still remains h\u00e1ble for his share of the losses, notwithstanding the suspension of his own insurance;</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">.

That, by having omitted to revalue within seven, years, they were no longer insured, and, of conse-\u201d quence,.not liable to-'contribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">3. That, by the alteration of the charter in 1805, their security and liability became so. materially changed, as to discharge them from their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\"><em>4. </em>That their revaluation in 1805- ought .not \" to b\u00e9 obligatory upon them, because they were deluded into it by false or incorrect suggestions. .-</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">5. i nat they are \u2022 not liable, under, the' description of persons who.had'insured pVior to 1804, as they, ought to be. considered only as having insured at die time of their revaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">. Oh the first of these points, the court are of opini\u00f3n,' that the separation of Alexandria from, the state of. Virginia could have no -effect upon' existing contracts of-individuals. Such divisions of territory are entirely, political, a separation of jurisdiction takes place,but. private interests and private contracts remain unaffected, and every individual relation continues the same, except that of being associated under the same government. The circumstance, that the law of Virginia,, has limited the company to the bounds of the state,\u201d in performing its functions, could only prevent theai. from- making new' contracts subsequent to the separation, and until they had received additional powers,'. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>but could not release them from their liability to individuals with whom they had previously contacted. Nor can the circumstance of the' members of'the legislature being authorized to represent their respective counties, affect the case ; for, although the Alexandria property could no l\u00f3nger be represented in that mode, there was nothing to prevent their appearing' in person, or by proxy, at the meetings of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The court are further ot opinion, that all the other grounds assumed by the.plaintiffs are equally untenable. Although, at th\u2019e'first view, it would appear reasonable that he who-is not insured is not bound to. contribute, yet there may exist strong reasons, why, under the peculiar organization of this \u25a0 company, a different rule should be adopted ; and certain it is that the individual may, by his own act, subject himself \"to such a state of things. The liability of the members of this institution' is of a twofpld- nature. It results both from an obligation to conform to the law\u2019s of their own ma-1 ing, as members of the body politic, and from a particular assumption or declaration which every individual signs on b\u00e9coming a member. The latter is remarkably comprehensive. \u201c We will abide by, observe and adhere to the constitution, rules and regulations which'are already established, or may hereafter be established, by a majority of the insured present in person, or by representatives, or by the majority of the property insured, represented either by the persons themselves, or their proxy, duly. authorized, or their deputy, as established by }aw, at any general meeting to be held by the said assurance society, or which are, or may hereafter be, established by the -president and directors of the society.\u201d- It would be difficult to find words of more extensive signification than these, or better calculated to aid, explain and. enforce the gen\u00e9r\u00e1l principle, that, the majority of a corporate body must have power fo bind its individuals. It is true that the words of this declaration, as well as th\u00e9 general power of a corporate body, must be restricted by the nature- and object of its institution; but apply this rule - to the case'before us,, and it cannot avail the plaintiffs, for both the rule which suspends the secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>rity and the alteration made in its constitution, under a vote of the majority, are strictly Conformable to the general objects for which the company was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">We are of opinion that whilst Korn &amp; Wis\u00e9miller continued members of the society, they remain subject to the general liability which that state imposes <em>; </em>and that, after becoming members, their ceasing to be so must be determined by the rules of the society, which rules, as far as we are at present advised, admit of only two cases ; one is, where the house insured is consumed, by fire, and the otb,er, upon giving the notice, and conforming to the other regulations imposed by the by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It is observable that the rule which imposes the necessity of a septennial valuation of the property insured, does not contemplate a total rescission or annihilation of the contract; on the contrary, it is express in declaring that, upon a revaluation being made, the party shall continue insured by virtue of his former policy. We, therefore, consider this suspension of his security merely as a penalty imposed upon the'member for neglecting to conform to a rule of the society. And it is certainly much more reasonable that he should be subject to a loss or inconvenience fot his own neglect, than that he should be released from his liability to the society, in consequence of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">As to what is contended to be a material alteration in their charter, we consider it merely as a new arrangement or distribution of their funds and whether just or unjust, reasonable or unreasona&amp;le, beneficial or otherwise, to all concerned, was certainly a mere matter of speculation, proper for the consideration of the society, and which no individual is at liberty to complain of, as he is bound to consider it as his own. individual act. Every member, in fact^j stands- in the peculiar situation of being party of botf sides, insurer and insured. Certainly the general sub, nission which they have signed will cover their liabilit'' to submit tq this' alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The view which we have taken of this subject affords an answer t0 ^ fiftfi ground, and, in a great measure,.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We consider the insured, upon every revaluation, \u2018as in under his former right of membership, and, of consequence, that the plaintiffs come Under the description of persons who had insured before 1804; and, for. the same reason, the representation of Scot (could any. effect at all be given to the circumstances to which he testifies) was true, as to the membership of the plaintiffs, \u00e1nd as to their liability in that capacity; They must have known it was a question of law; on which Scot possessed no power to commit the society, and on which the plaintiffs themselves ought to have been as well informed as any other individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
