United States, \u201c <em>the dangers of 4ke seas only </em>excepted.\u201d The vessel on board of which the goods were laden, cleared out and sailed from Philadelphia, for East Portland, in the district of Maine, but, having encountered s\u00e1vere and tempestuous weather^ her crew disabled in a great degree, she was obliged, in order to escape from the danger of Nantucket Shoals, to change her course, and to endeavour to gain the port of Charleston. . The weather and the winds, however, were so severe and adverse that she could not make Charleston, nor any other port of the United States, <em>and xvas oblig\u00e9d </em>to bear away for the West Indies to obtain relief. She arrived at Porto Rico in distress. The governor ordered the cargo to be landed and sold, with which order the captain was <em>obliged </em>to comply, and did land.and sell the same. She <em>could not </em>leave the island without considerable repairs, which were accordingly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b179-10\">The court below instructed the jury that these facts, if believed by them, were, upon the whole case, sufficient to bar the United States of their action.

In order to excuse the party he must show that the goods have been actually <em>lost </em>by the <em>dangers of the seas. </em>If the vessel were irresistibly driven by a tempest to Porto Rico, yet the. goods arrived .there in safety, and were not lost. The party had the full benefit of them, and probably at a higher price than if .he had landed them in the United States. If the law of the 12th of March affects the case, yet it must be a <em>loss </em>by sea, or a <em>Iqss </em>by other unavoidable accident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-9\">When the legislature particularly except certain cas&lt; s, no other exceptions can be presumed.

The first embargo law .means such a kind of a loss as prevents the r\u00e9lantling o\u00a1 the goods in the United .States. It does not mean where the loss is occasioned by the immediate dangers of .the element, \"but any loss . to.which vessels are exposed in <em>consequence </em>of the dangers of the seas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-9\">.Thus capture by pirates is a loss by one of the dangers of the seas. The expression has the same meaning in the act as it has in bills of lading.. If this action had been -upon the bill of lading instead of the bond, such an accident would have been a sufficient excuse to the master for not delivering the goods. Sci in a policy of insurance.

She could not return ' without repairs. \u25a0 She could not obtain repairs without leave of the governor. That leave could not be obtained but by obedience to his orders. His orders prevented the relanding of the goods according to the condition of the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-11\">The case cited from Peake only snows that the loss was within the description of loss by capture. not that it was not a loss by the dangers of the seas. The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>from <em>Banbury </em>was a. mere private trespass j so was \"that cited from 4 <em>T. R. 783. </em>It was not an act of the government. . The insured had a private remedy against the trespassers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-4\"><em>2. </em>We have a right to the benefit of the act of 12th of March, and are excused if prevented from relanding by any <em>unavoidable-accident.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-5\">There is a difference, as to <em>ex post Jacto </em>laws, be-' tween those which mitigate, and those which increase, \u2022the penalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">The act expressly refers to bonds taken under the prior law. - It does not mean <em>loss </em>by unavoidable ac- . \u2022eident, but <em>prevention by </em>such accident. '1 he punctuation of the sentence, as printed in the statute book, favours this construction; but if it be doubtful, the court will lean against the penalty..</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-7\">But the property was lost to the owner, within the meaning of the statute. He had no power over the \u2022thing itself; he could not bring it away, it is immaterial whether he obtained an equivalent, or not; the letter of the condition of the bond could only be satisfied by relanding the thing itself. A compliance with the condition was to him as impossible as if the goods had perished in the sea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-8\">3. The act of January 9, 1809, cannot apply to this case so as to make that penal which before was justifiable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-9\">Marshall, Ch. J. stopped the counsel, and observed that the court would \u2022 never consider the penal act as applying to previous facts, unless such construction be absolutely unavoidable.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b182-10\"><em>March </em>3.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b182-11\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEb\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">This suit was instituted on a bond taken in pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>anee of the original embargo act, with a condition that the cargo of the schooner Mary, a sea-letter vessel* should be relanded in the port' of EaBt Portland, or some other port of the United States, <em>\u201cthe dangers of the seas-only </em>excepted. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Her cargo was not relanded within the United States, but was carried to-Porto Rico and sold. The defendants allege that, they were driven by stress of weather into Porto Rico, where the cargo was landed by order of the government; and they insist that the case is within the exception contained in the condition of the bond. The circuit court instructed the jtiry that, if they believed the testimony, it was sufficient in law, to bar the action. To this opinion the counsel for the United States excepted; and its propriety is now to, be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The improbability of the allegations made by the defendants is no longer the subject of inquiry. The jury have verified them, and the court must receive them as true. Th.e testimony is, that the Mary was driven by tempestuous weather into a foreign port. That, while prosecuting her, voy age, she encountered weather which so disabled both the crew and vessel, and put her in such a situation that, to escape Nantucket Shoals, \u201c she was <em>obliged </em>to change her course, and endeavour to gain a southern port.\u201d She changed her course and bore for Charleston. But such; was the condition of th| crew and of the vessel, and so severe and so adversfe were the winds, that she \u201c <em>could </em>not make Charleston, nor <em>any other port </em>of the United , States, and was <em>obliged </em>to bear away for the West Indies, to obtain relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The vessel, then, was driven into Porto Rico by the cause which forms the exception in the condition of the bond, and if the cargo had been lost at the mouth of the harbour, instead of entering the port, all would admit that the penalty of the bond had hot been incurred. But it is contended that the dangers of the seas terminated on entering the port, and that no sufficient cause is shown for not bringing back the cargo to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"Au6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The caso states tbatthegpveiT\u00eddr\u00edof Porto Ricofeswed-an-order that the .cargo should he landed and sold, \u201c with which order the .captain was? <em>obliged, </em>to comply,\u201d\"</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">As this ca.se i\u00e1 stated, the Maty was driven into Porto Rico, aid the sale Of her cargo* while there,was inevitable. The dangers of the sea placed her;in a situation'which, put, it ,oiit of-the power qf the'.owners tp r'eland her cargo within the' United States. The obligor\u00bb,, then* were prevented,c.hy the dangers, of the seas,from complying with the condition of the bond ; for an effect, which -proceeds inevitably, and of absolute necessity from a specified cause, ;must be ascribed to that cause.. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Tt is-the unanimous opinion of this court that there is'rio.' error in the proceedings of the circuit court, and that the judgment be affirmed*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
