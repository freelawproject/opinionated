He says that in the year 1793, as a deputy-surveyor,t0 he surveyed the land on the Scioto, on which the claim of Oneal depended; but. not wishing to take upon himself the construction of Oneal\u2019s entry, he merely meandered the river, and referred the question to the principal surveyor, by whose directions he made the survey for One\u00e1l in 1796, and without any instructions from Oneal or any agent for him. That when the entry was made, the country had.been but recently explored, and none of the locators knew by survey the meanders of the <em>Scioto. </em>He does not admit that the entry has been surveyed contrary to location, but he surveyed it as he would have surveyed it for himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABz\">He admits he made an entry fot1 himself, and intended to appropriate the vacant land, but it was not by any procurementof his, that his patent was prior to Oneal\u2019s.

Secondly, if the complainant shall establish his right to the land in contest, and cannot obtain a,conveyance therefor, that the decree may be for the value thereof, in money. It appears from the pleadings in the cause that the defendant Massie has purchased Powell\u2019s land, and that he has appropriated, by entry and survey, the adjoining land. 1 he three following entries were made upon the Scioto river adjoining each other. \u201c No. 480: 1787. August 13, Major Thomas Massie enters 1,400 acres of land beginning at the junction of Paint creek with the Scioto, running up the Scioto 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, thence off at right angles from the general course of the river so far that a line parallel thereto will include the quantity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">\u201c No. 503.

No. 480. running up the river 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, thence from the beginning, with Massie\u2019s line so far that a line parallel to the general course of the river shall include the quantity,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">\u201c No. 509. Captain Ferdinand Oneal enters one thousand acres beginning at the upper corner on the Scioto of Robert Powell\u2019s entry. No. 503. running up the river 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, and from the beginning with Powell\u2019s line so far that a line-parallel with the general course of the river shall include the quantity.\u201d Surveys have been made upon the entries of Thomas Massie and Robert Powell, so as to cover almost the whole hasp of 1,560 poles, the-space which was allotted for the three claims on the river, and 530 acres of land have been surveyed for Oneal, by the defendant Massie in part of his entry, which it is impossible upon any construction he can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>hold\u00bb To form a correct opinion, in this case the seyeral entries of Massie, Powell and Oneal must be brought into one view, and, as far as it is possible, consistent with the entries, to. ascertain the object and intention of the locator. It is evident, from the manner in which these entries are worded, that the locator had no doubt in his mind, at. the time the entries were made, of having given that space which would enable him to secure, by legal surveys, the quantity of land located for each person. It becomes, then, the duty of the court to consider the case with a reference to this object. No difficulty arises as to the manner in which the entry of Thomas Massie ought to be surveyed, the calls of his entry being express and positive. His entry ought to have been surveyed in the following manner ; to begin, as he has done, at the junction of Paint creek, and the Scioto, and then to run up the. river so far as will ascertain the termination of the 520 poles called for on the river, when reduced to a straig1\u2019 line. This will reduce his base to a point below the first flooded land represented in the connected plat, a jove the mouth of Paint creek, thence he is to run cut at right angles with the general course of the river. The unexpected bends in the Scioto river have induced such a construction to be placed on the entries of Powell and Oneal, by the defendant Massie that, in executing the surveys of Thomas Massie aud Powell, he considered Oneal as being excluded from obtaining any part of the land upon the base of 1,560 poles, the space allotted for three entries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\">The contest in this case, in consequence of the manner which has been pursued in making Massie\u2019s and Powell\u2019s surveys, rests principally upon the construction which is to be given to Powell\u2019s and Oneal\u2019s entries ; and, as the latter is dependent on the former, equity requires that, if it be possible to secure to each his .portion of. land. agreeably to their entries, it ought to-be so decided, provided it can be done consistendy with the spirit of the entries, and the real intention of the locator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">From an attentive consideration of the entries, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>object of the locator was evidently to give to each of the proprietors of the warrants an equal base on the river, and make it the ruling principle in shaping the surveys. It only remains, then, to,be considered whether the words in the entries will bear such, a construction as to effectuate the object, and secure the lands to Powell arid Oneal, which the locator intended at the time he made, the entries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\">Powell\u2019s first call is to run up the river Scioto ; and the description given of the land contemplated to he. covered by the entry, is that portion which shall lie' within a litie parallel to the general course of the river. From a'view of the Scioto' river, as laid down - in th\u00e9 \u25a0 connected plat, and the shape which Thomas Massie\u2019s land will assume, when run out \u00e1gre\u00e9ably ty his entry, it becomes necessary,\"ip order to give Powell the land parallel to the general course of the river, to lay it off by commencing the survey on the river at the extremity of the 520 poles above Massie, and thence to run out \u00e1t -right angles to. the general course of the river, so far that a parallel line to the river, extending to Massit\u00ed\u2019s back line, and binding on Massie\u2019s lines, will.include his one thousand acres. Reverse this mode, of surveying Powell\u2019s entry, and begin at Massie\u2019s Upper Corner on the river and run out witli Massie\u2019s line, it Mill, make'Mas'sie\u2019s line the governing principle, df the survey, and not the river, which construction will be contrary to the true meaning expressed, in the entry, the intention of the locator, and place th\u00e9 survey on the land of On\u00e9al, whose interest, as a subsequent locator, is equally entitled to protection with that of the prior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">. The rifle adopted in construing this entry must justify the manlier .of executing a survey agreeably thereto by running'five lines instead' of four to circumscribe the land. This proceeds from an accidental circumstance occasioned by the great bend immediately above \u2022the mouth of Paint creek, which renders if necessary to comply'with the governing principle in the' entry for the land to be \u2022\u201c parallel to the general course' of. the \u25a0river.\u201d By thus executing Powell\u2019s survey, a portion of land will remain on the river, and parallel ther\u00e9t\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sufficient to satisfy Oneal, the calls of whose entry are similar to Powell\u2019s calling for him as he does for Massie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\">Oneal\u2019s survey ought, therefore, to have-been execu. ted in' the s\u00e1me manner as it is now decided, \u2022 Powell\u2019s ought to have been made by beginning at the termination of 520 poles on the river, and thence to run off at right angles from that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">\u2022Having decided the manner in which the entries ,of Massie, Powell, and Oneal .ought to have been surveyed, it remains yet to say what is the situation of the survey for 530- acres of land made for Oneal, and placed'on the record book of the surveyor. To make this act obligatory on the party it was necessary that all the acts done should have been performed or approved by Oneal himself, or some one of his assignees, or by some agent authorized for that purpose. There i\u00bb no evidence in the cause to this effect: the placing the survey on' the surveyor\u2019s book is therefore an unauthorized and void act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">. In the case of Wilson and Mason, in the late district court, the court decided \u25a0 that a survey once recorded was not afterwards in. the power or control of the party, I bis opinion was predicated on two facts found in that cause, that William Mason was the agent of the de? fendant, and approved of what had been done by registering the. surveys of Mason although cautioned of his danger,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">Upon this view of the case, the court is of opinion that the complainant recover of the defendant one thousand acres of land, to be laid off agreeably to the mode pointed out as the proper manner for surveying Oneal\u2019s entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">That upon the defendant Massie\u2019s conveying thfe said one thousand acres of land to the complainant, he, the complainant, shall assign to the said defendant all his right in. and\"to one thousand acres of the warrant issued to the said Oneal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>So fat as this ^uit relates to the defendant.Anderson, it is decreed and ordered that the bill be dismissed as to him with costs, the cohrt being of opinion he was improperly made a party. . It is therefore considered by the court, that the defendant Anderson recover of the complainant his costs by him in this behalf expend*, ed.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">And afterwards, at the same term, the following order was made herein. The court in pursuance of the opini\u00f3n and decree delivered in this cause on the eighth day of this month (Decerhber) doth order, that the surveyor of Ross county do go on the land in controversy and lay off the same as follows: Thomas Massie\u2019s entry by beginning at the mouth of Paint creek, thence up the Scioto so far as will amount to 520.poles when reduced to a straight line, and from each end of this base' at right .angles from the general course so far that a line parallel with that general course will produce the quantity of fourteen hundred acres. Robert Powell\u2019s entry by beginning at the upper corner of Thomas Massie\u2019s entry, that is, 520 poles from the mouth of Paint creek, theiiee up the river so far as will amount to 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, and from the end of this base line, a line is to be run at right angles to the general course of that portion of the river which is- occupied by the b\u00e1se line and from the beginning with the lines of Thomas Massi\u00e9, that is, his. second and third lines, so fqr that a line parallel to the general course of this base line will produce the quantity'of one thousand acres. Ferdinand Onpal\u2019s-entry by beginning at the upper corner of Robert' Powell\u2019s entry- when laid off as aforesaid, thence up the Scioto so far as will amount to 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, and from the end of this base line a line is to be run at right angles from the general course of that portion of the river which is occupied by the base line, and from the beginning with the second and third lines of Powell so far that a line parallel td the general course of the base line will p.v\u00e1duce the quantity of cne thousand aere\u00e9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">And the. court doth further order, that the said sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>veyor do make and bound the said survey of' Oneai when laid off as aforesaid, and make report of the metes and bounds and his proceedings herein to the next court.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-4\">At May . term, 1808, the surveyor having made his report, .a final decree- was entered in conformity with the principles laid down in the interlocutory order, from which the.defendant appealed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-5\">Pope, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APqI\">contended that the circuit court in Kentucky, had no jurisdiction of a case involving the title of land lying in <em>Ohio, </em>unless it be upon a <em>personal contract. </em>Here was no personal con-i tract. Although the bill states an agreement respecting the surveying of\u2019 the. land, yet it is denied' by the answer, and not proved. Besides, if there was such a contract, it is not upon the contract that the suit is brought. It .is a mere question which of the parties has the better right under their several entries.. The remedy in chancery in Kentucky is merely a substitute-for a <em>caveat. </em>It is in the nature of a real action, which is local... A court in New-York could not try the. title of land in -Virginia, unless it were upon a personal-contract. \u2022 Even the. action of trespass <em>quare clausum, fregit </em>is a. local action, although it sounds in damages,, and seems to b.e of \u00e1 personal nature.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-6\"><em>P.

Was this cause, therefore, to be. considered as involving a naked question of title, was it, for example, a contest between Watts and Powell, the jurisdiction of the circuit court of Kentucky would not be sustained; But Where the question changes its character, where the defendant in the original action is liable to the plaintiff, either' in consequence of contract, or as trustee, or .a*, tiie holder of a legal title acquired by any species oi <em>mala fides </em>practised on the plaintiff, the principles of equity give a court jurisdiction wherever the person may be found, and the circumstance* that a question of. title may be involved in the inquiry, and may even constitute the essential point on which the case depends, does not seem sufficient to arrest thatjurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In the celebrated case of <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Lord Baltimore, </em>the Chancellor of England decreed a specific performance of a contract respecting lands lying in North America. The objection to the jurisdiction of the court, in that case, as reported by Vezey, was not that the lands lay without the jurisdiction of the court, but that, in cases, relating to boundaries between provinces, the jurisdiction was exclusively in ,the king and-council. Tt is in reference to this objection, not to an objection that the lands were without his jurisdiction, that the chancellor says, \u2018f This court, therefore, has no 'original jurisdiction on the direct question of the original right of boundaries.\u201d The reason why it had no original jurisdiction on this direct question was, that the decision on the extant of those grants, including dominion and political power, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>as property, was exclusively reserved to the king in council.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In a subsequent (part of the opinion, where he treats of the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, arising from its inability to enforce its. decree <em>in rem, </em>he allows no&gt; weight to that argument. The strict primary decree of a court of equity is, he says, <em>in </em>personam, and may be enforced in all cases where the person is within its jurisdiction.- In confirmation of this position he cites the practice of the courts to decree respecting lands lying in Ireland and in the colonies, if the person, agamst whom tne decree was prayed, be found in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In the case of <em>Arglasse </em>v. Muschamp, 1 <em>Vernon, </em>Pa. the defendant, residing in England, having fraudulently obtained a rent charge on lands lying in Ireland, a bill was brought in England to set it aside. To an objection made to the jurisdiction of the court the chancellor replied, u This is surely only a jest put upon the jurisdiction of this court by the commpn lawyers; for when you go about to bind the lands and grant a sequestration to execute a decree, then they readily tell you that the authority of this court is only to regulate a man\u2019s conscience, and ought not to affect the estate, but that this court must <em>agere in personam </em>only; and when, as in this case, you prosecute the person for a fraud, they tell you that you must not intermeddle here, because, the fraud, though committed here, concerns lands that lie in Ireland, which makes the jurisdiction local, and so wholly elude the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d The chancellor,, in that case, sustained his jurisdiction .on principle, and on the authority of <em>Archer </em>and <em>Preston, </em>in which case a contract made respecting lands in Ireland, the title to which depended on the act of settlement,v was enforced in England, although the defendant was a resident of Ireland, and had only made a casual visit to England. On a rehearing before Lord Keeper North this decree was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In the case of <em>The Earl of Kildare </em>v. <em>Sir Morrice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Eustace and </em>Fitzgerald, <em>1 Vern. </em>419. it was determined that if the trustee .live in England^ the chancellor may- enforce the trust, although the lands lie in Ireland.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">In the case of <em>Toller </em>v. Carteret, 2 <em>Vern. </em>494. a bill w\u00e1s sustained'for the foreclosure of a mortgage of lands lying dot of the jurisdiction of the court, the person of the mortgagor being wkhin it.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Subsequent to these decisions w\u00e1s the case of <em>Penn </em>against <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, 1 <em>Vez. 444. </em>in which the specific performance of a contract tor lands lying m North America was decreed in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Upon the authority of these cases, ahd of others which are to be found in the books, as well as upon general principles, 'this court is'of opinion that, in a case of fraud, of trust, or of contract, the jurisdiction of a court of chancery, is sustainable wherever'-the person be found, although lands not within the jurisdiction of that court may 'be affected by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The inquiry, therefore,-will be, whether this be an , unmixed. question of title, or <em>a </em>case of fraud, trust or contract!</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Th\u00e9'facts in this case, so far as they affect the question of jurisdiction, are, that, in 1787, the land warrant, of which Watts is.now the proprietor, and which fhen'belonged to, Oneal, was placed without any special contract, in the hands of Massie, as a. common locator of lands.. - In the month of August in the same year h\u00bf l\u00f3c\u00e1ted 1,000 acr\u00e9s, part .of* this warrant, to adjoin a previous location made on the same day for Robert Powell.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">In the year 1793 Massie, as deputy-surveyor, surveyed the lands of Thomas Massie, on which Robert Powell\u2019s entry depended, and the land \u00f3f Robert P ow-ell, on which O.ne\u00e1l\u2019s entry1 now the property of Wa\u00a3ts, depended. On-the 27th \u00f3f June, 1795, Nathaniel Massie, the plaintiff in error, entered for himself 2,366 acres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of land to adjoin the surveys made for Robert Powell, Thomas Massie and one Daniel Stull. The entry of Daniel. Stull commences at the upper corner of Ferdinand .Oneal\u2019s entry on the'Scioto, and the entry of Ferdinand Oneal commences at the upper corner of Robert Powell\u2019s entry on the Scioto; so that the land of ..Oneal would be supposed, from the entries, to occupy the space on the Scioto between Powell and Stull. Nathaniel Massie\u2019s entry, which was made after surveying the lands of Thomas Massie arid of Robert Powell, binds on the Scioto, and occupies the whole space between Powell\u2019s survey and.Stull\u2019s survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">In the year 1796, Nathaniel Massie surveyed 530 acres of Oneal\u2019s entry, chiefly within Stull\u2019s survey, and afterwards, in the spring of 1797, purchased Powell\u2019s survey. Nathaniel Massie\u2019s entry is surveyed and patented. In 1801 Massie received from Watts, in money, the customary compensation for making his location.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">It is alleged that Nathaniel Massie has acquired for himself the land which was comprehended within Oneal\u2019s entry, and has surveyed for Oneal land to which, his entry can by no construction be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">If this allegation be unsupported by evidence, there is an end of the case. If it be supported, had the court of Kentucky jurisdiction of the cause ?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Although no express contract be made, yet it cannot be doubted that the law implies a contract between every man who transacts business for another at the request of that other and the person for whom it is transacted. A common locator who undertakes to locate lands. for an absent person is bound to perform the usual duties of a locator, and is entitled to t^e customary compensation for those duties. If he fails in the performance of those duties, he is liable to the action of the injured party, which may be instituted wherever his person is found. If his compensation be refused, he may-sue therefor in anv court within whose-jurisdiction the person for whom the location was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>cari be found. In either action the manner in which the service was performed is inevitably the subject of investigation, and the difficulty of making it cannot oust the court of its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">From the nature of the business, and the situation of the parties, the person for whom the location .is made being generally a non-resident, and almost universally unacquainted with the country in which his land is placed, it is the duty of the locator not only to locate the lands, but to show them to the surveyor. He also necessarily possesses the power to amend or. to change the location \u25a0 if he has sufficient reason to believe that it is for the interest of his employer so to do. So far as respects the location he is substituted in the place df the owner, and his acts done <em>bona fide </em>are the acts of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">If, under these circumstances, a locator finding that the entry he has made cannot be surveyed, instead of withdrawing it'or amending it. so as to render it susceptible of being carried into execution, secures the . adjoining land for himself, and shows other land'to the surveyor which the location cannot be construed to comprehend, it appears to this court to be a breach of' duty, which amounts to a violation of the implied contract, and subjects him to the action of the party injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">If the location be sustainable, and the locator, instead of showing the land really covered by. the entry,. show's other land, and appropriates to himself the land actually entered, this appears to the court to be a Species <em>of mala Jiotes </em>which will, ip equity, convert him into a trustee for the party Qriginally entitled \u25a0 to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In either case the jurisdiction of thg, court of' the state in w'hich the person is found, is sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">If we reason by analogy from the distinction between actions local and transitory at common law, this action Would follow the person, because it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>be founded on an implied contract, or on neglect of duty,</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">If we reason fropi those principles which are laid down in the books relative to the jurisdiction of courts of equity, the jurisdiction of the court. of Kentucky is equal!) sustainable, because the defendant, if liable, is either liable under his contract, or as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The case, then, as presented to the court, gives it jurisdiction, and the testimony must be examined to ascertain how far the bill is supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The entry of Thomas Massie begins at the junction of Paint creek .with the Scioto, .and runs up the Scioto 520 poles, when reduced to a straight line, thence off at right angles from the general course of the river, so far that a line parallel thereto will include the quantity. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Respecting this entry there is no, controversyt</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Robert Powell enters i,QOO acres of land,' \u201c beginning at the upper corner on jhe Scioto, of Major Thomas Massif\u2019s entry, No. 480. running up the river 520 poles, when reduced to a straight line, thence from th. beginning with Massie\u2019s line, \" so tar that a line parallel with the general course of the river shall include the quantity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Then Ferdinand Oneal enters 1,000 acres of land, beginning at the upper corner.on the Scioto, of Robert Powell\u2019s entry, No. 503. running up the river 520 poles, when reduced to a straight line, and. from the beginning with Powell\u2019s line, so far that a line parallel with the general course, of the river shall include the quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">As Oneal\u2019s entry depends on Powell\u2019s, it is necessary to ascertain the land taken by Powell, before that of Oneal can be accurately determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">Had the general course of the Scioto continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>nearly the same, no difficulty would have been found in this case. The surveys might have conformed literally to all the calls of each entry, and each tract would have constituted nearly a rectangular figure, with a base of 520 poles on the river, and a back line parallel to that base. But the unexpected bends of the Scioto have deranged the uniformity of this chain of locations, and produced questions of cbnsiderable intricacy respecting the ground which must be covered by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Thomas'Massie\u2019s entry being, of 1,400 acres, and Powell\u2019s of only 1,000 acres, with a base of the same length on the river, it probably was thought certain that Massie\u2019s upper line would extend beyond Powell\u2019s land, and that the line of Powell, which was to run parallel to the river, would intersect Massie\u2019s upper line. Powell\u2019s entry, therefore, calls to run lrom the river with Massie\u2019s line, so far that a line parallel to the general course of the river ,wijl include the quantity. Upon actual survey the course of the river is found to be such that a line parallel thereto, drawn from the end of Massie\u2019s line, would not include 200 acres of land. Under these circumstances' Powell must lose between 8 and 900 acres of land, if his entry cannot be so construed as to extend beyond the length of Massie\u2019s line.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u25a0 From the peculiar situation of titles acquired tinder the land law of. Virginia, a law which offered for sate an immense unexplored wilderness, covered with savages equally fierce and hostile, leaving to the purchaser the right to place his warrant, which was the evidence of his purchase, on any land not previously appropriated, and n quiring him to make his entries so certainly that any other person might locate the .adjacent residuum, it followed inevitably that immense difficulties would occur, and that locations must often be lost, or receive that certainty which the law required from principles adapted to the general. state of things in the ..country, but which were not precisely foreseen when the locations were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>These principles have been laid down by the courts, and must be considered as expositions of the statute. A great proportion of the landed property of the country deptnds on adhering to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The great and equitable foundation on which they Stand is this. , If, by any reasonable construction of an entry, it can be supported, the courts will support it. This principle absolutely requires that, all discretion, with respect to the mode of surveying an entry, should be surrendered. For if a location, might be surveyed in various Wys, then it . is vague, and no subsequent locator would know how to enter the adjacent residuum. \u25a0 The court, therefore, is compelled to say in what manner \u00e9very location, which appears, in its terms, to reserve some power in the locator to vary its form, shall be surveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In the exercise of this essential and necessary power, they have declared that when a given quantity of land is to be laid off on a given base, it shall, be included within four lines, so that the lines proceeding from, the base shall-be at right angles ivith it, and the line opposite the base shall be parallel to it, unless this, form be repugnant to the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The consequence, of this principle Is, that if the calls of an entry do not fully describe the land, but furnish enough to enable the court to complete the location by the application of certain principles,. they will complete it.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">They have also decided that, if a location have certain material calls sufficient to support it, and to,(le\u00bf scribe the land, other calls less material and incompatible with the essential calls of the entry, may be discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">These principles, it is believed, will enable the court to ascertain, in a reasonable manner, the land covered by Powell\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The beginning is the upper corner of'Massie on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Scioto. A base line upon the river is then given to insist of .520 poles, when reduced to a straight line. Massie\u2019s upper line, to its whole extent, it necessary, is also given, and a back line parallel to the base is given. The sid- line opposite Massie\u2019s line, and the course from the termination of Massie\u2019s line to the back line are wanting, arid are to be supplied by construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The material inquiry, so far as respects the present cause, is, in what direction shall Powell\u2019s upper line, extending back from the river to the line parallel to the general course of the river, be run ? That line is not given, and is, consequently, to be supplied by construction.</p>\n<p id=\"AnD\">According to the uniform course of decisions, Powell\u2019s upper line must project from the base at right angles with it, unless there shall be some other call in the entry which controls this general-principle. It \u00cd6 contended, that it is controlled by the. call to run with Massie\u2019s line from the beginning. Massie\u2019s line not being at right angles with the base .line, it is argued that Powell\u2019s opposite line, discarding the rectangular principle, must be parallel to the line from the begin-, ning.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">But the court does not concur with the counsel for the plaintiff in error in 'this opinion. The principle, that the rectangular- figure is to be preferred to any other, and'is to be preserved whenever it can be preserved, originates in the necessity of adopting some regular figure in order to give to locations that \u2019 certainty which is not always to be iound in their terms, and in the superior convenience of that figure \u25a0 over every otjief, with, respect to the adjacent residuum* These motives apply to a.part as well as to the whole of an entry* If one location be made upon another so-that the linee of that other bind the entry on one side, and then a precise line be called for .from the begin,ning to run a certain distance, from the end of which a line .is to be drawn, and to continue until a line, parallel to the first or base line, or to. some given point in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the lines of the person on whom the location is made, shall include the quantity, the same respect for certainty and convenience which induced originally the adoption of the rectangular figure would seem to require its adoption with respect to those lines which did not receive \u00e1 different direction from the positive calls of the location. On one side there might be several different lines; but this would not seem to demand that, on the opposite side, the same variety should-be preserved. It would be-departing from the principle unnecessarily to require that the lines of the opposite side of the tract-should be multiplied in order to be all parallel to the lines by which one side was unavoidably bounded. To the court it-see ms that the rectangular principle is always to be preserved where it can be preserved, that is, where there is no call in the entry applying to the lines 'which control them, and that, where it is necessarily departed from, the departure should not be extended further than the necessity re\u00bb quires.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">In this particular case the location does not cal\u00ed for a line parallel to Massie\u2019s line, and, as Massie\u2019s line was to run at right angles from the general course of the river, and it was obviously expected Powell\u2019s line would not extend the whole length of Massie\u2019s line, -it is clear that the locator expected that Powell\u2019s upper line, when at right angles with the conree of the. river, would be nearly parallel to Massie\u2019s line.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">This may be considered as, in some degree, an auxiliary argument in favour of the opinion which is entertained, by this court, that the circuit court did right in laying dawn the upper line of Powell at right angles with his bas\u00e9 line;</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">This line being'established, it is of little importance to Oneal\u2019s claim in what manner the remaining lines, of Powell may.be run.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The call of the location, so far as respects the side binding on Massie, is said to stop at Massie\u2019s northwestern comer. Is that line to be continued ? .</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The conclusive objection to it is, that it would intersect the upper \u2022 line before the quantity was, obtained, and would, consequently, entirely defeat the call for a back, line parallel to the course of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Is a line at right angles with the geperal course of the river to be run from Massie\u2019s corner and continued until aline parallel to,the base line would include the quantity ?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">This would, be. less exceptionable, but it \\vould be departing further from the square, and might, in some instances, exhibit a'plat the breadth of which would not be one third ,of its'length. This {Joint, however, is not critically examined, because it is of very little importance in the present cause. The upper line of Powell, on which Oneab binds, would be the same-as far as it now runs, and should it be continued further, it would only take a small angle of Oneal\u2019s survey as made by order of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The court is of opinion that Pow-ell\u2019s e'ntry is rightly sUt veyed by order of the circuit court, and it is an additional argument in support of this opinion, that, with the exception of the . angle unavoidably made by the interference of Massie; the general form of the land approaches a. square more' nearly than if laid off in any other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">If Powell\u2019s entry be correctly surveyed, Oneal\u2019s. cannot be laid off otherwise than it is, \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Were it even to be admitted that the original survey made for Powell was correct, it' is entirely possible that 'the case of the plaintiff would not be materially improved thereby. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Powell\u2019s back line would' probably terminate on the river*;, in which event, that would-be his upper corner on the Scioto, Which.is. c.alled' for as the beginning of Oneal\u2019s entry. Oneal then calls to run on .the river a distance of 520 poles on a straight line, and with Pow. ell\u2019s line so lar as that a line parallel to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>coarse of the river shall include 1,000 acres* Either this.entry is rendered totally incapable of being surveyed in consequence of the call for f^oWell\u2019s line, pr if -shust be so surveyed as to include almost the jyh\u00f3le town of Chilicothe, and to take \u00a3i considerable part of Massie\u2019sland.'</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">. It is, however,, unnecessary to inquire what would be the rights of the person claiming Oneal\u2019s entry, in' that event, since the court is satisfied that the survey, as directed by the circuit court, is.correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The case, the'ri', as made Out in evidence, is this.Nathaniel Massie, employed to locate a military warrant for Oneal, has entered the warrant , in pursuant\u00a9 <em>\u00f3\u00ed </em>his engagement. On surveying the entries 6n. which-that of Oneal depended, he either believed that Oneal\u2019sentry was void from the repugnancy of its calls, or if not absolutely void,-was incapable of covering the land which, according to legal construction-;, and the common Understanding of those who might read the entries, it must be.considered-as covering.; or he thought that, by obtaining a prior patent for the land, he might resist any claim which might afterwards be made by ,Oneal\u2019, or those claiming' Under him. If. Massie really believed that Powell\u2019s entry was properly Surveyed, -and that Oneal\u2019s entiy, as. made, could not be surveyed, it was his duty to amend it, or, if that was not hig 'duty, to place it elsewhere. For omitting so t\u00f3 \u00bflo he is chargeable With such gross neglect of duty as fo render him responsible in-damages,- had-his- construction of Oneal\u2019s location, even been-\u2018correct. But, if -in this he vyas mistaken, it would be dangerous in the extreme, it . Would be \" a \u00a1cover for fraud -which, could seldom be removed, if a locator, alleging difficulties respecting a-location, might withdraw, it arid take the l\u00e1nd for himself. He., however,, has not withdrawn It, except so far. as it may be impliedly-.withdrawn by the survey of 580. acres, With that exception, the .entry still covers foe land on' which it was originally'placed, rind is still entitled to that land. But .Massie,-the agent of Oneal, has entered and surveyed a portion of that land for himself, and obtained a patent for if in' his own name. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>According to the clearest and'best established principles of equity, the agent who so acts becomes a trustee for his principal. He cannot hold the land under an entry for himself otherwise than as trustee for his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">So far, then, as Oneal\u2019s land is within* Massie\u2019s survey, Massie is a trustee ,for Oneal and his assignees, and upon \u2018the principle stated in the early part of this opinion, the court of Kentucky had jurisdiction pf the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">But a part of Oneal\u2019s land is- surveyed for Powell, and in a contest between his assignees and Powell, the court of Kentucky would have had no jurisdiction. This controversy, however, is not with Powell; it is- with Massie, who is the purchaser of Powell\u2019s rights. The whole property being thus in the hands of Massie, and the court of Kentucky being in possession of the . cause, and having clear jurisdiction of a part of it which decides the principle on which the whole depends, that court did fight in deciding the whole cause, and decreeing to the assignees Of Oneal the whole, land originally included in the entry made for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Considerable doubts were entertained respecting the right of Watts to more than the unsurveyed part of the entry. But a majority of' the court, is of opinion-that he stands precisely in the place of Oneal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">* As Massie does not show that he had' conv\u00e9yed any of that part of Powell\u2019s survey which is included within Ofieal\u2019s entry previous t\u00f3 the institution pf this suit* or even now, the allegation that he has conveyed a part -of Powell\u2019s survey could not famish sufficient matter for preventing the decree which was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The decree of the circuit court is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
