That afterwards, on the first day of February, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, the legislature of said state of Georgia, then duty convened, passed an act for \u25a0 ceding part of the territorial claims of said state to the United States; by which act the state of Georgia authorized her delegates in congress to convey to the United States the territorial claims of said state of Georgia to a certain tract of country bounded as follows, to wit: beginning at the middle of the river Catahouchee or Apalachicola, where it is intersected by the thirty-first degree of north latitude, and from thence due north one hundred and forty miles, thence due west to the river Mississippi ; thence down the middle of the said 'rivet* to where it intersects the- thirty-first degree of north latitude, and along the said degree to the place of beginning ; annexing the provisions and conditions following, to wit: r That the United States in congress assembled, shall guaranty to the citizens of said territory' a republican form of government, subject only to such changes as may take place in the federal constitution-of the United States ; secondly, that the navigation of all the waters included in the said cession shall be equally free to all the citizens of the United States; nor shall any'tonnage on vessels, or any duties whatever, be laid on any goods, wares, or merchandises that pass up or down the said waters, unless for the use and benefit of the United States. Thirdly, that the. sum of one hundred and and seventy-one thousand and twenty-eight dollars, forty-five cents, which has been expended in quieting the minds of the Indians, and resisting their hostilities, shall he allowed as a .charge against the United States, and be\u2022 admitted in payment of the specie requisition \u00f3f that state\u2019s quotas that have been or may be required by the United States.

Fifthly, that congress shall guaranty and secure all the remaining territorial rights of the state, as pointed out and expressed'by the de finitive treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, the convention between the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>state and the state of South Carolina, entered into the twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and the clause of an act of the said state of Georgia, describing the boundaries thereof, passed the seventeenth day of February, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, which act of the said state of Georgia, with Sf\u00bbid conditions annexed, was by the delegates of Said state in congress presented to the said congress, and the same Vas, after being read, committed to a committee of cong\u00edes\u00e1; who, on the fifteenth day of July, in the said year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, made report thereon to congress, as follows, to wit: \u201c The committee, having fully considered the subject referred to them-, are of opinion, that the' cessiop offered by the state of Georgia cannot be accepted on tfie terms proposed; first, because it appears highly probable that on running the boundary line between that state and the adjoining state or states, a claim, to a large tract of country extending to the Mississippi, and lying between the tract proposed to be ceded, and that lately ceded by South Carolina, will be retained by the said state of Georgia; and therefore the land which the state now offers to cede must be too far removed from the other lands hitherto ceded to the union to be of any immediate advantages to it. Secondly, because there appears to be due from the state of Georgia, on specie requisitions, but a small part of the sum mentioned in the third proviso or condition before recited; and it is improper in this case to allow a charge against the specie requisitions of .congress which may hereafter be made, especially as the said state stands charged to th'e United States for very con-' siderable sums of money loaned. And, thirdly, because the fifth proviso or condition before recited contains a special guaranty of territorial rights, and such a guaranty has not been mad.e by congress- to any state, and which, considering the spirit and meaning -of the confederation, must be unnecessary and improper. But the committee are of opinion, that the first, second, and fourth provisions, before recited, and also the third, with some variations, may 'be admitted ; and'that, should the said state extend the bounds of her cession, <em>5 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>.and vary the terms thereof as herein after mentioned, congress may accept the same. Whereupon they submit th\u00e9 following resolutions: That the cession of claims to western' territory, offered, by the state of Georgia, cannot be accepted on the terms contained in her-act passed the first of February last. That in case the said state shall authorize her delegates in congress to make a cession of all her territorial claims to. lands west of the river Apalachicola, or west of a meridian line running through or near the point where that river intersects the thirty-first .degree of north latitude, and shall omit the last proviso in her said act, and shall so far v\u00e1ry the proviso respecting the sum of one hundred and seventy-one thousand four hundred and twenty-eight dollars, and forty-five cents, expended in quieting and resisting the Indians, as that the said state shaji have credit in the specie requisitions of congress, to 'the amount of her specie quotas on the past requisitions, and fdr the residue, in her account with the United States for moneys loaned, congress will accept the cession.\u201d Which report being read, congress resolved, that congress agree to the said report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">The jury further find, that in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, Thomas Jefferson, Esq. then secretary of state for tfie United States, made a report to the then President of the United States, which was intended to serve as a basis of instructions to the commissioners of the United States for settling the points which were then in-dispute between the King of Spain and the government of the United States; one of which points in dispute was, the-just.boundaries between West Florida and the southern line of the United States. On this point, the said secretary of state, in his report aforesaid, expresses himself as follows, to wit: \u201c As to boundary, that between Georgia and West Florida is the only one which needs any explanation. It (that is, the court of .Spain) sets up a claim to possessions within the state of Georgia j founded on her (Spain) having rescued them by force from the . British during the late war. The following view\u2019 of that subject seems to admit of no reply. The several states now composing the Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ted Slates of Am\u00e9rica were, ffotti thyir first establishment, separate and distinct societies, dependent on no other society of men whatever. They continued at ih'e-head of their respective governments the executive magistrate who presided over the one they had left, and thereby secured in effect a constant amity with $he nation. In this stage of their government their several boundaries were fixed, and particularly the southern boundary of Georgia, the only one now in question, was esfnblished at the thirty-first degree of latitude, from' \\ the Apalachicola westwardly. <em>\u00ed </em>he southern limits of Georgia depend chiefly on, first, the charter of South Carolina, Sic. \u2022 Secondly, on the proclamation of the British king, in one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three; establishing the boundary between Georgia and Florida, <em>to </em>begin on the Mississippi, in thirty-one degrees of north latitude, and \u00edunning eastwardiy to the Apalachicola, &amp;c. That after-wards, on the seventh day of December, of the same year, the commissioners of the United States for settling the aforesaid\" disputes, in their communications with those 6f the King of Spain, express themselves as follows, to wit: \u2018 In this stage of- their (meaning the United State's) government, th\u00e9 several boundaries Were fixed, aqd particularly the southern boundary of Georgia, the one now brought into question by Spain.

The breach of the covenant complained of is, that \u201c the <em>legislature had no authority to sell and dispose of </em>\u201d the' land, but the plea is, that <em>'\u25a0'\u25a0the said </em>Matthews, <em>governor of the said state, </em>was fully and legally empowered to <em>sell and convey\" </em>the land. Although the <em>governor </em>had. authority to sell, <em>non constat'that </em>the <em>legislature </em>had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">The sanie objection applies to the second plea; it is an answer to the inducement, not to the point of the plea. The breach assigned in the second count is, \u201c that the title which the state of Georgia at any tinfe had in the premises was never legally conveyed to the said Peck by force of the conveyances aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-8\">The improper influence .upon the members of the legislature was only inducement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-9\">The plea is, the defendant had no notice nor know- . ledge of the improper means used. It is no answer to the breach assigned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-10\">The same objection applies also to the third plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-11\">It appears upon the special verdict that the state of Georgia never was seised in fee of the lands. They belonged to the crown of Great Britain, and at the revolution devolved upon the United States, and not upon the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-12\">When the colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina were royal colonies, the king limited the boundaries, and disannexed thes\u00e9 lands from Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-13\">Argument for the defendant in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-14\">The first fault of pleading is in the declaration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The breach of the covenant is not well assigned in the first count. The/covenant is, that the legislature had good <em>right </em>to sell.' The breach assigned is, that the legislature had no <em>authority </em>to sell. Authority and right, are words of a different signification. Right implies an interest: authority is a mere naked power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-4\">But if the breach be well assigned, the plea is a. substantial answer to it, for if the governor derived full power and authority from the legislature to sell, the legislature must have had that power to give. The plea shows the title to be in the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-5\">The objection is only to the form of the plea, which cannot prevail upon a general demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">Two questions arise upon the issue joined upon the 4th plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-7\">1st. Whether the title was in the state of Georgia ; and, 2d. Whether it was in the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-8\">At the beginning of the revolution the lands were within the bounds of Georgia. ' .These bounds were confirmed by the treaty of peace in 1783, and recognised in the treaty with Spain in 1795, and by the c\u00e9s* sion to the United Shates in 1802.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-9\">The United States can have no title but what is derived from Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">The title of Georgia depends upon the facts found in the special verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-11\">The second charter granted by George the 2d in 1732, includes these lands, the bounds of that grant being from the Savannah to the Alatamaha, and from the heads of those rivers respectively, in direct lines, to the South Sea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-12\">It is not admitted that the king had a right to enlarge or diminish the boundaries even of royal pro- - vinces.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The exercise of that right, even by parliament itself, was one of the violations of right upon which the revolution was founded; as appears by the declaip\u00bb tion of independence, the address to the people of Quebec,. and other public documents of the time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-4\">This right, claimed by the king, was denied by Virginia and North Carolina in their constitutions. See the article of the <em>constitution of Virginia </em>respecting the limits of that state, and the <em>25th section of the declaration of rights of North Carolina, </em>1 <em>Belsham\u2019s Hist, of </em>Geo. <em>3d, The Quebec </em>Act, and the <em>Collection of State </em>Constitutions, <em>p, </em>180.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">The right was. denied by the commissioners on the part of the United States, , who formed the treaty, and was given up by Great Britain when the present line was established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-6\">But the proclamation of 1763 did not profess or intend to disannex the western lands from the province of Georgia. The king only declares that it is hife royal will and pleasure <em>for the </em>present, \u201cos aforesaid,\u201d to reserve under his sovereignty, <em>protection and </em>dominion, <em>for the use </em>oi the Indians, all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of. the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west; and he thereby forbids his subjects from making purchas\u00e9s or settlements, or taking possession of the sanie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">This clause of the proclamation cannot well be understood without the preceding section to which it refers, by the words \u201c <em>as aforesaid</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-8\">The preceding clause is, \u201c that no governor or commander in chief of our other colonies or plantations in America, <em>i. e. </em>(other than the colonies of Quebec, East Florida and West.Florida,) do presume for the present <em>and until our further pleasure be known, </em>to grant warrants Of surveys, or pass patents for any lands beydnd the heads or sources of any\u2019of the\u2019rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west or north-west; ar upon any lands whatever which, not having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ceded to, or purchased by us,, as aforesaid, are reserved to- the said Indians, or any of them.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT4\">'j'[ien comes the clause in question, which is supposed to have disannexed these lands from-Georgia, as follows: \u201c And we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure for the present as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty, protection and dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the land and temtories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west as aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-8\">It was a prohibition to <em>all </em>the governors of <em>all </em>the colonies,, and a'reservation of <em>all </em>the western lands attached to <em>all </em>th\u00e9 colonies. But it was only a temporary reservation for the use of the Indians.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-9\">If this proclamation disannexed these lands from Georgia, it also disannexed all the western lands from all the other colonies. But if they were disannexed by the proclamation, they were reannexed three months afterwards by the commission to Governor Wright, on the 20th of January, 1764.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-10\">- It appears by the report of the attorney-general, as. well as by Mr. Chalmers\u2019s observations, that it never was the opinion of the British government that these lands were disannexed by the proclamation. -\u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-11\">If they were not reannexed before, they certainly were by the treaty of peace.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-12\">At. the commencement of the revolution, the lands then belonged to and formed a part of the province of - Georgia.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-13\">By the declaration of independence the several states were declared to be free, sovereign and independent states; and the sovereignty of each, not of the whole, was the principle of the revolution; there was no connection 'between them, but that of necessity, and self defence, and, in ivhat manner each should contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>common cause, was a matter left to the discretion of each of the states. By the second article of the confederation the sovereignty of each state is confirmed, and all the rights of sovereignty are declared to be retained which are not by that instrument expressly delegated to tl\\e United States in congress assembled. It provides also that no .state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit .of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">Oii the 25th of February, 1783, the legislature of Georgia passed an act declaring her boundaries, before the definitive treaty of peace.- \u2022 This declaration of Georgi\u00e1 was not contradicted by the United States in any public act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">In 1785, Georgi\u00e1 passed an act erecting the county \u25a0of Bourbon in that territory ; this produced a dispute with South Carolina, which ended in the acknowledgment of the right of Georgia to these lands. (See the third article of the convention. between South Carolina and Georgia.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-7\">\u25a0The same boundaries are acknowledged by the United States in their instructions, given by the secretary of state, Mr. Jefferson, in 1793, to the commissioners appointed to settle the dispute with Spain respecting boundaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-8\">The United States certainly had no claim \u00e1t the commencement of the revolution,- nor at the declaration of independence, nor under the articles of confederation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-9\">During the progress of the revolution a demand was made by two or three of the states, that crown lands should be appropriated for. the common defence. But congress never asserted such a right. They only recommended that <em>cessions </em>of territ\u00f3ry should be made by the states for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-11\">The journals of congress are crowded with proofs of this fact.

The bounds of the United States were-fixed as tljte. bounds of the several states had. been before fixed.. The United States did not claim land for the United States as a nation; they claimed only in right of the individual state.s, Great Britain yielded the principle of the royal right to disannex lands from the colonies, and acquiesced in the principle contended for by the United States, which was the old boundary of the several states.

The sale its . f was not a legislative act. It was not an act o\u00ed sovereignty, but a mere conveyance of title. 2 <em>Tucker\u2019s Bl. Com. 53. 57.

It is a mere occupancy for the purpose of. hunting. It is not like our. te-' nures; they have no idea of a title to the soil itself. It is overrun by them, rather than inhabited. It is not a.true and legal possession. <em>Vattel, b. </em>1. \u00a7 81.p. 37. and \u00a7 209. <em>b. 2. </em>&amp; 97. <em>Montesquieu, b. 18. c. 12. Smith's Wealth of Nations, b. </em>5. c. 1. It is a right not to be <em>transferred </em>but <em>extinguished. </em>It a right regulated by treaties, not by deeds of conveyance. It depends upon the law of nations,.not upon municipal right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-10\">Although the power to extinguish this right bv treaty, is vested in congress, yet Georgia had a. right to sell subject to the Indian claim. .The point has tuver been decided in the courts of the United States; because it has never, before been questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-11\">The right has been exercised and recognised by all the states.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>There liras no objection, to the sale arising from the constitution of Georgia. With regard to <em>state </em>constitutions, it is not necessary that the powers should be <em>expressly </em>granted, however it may be with the constitution of the United States. But it is not constitutional doctrine even a? it applies to the legislature of the United,States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-4\">The old articles of confederation limited the powers' of congress to those <em>expressly </em>granted. But in the constitution of the United States, the word <em>expressly </em>was purposely' rejected. <em>See the </em>Federalist, <em>and Journals of House of Rep. 21st August, 1789. </em>Jo<em>urnal of Senate, 7th </em>September, 1789.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">But if the legislature of Georgia could only .ex- . ercise. powers <em>expressly </em>given- they had no power to abrogate the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">A question has .been suggested from the bench whether the right which Georgia had before the. extinguishment of the Indian title, is such a right as is susceptible of conveyance,, and whether it can be said to be a title in fee-simple ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">The Europeans found the territory in possession of \u25a0 a rude and uncivilized people, consisting of separate and independent nations. They had no idea of property in- the soil but a right of occupation. A right not individual but national. This is the right gained by conquest. The Europeans always claimed and exercised the right of conquest over the soil. They allowed the former occupants a part, and took to themselves what was not wanted by the. natives. Even <em>P\u00e9nn </em>claimed under the right of conquest. He took Under a charter from, the King of England, whos\u00e9 right was the right of conquest. Hence the feudal tenures in this country. All the treaties with the Indians were the effectof conquest. All the extensive grants have been forced from them by successful war. The conquerors permitted the conquered tribes to occupy part of the land until it should be wanted, for the use of the conquerors. Hence the acts of legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>fixing the lines and bounds of the Indian claims; hence the prohibition of individual purchasers, \u00a1kc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-4\">The rights of governments are allodial. The crown of Great Britain granted lands to individuals, even while the Indian claim existed, and there has never been a question respecting the validity of such grants. When that claim was extinguished, the grantee was always admitted to have acquired a complete title. The Indian title is a mere privilege which does not affect the allodial right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\">The legislature of Georgia could not revoke a grant' once executed. It had no right \u25a0 to declare the law void; that is the exercise of a judicial, not a legislative function. It is the province of the judiciary to say \u2022 what the law is, or what it was. The legislature can only say what it <em>shall </em>be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-6\">The legislature was forbidden by the constitution of the United States to pass any law impairing the obligation of contract. . A grant'is a contract executed,' and it creates also ap implied <em>executory </em>contract, which is, that the grantee shall continue to enjoy the thing granted according to the terms of the gram\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-7\">The validity of a law cannot be questioned because undue influence may have been used in obtaining it. However improper it may be, and however severely the offenders may be punished, if guilty of bribery, yet the grossest corruption will not authorize a judicial tribunal in disregarding the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-9\">Tins would open a source of litigation which could never be closed.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlB\">delivered the opinion of the court upon the pleadings, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In this cause there are demurrers to three pleas filed in the circuit court, and a special verdict found on an issue joined on the 4*b plea. The pleas were all sustained, and judgment was rendered lor the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">To support this judgment, this court must concur in overruling all the demurrers; - for, if the plea to any one of the counts be bad, the plaintiff below is entitled, to damages on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The covenant, on which the breach in the first count, is assigned, is in these words; \u201c that the legislature of the said state, <em>(Georgia,) </em>at the time of the passing of the act of sale aipresaid, bed good right to sell and dispose of the same, in manner pointed out by the said act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The breach of this covenant is assigned in these words; \u201cnow the said Fletcher saith that, at the time when the said act oi the legislature of Georgia, entitled an act, &amp;c. was passed, the said legislature bad no authority to sell and dispose of the tenements aforesaid, or of any part thereoi, in the manner pointed out in the said act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The plea sets forth the constitution of the state of Georgia, and avers that the lands lay within that state. It'ihen sets forth the act of the legislature, and avers that the lands', described'in the declaration, are included within those to be sold by the said act; and that the <em>governor </em>was legally empowered to sell and convey the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">To this plea the plaintiff demurred; and the defendant joined in the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">If it be admitted that sufficient matter is shown, in this plea, to have justified the defendant in denying the breach alleged in the count, it must also be admitted that he has not denied it. The breach alleged is, that the legislature had not authority to sell.. The bar set up is, that the governor had authority to convey. Certainly an \u00e1llegation, that the principal has no 'right to give a'power, is not denied by alleging that he has given a proper power to the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">It is argued that the plea shows, although it does not, in terms, aver, that the legislature had authority to convey. The court does not mean to controvert this position, but its admission would not help the .Case. The matter set forth in the plea, as matter of inducement, may be argumentatively good, may warrant an averment which negatives the averment in the .declaration, but does not itself constitute that negative.</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">Had the plaintiff tendered an issue in fact upon this plfea, that the governor was legally empowered to sell and convey the premises, it would have been a departure from his-declaration;, for the count to which this plea is intended as a bar alleges no want of authority in the governor. He was therefore under the necessity of demurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">, But it is contended that although the plea be sub. Stantially bad, the judgment, overruling the demurrer, is correct, because the declaration is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The defect alleged in the declaration is, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>breach is not assigned in the words of the covenant. The covenant is, that the legislature had a <em>right </em>to convey, and the breach is, that the legislature had no <em>mi- </em>\u25a0 <em>thority </em>to convey.,</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aq1\"><em>March </em>16,1810,</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">It is not necessary that a breach should be assigned in the very words of the covenant. It is enough that the words of the assignment show, unequivocally, a substantial breach.- The assignment undbr consideration does show such a breach* If the legislature ' had no <em>authority </em>to convey, it had no <em>right </em>to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">It is, therefore, the opinion ot this court, that the circuit court erred in overruling the demurrer to the firpt plea by the defendant pleaded, and that their judgment ought therefore to be reversed, and that judgment on that plea be rendered for the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">After the opinion of the court was delivered, the parties agreed to amend the pleadings, and the cause \u25a0was continued for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The cause having been again argued at this term, -</p>\n<author id=\"b135-8\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alo\">delivered the opinion--of the court as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The pleadings being now amended, this cause comes \u25a0 on again to be heard on sundry demurrers, and on a. special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The suit was instituted on several covenants contained in a deed made by John Peck, the defendant in error, conveying to Robert Fletcher, the plaintiffin error, certain lands which were part of a large purchase made by-James Gunn and others, in the year 1795, from the state of Georgia, the contract for which w.as made in the form of a bill passed by the legislature of that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The first count in the declaration set forth a breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in- the second covenant contained in the deed. Thq covenant is, \u201c that the legislature of the state of Geoiw gia, at the time of passing the act of sale aforesaid, had good right to sell and dispose of the same in manner pointed out by the said act.\u201d The breach assigned is, that the legislature had no power to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The plea in bar sets forth the constitution of the state of Georgia, and avers that the lands sold by the defendant to the plaintiff, were within that state. It then sets forth the granting act, and avers the power of the legislature to sell and dispose of the premises as pointed out by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">To this plea the plaintiff below demurred, and the defendant joined ip demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">That the legislature of Georgia,( unless restrained by its own constitution, possesses the power of disposing of the unappropriated lands within its own limits, in such manner- as its own judgment shall dictate, is a proposition-not to be controverted., \u2022 <em>The </em>only questioti, then, presented by this demurrer, for the consideration of the court, is this, did the then constitution of the state of Georgia prohibit the legislature to dispose of the lands, which were the subject of this' contract, in the manner stipulated by the contract ?.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The question, whether a law be void for its repu gnancyto .the constitution's, at all times, a \u00abquestion of much delicacy, which ought Seldom, if ever, to be-decided in the affirmative, in a doubtful case. The court, when impelled by duty to render such a judgment, would be unworthy of its station, could it be unmindful of the solemn obligations which that station imposes. Rut it is not on slight implication and vague-conjecture that the .legislature is to be pronounced to have transcended its powers, and its acts to be considered as void. The opposition between the constitution a,nd the law should be such that the judge feels a clear and strong conviction of -their incompatibility with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In this case' th.e court can perceive no such opposition. In the constitution of Georgia, adopted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>year 1789, the court can perceive no restriction on the legislative power, which inhibits the passage of the act\" of 1795. The court cannot say that, in passing that act, the legislature has transcended its powers, and violated the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In overruling the demurrer, therefore, to the first plea, the circuit court committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The Sd covenant is, that all the title which the state of Georgia ever had in the premises had been legally conveyed to John Peck, the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The 2d count assigns, in substance, as a breach of this covenant, that the' original grantees from the state of Georgia promised and assured divers members of the legislature, then sitting in general assembly, that if the said members would assent to, and vote for, the passing of the act, and if. the said bill should pass, such members should have a share of, and be interested in, all the lands purchased from the said state by virtue of such law. And that divers of the said members, to whom the said promises were made, were unduly influenced thereby, and, under such influence, did vote for the passing of the said bill; by reason' whereof the said law was a nullity, &amp;c. and so the title of the state of Georgia did not pass to the said Peck, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The plea to this count, after protesting that the promises it alleges were not made, avers, that until alter the purchase made from the original grantees by James Greenleaf, under whom the said Peck claims, neither the said James Greenleaf, nor the said Peck, nor any of the mesne vendors between the said Greenleaf and Peck, had any notice or knowledge that any such promises or assurances were made by the said original grantees, or either of them, to any of the members of the legislature of the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">To this plea the plaintiff demurred generally, and the defendant joined in the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>That corruption should find its way into the governments of our infant republics, and contaminate the very source of legislation, or that impure motives should contribute to the passage of a law, or the formation of a legislative contract, are circumstances most deeply to be deplored. How far a court of justice would, in any case, be competent, on proceedings instituted by the state itself, to vacate a contract thus formed, and to annul rights acquired, under that contract, by third persons having no notice of the improper means by which it was obtained, is a question which the court would approach with much cir- , cumspection. It may well be doubted how far the validity of a law depends upon the motives of its framers, and how far the particular inducements, operating on members of the supreme sovereign power, of a state, to the forination of a contract by that power, are examinable in a court of justice. If the principle be conceded, that an act of the supreme sovereign power might be declared null by a court, in consequence of the means which procured it, still would there be much difficulty in saying to what extent those means must be applied to produce this effect. Must it be direct corruption, or would interest or undue influence of any kind be sufficient ? Must the vitiating cause operate on a majority, or on what number of the members ? Would the act be null, whatever might be the wish of the nation, or would its obligation or nullity depend upon the public sentiment ?</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">it the. majority of the legislature be corrupted, it may well be doubted, whether it be within the province of the judiciary to control-their conduct, and,, if less than a majority act from impure motives, the principle by which judicial interference would be regulated, is not clearly discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Whatever difficulties this subject might present, when viewed under aspects of which it may be susceptible, this court can perceive none in.-the_particular pleadings now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">This is not a bill brought by the state of Georgia, to annul the contract, nor does it appear to the court, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>this count, that the state of Georgia is dissatisfied with the sale that has been made. The case, as made out in the pleadings, is simply this. One individual who holds lands in the state of Georgia* Under a deed covenanting that the title of Georgia was in the grant- or, brings an action of covenant upon this deed, and assigns, as a breach, that some of the members of the legislature were induced to vote in favour of the law, which constituted the contract, by being promised an interest in it, and that therefore the act is a mere nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">This solemn question cannot be brought thus Collaterally and incidentally before the court. It would be indecent, in the extreme, upon a private contract, between two individuals, to enter into an inquiry respecting the corruption of the sovereign power of a state. If the title be plainly deduced from.a-legislative act, which the legislature might constitutionally pass, if the act be clothed with all the requisite farms of a law, a court, sitting, as a court of law, cannot sustain a suit brought by one individual against another founded on the allegation that the act is a nullity, in consequence of the impure motives which influenced certain members of the legislature which passed the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The circuit court, therefore, did right in overruling this demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The 4th covenant in the deed is, that the title-to the premises has been, in no way, constitutionally or legally impaired by virtue of any subsequent act of an^ subsequent legislature of\" the state of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The third count recites the undue means practised On certain members of the legislature, as stated in the second count, and then\"alleges that, in consequence of these practices, and of other causes, a subsequent legislature passed an act annulling and .rescinding the law under which the conveyance to the original grantees was made, declaring that conveyance void, and asserting the title of the state to the lands it contained. The, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>count proceeds to recite at large, this rescinding act, and concludes with averring that, by reason of this act, the title of the said Peck in the premises was constitutionally and legally impaired, and rendered null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">After protesting, as before, that no such promises were made as stated in this count, the defendant agaih pleads that, himself and the first purchaser under the original grantees, and all Intermediate holders jpf die property, were purchasers withoutnotice.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">To this plea there is a demurrer-andjcinder,</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The importance and thcLdiffieulty of the questions, presented by these pleadings, are deeply felt- by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The lands in controversy vested absolutely in James Gunn and others, the original grantees, by the conveyance of 'the governor, made in pursuance of attwrt nf assembly to which the legislature was fully, competent. Being thus in full possession of the legal, estate, they, for a valuable consideration, conveyed portions of the land to those who were willing to purchase, If the original transaction was infected with_fraud, these purchasers did not participate in it, and_hacL.no notice of it. They were innocent. -Yet the legislature of Georgia has involved thern in thejfate-of- the first parties to the transaction, and, if the act be valid, has annihilated their rights also.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The legislature of Georgia was a party to this transaction ; and for a party to pronounce its own deed invalid, whatever cause may be assigned for its invalidity, m\u00fcst be considered as a mere act of power which must find its vindication in a train of reasoning not often heard in courts of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">But the real party, it is said, are the people, and when their. agents are unfaithful, the acts of those agents cease to be obligatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">It is, however, to be recollected that the people can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>act only by these agents, and that, while within the powers conferred on them, their acts must be considered as the acts of the people; If the agents be cor-, rupt, others may be chosen, and, if their contracts be examinable, the common sentiment, as well as common usage of mankind, points out a mode by which this examination may be made, and their validity determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">If the legislature of Georgia was not bound to submit its pretensions to those tribunals which ar\u00e9 established for the security of property, and to decide on human rights, if it might claim to itself the power of judging in its own case,,yet. there are certain great, principles of justice, whose authority is universally acknowledged, that ought not to be entirely disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">If the legislature be its own judge in its own case, it would seem equitable that its decision should be regulated by those rules which would have regulated the decision of a judicial tribunal. The question was, in its nature, a question of title, and the tribunal which decided it was either acting in the char\u00e1c-, ter of a court of justice, and performing a duty usually assigned to a court, or it was exerting a mere \u00e1ct bf power in which it was controlled only by its own will\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">If a suit be brought to set aside a conv\u00e9yance ob-tamed by fraud, and the fraud be clearly proved, the conveyance will be set aside, as between the parties; but the rights of third persons, who. are purchasers without notice, for a valuable consideration, cannot be disregarded. Titles, which, according to every legal test, are perfect, are acquired with that .confidence which is inspired by the opinion that the purchaser is safe. If there be any concealed defect, arising from the conduct of those who had held the property long before he acquired it, of which he had no notice, that concealed defect cannot be set up against him, He has paid his money for a title good at law, he is innocent, whatever may be the guilt of others, and equity will not subject him to the penalties attached to that guilt. All titles would be insecure, and the' inter\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>course between man and man would be very serious^ obstructed, if this principle be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"A6K\">A court of chancery, therefore, had a bill been brought to set aside the conveyance made to James Gunn and others, as beipg obtained by improper practices' with - the legislature, whatever might have been its decision as respected the. original grantees, would have been bound, by its own rules, and by the clearest principles of .equity, to leave unmolested those who were purchasers, without notice, for a valuable consi* deration.'</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">If the legislature felt itself absolved from those rules\u2019 of property which are common to all the citizens of the United States, and from those principles of equity which are acknowledged in all our courts, its act is to be supported by its power alone, and the same power may deVest any other individual of his lands, if it shall be the will of the legislature so to exert it.</p>\n<p id=\"AUl\">It is not intended to speak with disrespect of the legislature of Georgia, or of its acts. Far from it. The question is a general qu'estioh, and . is treated as ,'on\u00e9i For although such powerful objections (to. a legislative grant, as are alleged against this, mdy-not again exist, yet the principle, on which alone ,.t{ys_rescinding act is to be supported, may be applied' to every case to which it shall be the will of any legislature to apply it. The principle is this; that a legislature may, by its own act, devest the vested estate\" of any man whatever, for reasons 'which shall, by itself, be deemed sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In this case the legislature may have had ample proof that the original grant was obtained_hy_pmctiees which can never be too much '-eprohateri, arid wJiich would, have justified its abrogation so far as respected those to whom crime was imputable., But the grant, when issued, conveyed an estate in fee-simple to the grantee, clothed with all the solemnities which law-can bestow. <em>-1 </em>his estate was transferrable; and those who purchased pqrts of it were not stained by that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>guilt which infected the original transaction. Their case is not distinguishable, from the ordinary case of purchasers of a legal estate without knowledge of any secret fraud which-might have led to the emanation of the original grant.' According to the'well known, course of equity, their, rights could nQt be affected by such fraud. Their situation was'the same, their, title was the same, with that of every other member of the community who holds land by regular conveyances from the original patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">Is the power of the legislature competent to the annihilation of such title, and to a resumption of the property thus held ?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The principle asserted is, that\u2019 one legislature, is competent to repeal any act which a former legislature was competent to pass ; and tliat one legislature' cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The correctness of this principle, so far as respects general legislation, can never be' controverted. But, if an act be done under a law, a succeeding legislature cannot undo it. The past cannot be recalled by the most absolute power. Conveyances have been made,' those conveyances have vested legal estates, and, if those estates may be seized by the sovereign authority, still, that they originally -nested ia fl fact, and rannnt cease to be a fact. '</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">When, then, a l\u00e1w is in its nature a contract, when absolute rights have vested under that contract, a repeal of the law cannot devest those rights; and. the-act of annulling them, if legitimate, is rendered so by a power applicable to the case of every indmdaal-itt the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">It may well be doubted whether the nature of society and of government does not prescribe some limits to the legislative power j and,'- if any be prescribed, where are they to-be found, if the property of.-an individual, fairly and honestly acquired, may be seized without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>To the legislature all legislative power is granted,; but the question, whether the act of transferring the. property of an individual to the.public,, be in the nature of the legislative power, is well worthy of serious reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">It is the- peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the-application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments. How far the power of 'giving the law may involve every other power,\" in cases where the constitution is silent, never has been, and perhaps never can be, definitely stated.-</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The. validity of -this rescinding act, then, might well.be doubted, were-Georgia a single sovereign power. Bui Georgia cannot be viewed as a single, unconnected, sovereign power, on whose legislature no other restrictious are imposed than may be found in its own constitution. \u25a0 She is a part of a large- empire; she is-a member of the American - union; and 'that union has a constitution the supremacy of which all acknowledge, and which imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states, which none claim a right to pass. \u00bfThe constitution - of the United State! declares that no 'state shall pass any. bill of attainder, <em>ex post faci\u00f3 law, </em>or law impairing the obligation of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Does the case now under consideration come within this prohibitory section of the constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">In considering this very interesting question, we ^ immediately ask ourselves, what is a contract? Xs_a ^ I grant a contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">A contract is a compact between two or more parties, and is either executory or executed. . An execu- \u25a0 tory contract is one in which a party binds himself to do, or not to do, a particular thing; such was the law under which the conveyance' was made by the governor. A contract executed1 is one in which the object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>of contract, is performed; and this, says Blackstone, differs in nothing from a grant. The contract between Georgia and the purchasers was executed by the grant. A contract executed, as well as one which is executory, contains obligations binding on the parties. A grant, in its own nature, amounts to an extinguishment of the right of the grantor, and implies a contract not to reassert that right. A party is, therefore, always estopped by his own grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Since, then, in fact, a grant is a contract executed, the obligation of which still continues, and since the constitution uses the general term contract, without distinguishing between those which \u00e1re executory and those which are executed, it must be construed to cornprehend the lattetuas-welk-as the former. A law. annulling conveyances between individuals, and declaring that the grantors should stand seised of their former estates, notwithstanding those grants, would be as repugnant to the constitution \u00e1s a law discharging the vendors of property from the obligation of executing their contracts by conveyances. It would be strange if a contract to convey was secured by the constitution, while an absolute conveyance remained unprotected.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">If, under a fair construction' the constitution, grants are comprehended under the term contracts, is a grant from the state excluded from the operation of the provision ? Is the clause to be considered as Inhibiting the state from impairing the obligation of contracts between two individuals, but as excluding from that inhibition contracts made with itself?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The words themselves contain no such distinction. They are general, and are applicable to contracts of every description. If contracts made with the state are t\u00f3 be exempted from their operation, the exception must arise from the character of tha contracting party, not from the words which are employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Whatever respect might have been felt for the state' sovereignties, it is not to be disguised that the framers of the constitution viewed, with some appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>h\u00e9ns\u00edbn,' the- violeto* acts which -tonight grow out of the feelings of the tnoment;. and that the people of the United States, in adopting that instrument; have manifested-a determination to shield'themselves, and their property from the effects of those sudden and strong passions to which men are exposed. The restrictions on the legislative power of the states are obviously founded in this sentiment; and the constitution of the United States contains what may.be deemed- a bill of rights for the people of each state.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">No state, shall pass'any bill of attainder, <em>ex post facie </em>law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A bill of attainder may affect the life' of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In this form the power of t.he legislature over the lives-and fortunes-of individuals is expressly restrained. What motive, then, for implying, in words which import a general prohibition to impair the obligation of \u25a0contracts, an exception in favour of the right,to impair the obligation of those contracts \u2022 into which the state may enter?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The state legislatures can pass no <em>ex post facto </em>law. An <em>ex post facto </em>law is one which renders an act pu.nishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed. Such a law may inflict penalties on the person, or may inflict pecuni\u00e1ry penalties which swell the public treasury. The legislature is then prohibited from passing a law by which a man\u2019s estate, or any part of it, shall be, seized for a crime which was not declared, by some previous law, to render him liable to that punishment. 'Why, then, should violence be done to the natural meaning o\u00a3 words for the purpose of leaving to the legislature the power of \u25a0 seizing, for public use, the estate of an individual in the form of a law annulling the title by which he holds \u2022that estate? The court can perceive no sufficient \u25a0 grounds for making this ^distinction. This rescinding act would have the effect of an, <em>ex post facto </em>law. It forfeits the estate of Fletcher' for a crime not committed by himself, but by those from whom he purchased. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>This cannot be effected in the form of an <em>ex post facto </em>law, or bill of attainder ; why, then, is it allowable in the form of a law annulling the original grant?</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The argument in favour of presuming an intention to except a case, not excepted by the words of the constitution, is susceptible, of some illustration from a principle originally ingrafted in that instrument, though no longer a part of it. The constitution, as passed, gave the courts of the United States jurisdiction in suits brought against individual states. A state, then, which-violated its own contract was suable in the courts of the United States for that violation. Would it have been a defence in such a suit to say th\u00e1t the stJtte had passed a law absolving itself from the contract ? It is scarcely to be conceived that such a defence could be set up. And yet, if a state is neither restrained by the general principles of our political institutions, nor by the words of the constitution, from impairing the obligation of its own contracts, such a defence would be \u00e1 va\u00edIcT one. This feature is no longer found in the constitution; but it aids in the construction of those clauses with which it was originally associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">It is, then, the unanimous opinion of the court, that, in this case, the estate having passed into the hands of a purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice, the state of Georgia was restrained, either by general principles which are common to our free institutions, or by the particular provisions of the constitution of the United States, from passing a law whereby the estate of the plaintiff in the premises so purchased could be constitutionally and legally impaired and rendered null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In overruling the demurrer to the Sd plea, therefore, there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The first covenant in the deed is, that the state of Georgia, at the time of the act of the legislature thereof, entitled as aforesaid, was legally seised in fee of the soil thereof subject only to the extinguishment of part of the Indian title thereon-</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The 4th\u00a1eoutit assigns, as a breach\u2019of this covenant, that the right to the soil was in the United States, and not in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">To this count the defendant pleads, that the state of Georgia <em>was seised ; </em>and tenders an issue on the fact in which the plaintiff joins. On this issue a special verdict is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The jury find the grant of Carolina by Charles second to the Earl of Clarendon and others, comprehending the whole country from 36 deg. 30 min. north lat. to 29 deg. north lat., and from the Atlantic to the South Sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">They find that the northern part of this territory was afterwards erected into a separate colony,- and that the most northern part of the 35 deg. of north lat. was. the boundary line between North \u00e1nd South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">That seven of the eight proprietors of the Carolinas surrendered to George 2d in the year 1729, who appointed a Governor of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">That, in 1732, George the 2d granted, to the Lord Viscount Percival and others, seven eighths of the territory between the Savannah and the Alatamaha, and extending we'st to the South Sea, and that the remaining eighth part, which was still the property of the heir of Lord Carteret., one of the original grantees of Carolina, was afterwards conveyed to them. This territory was constituted a colony and called Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">That the Governor of South Carolina continued to exercise jurisdiction south of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">That, in 1752, the grantees surrendered to the crown. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">That, -in. 1754, a governor was appointed by the crown, with a commission describing the boundaries of the colony.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">That a treaty of peace was concluded between Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Britairr and Spain, in 1763, in which the latter ceded to the former Florida, with Fort St. Augustin and the bay of Pensacola.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">That, in October, 1763, the King of Great Britain issued a proclamation, creating four new colonies, Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada ; and prescribing the bounds of each, and further declaring that all the lands between the Alatamaba, and St. Mary's should be annexed to Georgia. The same proclamation contained a clause reserving, under the dominion and protection of the crown, for the use-of the Indians, all the lands on the western waters, and forbidding a settlement on them, or a purchase of them from the' Indians. The lands conveyed to the plaintiff lie on the western waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">That, in November, 1763, a commission was issued to the Governor of Georgia, in- which the boundaries of that province are described, as extending westward to the Mississippi: A commission, describing boundaries of the same extent, was afterwards granted in 1764.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">That a war broke out between Great Britain and her colonies, which terminated in a treaty of peace acknowledging them as sovereign and independent states.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">That in April, 1787. a convention was entered into between the states of South' Carolina and Georgia settling the boundary line between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The juiy afterwards describe the situation of the lands mentioned, in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, in such manner that their lying within the limits of Georgia, as defined in the proclamation of 1763, in the treaty of peace, and in the convention between that state and South Carolina, has not been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The counsel for the plaintiff rest their argument on a single proposition,. They contend that the reservation for the use of the Indians, contained in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>clamation of 1763, excepts the lands on the western waters trom the colonies within whose bounds they would otherwise have been, and that they were acquired by the revolutionary war. All acquisitions during the war, it is contended, were made by the joint arms, for the joint benefit of the United States, and not for the benefit of any particular state.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The court does not understand the proclamation as it is understood by the counsel for the plaintiff. The reservation for the use of the Indians appears to be a temporary arrangement suspending, for a time, the settlement of the country reserved, and the powers of the royal governor within the territory reserved, but is not conceived to amount to an alteration of the boundaries of the colony. If the language of the proclamation be, in itself, doubtful, the commissions subsequent thereto, which were given to the governors of Georgia, entirely remove the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The question, whether the vacant lands within the United States became a joint property, or belonged to the separate states, was a momentous question which, at one time, threatened to shake the American confederacy to its foundation. This important and dangerous contest has been compromised, and the compromise is not now to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">It is the opinion of the court, that the particular land stated in the declaration appe.ars, from this special verdict, to lie within the state of Georgia, and that the state of Georgia had power to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Some difficulty was.produced by the language of the covenant, and of the pleadings. It was doubted whether a state can be seised in fee of lands, subject to the Indian title, and whether a decision that they were seised in fee, might.not be construed to amount to a decision that their grantee might maintain an ejectment for them, notwithstanding that title.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">l he majority of the court is of opinion that the nature of the Indian title, which is certainly to be re* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>spect\u00e9d by all courts, until it be legitimately extinguished, is not such as to be absolutely repugnant to seisin in fee-on the part of th&lt;\u00a1\u00a1 state.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b151-4\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">In this case I entertain, on two points, an opinion different from that which has been delivered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">I do not hesitate to- declare that a state does not possess the power of revoking its own grants. But I do it on a general principle, on the reason and nature of things: a principle which will impose laws .even oil the deity.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">A contrary opinion can only be maintained upon tfie ground that no existing legislature. can abridge the powers of those which will succeed it. To a certain extent this'is certainly correct; but the distinction lies between power and interest, the right of jurisdiction and the right of soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The right of jurisdiction is essentially connected to, or rather identified with, the national sovereignty. To part with it is to commit \u00e1 species of political suicid\u00e9. Iii fact, a power to produce its'own annihilation is an absurdity in terms. It is a power as utterly incommunicable to a political as to a natural person. But it is not so with the interests or property of a nation. Its possessions nationally are in nowise necessary 'to its poll ical existence;' they are entirely accidental, and' may be parted with in every respect similarly to those of the- individuals who '.compose the community,When the legislature have once conveyed their inte-\u2019 <em>\u2022rest </em>or property in any subject to the individual, they have lost all control over it; have nothing to act upon; it has-passed from them; is. vested in die individual; becomes intimately blended with his existence, as essentially so as the blood that circulates through his system. The government may indeed demand of him the one or the other,, not .because they \u00abare not his, but because whatever is his\u2019is his country\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"Ary\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>As totbe idea, that the grants of a legislature may _ be void because the legislature are'corrupt, it appears to me to be subject to insuperable-difficulties. The acts of the supreme power of a country must be considered pure for the same reason that all sovereign acts must be considered just; because there is*'no power that can declare them otherwise. The absurdity in-this case would have been strikingly perceived, could the party who.parsed the act of cession have got again into power, and declared\u2019themselves pure, and the intermediate legislature corrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The security of a people against the misconduct of their rulers, must lie in the frequent recurrence to first principles, and the imposition of adequate constitutional restrictions. Nor would it be difficult, with the. same view, for laws to be framed which would bring the conduct of individuals under the review of adequate tribunals, and make them suffer under the consequences of their own immoral conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">I have thrown out these ideas that I may have it distinctly understood that my opinion on this point is not founded on the provision in the constitution of the United States, relative to laws impairing the obligation of contracts. It is much to be regretted that words of less equivocal signification, bad not been adopted in that article of the constitution; There. is reason to believe, from the letters of Publius, which are well-known to be entitled to the highest respect, that the object of the convention was to afford a general protection to individual rights against the acts of the state legislatures. Whether the words, \u201c acts impairing the obligation of contracts,\u201d can be construed to have-the same force as- must have been given to the words \u201c obligation and <em>effect </em>of contracts,\u201d is the difficulty in my mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There can be no solid objection to adopting the technical definition of the word \u201c contract,\u201d given by Blackstorte. -The etymology, the classical signification, and the civil law idea of the word, will all support it. But the difficulty arises on the word obligation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>which certainly imports an existing moral or physical necessity. Now a grant or conveyance by no means necessarily implies the continuance of-an obligation beyond the moment of executing it. It is most generally but the consummation of a contract, is <em>functus officio, </em>the moment it is executed, and continues after-wards to be nothing more than the evidence that a certain act was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">I enter with great hesitation upon this question, because it involves a subject of the greatest delicacy and much difficulty. The states and the United States are continually legislating on the subject of contracts, prescribing the mode of authentication, the time within which suits shall be prosecuted for them, in many cases affecting existing contracts by the laws which they pass, and declaring them to cease or lose their effect for want of compliance, in the parties, with such statutory provisions. All these acts appear to be within the *\u25a0 most correct limits of legislative powers, and most beneficially exercised, and certainly could not have been Intended to be affected by this constitutional provision j yet where to draw the line, or how to define or limit the words, \u201c obligation of contracts,\u201d will be found a subject of extreme difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">To give if the general effect- of a restriction of the state powers in favour of private rights, is certainly going very far beyond the obvious and necessary import of the words, and would operate to restrict the states in the exercise of that right which every community must exercise, of possessing itself of the property of the individual, when necessary for public uses; a right which a magnanimous and just government will never exercise without amply indemnifying the individual, and which perhaps amounts to nothing more than a power to oblige him to sell and convey, when the piiblic necessities require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The other point on which I dissent from the opinion of the court, is relative to the judgment which ought to be given on the first count.'. Upon that count we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>called upon substantially to decide, \u201cthat the st\u00e1te of Georgia, at the time of passing the act of cession, was legally seised in fee of the soil, (then ceded,) subject only to the extinguishment of part of the Indian title.\u201d That is, that the state ot Georgia was seised of an estate in fee-simple in the lands in question, subject to another estate, we know not what, nor whether it may not swallow up the whole estate decided'to exist in Georgia. It would seem that the mere vagueness and uncertainty of this covenant- would be a sufficient objection to deciding in favour of it, but to me it appears that the facts in the\u2019 case are sufficient to support the opinion that the state of Georgia had not a <em>fee-simple </em>in the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">This is a question of much delicacy, and more fitted for a diplomatic or legislative than ajudicial inquiiy. But I am called upon to make a decision, \u00e1nd I must make it upon technical principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The question is, whether it can be correctly predicated of the interest or estate which the state of Georgia had in these lands, \u201c that the state was seised thereof, in fee-si <em>rapt\u00e9,\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">To me it appears that the interest of Georgia in \u25a0 that land amounted to nothing, more than a-mere possibility, and that her conveyance thereof could operate legally only as a covenant to convey of to.stand seised to a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The correctness of this opinion will depend upon - a just view of the state of the' Indian nations. This will be found to be very various. ' Some have totally-extinguished their national fire, and submitted themselves-to the laws of the states: others have, by treaty, acknowledged that they hold their national existence at the will of the state within which they reside: others retain a limited sovereignty, and the-absolute proprietorship of their soil.' The latter is the case of \u2022 the tribes to the west of Georgia. We legislate upon the conduct of strangers or citizens within their limits, but innumerable treaties formed with them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>acknowledge them to be an independent people, and the uniiorm practice of acknowledging their right of soil, by purchasing from them, and restraining all persons from encroaching upon their territory, makes it unnecessary to insist upon their right of soil. Can, then, one nation be said to be seised of a fee-simple in lands, the right of soil of which is in another nation ? It is awkward to apply the technical idea of a fee-simple to the interests of a nation, but I must consider an abso-lute right of soil as an estate to them and their heirs.. A lee-simple estate may be held in reversion, but our law will not admit the idea of its being limited after a fee-simple. In fact, if the Indian nations be the absolute proprietors of their soil, no other nation can be said to have the same interest in it. What, then, practically, is the interest of the states in the soil of the Indians within their boundaries? Unaffected by particular treaties, it is nothing more than what was assumed at the first settlement of the country, to wit, a right of conquest or of purchase, exclusively of all competitors within'certain defined limits. All the restrictions upon the right of soil in the Indians, amount only to an exclusion of all competitors from their markets; and the limitation upon their sovereignty amounts to the right of governing every person within their limits except themselves. If the interest in Georgia was nothing more than a pre-emptive right, how could that be called a fee-simple, which was nothing more than a power to acquire a. fee-simple by purchase, when the proprietots should be pleased to sell? And if this ever was any thing more than a mere possibility, it certainly was reduced to that state when the state of Georgia ceded, to the United States, by the constitution, both the power of pre-emption and of conquest, retaining for itself only a resulting right dependent on a purchase or conquest to be made by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">I have been very unwilling to proceed to the decision of this cause at all. It appears to me to bear strong evidence, upon the face of it, of being a mere feigned case. It is our duty to decide on the rights, but not on the speculations of parties. My confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>deuce, however, in the. respectable gentlemen , who have been engaged for the parties, has induce^ me to abandon my scruples, in the belief that they would never consent to impose a mere feigned case upon this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
