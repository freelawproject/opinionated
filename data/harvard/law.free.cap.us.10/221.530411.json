J. It has never been doubted in Virginia, that notice is as necessary in an action upon . \u25a0 the statute, as upon the custom of merchants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-12\">\n<em>Youngs.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adg\">There was no motion in arrest of judgment. This objection was not taken in the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-13\">Marshall, Ch. J. There can be t|o doubt that any thing appearing upon the record, which would have been fatal upon a motion in arrest of judgment is equally fatal upon a writ of error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-14\">\n<em>Youngs.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_qq\">This court, in the case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Riddle, 1 </em>Cranch, 290. decided, that an action by a holder of a promissory note against an endorsor is only by re\u00e1son of the <em>value received, </em>and yet in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Codman, </em>3 Cranch, 193. 208. this court decided that the averment of <em>value- received </em>was an immaterial averment, and need not be proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-16\">In our case if notice were necessary to entitle the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>plaintiff to a verdict, it will be presumed, after verdict, that notice was proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-5\">The statute upon which this action is founded does not require notice. The declaration avers all that the statute requires to constitute a cause of action. The want of notice is only to be taken advantage of by the defendant ih his defence at the trial. The time of bringing, this, action shows that reasonable notice was given. This court has decided that it is not necessary <em>io </em>give notice of a protest for non-acceptance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">\u25a0 <em>As to the question of damages. </em>The law of the place where the contract was made must prevail. The contract of. the defendant as endorsor, was made in Alexandria. Every endorsement creates a new contract, and is in the nature pf a new bill.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>March 5.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-8\">Marshall, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABB\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows, viz.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Upon a critical examination of the act of assembly oh which this action is founded, the court is of opinion that jt is rightly brought'. Although the drawer of the bill was not liable to the damages of Virginia, the endorsor is feubject.to them, he having endorsed the bill in Alexandria. The words of the act are, that where a bill of exchange 'shail-.be protested, \u201c the drawer <em>or </em>endorsor shall be subject to 15 <em>per- cent. </em>damages thereof.\u201d The third section giyes an action of debt \u201c against the drawers <em>or </em>endorsors jointly, or against either of them( separately. The act of assembly appears to contemplate a distinct liability in the endorsor, founded on the contract created by his own endorsement, which is not affected by the extent of the liability pf the drawer. This is the more reasonable, as a bill of' exchange is taken as much on the credit of the endorsor,. as of the drawer; and the'endorsement is understood to be not simplv the transfer of the paper, but a new and a substantive contract.</p>\n<p id=\"Abq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>'There is, however, an objection taken to this dec\u00eda\u00bb ration. It omits to allege notice tyf the protest; an. omission which is deemed fatal,</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">It has been argued that the act'of-assemblyy which givei the action\u25a0 of debt, not requiring notice .to be. laid in the declaration,' ihat requisite, which is only essential in an action founded on,the custom of merchants, is totally dispensed with. Rut this court is not of that opinion. In giving the action of debt to the holder of a bill of exchange, and in giving it the dignity ,of a specialty, the legislature has not altered the character of the paper in other respects. It is still a pure commercial transaction governed by commercial lavtu. Notice,.of the protest is still necessary, and the omission to aver it in the declaration is still fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Had this error.been moved in arrest of judgment, it is presumable the judgment would have been arrested; but it is not too-late ,to allege,.\u00e1s error, in this court, a fault in the declaration, which ought to have ' prevented the rendition of a' judgment in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The judgment is arrested, and the cause remanded with direction that the judgment be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">-After the opinion was delivered, <em>Youngs </em>praye that the cause might be remanded with leave to <em>amena</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Marshall, Ch. J. Here is a verdict which must be set aside before an amendment can be allowed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">It might be set aside by- the court below, but this can see no reason in the record for setting it aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
