That upon examining the order-books of the said court, he finds the entries made in all cases where persons were admitted to become citizens under the act of congress, \u00e1t and prior to October term, 1795, to be agreeably to the form used in the case of Mr. Currie. That However informal these entries may have been in not stating that it appeared to the court that the persons who took the oaths were of good moral character, and were admitted citizens; he is sensible every requisite of the- law in this, as well as in. all: other similar instances, was complied with- to the satisfaction of the court, and that the omission has been a clerical one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">He also finds, from the order-book, that at May term, 1796, the .form of the entry was altered so as to express the applicant to, he of good moral character, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">The application was made under the 2d section of the act of January 29,1795,(vol. 3. <em>p. </em>163.) which provides that any alien then residing within the limits, and under the jurisdiction of the United States, may be admitted to become \u00e1 citizen, on his declaring, on oath or affirmation, \u201c that he has resided two years at least within and under the jurisdiction of the same, and one year at least within the state or territory cere such <em>court </em>is at the time held; that he will Support the constitution of the United States, and that he doth absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty whatever, and particularly by name, the 'prince, potentate, state or sovereignty,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>whereof he was' before a citizen or subject; arid moreover, on its appearing to the satisfactiori of the court, 'that during the said term of two years he has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the constitution of the United States^ arid well disposed to the good order and happiness of the'same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\">\u201cAll of which proceedings, re\u2019quired in this proviso to be performed, in the court, shall be recorded by th\u00e9 clerk thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">The <em>Jtrst </em>section of the act requires only the oath of the party himself to be recorded; but the 2d section requires <em>all the proceedings </em>to be recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">When a matter is directed by act of parliament to be recorded, it cannot be proved otherwise than by record. <em>Peake's N. P. Cas. </em>p. 132. The deposition of the. deputy clerk is not competent evidence to prove what ought to have appeared upon the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\">It does not appear upon the record that the court was satisfied \u00e1s to the moral character of Mr. Currie, or his attachment to the constitution of the United States, or that the court admitted him to become \u00e1 citizen. They must either show an order of the court for his admission, <em>or </em>they must show that every thing has been done to entitle him to become a citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\">No decision goes farther than that the declaration of a competent court that every thing has been done according to law, is sufficient, and dispenses with showing <em>how </em>it was done. \u2022 But the court has not said so, nor does the record show it. Proof of good character, fee. is not a'prerequisite to permission to take the oath; if it was, the admission to take the oath might be considered as evidence that the court was satisfied as to the moral character, &amp;c. His application to the court was not to take the oath, but tp be admitted a citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-9\">The \u201c&amp;c.\u201d in the minutes, might have been extended <em>by the </em>clerk, according to his usual custom; but this court cannot undertake to extend it, or to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>what it means. Certainly not without direct and po* sitive proof of its meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-4\">2. But if William Currie was duly admitted a citizen, yet his daughter Janetta, being then in Scotland, was not thereby naturalized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">The words of the 3d section of the act Of f 795 are\u00bf \u201c that the children of persons duly naturalized, <em>dwelling xvithin the United States, </em>and being under the age of 21 years, <em>at the time of such naturq.li%ationf </em>\u201c shall be considered as citizens of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">Janetta, the daughter of William Currie, was not dwelling within the United States, at the time of his naturalization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-7\">The words, \u201c at the time of such naturalization,\u201d apply as well to the residence of the child as to heir age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-8\">If the child be naturalized, by the ftaturalization of the father, she must be naturalized <em>eo instanti. </em>It cannot be a naturalization, or not, according to a future event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-9\">The case would rarely happen of a parent coming to this country, residing two years, becoming a citizen, and leaving his children in a foreign country. Congress meant to provide for the more common case of a man coming with- his children. They intended that all that were with him, under age at the time of his naturalization should \u2019 partake of the benefit of his act. But they could not mean that the naturalization of a father should naturalize all his progeny under age, wherever they resided. Reasons of policy would forbid it. Their education, manners, habits, prejudices, and prepossessions would all be foreign, and uncongenial with our manners,, principles, and systems of government. A child might in this manner become a citizen without renouncing his title of nobility.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-10\">The act of 1795 is to have the same construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>as the act of 1802, <em>vol. </em>6. <em>p. </em>79. \u00a7 4. 2 <em>Tuck. Bl. </em>249. 1 <em>Tuck. Bl. part </em>2. Appendix, 101.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-3\"><em>Swann, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-4\">The \u201c &amp;c.\u201d in the. clerk\u2019s minutes, means every thing that was necessary to be done to entitle Mr. Currie to-become a citizen.. If the requisites of the statute : were complied, with, it required the order of the court-to admit him to become a citizen. He became such by virtue of the'act of congress. The testimony as to .moral character, and attachment-to the constitution of the United States, may be taken out of court, or the court nuty be satisfied of their own\u2018knowledge. He was naturalized <em>de facto </em>when he complied with the requisites of the. act, and the: neglect or error of the clerk cannot deprive' him of the privileges of a citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-6\">It was immaterial where the child ivas, if she was under age at the time of her father\u2019s naturalization.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>February 20.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-8\">Washington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATD\">after stating the case as before mentioned, delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The title of -the appellees to the land in question being disputed only upon the ground of- the alienage of, the female appellee, the court take it for granted that there is no other objection to its validity. It is contended, by .the counsel for. the appellant, that Ja-, netta,.wh\u00f3 claims as heir to James Currie, is an alien, inasmuch as' she has, by no act-of'her. ovijn, entitled . herself to the rights and privileges of a citizen, and cannot claim those rights in virtue of her migration' to the United States, and of any acts performed by her father. First, because her father was not <em>duly </em>naturalized; and, secondly, because, if he were, she was not, at the time of her father\u2019s naturalization,\" dwelling within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In support of the first objection it is contended that, although the oath prescribed bv the second section of act of congress entitled \u201c An act to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and to repeal the act heretofore passed on that subject,\u201d passed the 29th of January, 1795, was administered to the said William Curri\u00e9, by a court of competent jurisdiction, still it, does not appear, by the certificate granted to hint by the court, and appearing in the record, that he was, by the judgment of the court, <em>admitted d </em>citizen, or that the court was satisfied that, during the term of two years, mentioned in the same section, he had behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to. die Constitution of tlje United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">It is true, that this requisite to his admission is not stated in -the certificate ; but it is the opinion of this court, that the court of Suffolk must have been satisfied as to the character of the applicant, or otherwise a certificate, that the oath prescribed by law had been taken, would not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"A-3\">It is unnecessary to decide whether, in the order of time, this satisfaction, as to the character of the applicant, must be first given, or whether'it may not be required after the oath js administered, and, if not then given, whether a certificate of naturalization- may not be withheld. But if the oath be administered, and nothing appears- to the contrary, it must be presumed, that the court, before whom the oath was taken, was satisfied as to the character of the applicant. The oath, when taken, confers upon him the rights of a citizen, and' amounts to a judgment of the court for his admission to those rights. It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of the court,, that William Currie was duly naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The next qu\u00e9stion to be decided is, whether the naturalization of William Currie conferred upon his daughter the rights of . a citizen, after her coming to, and residing within, the. United States, shehaving been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>a resident in a foreign country at the time when her father was naturalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Whatever-difficulty might exist as to the construction of the .third section of the act of the 29th of January, 1795,'in relation to this point, it is conceived that the rights of citizenship were .clearly conferred upon the female appellee, by the fourth section of the act of the 14th of April,' 1802.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">This act declares that the children of persons duly' naturalized under any of the laws of the United States, being under the age of 21 years at the time of their parent\u2019s^ being so. naturalized, shall, if dwelling in the United States, be considered as \u25a0 citizens of the United States. This is precisely the case \u00f3f Mrs. Gordon. Her -father was duly naturalized, at which time she was an <em>infant; </em>but she came to the United States before the year <em>1802, </em>and was at the time- when this law passed, dwelling within the United States.- .</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of'the court that, at the time of-the death of James Currie, Mrs. Gordon was entitled to all the right and privilege of a citizen; and therefore that there is no error, in the decree pf th\u00e9 circuit court for the district of Virginia, which is <em>to. be affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
