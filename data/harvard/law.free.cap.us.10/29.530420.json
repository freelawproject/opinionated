That he remained. with his vessel off the port, endeavouring' obtain permission to\u2018enter it on more ad van-' tageous terms, until the' 3l|t of March, when, find-that such permission could not be obtained, he sailed with the .vessel and carg\u00f3, <em>towards </em>the port pi\" Amsterdam,'in. the island of Curra^oa, with a view and - intention of ascertaining, by inquiring from-British ships of war, or other, ships, or by actual inspection, or other proper means, whether the s\u00a1aid port was -in a state of blockade, and of entering it, if he should find it not blockaded. That about four months before, he had been informed in Baltimore, that an American vessel, bound to that port, had-been warned off by the British blockading force; qnd a report, which he had heard in Baltimore before he sailed, that the island was still blockaded, induced him to. suppose, at-the time of sailing towards Amsterdam, that that port might still be in a state of blockade, <em>(he then being ignorant of that facti </em>and <em>not having been able to. obtain information, \u25a0relative thereto off </em>'Lftguira,) and to resolve to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>inquiry as aforesaid, before he. attempted to enter the port. That,, on the first of April, on hjs pas*sage to Amsterdam, being then about 28 or SO miles distant thepefrom, he. discovered a ship, distant about 21 miles, and immediately changed his course and stood towards her, for the, purpose of inquiring whether Amsterdam was still blockaded., The ship ' was the British ship of war \u201c Fortune,\u201d and was then supporting alone the blockade of the port of Amsterdam.. While standing towards her, she seized and captured, 'the schooner as prize, under pretence of an attempt to . break the blockade, and sent her to Jamaica, where the vessel and cargo were condemned as good prize,. whereby they were totally lost to the plaintiff.

That the usual course of trade for vessels from Baltimore with cargoes for Laguira, assorted for the Spanish Main, is <em>to </em>proceed to the port of <em>Amsterdam, </em>if refused permission to enter <em>Laguira. </em>That vessels in such .cases <em>never </em>proceed to <em>Cumana </em>or <em>New Barcelona. </em>That except Amsterdam, and .the said ports on the Spanish Main, the nearest port to Laguira, used for the purposes of trade, is in the island of <em>Porto', Pico, </em>distant more than 120 leagues. But that <em>Car</em>thdgena, on the Spanish Main, although more distant than <em>Porto </em>Pico, maybe reached from <em>Laguira </em>in a shorter .time, being more in the course of the winds. That there is no port in the island of Bonaire, except a small roadstead on, the west side of'the inland, where there is a small battery and military post. -That a- vessel bound from Laguira to Amsterdam, could not touch at the said roadstead without going.about five leagues out of her .way, and be.ing delayed three or four hours, and that there, is no other place, in the neighbourhood of Laguira qr of Amsterdam, except <em>Porto Cabello, </em>where information could then have been had respecting the continuance of the blockade. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">' The <em>defendants </em>then offered evidence-to the jury, that when Travers sailed from Baltimore, and when' he arrived at Laguira, and when he sailed -from thence and arrived near the island of Curraba, he had reason-to believe, and <em>did know, </em>that that island <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>was actually blockaded and <em>attempted </em>to ehter the port of Amsterdam. That when the insurance was effected, a vessel might enter Cumana and Porto Cabello without' first obtaining permission elsewhere. That the Spanish government was a party in the. war. That it has been usual and customary for vessels sailing from Baltimore, having cargoes suitable to the markets bn the Spanish Main, to proceed direct to-either of the ports of Cumana, New Barcelona, Porto Cabello, Maracaibo, or Carthagena, without first calling at Laguira for permission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">Whereupon the <em>plaintiff </em>prayed the direction of the court to the jury, that it. they believe the matters so offered in evidence <em>by </em>him, then the proceeding towards the port of Amsterdam for the purposes and in the manner so by the <em>plaintiff\" </em>stated, and offered in evidence, doth not in operation of. law deprive him of his right to recover for the said losses under the said policies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">But the court were of opinion, and so directed the jury, that rf they shall be satisfied from the evidence in the case, that Travers, the master of the schooner, had reason to believe that the island of Curra^oa was actually blockaded at the tinie when, he sailed .from Laguira, and when he arrived near the said island, and that he attempted to enter the port of' Amsterdam; then the plaintiff cannot maintain the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">\u201e To which opinion the plaintiff:' excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">The 2d bill of exceptions stated that the defendants, in addition.to the-evidence by them offered as stated in the first bill of exceptions, gave in evidence that Captain Travers might have obtained information at Laguira of the blockade of Currafoa, (it' being well and'generally known there,) if he had made the inquiry; but that he made no such inquiry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-10\">That there is a small island to the eastward of \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>C\u00farralo\u00bb, called <em>Bonaire, </em>and about 20 miles disdant therefrom on the direct and usual route to Curra^oa, and where Captain Travers might also have received information of the blockade, but he sailed piast the island without stopping thereat, or taking any measures whatever to learn whether the blockade existed or not. \u2022 That after Travers found he could not sell his cargo to advantage at Laguira, he <em>determined </em>to proceed to <em>Porto Pico, </em>ahd as Curra9oa was very little out of the course, to ascertain whether the blockade still continued. That on the 12th of April, 1804, the blockade of Cunaos was notified by the British minister to our. government, and that there had been no notification of a discontinuance thereof. That when the schooner left Baltimore, it was generally <em>reported and understood, </em>that Curra90a was blockaded. They also offered in evidence the record an,d proceedings of the admiralty court at Jamaica, and that the schooner was cori- \u25a0 d\u00e9mned on the ground of an <em>attempt </em>to violate the blockade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnJ\">Whereupon the plaintiff offered in evidence all -the matters by him offered in evidence as stated in the first bill of exceptions, which bill of exceptions is referred and made part of this bill of exception^, and also offered in evidence that the matters by the defendants stated in this and the foregoing bill of exceptions are untrue; and also that.Travers, while lying off Laguira, did inquire whether the blockade* of Chrracoa still continued, and could obtain no information on that subject; and also that at the time he discovered the ship of war, he might have proceeded to, and entered into; the port of Amsterdam without being intercepted by the frigate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">Upon which aforesaid statement of facts, so given in evidence, the\u2019 <em>defendants </em>pray the court to instruct the jury .that the said Travers was not justified in sailing from Laguira and passing' the island;, of Bonaire without inquiring,there - whether the port of Amsterdam was blockaded, and that in consequence thereof, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>But the court were of </em>opinion, that if the jury shall.be satisfied, from the evidence in the. case, that Travers sailed from Lagiiira for Amsterdam,, with intent to enter that port if not actually, blockaded, but if blockaded not to attempt to enter, but to sail for the island of St. Thomas ; and'if the jury shall be satisfied, from the evidence, that. Travers did not \u00a1attempt to enter the said port, but was captured on his way thither, at the distance of 29 or 3\u00d3 miles therefrom; the court directed the jury that such conduct of Travers was. not unlawful, and that, notwithstanding such conduct, the plaintiff can maintain the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-4\">The 3d bill of exceptions stated that the defendants, upon all the matters in the preceding bills of exceptions contained, prayed the court to instruct the jury that if they believe .that the blockade was notified by the British government to the American government, in a reasonable time before Travers sailed, and that it was generally known in \u2022 Baltimore before he sailed, and that he had been informed of it, and knew of the general report and belief, and under these circumstances sailed from Laguira to the port of Amsterdam, without making due inquiry, at Laguira, whether the blockade subsisted at Amsterdam, and passed Bonaire without making such inquiry, to the place where he was captured, then he. was not justifiable in proceeding . on the said voyage to Curra^oa, there to make inquiry, not having first made the inquiry in the neighbouring ports of Laguira and Bonaire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">The court refused to give the instruction as prayed, but repeated the instruction stated in the second bill of exceptions; to which the defendants ekceptedo</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">The 4th bill of exceptions stated that the defendants prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they shall be of opinion that there are three ports on the Spanish Main, viz. Port Cabello, \u00ab the distance of 21 leagues from Laguira, Maracaibo at 93 leagues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>from Laguira, and about 2 1-2 degrees, further west than Amsterdam., and Carthagena at the distance of 185 leagues from Laguira to the westward, and that the prevailing winds there are generally from the eastward, and that a voyage may be performed, with more facility from Laguira to Porto Cabell\u00f3 than to Currapoa, and from Laguira to- Maracaibo and Carthagena, than to the island of St. Thomas, or Parto Rico. That those ports are situated on the Spanish.Main, and under the government and jurisdiction of the King of Spain. That vessels sailing from the ports of the United States,, are in the habit of sailing direct to the said ports of .Porto Cabello, Maracaibo, and Carthagena without obtaining permission from the government at Laguira. That vessels leaving the United States with cargoes sujted to the market on the Spanish Main, frequently sailed from Laguira, to one or other of. the above-mentioned ports for the disposal ol their' cargoes!. That the island of Curracoa belongs to the Dutch government, who were parties to the war. That there are two other ports on the Spanish Main, under the Spanish government, lying to windward of Laguira, viz. Cumana1, <em>70 </em>leagues, and New-Barcelona, 57 leagues from Laguira, but the voyage from Laguira to those ports is more difficult-than the voyage to- Curracoa, which is 147 mile\u2019s. That CurKr^oa was known to be blockaded, and so notified by the British government to that of the United States tt reasonable time' before Travers sailed, and that he knew the same at the commencement of the voyage; then Amsterdam was not a port to which he was entitled to gp under the said policy.

That the court ought not to have permitted parol evidence .to bev,given of. the intention of Captain Travers to break the blockade, because the sentence of condemnation was conclusive evidence of that attempt. Curra^\u00f3a was not \u00e1 port within the policy, because the policy did not give leave tp sail to a blockaded port.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-7\">2., A <em>neighbouring </em>port, means a port on the Spanish Main, unde\u00ed the same government as Laguira.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-8\">St.' Thomas was not a neighbouring port j if it was, he deviated in going <em>to </em>Currado a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-9\">He sailed for Curra^oa with a knowledge that it was blockaded, and therefore the defendants are .discharged.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-10\"><em>Harper, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-11\">The evid&amp;nse is conflicting as to the knowledge of the captain of the blockade, and therefore upon that point this court can give no opinion. \u2022 The only evidence of such knowledge is, that there was a blockade at a prior period, which had been notified to our government. But there is a difference between a blockade by notification, and a blockade <em>de facto. </em>A\" vessel has a right to go and inquire of the blockading for.ce. ' The British government had declared that no blockades should be considered as existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in the West Indies, except blockades <em>de </em>facto, and then not to capture them unless they should have been previously warned off. Under this order and declaration of the British government, Travers had a right to go and see whether the port was or was not actually blockaded. This court will not extend the principle of blockade farther than it has been. extended by the British government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-4\">The voyage, then, to Currados, was lawful. Tr\u00e1vers was in the due course of the voyage, and it was altogether immaterial whether h\u00e9 had any or what \u2022ther port eventually in view.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-5\">Martin, <em>in </em>reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">Travers had no right to sail for Currados, knowing it to blockaded. If there be in fact a blockade, no vessel knowing that fact has a right to go to the blockaded port for inquiry. If she does, she is not, by the law of nations,.entitled to warning, but is food prize at once. \u2022 <em>lile hostis est qui dat auxilium pstibus. </em>If she sails to a blockaded port, knowing it to be blockaded, she assumes the. hostile character, and, is to be treated in all respects like an enemy. This was a blockade by notification as well as <em>de facto. </em>Our government had express notice, and. all our citizens are ,to be presumed to have notice, also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">The- British treaty is not in force, but it is a correct exposition of the law of nations ion the subject \u00aef blockade. <em>Fitzsimmons </em>v. <em>Newport Ins. Co. </em>4 Cranch, 199.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">The sentence is conclusive evidence of the <em>breach of blockade, </em>notwithstanding the clause in the policy that proof of the: property being American is tq be made here ohly. We g.clmit the property was. American t \u2014 we admit every thing that is, to be proved under that clause. But it was not agreed that the question, of <em>breach of blockade </em>should be tried here only.. If the clause is to be so construed, it would place the'insurance companies entirely in the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>of the insured, because all the persons on hoard are *be agents of the assured, and interested to justify their own conduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-4\">It is the duty of the insured and his agents to do nothing to increase the risk, and to do all in his power to avoid <em>loss; </em>and their negligence, or improper conduct will discharge the underwriters. Thus in the case of the <em>ship </em>Atlantic, Marshall, 321., want of a passport at first sailing, although obtained before capture, and although the capture was not for want of that paper, yet the underwriters were discharged. The insured is answerable for all the improper conduct of the master if it do not amount: to barratry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">Travers knew that Currado a was blockaded,' at least he had the strongest grounds of believing it; and if he was not certain, he ought to have inquired at Laguira, or \u2022 at Bonaire. This neglect increased \u2022the risk and discharged the underwriters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">Currajoa was not a neighbouring port within the meaning of the policy. It means only a port on the Spanish Main. General expressions may be restrained by the nature of the case. Thus, in the . case of <em>Hogg </em>v. Horner, 2 Marshall, 397. the expression in a policy on a voyage from Lisbon to London, \u201c with liberty to touch at any port in Portugal,\u201d wa.s construed to mean any port to the northward of Lisbon only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-7\">Tlie fifth, exception was taken to the opinion of the court, to show a repugnance between that and -the opinion\" stated in the second bill of exceptions; \"for if it was unlawful to go to Porto Rico and St. Thomas, it was equally so to go to Curra^oa.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-8\">As to the sixth exception to the opinion that the intention to go to St. Thomas in case Curraron should be blockaded did not vitiate the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-9\">There must, \u00e1t the commencement of the voyage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>from Laguira, be a <em>certain fixed terminus ad queni. </em>Otherwise the door would be open to fraud upon the Underwriters,; as there could be no deviation. It ought to have been entered in the log-book to what por t they were bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-3\"><em>Neutral </em>property may 'be condemned for violation of blockade. 1 <em>Rob. </em>144. <em>Ship Neptunus. </em>We ad* mit the property to be American, and neutral, but this American neutral vessel attempted to break the blockade.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-4\">A <em>notified </em>bloc.kade is presumed <em>prima facie to </em>continue until the- contrary be notified, or the' blockade be removed <em>de facto. </em>2 <em>Rob. </em>92, 93. 106. 108. 1 <em>Marsh. </em>65. 1 <em>Rob. </em>131.

The nature of the voyage was called in aid of the construction, and it was decided to mean any port in the course of the voyage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">The clause as to proof of the neutrality of -the property applies to its neutral character throughout the whole voyage;</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">Travers had a right to proceed towards ne blockaded, port for inquiry, even upon British pi inciple?, prior to the order of 1804. But after th T order there can be no doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-10\">Although there are <em>dicta </em>that;a vessel sailing for a blockaded port knowingly is liable to' be condemned, yet in no cafe,is it the direct and sole \u2022ground of condemnation. In the c\u00e1se of the Co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>lumbia, the. vessel Was taken in the actual attempt to break the blockade. But this doctrine is <em>overruled. </em>by the court of \u00e9rrors and appeals in New York. 1 <em>Caines' Cases in </em>Error, 8. 1 <em>Caines' N. Y. Term Rep. </em>2. 1 <em>Johhs. 256.

The distance of the.\u00bfdace from whence the vessel sails may excuse. So may also the nature of the blockade. In the West-'Indies the blockades.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcU\">delivered the following opinion of the court1, viz.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">This'cause comes on upon various exceptions, to Opinions delivered by the circuit court of .Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">The first exception, haying been taken by the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>who prevailed in the cause, is'passed over without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">The 2d and 3d exceptions are so intimately connected with each other, that they can scarcely be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">This action. was brought by the owners of the cargo of the William 8? Mary, to Tecover from the Maryland Insurance.Company the amount of the policy insuring the,cargo of that vessel. The voyage insured was \u201c from Baltimore to Laguira, with liberty of one.other neighbouring port, and at, and from them, or either of them, back to Baltimore.\u201d The cargo was warranted to be American property, and the vessel to be an Ame \u00a1Can.bottom, \u201cproof.of which was .agreed tb be . ed in the United States only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Previous to the sailing of the William ,&amp; Mary from Baltimore, the blockade of Curra$oa had been notified to the President of the United States, by the British government, and was generally known in Baltimore. The, vessel arrived at Laguira, <em>from </em>which 'place she sailed for some other port,, was captured within'thirty miles of the port of Amsterdam, in Curra\u00a3oa, then actually blockaded, ;and was con* demned for an attempt to break the blockade.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The proof whether the William. 8c Mary sailed from Laguira for Gurra$o\u2018a, or for St. Thomas\u2019s or Porto Rico, is not <em>positive; </em>and the evidence respecting the information which she sought, or might have received, at Laguira, respecting the blockade' of Curraba, is contradictory. On the part of the plaintiff below, evidence was given that, at Laguira, information of this fact was sought and could not be obtained. On the part of the underwriters, evidence was given, that no inquiry respecting it was made at Laguira, and further, that there was a small island called Bonaire, between Laguira and Curra$oa, not much out of the track from the former, place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>t0 the port.of Amsterdam, at which no inquiry^*\u00bb-. specting the blockade of Amsterdam was -made.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The counsel for the underwriters prayed the court to instruct the jury, that, if they believed these facts, the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">This instruction the court refused to give, but did instruct the jury \u201c that if they shall be satisfied, in this case, that Captain Henry Travers, master of the said schooner, sailed from taguira for the port of Amsterdam, in the island of Cu\u2019rra^o\u00e1, with intent to enter the said port, if not actually blockaded, but, if blockaded, not to attempt to enter,. but to sail for the island of . St. Thomas\u2019s, and if the jury should be also satisfies, from the said evidfence, that the said Henry Tra 'did not attempt; to enter the said port, but was captured on his way to the said , port, at the distance of 29 or 30 miles- therefrom, the court are of opinion, and accordingly directed the jury, that such conduct, on the part of the said Henry Travers, was not unlawful, and that, notwithstanding s\u00fcch conduct, the plaintiff can maintain the present action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This opinipn and'direction of the circuit court asserts two principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">1. That the sentence and'condemnation of a foreign court of admiralty, condemning a vessel as prize for attempting to entcr.-a blockaded port, is not conclusive evidence of that fact, in an action on this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">2. That, under the circumstances of the case, the sailing from Laguira, and the passing Bonaire, without making any inquir^, at either place, respecting the blockade of Amsterdam, were not such acts .of culpable negligence as to discharge the underwriters*</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">1. Is the sentence of a foreign court of admiralty, in this c\u00e1se, conclusive evidence of the fact it . asserts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>This depends ent\u00edr\u00e9iy otf the construction given to the policy. The question respecting the conclusiveness of a foreign, sentence. w^Sj some time past, much, agitated throughout the United States, and was finally decided, in this court, in the affirmative.' Pending this controversy, a change was- introuuced in the form of the policy, at several offices, by insert\u00bb ing, after the warranty that the property was neutral, the words, \u201c proof of which to be required in the United States only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\">ijy the underwriters it. is contended that these words go to the property only, and not to the conduct of the vessel. -By the assured it is contended that they .apply to both. .</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The underwriters insist that the words themselves import no more than that proof respecting the property may be received in the United States, and that a more extended construction is not necessarily to be given .to them in consequence of their connection with the warranty of neutrality, because\" a neutral vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port would thereby discharge the underwriters, although no warranty of neutrality should be found in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There is much ,force in this argument, and if the question shall ever occur on such a policy, it ;will deserve serious consideration. But whatever might be the law in such a case, the majority of the court is of opinion that, under this policy, the sentence of the foreign court of admiralty is not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The contract of insurance is certainly very loosely drawn, and a settled construction, .different from the natural import of the words, is given, by the commercial world, to many of its stipulations, which construction has beeii sanctioned by the decisions of courts. One of these is on the warranty that, the vessel.is neutral property. It is not improbable that, without such warranty, the attempt of a neu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tra| vessel to enter \u00e1 blockaded port might be <em>cotxr </em>sidered as discharging the underwriters. But no such decision appears ever, to -have been made; nor is the principle asserted, so far as is known to the court, in any of. the numerous treatises which have been written, on the subject. .On the contrary, the Judgments rendered in favour of th\u00a1e underwriters, in such cases, have been uniformly founded on the breach of the warranty of neutrality, which, though jn terms extended only to the property, has been carried, by construction, to the- conduct of. the vessel. ft is, universally declared that anti-neutral conduct forfeits the warranty, that the vessel is neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">This being the construction put by the p\u00e1rties, and, in consequence thereof, by courts, on the warranty of neutrality, it is- fair to consider'the reservation of the right of .giving . proof in the United States* which, in direct terms, refers to the whole warranty, as intended by the parties to be co-extensive with the warranty itself; and, as the cqn.duct of the vessel was, in legal construction, comprehended in the warranty of her neutrality, that the conduct of the vessel would, in legal construction, be comprehended in the reservation of a right to. make proof in the. United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The majority of the-court, ther\u00e9fore, is of opinion, that the circuit court did not err in submit?ting the testimony respecting the conduct of the vessel, in this case, to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">2. Are the underwriters' discharged by the conduct of the captain ?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">This question is susceptible of several subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">1. Was the port of Amsterdam, in\u2019 Curra?oa, a neighbouring port, yrithih the policy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Si. Did the intention to pass Amsterdam, if blockaded, discharge the underwriters ?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>or .3; Was an omission to inquire at Laguira Bondire, respecting the blockade of Amsterdam, such a culpable negligence as to discharge the under Wri \u2022te'rs.?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">It is the opinion of the court that the port of A,im sterdam was \u00e1 neighbouring port within the policy.* \u25a0The distance between'the two places is inconsiderable. It is not stipulated that the-neighbouring port shall be one under the Spanish government, noi; is it to be implied from the nature of the case. Indeed, the,common usage of fealtimore, which was given in evidence, for vessels sailing with cargoes assorted for the Spanish Main to and from Laguira to Currafoa, if. refused admittance into the former port, would be. conclusive on this point, if, in other respects, it could be doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Neither was the intention to sail fob some other port, on the contingency of finding Amsterdam blockaded, a deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">It is admitted that the voyage from Laguira must be certain, and that only a certain voyage would be within the policy. But the opinion of the circuit court was founded on the jury\u2019s believing that the voyage from Laguira was for Amsterdam, a voyage which the vessel had a right to make, and that the intention to sail to another port, should Amsterdam be blockaded, constituted no deviation while on the voyage to Amsterdam.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">. Certainly an intention, not executed, will not deprive the insured of the benefit of his contract in a case in which he would not have been deprived of it, had he executed his intention. Had Captain Travers, on the voyage to Amsterdam, sustained a partial loss, and; after entering that port, determined to go to Rorto Rico, or St. Thomas\u2019s; it is certain that, after sailing from Amsterdam, the voyage would have been no longer within the policy, nor would the underwriters have been answerable f\u00f3r a subsequent loss* But R could never be contended, with- any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>semblance of reason, that this discharged them from th\u00a1a loss sustained o.n the voyage to Amsterdam.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">3. The omission of the captain to m\u00e1ke any inquiry respecting the blockade of Amsterdam, -at Laguira, or to call, for that purpose, at' Bonaire,.comes next to be considered.,</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">. The \u25a0 notoriety of the blockade of Curra^o\u00e1, before Captain Travers sailed 1'rotn Baltimore, must \u2022affect him, especially as-the instruction given to the jury is not made dependent on their believing that he had no actual knowledge of the fact\u00bb It seems a reasonable duty, in ordinary .cases, to make inquiry in the neighbourhood, if information be attainable^ respecting the continuance of a blockade known previously to\u2019 exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">It is true, that upon this point, contradictory evidence was given; but the opinion of the . court is predicated on the. jury\u2019s believing that Captain Trar vers made no inquiry at Laguira. The correctness of that opinion, therefore, depends on its having been the duty of the captain to make this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In an ordinary blockade, this, perhaps, might have been necessary ; but it is contended, that blockades in' the West Indi\u00e9s were so qualified by the British government, as to have dispensed with this necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">It wasproved, that orders had been given by that government, to its cruisers and courts of vice-adtniralty, which orders were communicated to, and published by, the government of the United States, \u201c Not' to consider blockades as existing, unless\" in respect to particular ports which may be actually ..invested, and then not to capture vessels bound to such ports., unless they- shall have been previously warned not to enter them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">On the motives for this order, on the policy which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>dictated this mitigation of the general rule, so far as respected blockades in the West Indies, this court does not possess information which would enable it to make any decision, but it appears essentially to vary the duty of the masters of neutral vessels sailing towards a port supposed to be blockaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The words of the order are not satisfied by any previous notice which the vessel may have obtained, otherwise than by her being warned off. This is a technical term which is well understood. It is not satisfied by notice received in any other manner. The effect'of this order is, that a vessel cannot be placed in the situation of one having a notice of the blockade until' she is warned off. It gives her a. right to inquire of the blockading squadron, if she shall not previously receive this warning from one capable of giving it; and, consequently, dispenses with her making that inquiry elsewhere. While this order was in force, a neutral vessel might lawfully sail for a blockaded port, knowing it to be blockaded, and being found sailing towards such port; would, not constitute an attempt to break the blockade, until she should be warned off.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u2019 There is, then, no error in the opinions to which the second and third exceptions are taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The 4th exceptipn is-taken to the refusal of the court to give an opinion to the jury, that, under the circumstances stated by the' defendants below, the . port of Curra5oa was not a neighbouring port within the policy..</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The merits of this opinion have been essentially discussed in the view taken of the second and third exceptions, and-heed not be repeated. The port of Curra^oa is considered as a port within the policy, and, consequently, the circuit court might not to have given the opinion prayed for by the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The 5th exception presents the extraordinary case of ah exception to an opinion in' favour of the party taking it,, and, consequently, need not be examined.-</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The 6th exception presents a case not essentially varying from the second and third, and will therefore be passed over without other observation than that it is decided in the opinion on those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The 7th exception is to a different point. \u2022 The counsel for the defendants' below prayed the court to instruct the jury, \u201c that if they believed the said Travers sailed from Laguira on a voyage - to St. Thomas\u2019s, or Porto Rico, but with an intention to proceed a small distance out of. the way to see if Amsterdam was blockaded, and in case it was not .blockaded, then to enter that port, and did so 'proceed to the port of Amsterdam, and- was captured as aforesaid, then the defendants are not answerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">This opinion the court refused to give, and proceeded to repeat the instruction, to which'the' secohd and third exceptions were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">If St. Thomas\u2019s, or Porto Rico, were riot neighbour* ing ports within the policy,. as is most probably the fact, then the voyag\u00e9 from Laguira to either of those places was not insured. If they were neighbouring ports,, so that a voyage to either of them was within the. policy, then going out of the way to see whether' Amsterdam was blockaded was a deviation, and, of consequence, the underwriters are equally discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The only doubt ever felt-on this point, was, whether, any testimony had been offered to the jury.to establish this fact, which would authorize counsel to request the opinion of the court respecting the law. Ofl examining the record, it appears that such testimony was offered. It is stated' that the defendants below offered in evidence, \"that the captain, on finding he could not be permitted to dispose of his cargo at Laguira, but on terms which amounted to a total sacrifice of it, \u201c determined to proceed to Porto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Rico, and,, as Currafoa was very little oat of the course, to ascemin.whether the blockade still conti-</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">This evidence might be disbelieved by the jury, but the defendants were certainly entitled to the opinion of the court declaring its legal operation if believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">. It is the opinion of the court, that, in refusing-to give the opinion prayed in the seventh exception, the circuit court. erred, for which their judgment rs reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
