Appellant\u2019s failure to comply with section 2590 of the Education Law invalidated the redistricting for the Borough of Manhattan. The board failed to publish a tentative redistricting plan in compliance with section 2590. II. The board failed to hold a public hearing which gave notice of the redistricting changes for Manhattan. <em>(Matter of Binghamton Citizens Penn-Can Route 17 Highway Committee </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>7 A D 2d 170; <em>Powelton Civic Home Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>284 F.

There is no support in the record for appellant\u2019s contention that the invalidity of the proposed plan was known by the public and acted upon at the hearings. IV. The board\u2019s final plan violated constitutional requirements and the requirements of State policy and law by removing petitioners \u2019 predominantly black schools from an integrated district and placing them in a segregated district, thereby denying petitioners the opportunity to participate in integrated educational programs. <em>(Matter of Vetere </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>15 N Y 2d 259; <em>Addabbo </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>22 A D 2d 383, 16 N Y 2d 619, 382 U.

The proposal here carried clear notice of its infirmity. Under the circumstances the hearing served its purpose and the letter and spirit of the statute were satisfied. <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>304 U. S. 1.) II. School district heterogeneity is not here involved. Even if it were, the record is bare of facts sufficient to warrant an inference of arbitrary action with regard to it.

The court below erred if it held that Broum, prohibits any redistricting which results in the inclusion of schools attended by petitioners\u2019 children in a district less integrated than formerly. <em>Brown </em>dealt with school segregation not districts. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of New Rochelle, </em>191 F.

II. The Board of Education must be required to hold new public hearings to allow citizens to express their sentiments on the creation of an All-East Harlem School District.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b145-4\">Chief Judge Fuld.</author>\n<p id=\"AJf\">We agree with the conclusion reached by Presiding Justice Stevens in his dissenting opinion in the Appellate Division. The Board of Education must prepare and submit a new school districting plan for the Borough of Manhattan and thereafter hold a public hearing on such plan in accordance with the provisions of the Education Law (\u00a7 2590-b; L. 1969, ch. 330, as amd. by L. 1970, ch. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">It is clear that the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Proposed Plan for a Community School District System,\u201d upon which the hearings herein were held, did not comply with the provisions of section 2590-b of the Education Law. Subdivision 2 (par. [b]) of that section recites that \u201c [t]he interim board of education shall prepare a tentative districting plan defining the boundaries of the community districts \u201d and that no such district <em>\u201c </em>shall contain less than twenty thousand pupils in average daily attendance in the schools under its jurisdiction \u201d. And subdivision 2 (par. [c] explicitly declares that, after the \u201c tentative districting plan [is] published * * * the interim board of education shall hold a public hearing or hearings thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The board\u2019s \u201c tentative \u201d or proposed plan created districts which contained fewer pupils than the 20,000 prescribed by the statute and, by that token, it could not possibly have been accepted or adopted. In other words, no 1 \u2018 tentative districting plan\u201d (as defined by the Education Law provision) was ever published. Consequently, the hearings which the board in good faith held did not satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements. This was no minor deviation. It was the legislative design that the local community be heard on the plan under consideration, which was possible of acceptance. Moreover, the Education Law unequivocally places the responsibility on the board, not on the members of the public attending the hearings, to formulate the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>proposal for such valid plan and to hold public hearings upon <em>that </em>plan prior to its adoption. Concededly, no hearings were held on the plan which the board thereafter announced and adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">This is not to say that if, as a result of the hearings held, the board decides to modify its original valid proposal, it must resubmit the plan for new and further hearings. The plan finally adopted, however, must be derived from, and bear some reasonable resemblance to, the one initially proposed. In the present case, there was no such relationship between the plan initially published, providing for an impermissible and illegal division of the Borough of Manhattan into six school districts, and the radically different plan ultimately adopted, calling for the creation of five districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs in this court and the Appellate Division, and the case remitted to the Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
