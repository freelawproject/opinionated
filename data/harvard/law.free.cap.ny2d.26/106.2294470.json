VII. The court erred in charging the jury on the hypotheses to be deliberated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Van Norman, </em>231 N. Y. 454; <em>People </em>v. <em>Koerber, </em>244 N. Y. 147.) VEIL The admissions of photographs of the corpse was unnecessary, yet inflammable, and therefore prejudicial. IX. The court unnecessarily supplemented the testimony of prosecution witnesses to the prejudice of respondent. X. Failure of the court to require the prosecution to apprise respondent of the charges against him was error. XI. The People\u2019s proof is incredible and does not support the verdict. XII. The court should have permitted the jury to hear Hackett\u2019s testimony concerning a third man with the deceased and respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b140-5\">Chief Judge Fuld.</author>\n<p id=\"Avn\">The record leaves no doubt that Albert Hicks died of a stab wound and that it was the defendant who inflicted it in the course of robbing him. While in the company of several friends, the defendant asked one of them, a Johnnie Cooper, for a loan. \u201c I need some money,\u201d he told him, <em>\u201cI </em>have to get it one way or another, even if I have to kill somebody.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A few minutes later, Hicks came along on the other side of the street; the defendant walked over to him and they entered a building together where they remained for a short time. When they emerged from the building, the defendant grabbed Hicks, turned him around and struck him in the chest. Hicks fell to the sidewalk, a fatal stab wound through his heart, and the defendant was seen to bend down and take some change from his victim\u2019s pocket. When the police arrived, they found Hicks\u2019 body on the sidewalk, one pants pocket turned inside out.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder and a divided Appellate Division reversed the resulting judgment on the ground that, under the trial judge\u2019s instructions, \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>jury was enabled to find the defendant guilty of a felony murder although the intent to commit the predicate felony may have followed the killing .\u201d (32 A D 2d 260, 262).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The governing principle is clear. A person may be convicted of felony murder only if it be shown that he killed 1 \u2018 in the attempted execution of the unlawful end.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>8 N Y 2d 48, 51; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Luscomb, </em>292 N. Y. 390, 395; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lytton, </em>257 N. Y. 310, 312; former Penal Law, \u00a7 1044.) If the intent to commit the felony, robbery in this case, came into being after the defendant had killed his victim, the defendant was not guilty, and could not be convicted, of felony murder. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Levan, </em>295 N. Y. 26; <em>People </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>36 Hun 500.) The trial judge in the case before us, undoubtedly with these principles in mind, repeatedly instructed the jury that \u201c [t]o constitute felony murder the injury which resulted in death must have been inflicted during the commission of a robbery, or an attempted robbery, and while the killer was engaged in committing such act \u2019 \u2019. Indeed, whenever he mentioned robbery and murder, the judge was careful to use language such as <em>\u201cin the course of\u201d </em>or <em>\u201c during </em>\u2019\u2019the robbery. Moreover, his charge left no doubt that, in order for a robbery \u25a0to be committed, the defendant had to employ force or fear <em>\u201c </em>either to obtain or retain possession of the monies or property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking.\u201d In view of the language employed, there was no need to charge the further instructions on the subject requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">However, in reaching its decision to reverse, the Appellate Division stressed the judge\u2019s answer to a question put to him by the jury. Defense counsel, in the course of his summation, declared that \u201c You can\u2019t rob a dead man.\u201d Perhaps puzzled or confused by this remark, the jury returned, after nearly three hours of deliberation, and asked, \u201cIs a felony, robbery [sic] committed if money is taken from a dead man? \u201d In response, the court stated: \u2018 \u2018 Yes. If a man or woman kills another <em>for the purpose of robbing him, and in the course of robbing him, or. after he has robbed Mm, </em>in order to get away and retain whatever ill-gotten gains he had, any of these circumstances constitutes a felony murder.\u201d These instructions could, perhaps, have been phrased even more plainly but the trial court, at this point, as well as at others, made it clear that the killing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>had to be perpetrated \u201c for the purpose \u201d or \u201cin the course \u201d of a robbery. In short, the court\u2019s language sufficiently informed the jurors that, if the defendant did not intend to rob Hicks at the time he stabbed and killed him, they could not find him guilty of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We have thoroughly considered each of the other points urged upon us by the defendant and find them without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Since the Appellate Division reversed \u201con the law\u201d and affirmed the facts, its order should be reversed and the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated. (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 543-b; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Solimine, </em>18 N Y 2d 477; Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, pp. 770-771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Brietel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. The witness did not take seriously the defendant\u2019s statement about killing somebody; it was his testimony that he believed the defendant was joking when he made that remark.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
