The courts below erred in holding the Nassau County system of modified weighted voting unconstitutional based solely on a comparison of populations with one town\u2019s percentage of the total vote of the Board of Supervisors. The constitutionality of an operating system of local government cannot be determined by reference solely to sterile, theoretical, mathematics; other factors reflecting the flexibility, diversity and experimentation which is necessary and desirable at the local government level must be considered. <em>(Iannucci </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of County of Washington, </em>20 N Y 2d 244; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Fedourich, </em>16 N Y 2d 94; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U. S. 186; <em>Wesberry </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>376 U. S. 1; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U. S. 533; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Midland County, </em>390 U.

Even assuming that mathematics is the \u201csole criterion\u201d of constitutional validity for weighted voting plans, the courts below applied the wrong system of mathematics. <em>(Augostini </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>46 Misc 2d 1058; <em>Shilbury </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>46 Misc 2d 837; <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Chemung County Bd. of Supervisors, </em>50 Misc 2d 418.) III. Special Term erred in determining this case on a motion for summary judgment. A trial is required to determine the \u201c voting power \u201d of the Nassau Supervisors. IV. If factors other than mathematics may enter into a determination of constitutionality, a trial is required. V. Should the court reverse and order a trial in this action, the burden of proof should rest upon the plaintiffs. VI. The courts below erred, even on their own premises, in granting judgment to four of the five plaintiffs and to the cross-claiming defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Seymour H.

The constitutional mandate of \u201c one person, one vote \u201d applies to local legislative bodies. <em>(Iannucci </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of County of Washington, </em>20 N Y 2d 244; <em>Seamam </em>v. <em>Fedourich, </em>16 N Y 2d 94; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Midland County, </em>390 U.

The apportionment of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors violates the constitutional mandate of \u201c one person, one vote.\u201d Weighted voting is unconstitutional per se. <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U. S. 533; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Fedourich, </em>16 N Y 2d 94; <em>WMCA </em>v. <em>Lomenzo, </em>238 F. Supp. 916, 382 U. S. 4; <em>Bannister </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>263 F.

Weighted voting as presently employed in Nassau County is constitutionally defective. IV. If Hempstead must be allowed more than half the votes of the board, section 104 (subd. 2) of the charter must be declared invalid. Where one portion of a statutory provision is invalid, other integrally related parts must fall with it. <em>(People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>230 N. Y. 48.) V. If Hempstead is allocated votes on a strict population basis, thereby receiving 72 total votes, the resulting system of apportionment and voting is also constitutionally defective. VI. The apportionment provisions of the County Law, which would govern the representation on the board in the absence of charter provision, are invalid as applied to Nassau County. VII. This court should speak on the question of per se unconstitutionality of weighted voting. <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Erie County, </em>18 N Y 2d 672; <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Mundt, 59 </em>Misc 2d 809, 33 A D 2d 660; <em>Dobish </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>54 Misc 2d 367.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>Louis J. Lefkowitz, Attorney-General (Daniel M. Cohen </em>and <em>Samuel A. Hirshowits </em>of counsel), in his statutory capacity under Section 71 of the Executive Law. Upon the record in this case the Nassau County Government Law ([L. 1936, ch. 879 as amd.] \u00a7 104), should not have been held unconstitutional. Special Term failed to hold a hearing in accordance with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Iannucci </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of County of Washington, </em>20 N Y 2d 244 (1967), to evaluate the \u201cvoting powers \u201d of each of the members of the Board of Supervisors. The Appellate Division disregarded this failure and erroneously deemed it to be unnecessary to take the testimony required by the <em>Iannucci </em>decision. <em>(Avery </em>v. <em>Midland County, </em>390 U. S. 474; <em>Sailors </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of County of Kent, </em>387 U. S. 105; <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Union School Dist., </em>395 U. S. 621; <em>Dusch </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>387 U.

Important as is the fact of the present inequality, it is of even greater moment that inequality in some degree is mandated and, indeed, perpetuated by the charter provision: <em>\u201c </em>nor shall the supervisor or supervisors of any town, or city be entitled to cast more than fifty per centum of the total vote of said board.\u201d (L. 1936, ch. 879, \u00a7 104, subd. 2.) This provision has survived two attempts at reapportionment, proposals therefor having been defeated in referendums conducted in 1965 and 1967<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and clearly violates the one man, one vote principle. The phenomenal population growth in Hempstead, as in Nassau County generally, points up the inequality created and perpetuated by the charter provision. Not only are the Hempstead Supervisors presently barred from exercise of a majority vote, but section 104 would continue to deprive them, or the residents of any other town or city subsequently containing a majority of the county population, from majority representation, regardless of how great their majority may presently be or may in future become. This is the vital factor which distinguishes the case from <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Mundt </em>(25 N Y 2d 309), recently decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Thus, it was proper to direct reapportionment but it seems unwise and unnecessary to proceed thereto on the basis of the 1960 census.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The order appealed from should be modified so as to direct that a valid .reapportionment plan be adopted by the Board of Supervisors within six months after public announcement of the enumeration of the inhabitants of Nassau County in the Federal census of 1970 and that meanwhile the present plan remain in effect, as a temporary measure, and, as so modified, the order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel and Jasen concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Order modified in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">.
