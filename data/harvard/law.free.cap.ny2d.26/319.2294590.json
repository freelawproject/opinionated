The proof was clearly insufficient to offset Mrs. Crimmins \u2019 presumed innocence, as a matter of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>283 N. Y. 479; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>New York, Ontario &amp; Western R. R. Co., </em>116 N. Y. 615; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City of N.

Y. 51; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>156 N. Y. 253.) II. The evidence before the Grand Jury was insufficient to indict. The pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment should have been granted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>18 N Y 2d 516; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>3 N Y 2d 672; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nitzberg, </em>289 N. Y. 523.) III. Respondent was seriously prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defense to elicit on Rorech\u2019s cross-examination his pretrial assertion of the fact of respondent\u2019s innocence, subsequent to the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>on which he claimed that respondent confessed to him. <em>(Larkin </em>v. <em>Nassau Elec. R. R. Co., </em>205 N. Y. 267.) IV. Respondent was seriously prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s barring of defense testimony of Mrs. Crimmins\u2019 ignorance of her dog\u2019s pregnancy, a highly material fact, the People having imputed such knowledge to respondent through the witness Earomirski. <em>(Provenzo </em>v. <em>Sam, </em>23 N Y 2d 256; <em>Loetsch v. New York City Omnibus Corp., </em>291 N. Y. 308.) V. The trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing into evidence proof of a custody proceeding brought against respondent by her husband, and proof of numerous underlying acts of marital misconduct by respondent, for the supposed purpose of establishing motive to kill. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>290 N. Y. 160; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>156 N. Y. 253; <em>Provenzo </em>v. <em>Sam, </em>23 N Y 2d 256; <em>People </em>v. <em>Levan, </em>295 N. Y. 26; <em>Epstein v.

Y. 127; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>392 U. 8. 219.) VT. The trial court committed prejudicial error by barring defense from proving Earomirski\u2019s physical defects and mental illness in order to impeach her testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kohlmeyer, </em>284 N. Y. 366; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conde, </em>16 A D 2d 327, 13 N Y 2d 672; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>309 N. Y. 283; <em>Bromberg </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>25 A D 2d 885; <em>Bishin </em>v. <em>New York Cent. R. R. Co., </em>20 A D 2d 921; <em>Toll </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>32 A D 2d 47; <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Bair Transp., </em>249 F. Supp. 681; <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>139 N. Y. 73; <em>Ellarson </em>v. <em>Ellarson, </em>198 App. Div. 103; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lubrien, </em>19 A D 2d 641.) VII. The trial court committed reversible error by denying certain vital defense applications for mistrials. and bv permitting highly incompetent police conclusions to come before the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bodine, </em>1 Denio 281; <em>Cloyes </em>v. <em>Thayer &amp; Morse, </em>3 Hill 564; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>72 N. Y. 571; <em>Baumann </em>v. <em>Steingester, </em>213 N. Y. 328; <em>Doheny </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>168 N. Y. 213; <em>People </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>145 N. Y. 1; <em>Rosseau </em>v. <em>Bleau, </em>131 N. Y. 177; <em>Sturm </em>v. <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co., </em>63 N. Y. 77; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>316 F. 2d 606; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>390 U. S. 129.) VIII. The trial court\u2019s refusal to grant defense request to charge the jury, that the testimony of police officers and public officials should not be given greater or lesser weight simply because of their official status, constituted reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>270 App. Div. 624; <em>Bush </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>States, </em>375 F. 2d 602; <em>People </em>v. <em>Caserta, </em>19 N Y 2d 18.) IX. The trial court erred in denying defense counsel the clear right to hear the tapes of wiretaps of respondent\u2019s telephone com versations, and to examine the wiretap applications. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>17 N Y 2d 152; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>28 A D 2d 727; <em>People </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>24 N Y 2d 445.) X. The unauthorized but purposeful visit by the jurors to the scene in which the People\u2019s star witness claimed to have made crucial observations, constituted a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and the trial court\u2019s denial of an application for a new trial was reversible error. <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Gladden, </em>385 U. S. 363; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Lucia, </em>20 N Y 2d 275; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>149 N. Y. 106; <em>Bainton </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City of N. Y., </em>57 Misc 2d 140; <em>People </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>31 A D 2d 964; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18; <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 250; <em>United States ex rel. Savino </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>305 F. Supp. 277, 417 F. 2d 1070.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-5\">Burke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7K\">Defendant was indicted for, and convicted of, killing her daughter. .At the trial the People established that the child died of strangulation within two or three hours of her last meal. The body was found at about 2:00 p.m;., on July 14, 1965, and an autopsy determined that death occurred approximately 8 to 24 hours prior to discovery. Two of the People\u2019s witnesses, Sophie Earomirski and Joseph Rorech, presented substantially all of the evidence which connected defendant to the crime. The former testified that at about 2:00 a.m., on July 14, 1965, she saw defendant carrying a bundle and holding the hand of a little boy; she was accompanied by a man. Defendant\u2019s companion took the bundle and threw it into an automobile, and Mrs. Earomirski, from her third floor window across the street, heard defendant say, \u201c My God, don\u2019t do that to <em>her.\u201d </em>Mr. Rorech testified that at a subsequent time defendant admitted to him, \u201c Joseph, please forgive me, I killed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Although defendant raised several alleged errors in the Appellate Division, reversal was predicated on only one \u2014 an unauthorized visit by three jurors to the neighborhood which was the subject of Mrs. Earomirski\u2019s testimony\u2014and was based on our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>De Lucia </em>(20 N Y 2d 275). Leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>appeal to this court was granted on the People\u2019s application. They argue that reversal is mandated only when prejudice to the defendant is shown and that, as found by the Trial Justice, such prejudice is absent herein. They also argue that the evidence is legally sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">After the trial but before the imposition of sentence, defendant moved, on the basis of a juror\u2019s affidavit, to set aside the verdict because members of the jury had made an unauthorized visit to the street on which Sophie Earomirski lived. A hearing was held, and the juror, Samuel Ehrlich, testified that, after Mrs. Earomirski had testified, he wanted to see that area. He went there between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. Ehrlich further testified that his visit did not influence his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Another visit was made by Ehrlich and two other jurors, Harry Tunis and Irving Furst, at about 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">During the jury\u2019s deliberations the lighting in the area was discussed in <em>\u201c </em>small talk \u201d and, according to Ehrlich, someone mentioned that the area was well-lit. Another juror, Philip Seidman, testified that the subject was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">During the length of the trial, the jurors were never admonished not to visit any place which had been the subject of testimony. Ironically, after Mrs. Earomirski had testified, defense counsel requested that the court arrange a controlled visit to the area. The court denied the visit as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>De Lucia, </em>this court held: <em>\u201c </em>In this type of case, proof of the fact of the unauthorized visit is sufficient to warrant a new trial without proof of how such visit may have influenced individual jurors in their juryroom deliberations. <em>Such a visit, in and of itself, constitutes inherent prejudice to the </em>defendants.\u201d (20 N Y 2d 275, 280 [emphasis supplied].) Appellant\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Be Lucia </em>fails to comprehend the nature of the decision in that case. Although the affidavit averred that the jurors had re-enacted the crime, we did not predicate our decision on actual prejudice. That discussion merely demonstrates one of the manifest evils of an unauthorized visit. Since <em>Be Lucia </em>was in the court on mere allegations, a hearing was ordered, and the afore-quoted statement indicates the quantum of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>which would mandate a new trial. The defendants were not required to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Moreover, our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sher </em>(24 N Y 2d 454) should not be construed as modifying <em>Be Lucia (supra). </em>There, unlawful communications made to jurors were disclosed to the court during the trial and prior to deliberation. After examining the jurors, the trial court was satisfied that the impropriety would not affect their verdict. We held that the pre-deliberation examination was sufficient to \u201c sterilize \u201d the jury. The jury visit herein was not disclosed until after verdict. Without the benefit of a judicial admonition, the jurors, although not <em>consciously </em>affected by the visit, would not make the specific effort to disregard it. Thus, no court instruction was made to counteract or <em>\u201c </em>sterilize \u201d any possible <em>subconscious </em>effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The attempt to distinguish the view made herein from one of the scene of a crime is also without merit. Mrs. Earomir ski\u2019s ability to see and hear the events to which she testified depended very much on the lighting in the area and the distances involved. And the credibility of her testimony is essential to the prosecution\u2019s case. The Legislature perceived the evil in such a view and directed court supervision of views of the place where the crime is alleged to have been committed or where <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>any material fact occurred \u201d (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 411). The statutory inclusion is sound, and we ought not to make a tenuous distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Finally, appellant argues that the error is harmless. Assuming that such a determination is not precluded by our holding in <em>Be Lucia, </em>the question is nevertheless moot. Although, as the People argue, the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the verdict of guilt, it was not so overwhelming that we can say, as a matter of law, that the error could not have influenced the verdict <em>(Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 250; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18). Only two witnesses gave evidence which connected defendant directly with the crime. Rorech, of course, testified that defendant confessed to the slaying, and that testimony, together with that of the coroner, is sufficient to establish a prima facie c\u00e1se. (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 395.) But that testimony was seriously challenged, and the witness was subjected to searching cross-examination. Mrs, Earomir ski was the other witness who implicated defendant, and it is the value of her testimony which may have been affected by the improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>riety. Given such limited evidence, we cannot find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Accordingly the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
