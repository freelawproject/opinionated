Claimant\u2019s grant of $125,000 made pursuant to the Military Claims Act made with Congressional approval was gratuitous and not comparable to a settlement under the Federal Tort Claims Act. <em>(Matter of Schneider </em>v. <em>Archie Baxter\u2019s Flying Service, </em>266 App. Div. 1037.) II. The Appellate Division majority erred in its holding that the Federal Government payment to petitioner was made in settlement of a tort claim and subject to a lien pursuant to section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>(Pfaffenbach </em>v. <em>White Plains Express Corp., </em>17 N Y 2d 132; <em>Matter of Petterson </em>v. <em>Daystrom Corp., </em>17 N Y 2d 32.) III. The rule of <em>Petterson </em>case should not be extended to allow a carrier\u2019s lien against petitioner\u2019s grant from the Federal Government. <em>(Meachem </em>v. <em>New York Cent. R.

The settlement and award under the Military Claims Act are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>a \u201c recovery \u201d by \u201c settlement \u201d under section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law providing that the compensation carrier shall have a lien on the proceeds <em>of any recovery </em>from such other, whether by judgment, <em>settlement </em>or otherwise. <em>(Matter of Petterson </em>v. <em>Daystrom Corp., </em>17 N Y 2d 32; <em>Matter of Berenberg </em>v. <em>Park Memorial Chapel, </em>286 App. Div. 167; <em>Matter of Amo </em>v. <em>Empsall-Clark Co., </em>9 A D 2d 852; <em>General Aniline &amp; Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Schrader &amp; Son, </em>12 N Y 2d 366; <em>Matter of Simonetti </em>v. <em>Munro Waterproofing Co., </em>282 App. Div. 899; <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>209 App. Div. 332; <em>Commissioners of State Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Parrilla, </em>31 Misc 2d 835.) II. Statutes are construed to effectuate their purpose and legislative intent and not as literal abstractions. Words like \u201cnegligence or wrong\u201d in section 29 are to be construed with \u201c any recovery\u201d and \u201csettlement\u201d to achieve the manifest purpose of the statute to prevent double recovery and not compel an employer or carrier to make a second payment after claimant has already been otherwise compensated. <em>(Matter of Petterson </em>v. <em>Daystrom Corp., </em>17 N Y 2d 32; <em>Matter of New York Post Corp. </em>v. <em>Leibowitz, </em>2 N Y 2d 677.) III. The construction of the statute is aided by the interpretation put upon it by the public officials in the course of their administration of the statute. <em>(City of New York </em>v. <em>New York City Ry. Co., </em>193 N. Y. 543; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaidys, </em>194 F. 2d 762; <em>Matter of Schneider </em>v. <em>Archie Baxter\u2019s Flying Service, </em>266 App. Div. 1037, 292 N. Y. 726; <em>Meachem </em>v. <em>New York Cent. R. R. Co., </em>8 N Y 2d 293; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>338 U. S. 366.) IV. The Appellate Division soundly affirmed the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board\u2019s finding on the facts in this record that the agreed upon settlement and award under the Military Claims Act was a \u201c recovery \u201d and \u201c settlement \u2019 \u2019 within the purpose and intent of section 29 granting a \u201clien\u201d to respondent. <em>(Pfaffenbach </em>v. <em>White Plains Express Corp., </em>17 N Y 2d 132.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b40-5\">Breitel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHq\">The issue is whether, to the extent of compensation awarded, a workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier has a lien on payments made to dependents by the United States Government for death caused by \u201c noncombat \u201d activities, that is, certain military exercises, by United States armed forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Claimant, Mary Ryan, as a surviving widow, appeals from a determination that respondent carrier Electric Mutual Liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Insurance Company has a lien, pursuant to section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, on the proceeds of a settlement received under the Military Claims Act (U. S. Code, tit. 10, \u00a7 2733). The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, in reversing the referee, held that the settlement and award were a \u201c recovery \u201d covered by section 29 and not a collateral source payment. The Appellate Division, by a divided court, affirmed the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Claimant widow contends that the payments received from the United States Government under the Military Claims Act were a gratutity and not a settlement for tort. Thus she contends that the payments are not a <em>\u201c </em>recovery \u201d for <em>\u201c </em>negligence or wrong \u201d which would be subject to a lien under section 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is concluded that the payments were in the nature of a recovery for negligence or wrong, although not necessarily in settlement of a judicially cognizable cause of action. Hence, the lien was properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Claimant\u2019s husband, an airplane pilot employed by the General Electric Company, was killed in October, 1962 when his employer\u2019s airplane was struck by a Navy jet airplane which had been towing a practice target. The Navy jet had reported difficulty in reeling in its target and was in a steep dive when it hit the airplane piloted by claimant\u2019s husband. There were no survivors of this collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits to the widow and children paid by the carrier totaled $6,083. Subsequent to the award, claimant entered into administrative negotiations with the Department of the Navy under the Military Claims Act. On January 7, 1964, she received $5,000 and six months later received an additional $120,000 award by special act of the United States Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The carrier asserts a lien under section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law on these Military Claims Act payments covering the benefits already paid by the carrier and any future compensation which may be awarded. Subdivision 1 of section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law provides that if the dependents elect to pursue their remedies against a third party, the insurance carrier liable for payment of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits shall have, to the extent of compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>awarded, a lien on the proceeds of any recovery whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> *</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Military 'Claims Act provides for the administrative settlement of claims up to $5,000 for property damage, injuries or death arising from the <em>\u201c </em>noncombat \u201d activities of members of the armed services acting within the scope of their employment (IT. S. Code, tit. 10, \u00a7 2733, subd. [a]). Where a meritorious claim is in excess of $5,000, as. in this case, the Secretary of a Military Department may pay the claimant $5,000 and report the excess to Congress for its consideration <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 2733, subd. [d]). This occurred here. To the extent, however, that a claim caused by a negligent act or omission may be administratively settled under the Federal Tort Claims Act (IT. S. Code, tit. 28, \u00a7 2672) the Military Claims Act is inapplicable (U. S. Code, tit. 10, \u25a0\u00a7 2733, subd. [b], par. [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The question whether payment under the Military Claims Act constitutes a recovery contemplated by section 29 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is novel.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">In an .analogous case, <em>Matter of Schneider </em>v. <em>Archie Baxter\u2019s Flying Service </em>(266 App. Div. 1037, mot. for lv. to app. den., 292 N. Y. 726), the Third Department had held that payments under a special Congressional enactment did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>a recovery under section 29 where the recipient of the award had no legally - enforceable claim against the Government. Neither the Military Claims nor Tort Claims Act had been enacted at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The Appellate Division in the instant case split three ways. The majority (per Herlihy, J.) reasoned that the circumstances of the accident suggested the possibility of recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act, so that the Military Claims Act settlement could be considered as the settlement of a \u201ctort\u201d claim. In determining the applicability of section 29 it treated the motive of the United States in settling the claim as a factual matter, finding it did so to avoid an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Mr. Presiding Justice Gibson, as he then was, concurred on .the theory that although negligence could not be inferred from the facts, section 29 should be broadly construed to cover this case. He suggested that section 29 be extended to a recovery not purely in tort. Mr. Justice Gabrielli, relying on the <em>Schneider </em>case <em>(supra), </em>dissented on the theory that there was no legally enforceable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Navy Regulations governing awards under the Military Claims Act make clear that awards for death or injury arising out of certain \u201c noncombat \u201d activities, of which operation of an aircraft is one, are not conditioned on a showing of negligence (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 750.18-750.21; to similar effect for the Army and Air Force see \u00a7\u00a7 536.14, 842.42). Interestingly, however, the claimant must be free of contributory negligence (U. S. Code, tit. 10, .\u00a7 2733, subd. [b], par. [4]). And, it is also clear that a claimant may without regard to negligence, choose to process his claim through the Military Claims Act, or seek a tort recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act on the ground of negligent conduct (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaidys, </em>194 F. 2d 762, 764).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">It is not fruitful, however, to speculate in cases where the Military Claims Act award rather than a Federal Tort Claims Act recovery is obtained, whether the award is factually, or as a matter of law, a recovery in settlement of a tort action. The \u2018 \u2018 noncombat \u2019 \u2019 activities listed, for which no negligence need be shown, are of the sort which although having little parallel in civilian pursuits would, if conducted by private persons, most likely result in liability without any necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>for showing negligence because they involve inherently dangerous activities, e.g. maneuvers and special exercises; practice bombing;. naval exhibitions; operation of missiles, aircraft and antiaircraft equipment (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 32, \u00a7 750.21). Army and Air Force Regulations, also list similar activities (Code of Fed. Reg., tit. 32, \u00a7 536.14, subd. [e]; \u00a7 842.42, subd. [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">To this extent, the administrative payments and subsequent deficiency appropriation bills represent recoveries for wrongs. This is so even if it is unclear whether a claimant might have an action at law, under common-law principles. Indeed, the Military Claims Act provides that, except for Congressional consideration of the part of a claim over $5,000, the amount tendered must be accepted by the claimant in full satisfaction (\u00a7 2733, subd. [e]). The requirement of \u201cfull satisfaction\u201d looks to possible liability and is not consonant with the idea of gratuitousness of the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Viewed in this context, the Military Claims Act serves as a substitute for a tort recovery, without reference to negligence or proof of wrong beyond causation. As a matter of policy, section 29 should be broadly read to cover a Federally authorized substitute for any possible tort recovery. In <em>Matter of Petterson </em>v. <em>Daystrom Corp. </em>(17 N Y 2d 32, 39), this court stated that section 29 is designed \u201c to provide for reimbursement of the compensation carrier whenever a recovery is obtained in tort for the same injurj\" that was a predicate for the payment of compensation benefits.\u201d That legislative design is best effected by allowing reimbursement where recovery, although perhaps not falling within classical or categorical torts, nevertheless is based on some kind of wrong if only because the engagement in necessary hazardous activities may or must cause harm to innocent individuals. (In this context, compare the even more liberal provisions for compensating foreign civilians in overseas areas in which the armed forces are based [U. S. Code, tit. 10, \u00a7 2734].)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Jasen concur; Judge Gibson taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> Section 29 (subd. 1) reads, in pertinent part, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>If an employee entitled to compensation under this chapter be injured or killed by the negligence or wrong of another not in the same employ, such injured employee, or in case of death, his dependents, need not elect whether to take compensation and medical benefits under this chapter or to pursue his remedy against such other but may take such compensation and medical benefits and * * * pursue his remedy against such other subject to the provisions of this chapter. If such injured employee, or in ease of death, his dependents, take or intend to take compensation, and medical benefits in the case of an employee, under this chapter and desire to bring action against such other, such action must be commenced not later than six months after the awarding of compensation * * * In such case, the state insurance fund, if compensation be payable therefrom, and otherwise the person, association, corporation or insurance carrier liable for the payment of such compensation, as the case may be, shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from such other, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, after the deduction of the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred in effecting such recovery, to the extent of the total amount of compensation awarded under or provided or estimated by this chapter for such case and the expenses for medical treatment paid or to be paid by it and to such extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit of such fund, person, association, corporation or carrier \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
