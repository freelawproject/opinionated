S. 217.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-5\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIc\">In the selection of the jury, after both the People and defendant had exercised their peremptory challenges, the People were allowed over objection to exercise a peremptory challenge to a previously unchallenged juror and the juror thus challenged was excused by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Section 385 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states expressly that a challenge to an individual juror \u2018 \u2018 must be taken first by the people and then by the defendant \u201d. The procedure followed by the court in allowing the People to exercise a peremptory challenge after the defendant had exercised the right to peremptory challenge and had accepted the juror is the only issue raised on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">It is difficult to see how the mere sequence of the challenges could make any real difference to the accused in most cases, and certainly not in this case. Although the statute prescribes the sequence in context with the word <em>\u201c </em>must \u201d, one would normally think that such an error would meet the condition of section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as to technical errors and defects. But this court construed the requirement very strictly in 1888 in <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade </em>(110 N. Y. 284) and with one exception, almost an aberration, has followed that strict construction ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The court in <em>McQuade </em>had clearly in mind the mandate of section 542 to disregard technicalities (p. 291) but it was of opinion (per Andrews, J.) that the sequence involved a very important and historic right and concluded that the <em>\u201c </em>statute is peremptory, and violation of its provisions was a substantial, and not a mere technical error\u201d (p. 295).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The precise problem came up again in 1934 in <em>People </em>v. <em>Grieco </em>(266 N. Y. 48) where the trial court permitted the People to excuse a juror who had previously been accepted both by People and defendant. The court held (opinion per Htjbbs, J.) that the <em>\u201c </em>ruling was in violation of the provisions of section 385 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the decision of this court in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade </em>\u201d (pp. 54-55).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Judge O\u2019Brien dissented in <em>Grieco </em>distinguishing <em>McQuade </em>on the ground defendant did not show how he had been prejudiced, and also distinguishing <em>McQuade </em>because the court had not considered there the point that had been argued in <em>Grieco, </em>i.e., that the trial court may in its discretion \u00a3 \u00a3 for good cause \u201d set aside a juror at any time before evidence is given under section 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This question was considered in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(137 N. Y. 29), as Judge O\u2019Brien notes, but, turning to <em>Hughes, </em>one sees that the sequence provision of section 385 was not raised or considered. <em>Grieco, </em>then, must be regarded as following <em>McQuade </em>in 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(66 App. Div. 179, affd. 172 N. Y. 146) the <em>McQuade </em>issue was raised, but the Appellate Division found (pp. 180-181) the question had not been preserved by proper objection to the procedure followed in selection of the jury, and this court did not discuss the question. The problem was considered in <em>People </em>v. <em>Miles </em>(143 N. Y. 383) but the court ruled that section 385 had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">A failure to object to the procedure followed was the ground for affirmance in 1968 in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mancuso </em>(22 N Y 2d 679), but the court\u2019s memorandum .stated that <em>\u201c </em>it was error for the People to be allowed to peremptorily challenge a prospective juror after they had already indicated their satisfaction with the jury as thus impaneled and after the defendants had exercised their peremptories to the box (see <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>110 N. Y. 284; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grieco, </em>266 N. Y. 48; Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 385) \u201d (p. 680). The court seemed thus to continue to adhere to the <em>McQuade </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The seeming \u201caberration\u201d is <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(14 N Y 2d 948 [1964]). There the Appellate Division, although holding that it was error \u00a3 \u00a3 to direct the defendant to exercise peremptory challenges before the jury was declared satisfactory by the People \u201d, nevertheless held, since defendant had 20 challenges and had exercised only 6, there was \u00a3 <em>\u2018 </em>no prejudice to the substantial rights \u201d of defendant (20 A D 2d 622). The judgment was affirmed here without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">But when the articulated statements of the court since <em>McQuade </em>are placed in full context it is to be seen that the rule of that case has been consistently avowed and followed, \u2022bio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>strong policy reason suggests departure now from a rule which has thus been firmly reiterated.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
