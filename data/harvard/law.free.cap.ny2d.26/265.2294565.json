By denying an absolute right of appeal from the denial of a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>when the death sentence has been imposed, section 517 (subd. 3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brabson, </em>28 A D 2d 989; <em>Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold, </em>383 U. S. 107; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>24 N Y 2d 292; <em>Matter of Buttonow, </em>23 N Y 2d 385.) II. The People failed to sustain their burden of proof that the confessions were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>9 N Y 2d 571; <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U. S. 568; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U. S. 503; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>24 A D 2d 740; <em>People </em>v. <em>D\u2019Iorio, </em>49 Misc 2d 30.) (In the first above-entitled action.) III. Appellant was improperly denied a hearing on his claim that an illegally obtained confession was introduced at his trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>11 N Y 2d 279; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>22 N Y 2d 325; <em>People </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>15 N Y 2d 167; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>15 N Y 2d 72; <em>People </em>v. <em>DeRenzzio, </em>19 N Y 2d 45; <em>United States ex rel.

The petitions were properly denied, the claims being totally devoid of merit. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>16 N Y 2d 731; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>19 N Y 2d 14; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cefaro, </em>23 N Y 2d 283; <em>People </em>v. <em>McQueen, </em>18 N Y 2d 337; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>22 N Y 2d 476; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Klinger, </em>373 F. 2d 847; <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>Shanker, </em>25 N Y 2d 780; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>24 N Y 2d 666.) II. Petitioners lack standing to claim a denial of equal protection by the discretionary leave-to-appeal procedure, since they have been granted permission to appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pereira, </em>31 A D 2d 613; <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>31 A D 2d 613; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brabson, </em>28 A D 2d 989, 31 A D 2d 524; <em>Longshoremen\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>347 U. S. 222.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-5\">Scileppi, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9W\">The three appellants herein were all convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. Thereafter, they were .spared that penalty when their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. On direct appeal to our court, all three judgments of conviction were affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The appeals herein are by permission of Chief Judge Fuld directly from orders of the Supreme Court, New York County, denying <em>coram nobis </em>relief (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 517, subd. 3). (Terry\u2019s application was denied without a hearing while Pereira and Cruz received <em>Huntley </em>type hearings.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Section 517 (subd. 3) provides, in relevant part: \u201c An appeal may be taken as of right by the defendant from an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction, otherwise known as a motion or application for a writ of error coram nobis, to the court to which an appeal from the judgment of conviction would lie as provided in this section, except that .such an appeal shall lie only directly to the court of appeals by permission as provided .in section five hundred twenty where the judgment is of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The appellants are attacking the constitutional validity of section 517 (subd. 3) alleging a deprivation of equal protection. The argument is advanced that if a person not under a judgment of death possesses an absolute right to an appeal (to the Appellate Division) from a denial of <em>coram nobis </em>relief, then it is a violation of equal protection to relegate persons under judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ments of death to apply for leave without any <em>right </em>to an appeal, from a similar denial of <em>coram nobis. </em>While the argument, on its face, seems compelling, these appellants have no standing to raise such an issue. Having granted leave to appeal, our consideration of the merits of the <em>coram nobis </em>applications necessarily precludes a consideration of the equal protection argument since the appellants are in no way aggrieved. Accordingly, to pass upon the equal protection claim would be tantamount to rendering an advisory opinion (Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, \u00a7 98).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On the merits, appellant Terry makes a \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d argument. He contends, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(11 N Y 2d 279), that it was error to admit his confession at trial since it was given only after he had been confronted with illegally seized evidence. Whatever merit there may be to this argument, he has not properly preserved the question, having failed to move to suppress the confession or in any way object to its admission at trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>24 N Y 2d 666, 670). Additionally, Terry asks for a <em>\u201c Huntley \u201d </em>hearing. This claim is equally without merit. Unlike the companion cases, Terry\u2019s case was before us after our determination in <em>People </em>v. <em>Huntley </em>(15 N Y 2d 72) and on the direct appeal the demand for a <em>Huntley </em>hearing was considered and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Accordingly, the denial of Terry\u2019s application without a hearing was in all respects proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">As to appellants, Pereira and Cruz, although no objection was made to the admission of their confessions at trial, the Judge did submit the issue of voluntariness to the jury and, therefore, they were properly afforded <em>Huntley </em>hearings <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>15 N Y 2d 72, 77, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The sole argument offered in support of the claimed involuntariness of the confessions is that at the time the statements were made, the appellants were laboring under the misapprehension that none of the victims were dead and that if the District Attorney had <em>\u201c </em>properly \u201d informed them of the victim\u2019s death, they would never have made the statements. The argument is patently devoid of merit for, even in the cases where actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>deception is made out, which is not the case herein, we have refused to find confessions involuntary. As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>McQueen </em>(18 NY 2d 337, 346): \u201c Near the end of the trial, to be sure, defense counsel moved a second time to strike from the record these confessions on * * * the ground that <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>they were secured by fraud and deceit \u2019\u2014which apparently referred to the circumstance that one of the detectives had told appellant in the beginning that she might as well admit what she had done inasmuch as otherwise the victim, who she had not been told had died, would he likely to identify her. She may not have known, at that time, that he was dead. No contention is made, however, nor is there evidence that any promise or threat was made to appellant, and the law is well settled that in the absence of such factors mere deception is not enough <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caserino, </em>16 N Y 2d 255, 259).\u201d (See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>22 N Y 2d 476, 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Accordingly, the orders of the Supreme Court, New York County, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Bergan, Breitel, Jasbn and Gibson concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(16 N Y 2d 731); <em>People </em>v. <em>Pereira and Cruz </em>(11 N Y 2d 784).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\">. It should also be noted that. Terry made a 1966 application for <em>coram nobis </em>relief alleging similar grounds to those urged herein. This application was denied and no appeal was ever taken from that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
