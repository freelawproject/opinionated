The legislation is not discriminatory on its face. There is no invidious discrimination in enforcement since, whenever an apartment toilet stoppage is involved, there is ample reason for requiring the owner rather than the occupant to make the repair, and rights as between owner and occupant are not affected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Utica Daw\u2019s Drug Co., </em>16 A D 2d 12; <em>Matter of Martinis </em>v. <em>Supreme Ct., </em>20 A D 2d 79, 15 N Y 2d 240; <em>Matter of Edelman </em>v. <em>Baumgartner, </em>12 A D 2d 922; <em>Matter of Teuch </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>45 Misc 2d 81; <em>Matter of Pagano Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dwyer, </em>195 Misc. 157, 275 App. Div. 705; <em>Matter of Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of Westchester County </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Vil. of Croton-on-Hudson, </em>21 A D 2d 693; <em>Matter of Di Maggio </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>19 N Y 2d 283; <em>Matter of Morris </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>29 A D 2d 856; <em>Paterson </em>v. <em>University of State of N.

They involve the sufficiency of notice afforded a landlord of an order to abate a nuisance, and the postponement of adjudication of the landlord\u2019s liability for repairs until after his tenants have been ordered to pay their rent to the department to satisfy the repair claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The nuisance, a blocked toilet, was located in an apartment at 116 West 139th Street in Manhattan, occupied by a welfare recipient of the city. She asserted that she telephoned the landlord\u2019s office and reported the stoppage on December 23, 1966, but that when no repairs were made she telephoned again on December 27, and was told by the landlord that repairs would not be made under any circumstances. Later that day she visited the landlord, whose principal again refused to make repairs, and threatened eviction if she complained to the authorities. Upon receipt of her complaint, an employee of the City Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ment of Buildings telephoned the landlord that same day. The landlord, however, argues that it knew nothing of the stoppage, which was wholly within the tenant\u2019s apartment, until it received a bill for repair of the toilet. The bill for the repair and administrative expenses was $58.10, although such repairs had usually been of nominal cost to the landlord, and had never exceeded $25.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Administrative Code provides that landlords and tenants are jointly and severally liable for nuisances (\u00a7 564-17.0). The Board of Health may declare a building or a portion of a building a nuisance or dangerous to life and health, and order the condition abated (\u00a7 564-18.0). If the nuisance continues unabated, the Board of Health, or any agency of the city, may execute the order by making the necessary repairs (\u00a7 564-20.0) and demand payment from those liable to abate the nuisance (\u00a7\u00a7 564-22.0 to 564-26.0). The department may demand payment of the sum due from those owing rent to the landlord (\u00a7\u00a7 564427.0 to 564430.0). The money so collected is held by the department in anticipation of an action by the landlord to recover the money thus collected (\u00a7 564-31.0), at which time the issue of liability may, presumably, be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The code provides that a landlord be given personal service \u25a0of the order to abate, or, if necessary, service by mail or posting of the order on the offending premises (\u00a7 564421.0, subds. a, b). The Board of Health is empowered, however, to declare that a nuisance is so widespread that the regular provisions for notice are not feasible. Instead, by general newspaper publication, without specification of names and addresses, the board may order that <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>any such nuisance which may exist upon or in any real or personal property or place located within the area or areas specified in such order \u201d be abated (\u00a7 564-21.0, subd. c). (The issue was not tendered in this case whether the code provisions apply only to nuisances existing at the time the board adopts its order, or may extend to future nuisances, and that issue is, therefore, not considered.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">On January 29, 1965, the Board of Health passed and subsequently published a resolution declaring buildings without, <em>inter alia, </em>effective sewage disposal facilities a nuisance, and ordered that adequate sewage disposal facilities be provided throughout the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Occasions may arise requiring abatement of a nuisance without any prior notice to those otherwise charged with the duty to abate, when the giving of notice is not feasible. Eeasonable notice must be given, wherever possible, however, to provide a landlord, or other party, opportunity to abate the nuisance not created by him or of which he may not have, and could not have, actual notice by reason of control or operation, in a manner causing the least disruption to the premises and minimizing the costs which he must bear ultimately. The blockage of tenant\u2019s toilet, occurring entirely within the tenant\u2019s apartment, is such a case. Even if a blocked toilet causes such \u20181 imminent peril\u201d as to justify emergency abatement procedures (see \u00a7 564-20.0), a telephone call to the landlord informing him of the order would not only be a reasonable form of notice, but might conceivably expedite the repair. (Indeed, the Department of Buildings, charged with implementation of emergency repairs, provides in its internal manual of procedure that repairs are to be made only in the event a landlord cannot be located or is unwilling to make repairs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In the instant case, the pleadings reveal contested issues of fact involving the notice assertedly given the landlord by both the tenant and Department of Buildings. Whatever the code provision\u2019s (\u00a7 564-21.0, subd. c) application to nuisances created after the order is promulgated, an order to abate may not be enforced with respect to a nuisance not created by the landlord other than one of which he must have or should have known because of actual control, or operation, unless the department makes reasonable efforts to notify the landlord, beyond a notice by general publication made before creation of the nuisance in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The proceeding should be remanded for a resolution of the factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Although the landlord is entitled to notice and an initial opportunity to effect necessary repairs, he is not entitled to a judicial determination of liability before his tenants are asked to make payments due from them as rent directly to the department. First, except in cases of imminent peril, which a toilet blockage may be, the Administrative Code provides for an administrative hearing to challenge the order to abate prior to its execution (\u00a7 564-19,0). Second, the requested rent payments are limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>by the statute to the outstanding cost of the repairs, and the landlord may sue to recover any rents collected and establish his nonliability. There is no authority to hold rents in excess of the amount of the costs, and the retention of any such excess would be invalid and unconscionable. \u2018 \u2018 Where only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial inquiry is not a denial of due process, if the opportunity given for the ultimate judicial determination of the liability is adequate \u201d <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>283 U. S. 589, 596-601). The instant procedure involves none of the special irreversible economic hardships requiring prior judicial proceedings, as does wage garnishment <em>(Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U. S. 337) or termination of public assistance payments <em>(Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U. S. 254).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Scileppi, Bergan, Jasen and Gibson concur; Judge Bubke taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Order modified, without costs, by remitting matter to Supreme Court, New York County, for a hearing in accordance with the opinion herein, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
