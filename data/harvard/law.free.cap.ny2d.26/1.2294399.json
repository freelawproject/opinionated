The decision of the United States Supreme Court on June 16, 1969, granting appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari after that court had directed specific argument as to the applicability of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U. S. 123, the vacatur of the judgment of this court and the remand of appellant\u2019s case to this court for further consideration in the light of <em>Burton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>notwithstanding the earlier decision of that court in <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 250 (1969), decided two weeks prior to the grant of appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and nearly two full months after the decision of this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>24 N Y 2d 550 (decided April 23, 1969), a decision which the Supreme Court undoubtedly considered in deciding appellant\u2019s petition amounts to a definitive adjudication from the highest court in our land that appellant is indeed entitled to a new trial in light of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra. (United States ex rel. Catanzaro </em>v. <em>Mancusi, </em>404 F. 2d 296; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18; <em>Peoples. Peres, </em>299 N. Y. 784, 300 N. Y. 208.) II. With respect to appellant\u2019s conviction of manslaughter his statements were totally excul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>patory. His codefendant, Moll, however, not only incriminated himself but Stanbridge as well in his statements. As to his manslaughter conviction appellant is on all fours with the <em>Bruton </em>rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>24 N Y 2d 696.) III. Appellant\u2019s conviction of robbery in the first degree should be reversed in the light <em>of Brut on v. United States </em>since the harmless error rule cannot be applied here inasmuch as appellant\u2019s conviction is not predicated upon overwhelming evidence. Instead, the entire evidentiary content of the People\u2019s case consists of appellant\u2019s suspect confessions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McQueen, </em>18 N Y 2d 337; <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478.) IV. Appellant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated by virtue of testimony adduced by the People. A joint trial severely prejudiced appellant\u2019s substantial rights. V. The trial prosecutor\u2019s use of Moll\u2019s confession as evidence of guilt against Stanbridge in summation was violative of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\"><em>William Cahn, District Attorney (Henry P.

The judgment should be upheld. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>24 N Y 2d 696; <em>People </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>24 N Y 2d 550; <em>People </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>24 N Y 2d 935; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.

He was also convicted of robbery, larceny and assault charges arising from the store robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Stanbridge confessed his participation in the crimes. He had two accomplices, Robert Moll and John Closter, who also confessed. There was a joint trial in which the confessions of each defendant were received, each only against the one confessing, with adequate limiting instructions to the jury as to the others. This court in 1967 affirmed all three convictions with a dissenting opinion by Judge Burke in which Chief Judge Fuld joined <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moll, </em>21 N Y 2d 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">On June 16, 1969 the Supreme Court of the United 'States on petition of Stanbridge vacated the judgment of conviction as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>him and remanded the case to this court \u20181 for further consideration in light of <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U. S. 123\u201d <em>(Stanbridge </em>v. <em>New York, </em>395 U. S. 709).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The decision in <em>Bruton </em>turned entirely on the absence of confrontation of witnesses required by the Constitution in a criminal trial. This absence was noted when a codefendant\u2019s confession implicated the complainant and was received in evidence at a joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In such a situation, the human nature of juries being what it is, the Supreme Court felt the protection of judicial instruction to the jury not to consider what A\u2019s confession said about B was an inadequate safeguard.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u25a0So the rule of <em>Delli Paoli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(352 U. S. 232), resting on the supposed protection of careful judicial instruction, was overruled. The essence of <em>Bruton </em>as laid down by Justice Brennan is this: \u201c Here the introduction of Evans\u2019 confession posed a substantial threat to petitioner\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him, and this is a hazard we cannot ignore. Despite the concededly clear instructions to the jury to disregard Evan\u2019s inadmissible hearsay evidence inculpating petitioner, in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions'as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination \u201d (391 U. S., p. 137).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Further consideration of the present case with the <em>Bruton </em>doctrine in mind requires this court to see both the extent to which there was an absence of confrontation against IStanbridge when the whole record is looked at; and if the rule of <em>Bruton </em>had been violated, whether the other evidence in the case was so strong as to subordinate the effect on Stanbridge of confessions of codefendants to a minor role so as to say the error was harmless within <em>Harrington v. California </em>(395 U. S. 250 [1969]).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Justice Brennan, dissenting in <em>Harrington, </em>felt that \u201cthe deterrent effect of \u2019 \u2019 <em>Bruton </em>and some other cases \u2018 \u2018 will be significantly underminded \u201d by <em>Harrington </em>(395 U. S., p. 255). A State court must, however, take the two cases the way they have been laid down and follow them both in good faith and as far as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">On confrontation with the confessing codefendants, there was full adversary opportunity for Stanbridge\u2019s lawyer to examine these defendants as to the statements made by them involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Stanbridge. All three defendants testified at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing; none testified at the trial. Counsel for Stanbridge cross-examined Closter, one of the codefendants; he had opportunity to cross-examine Moll but did not do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The complete absence of confrontation found in <em>Bruton, </em>therefore, did not exist here; and although there is a difference between the cross-examination afforded at a trial, absent here because defendants did not testify, and that afforded at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing where they did testify, the availability of a means to test truth seems significantly to distinguish this case from <em>Bruton </em>where there was no such availability of cross-examination or confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">This court, considering the effect of <em>Bruton, </em>has noted the difference in effect where codefendants testify at the trial and are subject to cross-examination <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>24 N Y 2d 696). It has applied the same rule where opportunity to cross-examine was afforded at a <em>Huntley </em>hearing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>24 NY 2d 935).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">On somewhat different grounds, the court also has not applied the <em>Bruton </em>rule where there are multiple confessions of codefendants and the complaining defendant has himself confessed, apparently because this is a safety check on the reliability of the confession or, in any event, minimizes the prejudicial effect of receiving implicating confessions of other defendants. <em>\u201c </em>[I]n a case such as this, the logic of <em>Bruton </em>is inapplicable \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>24 N Y 2d 550, 552 [Scileppi, J.]). This was in part based on the rationale in <em>United States ex rel. Catanzaro </em>v. <em>Mancusi </em>(404 F. 2d 296).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">This reasoning suggests somewhat the broader view of <em>Harrington </em>which affords ground on which the record in this case should be distinguished from <em>Bruton. </em>If Stanbridge\u2019s confession be taken into account, the evidence against him is, indeed, as overwhelming as that considered in <em>Harrington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The issue on the validity of that confession is now closed and as a matter of law it must be held a free and voluntary confession properly received against Stanbridge. This, as to Stanbridge, was the main, problem debated in this court, as the dissenting opinion demonstrates (21 N Y 2d 706, 709-711).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The Supreme Court did not reopen this issue in remitting to consider the effect of <em>Bruton </em>which is quite a different question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and so the confession of Stanbridge added to the circumstantial case against him gives strong enough support to the judgment to come within <em>Harrington. </em>Indeed the identity of an unusual car owned by Stanbridge, observed at the scene of the crime by a youthful and alert witness, led to the apprehension of all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Upon reconsideration the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Judges Soileppi, Breitel, Jasen and Gibson concur with Judge Bergan <em>; </em>Chief Judge Fuld and Judge Burke concur in the following memorandum: Although we still subscribe to the view set forth in the dissenting opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNeil </em>(24 N Y 2d 550) \u2014which would require a reversal here\u2014we are constrained by the majority\u2019s decision in that case to vote for affirmance. (See, also, concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. Galloway, 24 N Y 2d 935, 936.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Upon reargument by defendant Stanbridge: Original decision of this court, dated December 29, 1967, affirming the judgment, adhered to.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
