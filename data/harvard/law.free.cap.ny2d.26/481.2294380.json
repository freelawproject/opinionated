The 1964 Grand Jury Annual List for New York 'County from which the Second August, 1964 Grand Jury was chosen was so selected and composed as to deny appellants the equal protection of the laws and due process of law in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions. <em>(People v. Agron, </em>10 N Y 2d 130; <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>18 N Y 2d 355; <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>100 U. S. 303; <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>103 U.

Under the doctrine of <em>People </em>v. <em>Steuding </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>De Feo </em>which prevailed at the time defendants appeared before the Grand Jury, they could not be granted immunity and compelled to testify because they were targets of the <em>investigation. </em>The <em>Gillette-Steuding-De Feo </em>rule was a rule of personal liberty and it would be a deprivation of due process to apply the subsequent doctrine of <em>People v. Tomosello </em>and <em>People v. Ianniello </em>to this case. <em>(People v. Epton, </em>19 N Y 2d 496; <em>People v. De Feo, </em>308 N. Y. 595; <em>People v.

Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418.) III. The proffered grant of immunity to defendants was procedurally defective and constitutionally inadequate. <em>(Stevens v. Marks, </em>383 U. S. 234.) IV. Defendants were not fully and fairly informed of their rights when before the Grand Jury. V. The informations failed to allege an essential element of the offense and the evidence failed to establish the requisite <em>mens rea </em>beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Post Std. Co., </em>13 N Y 2d 185; <em>Matter of Spector v. Allen, </em>281 N. Y. 251; <em>People ex rel. Munsell v. Court of Oyer &amp; Terminer, </em>101 N. Y. 245; <em>People ex rel. Bernstein v.

The Grand Jury was lawfully impaneled without systematic and intentional exclusion of any element of the community entitled to representation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shakur, </em>25 N Y 2d 705; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Comm., </em>396 U.

Any disproportionate representation of Negroes, Puerto Bicans, blue collar workers and low income groups was not systematic and intentional. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>316 U. S. 400; <em>Rabinowitz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>366 F. 2d 34; <em>Fay </em>v. <em>New York, </em>332 U. S. 261, 296 N. Y. 510; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>368 U.

The exclusion of persons under thirty-five years of age and those on welfare assistance was a valid exercise of discretion to set relevant qualifications for grand jury service. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>294 N. Y. 405.) IV. The $250 property requirement (former Judiciary Law, \u00a7 596, subd. 3) was not applied to the selection of the 1964 Grand Jury. <em>(Samuels </em>v. <em>Mackell, </em>288 F. Supp. 348, 393 U. S. 975, 395 U. S. 957.) V. Appellants were not required to give testimony in violation of their constitutional rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tomasello, </em>21 N Y 2d 143; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418, 393 U.

The explanatory remarks of the prosecutor were not intended as conferrals of immunity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>21 N Y 2d 967.) VII. Appellants\u2019 contempt was fully proved upon legally sufficient informations. This Grand Jury was the proper party to draw the information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418, 393 U. S. 827; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saperstein, </em>2 N Y 2d 210, 353 U.

VIII. Convictions on separate counts of contempt were proper, since the refusals to answer were separate crimes, and in any event only concurrent sentences were imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Riela, </em>7 N Y 2d 571, 364 U. S. 474; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saperstein, </em>2 N Y 2d 210, 353 U. S. 946.) IX. The sentences were not excessive.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b516-4\">Chief Judge Fuld.</author>\n<p id=\"AZM\">The six defendants in this case were charged with criminal contempt (former Penal Law, \u00a7 600, subd. 6) for refusing to answer questions during an investigation by a New York County Grand Jury after they had been granted immunity. After unsuccessfully attempting to challenge the informations, in both the Federal and State courts, on the ground that the Grand Jury was unlawfully constituted, the defendants were tried and convicted in the New York City Criminal Court and their convictions were unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Term. On this appeal, they argue, among other things, that the Constitution requires all juries to be drawn from a cross section of the community and that the underrepresentation of certain minority groups on the New York County Grand Jury List rendered their convictions invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In December of 1964, each of the defendants was called to appear as a witness before a Grand Jury of New York County, which was conducting an investigation into the activities of three individuals\u2014not the defendants\u2014who were suspected of having played a major role in a series of riots that had occurred in the summer of 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants were regarded as \u20181 lesser figures in the conspiracy [who had taken] their directions \u201d from others and, before calling them to the stand, the Grand Jury voted to grant them immunity so that they could obtain the evidence needed against the major suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>When the defendants were called to testify, the District Attorney informed them of the Grand Jnry\u2019s decision to grant them immunity and of the fact that they could be held in contempt if they refused to testify. Despite these monitions, however, each refused to answer several questions and persisted in his refusal after the foreman of the Grand Jury, at the request of the District Attorney, directed him to respond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, on March 8, 1965, the Grand Jury, with the approval of the Supreme Court, directed the District Attorney to file in the New York City Criminal Court an information against each defendant, charging him with several counts of criminal contempt (N. Y. City Grim. Ct. Act, \u00a7 42, subd. [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendants then sought to remove the case to the United States District Court, claiming that the \u201cgreat majority of qualified Negro and Puerto Bican citizens \u201d were excluded from service on grand juries in New York County and that they were, therefore, \u201c denied * # * a right under * * * law[s] providing for the equal [protection of] civil rights of citizens of the United States \u201d (U. S. Code, tit. 28, \u00a7 1443, subd. [1]). The District Court decided that it lacked jurisdiction to try the case and, on appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that decision <em>(Chestnut </em>v. <em>New York, 370 </em>F. 2d 1, cert. den. 386 U. S. 1009). In so doing, however, the court noted that the defendants had raised \u201c serious constitutional issues \u201d concerning the State\u2019s grand jury selection process (370 F. 2d, atp. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Beturning to the State courts, the defendants applied to the Supreme Court, New York County, \u201c for an order revoking [its] approval \u201d of the Grand Jury\u2019s directive to file the informations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>against them. An extensive hearing was conducted in which the court examined, in detail, the methods and procedures employed for the empanelling of grand juries in New York County. In particular, several officials of the County Clerk\u2019s office explained how they compiled the annual list of persons <em>\u201c </em>suitable to serve as grand jurors \u201d which they were required to submit to the County Jury Board (Judiciary Law, \u00a7 609, subd. I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their testimony demonstrated that most of the persons on that list had qualified and served as grand jurors in previous years. It further appeared that the names of additional persons were obtained, as vacancies occurred, from the County Clerk\u2019s list of petit jurors. This was accomplished with the aid of a computer, programmed to eliminate the names of government employees and of persons under 35 years of age and over 65. All others on the petit jury list who had established a satisfactory record of attendance as trial jurors were sent letters enclosing application forms and inviting them to serve as grand jurors. Response to the letter solicitations was poor, only about one third of the persons contacted even troubling to respond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>cations were also received from persons ' who, unsolicited, appeared at the County Clerk\u2019s office, as well as from individuals referred to the office by other grand jurors, the County Grand Jury Association and judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The applicants were each requested to appear at the clerk\u2019s office for a personal interview at which an official would explain the duties and function of grand jurors and verify the answers on the questionnaire which all prospective jurors in New York City are required to fill out (Rules of Jury System of City \u00f3f New York, 22 NYCRR 620.2, 620.18). On the basis of (1) the questionnaire, (2) a credit report and (3) the applicant\u2019s criminal record, if any, the County Clerk\u2019s office would then decide whether or not the applicant\u2019s name should be submitted. All persons on relief and persons against whom judgments of divorce on the grounds of adultery had been entered were rejected, along with those who did not meet the express statutory qualifications contained in section 596 of. the Judiciary Law. One statutory provision, which, however, was not enforced, was the requirement\u2014since repealed (L. 1967, ch. 49, \u00a7 1)\u2014that a juror own property worth in excess of $250. In the year 1964, 144 new applicants were rejected and the-remaining applicants, numbering about 200, were added to the list of about 2,000 jurors who had already qualified as grand jurors. Throughout this selection process, the testimony demonstrates, there was no intent or desire to exclude, members of minority groups from this list, although it did contain a very small percentage of Negroes and English-speaking Puerto Ricans in relation to their proportion of the population.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Based on the evidence presented, the court at Special Term denied the defendants\u2019 motion, stating that \u201c \u2018 [w]ant of proportional representation of groups not proven to be deliberate and intentional is not constitutionally offensive.\u2019 (Froessel, J., in <em>People </em>v. <em>Agron, </em>10 N Y 2d 130, 141, citing <em>Fay </em>v. <em>New York, </em>332 U. S. 261, 291; <em>Akins </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>325 U. S. 398, 403.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Finally, in May of 1967, more than two years after the filing of the information against them, the defendants were brought to trial before a three-judge court in the Criminal Court. The trial consisted, almost entirely, of readings from the transcript of the Grand Jury minutes, and, on the strength of that testimony, each of the defendants was convicted on one or more counts and received sentences ranging from probation to six months in the workhouse. As already noted, their convictions were unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In evaluating the defendants\u2019 argument that the Grand Jury was illegally constituted, it is important to point out that the defendants\u2014who, with exception of the defendant Chestnut, are white \u2014 do not claim that they have any evidence that the lack of equal representation by racial minorities on the Grand Jury was the result of a policy of purposeful and intentional exclusion, a course of conduct which would not only violate the Constitution but would render the officials of the County Clerk\u2019s office subject to criminal penalties as well (Civil Bights Law, \u00a7 13). Bather, they maintain that, regardless of intent or motivation, the State had an affirmative duty to provide a jury which was made up of a cross section of the community and that the lack of equal representation, whatever its cause, deprived them of their constitutional rights. More .specifically, it is the defendants\u2019 contention that \u201c [t]he constitutional command for a jury of peers is not merely negative, forbidding active discrimination, [but] It enjoins an affirmative duty upon the state to provide such a jury. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As the defendants recognize, this argument is at odds with our past decisions; in order to sustain a claim of an illegally constituted jury, it is essential, we have held, that <em>intentional and systematic discrimination </em>must be proved and that a showing of mathematical disparity, without more, is insufficient to meet this burden. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>18 N Y 2d 355, 359-360, cert. den. 387 U. S. 934; <em>People </em>v. <em>Agron, </em>10 N Y 2d 130, 141, cert. den. 368 U. S. 922; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dessaure, </em>299 N. Y. 126, cert. den. 337 U. S. 949.) Thus, for example, in the <em>Horton </em>case (18 N Y 2d 355, <em>supra), </em>the defendant had made a claim similar to that advanced by these defendants, based upon the fact that there was only one Puerto Bican on the panel from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>which his trial jury was chosen. Noting that, according to the census, some 13.4% of the county\u2019s population was of Puerto Bican origin, we wrote (p. 360):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201c This does not, of itself, indicate a <em>prima, facie </em>denial of equal protection. <em>Since there is no evidence of any deliberate, intentional or systematic exclusion of any particular race, appellant\u2019s position is u/ntenable. (People </em>v. <em>Agron, </em>10 N Y 2d 130, 140-141 [1961].) Our ruling in <em>Agron, </em>equally applicable here, was that a mere showing of imbalance on one particular jury panel does not, without more, demonstrate a denial of a particular defendant\u2019s right to equal protection. Here there is neither direct evidence of exclusion of a particular racial group nor evidence of a long-continued pattern of exclusion which prompted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s determinations in <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(332 U. S. 463 [1947]), and <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(294 U. S. 587 [1935]). (See <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>368 U. S. 57 [1961].) \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The defendants, however, point out that the United States Supreme Court has, in recent rulings,. considered statistical disparity in passing upon claims of discrimination in the selection of jurors. (See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Fouche, </em>396 U. S. 346, 357-360; <em>Whitus </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>385 U. S. 545, 550-552.) From this, they would have us decide that a showing of disproportion in representation is all that is necessary to sustain such a claim. We do not read the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in this way. Study of them indicates that, although a statistical disparity may be used, along with other factors, as evidence in support of a claim of purposeful discrimination, it is not a ground, in itself, for concluding that a jury is impermissibly constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In the <em>Whitus </em>case (385 U. S. 545, <em>supra), </em>for example, the appellants, in addition to showing a substantial statistical disparity in the representation of Negroes on the jury panel, also established that' the names of jurors had been drawn from tax digests which listed Negroes separately from whites. In the court\u2019s view, it was the combination of these two factors which <em>\u201c </em>constituted a prima facie case of <em>purposeful </em>discrimination \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(385 U. S., at p. 551; emphasis supplied). Similarly, in <em>Turner </em>(396 U. S. 346, <em>supra), </em>it was shown that a substantial statistical disparity had arisen at the one point in the selection process in which the jury commissioners were called upon to use their subjective judgment. In particular, the evidence indicated that 171 out of 178 jurors rejected on grounds that they were not \u201cupright\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d were Negroes. The court\u2019s conclusion was not that the jury was unlawfully constituted per se but that the appellants had \u201c thereby made out a prima facie case of jury discrimination\u201d which the State failed to overcome (396 U. S., at p. 360).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the present case, the District Attorney asserts, and it is not denied, that the principal cause for the underrepresentation of minority groups on grand juries in New York County is the reluctance of the members of those groups to volunteer for jury duty. Although this is unfortunate,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it does not establish that there has been any unconstitutional discrimination against the members of those groups by those involved in the selection process. Nor does the Constitution require, as the defendants maintain, that the present voluntary system he abandoned and replaced by a compulsory system to insure that Negroes will be fully represented on grand jury panels whether they wish to be or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The County Clerk\u2019s office did, it is true, intentionally exclude welfare recipients, persons adjudged guilty of adultery and persons under the age of 35, and this, the defendants insist, constitutes invidious discrimination even under the traditional standard. We may not, however, say that any of these criteria is so totally lacking in reasonable justification as to render it unconstitutional. The 35-year age limit, for example, was used in the computerized selection of names from the list of trial jurors only as a convenient means of eliminating those who were not likely to have the requisite experience as petit jurors to evaluate the degree of evidence which \u2018 \u2018 would, if unexplained or uncontradicted, warrant a conviction by the trial jury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 251). The age limit was not applied where the names came from judges or other sources. Persons adjudged guilty of adultery were eliminated on the ground that it constituted evidence of moral turpitude, a ground which is not seriously challenged by the defendants. As for the practice of excluding welfare recipients \u2014 a practice which has since been discontinued \u2014 it was apparently founded upon an assumption, which may have been erroneous, that it was unlawful for people on welfare to receive money from other governmental sources. Be that as it may, there is no basis for an inference that this criterion was used as a means of discriminating against poor people.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In sum, the record, taken as a whole, establishes that the County Clerk and his staff tried diligently to fulfill their statutory duty to select grand jurors who are \u2018 \u2018 intelligent; of sound mind and good character [and] well informed \u201d (Judiciary Law, \u00a7 596, subd. 6 [renum. subd. 5 by L. 1967, ch. 49]). By choosing jurors on the basis of these factors, rather than race or ethnic background,, their actions were clearly consistent with the policies embodied in the Equal Protection Clause. As the Supreme Court only recently reaffirmed <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Comm., </em>396 U. S. 320, 332), \u201cThe States remain free to confine the selection [of jurors] to citizens, to persons meeting specified qualifications of age and educational attainment, and to those possessing good intelligence, sound judgment, and fair character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In addition to their challenge to the composition of the Grand Jury before which they were called, the defendants raise several additional arguments for reversal, only one of which has merit. All but one of the defendants were convicted on multiple counts of contempt, even though each of them made it perfectly clear, at the outset, that he would not answer any questions concerning the alleged conspiracy. The District Attorney multiplied the counts by asking them several questions, all of which were related to statements made by one of the suspects at a meeting held on July 30,1964. In this respect, the case closely resembles <em>People </em>v. <em>Riela </em>(7 N Y 2d 571), in which we held that a witness\u2019 statement, after being granted immunity, that he would not answer questions about a particular subject \u2014 in that case the notorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\"Apalachin\" meeting - constituted a single act of contempt, regardless of the number of questions put to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The sentencing judges in the case before us, apparently recognizing that the defendants were guilty of only a single act of contempt, directed that the sentences imposed on each of the several counts were to run concurrently. It may well be that the imposition of concurrent sentences eliminated any actual prejudice to the defendants but proper application of the rule required the court to find the defendants guilty of but a single contempt, sentence each of them for that crime and dismiss all the other counts. This result may be accomplished, without the necessity of remanding for resentencing, by simply modifying the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Before bringing this opinion to a close, we discuss briefly one other point which the defendants raise. Since the questions put to them related to their own conduct, they insist that they were really \"targets\" of the Grand Jury\u2019s investigation and as such could not be compelled to testify even though granted immunity. Their argument is based upon our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>De Feo </em>(308 N. Y. 595) which\u2014though subsequently overruled (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418, cert. den. 393 U. S. 827; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomasello, </em>21 N Y 2d 143) \u2014was still in effect at the time they refused to testify. However, what the defendants overlook is that the cases relied upon were concerned with the question whether a prospective defendant who had <em>not </em>been granted the complete immunity conferred by section 2447 of the former Penal Law could be held in contempt for his refusal to answer questions. In a case such as the present, where there has been entire compliance with the immunity statute, it has always been the rule that any witness, whether or not a <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>target \u2019 \u2019 of the investigation, could be required to testify and be subjected to prosecution for contempt should he willfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>refuse to do so. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Gold </em>v. Menna, 25 N Y 2d 475, 482; <em>People </em>v. <em>Breslin, </em>306 N. Y. 294, 297.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In conclusion, then, the defendants willfully refused to testify before a Grand Jury after they had been offered a complete grant of immunity in accordance with the statute. The Grand Jury was a lawfully constituted body, chosen without regard to race or other discriminatory factors and, apart from the fact that\u2014except in the case of the defendant Shallit who was adjudged guilty on only one count\u2014thn single act of contempt which each defendant committed was artificially multiplied by repetitive questioning, their convictions were entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The judgments appealed from should be modified in accordance with this opinion and, as ,so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Breitel, Jasen and Gibsof concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. One of the three suspects, William Epton, was eventually indicted and convicted of the crimes of conspiracy to riot and advocacy of criminal anarchy. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Epton, </em>19 N Y 2d 496, app. dsmd. and cert. den. 390 U. S. 29.) He subsequently instituted a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal court in which he raised the same arguments asserted by these defendants and was released on bail pending a determination of the question in the State courts. (See <em>United States ex rel. Epton </em>v. <em>Nenna, </em>281 F. Supp. 388.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\">. Under section 2447 of the former Penal Law, immunity is conferred upon a witness when the Grand Jury, at the request of the District Attorney, directs that witness, who has asserted his constitutional privilege, to answer questions put to him and he complies with that directive. It is to he noted that, as long as it follows the statutory formula, the Grand Jury has the power to order the witness to respond, and there is no need to obtain a further directive or order from the court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Riela, </em>7 N Y 2d 571, 575.) Such court approval would, however, he required if the Grand Jury wished to compel an answer without granting immunity on the ground that the exercise of the privilege was \u201cpalpably not in good faith\u201d. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ianniello, </em>21 N Y 2d 418, 425, cert. den. 393 U. S. 827.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">. Subdivision 1 of section 609 of the Judiciary Law reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201c1. Selection of grand jurors. The annual list of persons to serve as grand jurors at the terms of the supreme court for the trial of criminal actions within the city of New York * * * shall be made up in the following manner: the county clerk shall make special investigation of persons qualified to serve as trial jurors. The county clerk shall require each applicant for service as a grand juror to record the fingerprints of his two hands <em>* </em>* * Such fingerprints shall be promptly forwarded to the central bureau of criminal identification * * * with the request that all information on file as to the previous record, if any, of such person, be forthwith transmitted to the county clerk. * * * [T]he county clerk shall not place the name of such person upon the grand jury list if such person\u2019s record contains a conviction for a felony or for a felony or for a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. <em># # #</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\"><em>\u201c </em>The county clerk shall make a list of those persons who, this investigation shows, are suitable to serve as grand jurors. * * * The annual grand jury lists shall be selected therefrom by the respective county jury boards.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-12\">. Many of the applicants responding, the record indicates, did so only because of a mistaken belief that they had been effectively summoned and were required to respond. Many others proceeded no further on learning of the demands which service on the Grand Jury would make upon their time, a factor which undoubtedly contributed to the relatively high proportion of \u201cretired\u201d persons among those ultimately selected to serve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\">. For example, of the 1,999 persons on the 1964 list whose race could be identified, only 33, or about 1.6% were Negro, despite the fact that, according to the 1960 census, Negroes comprised 24% of the county\u2019s adult population. Similar disparities existed in the representation of poor people, blue collar workers and persons who never attended college.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. It is a source of some satisfaction to note that efforts, conducted by the New York County Clerk\u2019s office since 1964, to increase the participation of minority groups on grand juries have met with considerable success.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">. \u201c What is of significance \u201d, we wrote in the <em>Riela </em>case (7 N Y 2d 571, 576, <em>supra), </em>\u201cis that it was apparent from the very start of his interrogation that Riela, relying upon the privilege, would decline to answer any question bearing on the \u2018 Apalachin meeting \u2019, and that the questions, different though they were from one another, all related to that one subject. This being so, he is guilty of the single contempt of refusing to give testimony concerning the Apalachin gathering, rather than 17 contempts for refusal to answer individual questions about it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
