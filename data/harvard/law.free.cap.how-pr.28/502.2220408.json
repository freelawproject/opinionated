And the plaintiffs charge that said assignment was fraudulent, and was made by said Dakin with intent to hinder, defraud and delay'his creditors, and especially the plaintiffs, in the collection of their said demand, and that the same was made to prevent the plaintiffs from collecting the amount due them on said promissory note. That said defendant Jewell is a brother-in-law of said Dakin; that as plaintiffs are informed and believe, the said Jewell did not pay any consideration or value for said assignment, but the same was made wholly without consideration; that said Dakin still continues, in effect, the owner of said bond and mortgage, and the interest that has been paid thereon since said pretended assignment has been paid to said Dakin, and received by him to his own use; that a copy of said attachment was soon after the commencement of the action aforesaid, served upon the said defendant Jewell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">The complaint then demands judgment as follows : That the assignment of the bond and mortgage be adjudged to be fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs ; that the title to the bond and mortgage be adjudged to be in Dakin ; that the bond and mortgage be adjudged to be subject to the lien of the attachment and execution; that the sheriff be authorised to collect this bond and mortgage from Fite Miller, and employ the proceeds to the satisfaction of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment and execution; that the parties may be enjoined, &amp;c., <em>pen dente lite.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">The answer of the defendant Fite Miller, admits the execution of the bond and mortgage, and that there is due thereon $3,*150, and interest from July 1, 1863; admits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>that on July 21, 1862, the sheriff of Tompkins county served on him the attachment, and attached the bond and mortgage; denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to the regularity of the plaintiffs proceedings under the attachment; avers that interest is paid to July 1, 1863; avers that plaintiffs and Jewell both claim the bond and mortgage adversely to each other, and that he, the defendant, is ready to pay the right owner, and cannot determine who that is, whether the plaintiffs or Jewell; denies each and every allegation not expressly admitted. The answer of the defendant Dakin denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to plaintiffs being a corporation; denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to whether attachment was issued; admits service of attachment on Miller, but denies knowledge as to whether Miller gave a certificate, and says if it was given it was not true ; denies that sheriff attached any indebtedness of Miller to him; denies that Miller was indebted to him when attachment was served; avers that on- August 1, 1862, and for four months anterior thereto, and ever since, defendant Jewell was the legal holder and owner of the indebtedness and bond and mortgage, and solely entitled to demand and receive said indebtedness; denies knowledge, &amp;c., of inventory, appraisement, proceedings under attachment,judgment, transcript, docketing and execution; admits that he had no property in the state of New York, wherewith to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 judgment in whole or in part; denies he has any interest in the bond and mortgage; avers that the judgment is founded on the note to Bramhall, dated March 1, 1861; that as collateral for the note Bramhall holds a mortgage on an undivided one-third of real estate in Vermont, purchased chiefly by defendant of Bramhall; denies that the plaintiffs have any right to have satisfaction of their judgment out of the bond and mortgage; denies that the assignment to Jewell was or is fraudulent; admits that on March 26, 1862, he assigned the bond and mortgage to Jewell; avers that he assigned, sold and delivered the bond and mortgage in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>faith, and Jewell purchased them in good faith for $3,500, then and shortly subsequent, paid by said Jewell to defendant in cash, and that such assignment was valid ; asks leave to refer to assignment and bond and mortgage in the possession of Jewell since the assignment; denies that the assignment was fraudulent; denies that the assignment was made and delivered, or received with any fraudulent intent, or with any such intent or design as is averred by the plaintiffs ; avers that he received full consideration for the assignment, and that he has not been the owner of the bond and mortgage since the assignment, and has had no interestin it; denies that any interest since the assignment has been paid to him as his own, or received as his own, or for his use ; avers that any such interest by him received since the assignment, was received by him as the agent, and for the use of Jewell, on the receipt thereof; denies all fraud and fraudulent purpose, design or practice, averred or charged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Answer of defendant Jewell, denies knowledge, &amp;c., of plaintiffs beitig a corporation, and of Dakin\u2019s indebtedness; denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to attachment and the proceedings under it; admits that sheriff served attachment on Miller as alleged, but denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to whether Miller gave certificate, and says if it was given it was not true ; denies that sheriff attached any indebtedness of Miller to Dakin; denies that Miller was indebted to Dakin when the attachment was served ; avers that on August 1,1862, and for four months anterior thereto, and ever since, he was the exclusive legal holder and owner of said indebtedness ; denies knowledge, &amp;c., of inventory, appraisement, proceedings under the attachment, judgment, transcript, docketing, execution, and whether it can be satisfied ; denies knowledge, &amp;c., as to whether Dakin has property in this state, and avers that plaintiffs have no right to have the execution satisfied out of the bond and mortgage; denies that the plaintiffs have acquired any lien on the bond and mortgage by the attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ment; denies that the assignment is fraudulent; avers that Dakin, March 26, 1862, duly assigned said bond and mortgage, and it was recorded, &amp;c.; avers that Dakin assigned, sold and delivered the bond and mortgage in good faith, for $3,500, then and shortly thereafter paid by defendant to Dakin in cash; such assignment being in writing in due form of law, acknowledged and recorded; asks leave to refer to assignment, and bond and mortgage, which since March 26, 1862, was in his, Jewell's, personal custody and possession; denies that the assignment was fraudulent; denies that the assignment was given or received with any fraudulent intent, or with any intent or design averred by the plaintiffs ; avers that he paid a full consideration for the assignment, and that Dakin has not been the owner of the bond and mortgage since the assignment, and has had no interest in it; denies that any interest since the assignment has been paid to Dakin as his own, or been received by Dakin as his own, or for his own use ; avers that any such interest received by Dakin since the assignment was received by him as the agent, and for the use of him, Jewell, and that he paid such interest to him, Jewell, on the receipt thereof; admits the service of the attachment on him as alleged, and says he gave the sheriff a certificate that on March 26, 1862, he purchased the bond and mortgage of Dakin, and paid him for it in full, and then held it in his possession; denies all fraud, fraudulent intent and practice, wherewith he is charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">Dakin was a resident of the state of Vermont, as admitted by the answers, and sworn to by the witnesses on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">On the trial, the plaintiffs claimed that the only disputed question of fact in the case was as to whether the assignment of the bond and mortgage by Dakin to Jewell, dated March 26, 1862, was fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs, who were creditors of Dakin. That from the testimony of Edmund C. Bramhall, a witness sworn on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>trial, could be gathered the connection and situation of Bramhall and Dakin, and the manner in which the note upon which the judgment was recovered, originated. Bramhall advanced money to carry on an enterprise in Vermont, which was expended by Dakin, and, as would appear, in which enterprise both Bramhall and Dakin had an interest. This money was obtained from the plaintiffs by loans to Bramhall. March 27, 1861, Bramhall and Dakin had a settlement, and on that settlement it was ascertained that Dakin owed Bramhall the amount of the note, and Dakin gave the note on which judgment was recovered to Bramhall for \"the balance thus found due by him on the settlement, and Bramhall indorsed the note to the plaintiffs for the money they had loaned to him, and which had thus been expended by Dakin in his enterprise. The enterprise in which Dakin was thus engaged was not successful. This was evident by the whole of the testimony of Bramhall\u2014 he said the money expended was money thrown away. Dakin had given Bramhall to understand while he, Bramhall, was making advances, that the said bond and mortgage of Fite Miller should be given to him as security for such advances. When the enterprise became unsuccessful, Dakin sought to evade the promise to Bramhall to secure him for his advances by means of the Miller bond and mortgage, and when in October, 1861, Bramhall sought to obtain from him the performance of his promises, and thus obtain the bond and mortgage, Dakin refused to give it to him, and stated that he would put the bond and mortgage beyond his, Bramhall\u2019s reach. Bramhall testified, that when in Vermont, Dakin had promised him that this bond and mortgage should be applied to this debt, and that after-wards, to wit: in October, 1861, when he again saw Dakin in Vermont, and reminded him of this promise, Dakin then refused to carry out the promise, and threatened to put the bond and mortgage beyond the reach of any one holding this claim.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>William Wilkinson, <em>attorney, and </em>William Henry</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-5\">Arnoux, <em>counsel for defendant,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-6\">moved to dismiss the complaint on the merits. 1st. On the ground that the plaintiffs have shown no fraudulent transfer of the bond and mortgage, and no want of consideration. 2d. As matter of law, for want of jurisdiction in the court to grant the judgment in the action against the non-resident defendant Dakin, the summons never having been served on him personally, and there was no appearance <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 135, <em>sub. </em>4). The bond and mortgage being personal property and movable, is governed\" by the law of the domicil of the owner. <em>(Story\u2019s. Con. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 376 <em>and </em>379; <em>Sill </em>agt. <em>Worewick, </em>1 <em>H.

Plaintiffs standing as simple contract creditors, cannot attack an alleged fraudulent assignment. <em>(Reubens </em>agt. <em>Joel, </em>13 <em>N. Y.

That the ley under the execution relates back to the\" levy under the attachment. <em>(Skinner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>agt. <em>Stewart, </em>13 <em>Abb. </em>442 ; <em>Burkhardt </em>agt. <em>Sanford, </em>7 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>259.) This action is not what is commonly known as a judgment creditor\u2019s suit, but an action to remove an obstruction that prevents the attachment and execution at law, and it is the province of a court of equity to come in in aid of legal remedies where fraudulent obstructions are placed in the way of their enforcement. In such an action it is not necessary to aver the return of an execution. The creditor having an attachment does not stand in the position of the creditor at large,'but a creditor with a special lien, which is to be enforced by the execution. <em>(Hendricks </em>agt. <em>Robinson, </em>2 <em>John. Ch. R. </em>283; <em>affirmed in the Court of Errors, </em>17 <em>John.

Ch. R. </em>565 ; <em>Rinchey </em>agt. <em>Stryker, </em>26 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>75, <em>Court of </em>Appeals.) As to the insufficiency of the answers in denying that the assignment of the bond and mortgage was fraudulent or made with a fraudulent intent. <em>(Litchfield </em>agt. <em>Pelton, </em>6 <em>Barb. </em>187; <em>Dykers </em>agt. <em>Woodward, </em>7 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>313; <em>Churchill </em>agt. <em>Bennett, </em>8 <em>Id. </em>309.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b514-5\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axh\">My findings of fact, &amp;c., show the ground upon which I dismiss the complaint, irrespective of the question of fraud, or of other questions in the case. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel appears to concede in his points that the action cannot be maintained as a judgment creditor\u2019s bill or action, technically, but he insists that the action can be maintained as an action to remove a fraudulent obstruction out of the way of the plaintiffs\u2019 execution. But if Dakin had never assigned the bond and mortgage, or if his assignment were declared fraudulent and void, the plaintiffs could not reach or sell the bond and mortgage, or the mortgage debt, by or under the execution. How then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>could or can Dakin\u2019s assignment of the bond and mortgage be an obstruction in the way of the execution ? <em>(See Beck </em>agt. <em>Burdett, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>305 ; <em>McElwain </em>agt. <em>Willis, </em>3 <em>Id. </em>505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As the assignment by Dakin to Jewell of the bond and mortgage, was good between the parties to it, however fraudulent it may have been as to the creditors of Dakin, I doubt whether the sheriff could attach the same, or the debt secured thereby, whefchey the sheriff\u2019s proceeding under the attachment was not nugatory ; but if otherwise, it has been frequently held by this court that the lien acquired by the levy of an attachment under the Code, <em>even on chattels </em>alleged to have been fraudulently assigned, would not <em>alone </em>authorise an action to set aside the assignment as fraudulent, either before or after judgment in the attachment action. <em>(Wilson </em>agt. <em>Forsyth, </em>24 <em>Barb. </em>105; <em>Brooks </em>agt. <em>Stone, </em>11 <em>Abbott, </em>220; <em>Mills </em>agt. <em>Block, </em>30 <em>Barb. </em>552.) Indeed this follows from the decision in <em>Reubens </em>agt. <em>Joel </em>(13 N. <em>Y. R. </em>488). There is nothing in the decision, or in either of the opinions in <em>Fassett </em>agt. <em>Tallmadge, </em>referred to by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, which favors the plaintiffs\u2019 right to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The complaint must be dismissed as to all the defendants, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
