The trial took place at the circuit court in Genesee county, in June, 1864. In the complaint, the plaintiff set forth by metes and bounds, a description of certain real estate, which he claimed to own, and on which it was alleged the defendant had trespassed. The defendant in his answer admitted that the plaintiff was the owner of the property thus described. Upon the trial it appeared that the parties were occupants of adjoining lots in the village of Batavia, and the trespass complained of consisted in the erection of a wooden addition to the defendant\u2019s building, made upon the rear of the lot occupied by him. The plaintiff claimed that it extended over upon the land described in the complaint, which the defendant denied. Aside from the question of damages, that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the issue presented and tried at the circuit. The jury-decided it in favor of the plaintiff, but rendered their verdict for less than fifty dollars damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\">M. F.

By those made and proven on behalf of the plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s addition was shown to extend over upon the premises described in the complaint, while those on the part of the defendant excluded it from them. The question became, therefore, one of location solely, depending upon the accuracy of the respective measurements. If those relied upon by the plaintiff were correct, the effect of the defendant\u2019s answer was to admit that the addition was over upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, and it consequently followed that the trespass had been committed. If they were not correct, and those relied upon by the defendant were, then it became entirely immaterial upon whose land he had built, for the plaintiff had no cause of complaint on account of it. The question thus presented and litigated, was, therefore, not one of title, but merely one of location, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the piece of land on which it was claimed the defendant had trespassed, was a portion of that which he admitted was owned by the plaintiff. That brought the controversy to one which concerned the possession only. For when it was satisfactorily shown to be a part of that described in the complaint, it followed that it was in the plaintiff\u2019s possession at the time of the trespass. If the lines of the land are properly laid as claimed by the plaintiff, the title which the defendant\u2019s answer admitted, drew after it a constructive possession <em>(Dewey </em>agt. <em>Bordwell, </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>65). The production of the plaintiff\u2019s deed could make no differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ence, for it would be of no use as evidence where the title and description were fully ascertained by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><em>In Ehle </em>agt. <em>Quackenboss </em>(6 <em>Hill, </em>539), this court held that the term \u201c title,\u201d as used in the statute under consideration, is limited to the right of possession. In this case the inquiry was as to the fact, not the right of possession. For when the fact was ascertained to be as the plaintiff alleged it, the right stood admitted. <em>(Idem, </em>540; <em>see also Ford </em>agt. <em>Sampson, </em>17 <em>How. </em>447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The application made must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
