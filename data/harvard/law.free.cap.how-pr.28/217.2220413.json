The jury on that day rendered a verdict in favor of respondent for $175.73 and costs. The costs were subsequently adjusted at $39.04, and on the 13th January, 1863, the judgment was entered in favor of respondent for $214.50, being entered by mistake for twenty-seven cents less than the true amount, which was $214.77. The plaintiff Frohue appealed to the general term from this judgment, and it was subsequently affirmed. Upon his appeal and to stay proceedings, he caused to be executed by defendants and filed an under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>taking, reciting in it that the judgment was recovered on the 18th December, 1862, in the Kings county court, by Levi respondent, against Frohue appellant, for $214.11. This undertaking was filed on the 8th/January, 1863.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-5\">H. C.

The judgment is recited as being twenty-seven cents more than the amount for which it is entered ; and, 2. That the judgment was not in fact entered until after the undertaking was filed;</p>\n<author id=\"AVl\">J. F. Barnard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The first of these objections is not -in fact true, the verdict is given, and the costs as taxed are given ; the footing up of the two sums is only erroneous, but the defendants are estopped by their recitals in the undertaking. They executed, acknowledged and filed this paper to. stay proceedings on appeal. The verdict had been rendered and the costs taxed. They put in the recitals. They are bound by their paper as they made it. <em>(Decker </em>agt. <em>Judson, </em>16 N. <em>Y. R. </em>439 ; 22 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>494.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
