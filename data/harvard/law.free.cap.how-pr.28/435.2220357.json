If a plaintiff chooses to commence an action of interpleader, that action must be governed by the practice and rules which obtained in chancery in such cases. By that practice no such order as the one asked for could be granted until after the bill had been taken <em>pro confesso </em>as against all the defendants. Up to that time the defendants had a right to come in and demur to or answer the bill, and the issues raised by the demurrer or answer were then disposed of in the ordinary manner of disposing of issues; if the plaintiff succeeded on the issues, then he obtained his relief by the decree made thereon. An action under the Code for an interpleader, must take the same course. The defendants have a right within twenty days after the service of the summons and complaint on them to present their objections and defences to the complaint and the relief thereby asked, either by demurrer or answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">An order granting such relief can only be made after all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the defendants have failed either to demur or answer within the time allowed by the Code for an answer or demurrer to be served. On this ground, without considering the other objections urged, I think the motion should be dismissed, with costs. The plaintiff, however, may apply <em>ex parte </em>for an injunction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>appeared had only thirty days from that time within which to appeal <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 332). That time having expired, this court has no power to allow one to he now brought <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 405). That such was the intention of the legislature is evident. By section 149 of the Code of 1848 (now section 113), it was provided that \u201c the court may at any time, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or a mistake in any other respect, or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or by conforming the pleading or proceedings to the facts proved, whenever the amendment shall not change substantially the cause of action or defence.\u201d Under this section no one would claim a power to allow an appeal or exf\u00e9\u00f1dx the time to bring one, and hence section 215 of the Codo of that year (now section 327), simply provided that \u201c an\u2018.appeal must be made by the service of a notice in wi#ibg/\u00f3n the adverse party and on the clerk with whom judgment or order appealed from is entered, stating the appeal from the judgment or some specified part thereof.\u201d Section 366 of the Code of 1848 (now section 405), read as it now does, except that time to do any act after judgment could not be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In 1849 the legislature made section 149 of the Code of 1848, section 173, and amended it by adding \u201c the court may likewise in its discretion allow an answer or reply to be made, or any other act to be done after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarge such time,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>This section has not since been materially amended, except that what was added in 1849 has been made a new section and numbered 174. The legislature seems to have foreseen that perhaps under the term \u201c or any other act to be done after the time limited by this act,\u201d it might be claimed the court had power to allow an appeal after the right (o it was lost, and litigation endlessly prolonged. Regarding an appeal after one hearing as a favor (5 <em>How. </em>366; 7 <em>Id. </em>112), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>prevent any mistake as to their intention, they added to section 327 of the Code of 1849 (section 275 of Code of 1848, <em>supra), </em>as follows : \u201c When a party shall give in good faith, notice of appeal from a judgment or order, and shall omit through mistake to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal (i. <em>e., </em>to give an undertaking, &amp;c.), or to stay proceedings, the court may permit an amendment on such terms as may be just,\u201d showing clearly that they did not intend to give the court power to allow service of a notice of appeal after the right to do so was gone. (5 <em>How. </em>366; 16 <em>Id. </em>338.) The whole act is to be taken together, and section 174 construed with reference to this declared intention of the law makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">That this court has not power to allow an appeal or enlarge the time to bring one has been held in the following cases: <em>(Renouil </em>agt. <em>Harris, </em>2 <em>Code Rep. </em>71, <em>Gen.

Pritchard, 3 Duer, 669, <em>expressly overruled by same </em>court, 16 Id. 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It will be seen that there are&gt; only three special term cases holding the power exists, while the court of appeals, superior court, court of common pleas, and the general terms of the 2d, 3d, 4th and 7th districts, and numerous special terms hold the contrary. There should be uniformity in the practice, and general term decisions should be followed by other districts, unless they have already held the other way. (16 <em>How. </em>289 ; 7 <em>Abb. </em>416 ; 29 <em>Barb. </em>350 ; 39 <em>Id. </em>633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In <em>Wait </em>agt. <em>Van Allen </em>(22 N. Y. 319), the question of power in the court to extend time to appeal was certainly up and decided. That case originated in justice\u2019s court. At the term after decision, a motion was made for leave to go to the court of appeals. The motion was not decided until the next term, but was then granted, and finally ordered to be entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of the term when the motion for leave was made. The fault if any, was the neglect of the court, and yet on motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court possessed no power to thus extend the time, the appeal was dismissed, the court holding (p. 321) that as soon as the time within which an appeal could be brought had expired \u201cthe plaintiff had an absolute right to the fruit of his recovery, of which it was not in the power of the court to deprive him\u201d <em>(see also </em>16 N. Y. <em>Rep. </em>600).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The rule is thus laid down (2 N. Y. <em>Pr. </em>115-16) by Messrs. Tiffany <em>&amp; </em>Smith: \u201c The notice of appeal must be given properly and in good faith, within the time allowed by law for appealing, or the right is lost; the court cannot relieve the party who has \"omitted this ; but where a party shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>in good faith, and within the proper time,- give notice of appeal, and shall omit through mistake to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings, the court will permit an amendment.\u201d It was held in this district in the case of <em>People ex rel. Gilchrist </em>agt. <em>Field, late sheriff (argued July General Term, </em>1856), that service of a copy of the order appealed from, certified as a copy by the clerk, without any notice whatever, or even the name of the respondent\u2019s attorney on it, set the time running within which an appeal must be brought, and that the right to appeal having once been lost, the court could not allow one, and the appeal brought after thirty days was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">III. Service of notice of appeal against the plaintiffs, on them and the clerk, was of no avail against these defendants. It was not sufficient to authorize the court to allow an appeal against them. Section 321 provides that \u201c when a party shall give in good faith, notice of appeal from a judgment or order, and shall omit through mistake to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings, the court may allow an amendment on such terms as may be just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\"><em>(\u0430) </em>No notice of appeal, case, exceptions undertaking or other paper relating to an appeal was served. This provision only allows an \u201c amendment.\u201d Where nothing has been done there is nothing to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">(\u0431) This applies to acts other than service of a notice of appeal, and then only when notice.of appeal has been actually served on the adverse party against whom the appeal is desired, and on the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In <em>Tripp </em>agt. <em>DeBow </em>(5 <em>How. </em>114), the notice of appeal was properly served on the clerk, and was also served on the respondent personally, instead of on his attorney. The court held the appellant had not- served notice of appeal as provided by the act. In <em>Fry </em>agt. <em>Bennett </em>(16 <em>How. </em>385), the appellant duly served notice of appeal from the judgment. Held, it could not be amended so as to make it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>an appeal from an order denying a new trial. The court <em>(p. </em>381) said, \u201c for the purpose which the appellant has in view, two appeals were necessary, and although it may not be irregular to include both appeals in the same notice, it is authorizing an appeal where none has been taken, to allow an alteration of the notice which has been served, so as to embrace two appeals instead of one, and it can no more be done than a new and separate notice can be permitted.\u201d In <em>Morris </em>agt. <em>Morange </em>(26 <em>How. </em>247), the notice of appeal was properly served on the adverse party and mailed to the clerk on the last day, but not received by him until four days afterwards. <em>Held (Gen. T. 2d. Dist.), </em>that \u201c the notice of appeal ivas insufficient to give the appeal effect, and the court had no power to grant any relief to the appellant by which he could make his intended appeal effectual.\u201d So also in <em>Ellsworth </em>agt. <em>Fulton </em>(26 <em>How. </em>23), the court says, \u201c to give notice of appeal in order to give the court jurisdiction to allow the amendment under the section, means to make out the notice in writing and serve it on the adverse party and on the clerk.\u201d To serve it upon either and not on the other, is not giving notice of the appeal within the meaning of the section. This I think evident from what the omission is from which the court has power to relieve the party, which is to omit to do any other act necessary, &amp;c. Other than what ? Clearly than to give notice of appeal. No other interpretation is admissible. The only construction which Avould aid the plaintiff Avould involve the following absurd reading of the section: <em>\u201c </em>When a party shall give in gooff faith notice of appeal from a judgment or order, and shall omit through mistake to give notice of such appeal as required by this section, or to do any other act necessary,\u201d &amp;c. The section is general, and relates to all appeals provided by the Code in civil cases, to which its provisions in Avliole or in part can be made to apply, and that part of it under which the plaintiff seeks relief was intended to apply to such cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>as an appeal from a judgment of the supreme court to the court of appeals, where the party appealing has served written notice upon all the'proper persons, hut has neglected by mistake to give the undertaking, or to make the deposit as required by section 334, without which such appeal is not available for any purpose, to a case where it is necessary to have the appeal operate as a stay of proceedings, and such an undertaking has been omitted by mistake; where the judgment appealed from directs the assignment or delivery of documents or personal property, and the party appealing has inadvertently omitted compliance with such directions, which is required by section 336 as a condition of the appeal operating as a stay of proceedings, together with all other cases where something necessary to be done besides giving the notice of appeal, has been 'omitted from the same cause, and which is necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">IY. But in this case, even if the court had the power to relieve the appellants, they are clearly not entitled to a favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">(a) Mr. Bates did not omit to serve notice of appeal on Countryman <em>&amp; </em>Moak \u201c through mistake.\u201d He did not intend to do so. He intended to do just what was done, and nothing more. <em>Ignorantia juris non excusat. </em>Ignorance of law is one thing, omission \u201c through mistake,\u201d to do an act, quite another. In this case he knew all the facts, and elected to take the consequences. A party is presumed, indeed, bound to know the contents of a judgment from which he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">(&amp;) The law_as to the effect of the appeal he brought was well settled <em>(Point I, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">(c) He understood perfectly well the notice was'served to limit his time for bringing an appeal, and insisted he would not bring one.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">(d) By allowing an appeal under such circumstances, the court would hold out a premium to claims of mistake and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>other paltry excuses which can never be denied or disproved, and it is difficult to conceive a case in which a party would not be relieved.</p>\n<author id=\"b450-5\">Mason, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJe\">There can he no doubt, I think, that the appeal in this case as to the defendants Laura, Jane M. and George L., who appeared by Countryman &amp; Moak, their attorneys, is wholly ineffectual. As to them there is no appeal, as no notice of appeal was served upon them or their attorneys. The language of the Code is that \u201c an appeal must be made by the service of a notice in writing on the adverse party, and on the clerk with whom the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d The 60th section of the statute regulating appeals from a decree of the vice-chancellor to the chancellor, declared that an appeal from a decree or order of the vice-chancellor should \u201c be made' by serving notice thereof on the solicitor of the adverse party, and on the register, assistant register or clerk with whom the order or decree appealed from was entered \u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>178). The only difference in these two statutes is that the one says that the appeal must be made by the service of a notice in writing on the adverse party, while the other says that it shall be made by serving notice on the solicitor of the adverse party. Now it was adjudged by the chancellor in the case of <em>Thompson </em>agt. <em>Ellsworth and others </em>(1 <em>Barb. Ch. Rep. </em>624), that the adverse party within the intent and meaning of the statute, was the party whose interest in relation to the subject of the appeal is in conflict with the reversal of the order or decree appealed from or the modification sought by the appeal, and this it seems to me is the only sensible construction which can be put upon the statute, and it must control in the construction of the 327th section of the Code. It follows, therefore, that there is no appeal as against Laura Carroll, Jane M. and George L. Rathbun, in this. case.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The only remaining question is whether we can allow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>by way of amendment or otherwise, this notice to be served after the time for appealing has gone by, so as to \"make this appeal effective as against these three defendants. I held some fourteen years ago, in the case of <em>Crittenden </em>agt. <em>Adams and others </em>(5 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>310), that this court had power under the statute to allow an appeal to be taken after the time limited in the Code. The reasons there assigned were, and are now, satisfactory to me for so hold-. ing. The language of the statute is, \u201c the court may, in its discretion, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other act to be done after the time limited by this act.\u201d I am not, however, justified in adhering to that decision, it has been so badly shaken and repudiated by subsequent decisions in this court (2 <em>Code Rep. </em>71; 16 <em>How. Rep. </em>385; 7 <em>Id. </em>108 ; 26 <em>Id. </em>247 ; 5 <em>Id. </em>361; 27 <em>Id. </em>133 ; 5 <em>Id. </em>114 ; 24 <em>Id. </em>20; 13 <em>Id. </em>93; 24 <em>Id. </em>193; 7 <em>Id. </em>197), and especially since the decisions in the court of appeals in the cases of <em>Humphrey </em>agt. <em>Chamberlain </em>(1 <em>Kern. Rep. </em>274), and <em>Wait </em>agt. <em>Van Allen </em>(22 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>319). These cases certainly hold that the time to appeal cannot be extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">There being no appeal against these three defendants, I do not see how these appellants can be helped out of their difficulty under section 327. That section provides that \u201c when a party shall give in good faith notice of appeal from a judgment or order, and shall omit through mistake to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings, the court may allow an amendment on such terms as may be just.\u201d This section has no application, for no notice of appeal has been given as regards these three defendants, and by this section the court can only allow an amendment where a notice of appeal shall have been given in good faith, and the party shall, through mistake, have omitted to do some other act than giving the notice of appeal, which was necessary to perfect the appeal. It is very clear to my mind that this 327th section applies to acts other than the service of notice of appeal, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>amendment can then only be allowed when notice of appeal has been\" actually served on the adverse party, against whom the appeal is desired to be perfected. (5 <em>How. Rep. </em>114; 16 <em>Id. </em>385 ; 26 <em>Id. </em>247; 26 <em>Id. </em>23.) There is another reason why this should not be allowed here. There is no mistake shown. The party did not intend to serve any notice of appeal on these three defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We must strike the cause from the calendar as to these three defendants, and refuse to hear the appeal as to any of the matters affecting their interests, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Parker, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b452-7\">Balcom, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Az-\"><em>dissenting </em>(in part). According to section 327 of the Code, \u201c an appeal must be made by the service of a notice in writing on the adverse party, and on the clerk with whom\u2019 the judgment or order appealed from is entered, stating the appeal from the same or some specified part thereof.\u201d And the main question now presented is whether the three defendants, who have not appealed from the judgment, are to be deemed adverse parties, so as to entitle them to notice of the appeal. Their interests in the case are certainly adverse to those of the appellants. They are as much interested in sustaining the judgment as the appellants are in reversing it, and the only interest the plaintiffs have in the controversy is to have it ended with the least possible expense and delay. The chancellor, in determining who was the adverse party within the meaning of a section of the Revised Statutes and a rule of his court, held that the adverse party was the party whose interest in relation to the subject of the appeal was in conflict with the reversal of the order or decree appealed from, or the modification sought by the appeal <em>(Thompson </em>agt. <em>Ellsworth, </em>1 <em>Barb. Ch. </em>Rep. 624). And I am of the opinion the words \u201c the adverse party,\u201d in section 327 of the Code, should be construed to embrace parties to the action, whose interests in relation to the judg-ment or order appealed from are in conflict with the reversal or modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tion sought by the appeal, and that the defendants in this case who have not appealed from the judgment, are adverse parties within the meaning of that section of the Code, and consequently were entitled to notice of the appeal. And as their interest might be affected by the manner the case and exceptions were proposed and settled, I thinlc their attorney should have been served with a copy of the proposed case and exceptions so they could have proposed amendments thereto, and been heard on the settlement of the case, exceptions and amendments. It follows that the case is irregularly on the calendar as against the defendants who have not appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The next and only remaining question, is whether the appellants can have relief which will enable them to make their appeal effectual and valid as to all the parties to the action. Section 405 of the Code is similar to a rule of the former supreme court, which was held not to preclude the court from permitting a case not made within the time prescribed by it, to stand as if made within such time. (See <em>Hawkins </em>agt. <em>The Dutchess, &amp;c. Co. </em>7 <em>Cow. </em>467 ; 2 <em>Grah. Pr. 2d ed. </em>331.) And I am of the opinion this court possesses the power to allow the appellants\u2019 attorney in this action to serve a copy of the case and exceptions upon the attorneys of the defendants who have not appealed, and have the same re-settled, on notice to them and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">It is provided by section 327 of the Code, \u201c where a party shall give in good faith, notice of an appeal from a judgment or order, and shall omit through mistake, to do any other act necessary to perfect the appeal or to stay proceedings, the court may permit an amendment on such terms as may be just.\u201d The appellants\u2019 attorney gave' his notice of appeal in good faith. It was duly served on the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, and also upon the clerk with whom the judgment was entered. But he omitted through mistake, to serve the notice upon the attorneys of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>who have not appealed, which act was necessary to perfect the appeal. It seems to me that giving the appellants\u2019 attorney permission to serve his notice of appeal on the attorneys of the defendants who have not appealed, will not be enlarging the appellants\u2019 time to appeal, and that the court is authorized to grant this relief to the appellants by section 321 of the Code. I think the Code itself, as well as pleadings, should be construed <em>\u201c </em>with a view to substantial justice between the parties \u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 159, <em>467).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">My conclusions are that the cause should be struck from the calendar, with $10 costs of the motion to be paid by the appellants, and that upon paying $20 costs to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, and said $10 costs to the attorneys of the defendants who have not appealed, within twenty days after notice of the order, the appellants should have leave to serve a copy of the notice of the appeal and a copy of the case and exceptions on the attorneys of the defendants who have not appealed, who should have ten days thereafter in which to propose amendments thereto, and that the case and exceptions should, if amendments are thus proposed, be re-settled upon notice to the attorneys so proposing amendments and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, arid if re-settled, the same as re-settled should be substituted in the judgment roll in place of the same now in it. But if no amendments should be proposed to the case and exceptions within the time aforesaid, then the case and exceptions as now settled should remain in the judgment roll, and the appeal should be heard on the papers as they now stand, with a copy annexed thereto of the notice of the appeal, directed to the attorneys of the defendants who have not appealed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
