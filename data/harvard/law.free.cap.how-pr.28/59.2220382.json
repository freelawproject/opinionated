Martin Barnaman.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-7\">Before a <em>justice of the peace </em>is authorized to proceed with the action in which an <em>attachment </em>has been issued, it is necessary that he should have the <em>officer\u2019s return </em>to the attachment, showing a <em>service of it </em>in the manner provided for by the statute. It is the only manner in which the justice can acquire <em>jurisdiction. </em>The return of the officer is the <em>evidence </em>to be furnished to the justice that the statute has been complied with.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-8\">Where the defendant has had no <em>personal notice </em>of the suit, by the service of the attachment upon him, it is vitally important that the different steps prescribed by the statute should be accurately followed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b63-9\">Where the return of the constable stated that a copy of the attachment was left with Barnaman's (defendant's) wife, at Martinsville, as defendant cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>found in this county,\u201d without an inventory, or any statement that the property had been seized under it: <em>Held, </em>that the return was so <em>fatally defective, </em>as not to afford any protection to the plaintiff in the sale he afterwards made of the property under an execution upon the judgment recovered in that suit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b64-5\">The rule is well settled, that where a statute prescribes a new mode of proceeding, either unknown to the common law, or contrary thereto, the statute, so far at least as those parts of it essential to jurisdiction are concerned, must be not only proved, but shown to have been strictly pursued, or the proceeding will be held a <em>nullity. </em>The same rule applies to courts of limited and special jurisdiction, as justices\u2019 courts. Nothing is presumed in their favor so far as it respects juris diction; and the party seeking to avail himself of their judgments must show affirmatively that they had jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Erie Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AaH\"><em>July, </em>1864.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">Motion for a new trial on a case containing exceptions, The facts sufficient to present the questions determined, appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-8\">Geo. W. Cothran, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-9\">I. The affidavit upon which the attachment was issued is fatally defective. It does not show that the demand claimed rose upon contract. This fact should appear in it affirmatively. (3 <em>R. S. </em>462, \u00a7\u00a7 214, 215, 216, <em>5th ed.; Waters </em>agt. <em>Whitamore, </em>13 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>634; <em>Cowen's Treatise, by Tracy, </em>\u00a7 834; 14 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>96.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-10\">An attachment can issue from a justice\u2019s court against the property of non-residents of the county for demands arising on contract only..</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-11\">In this case the affidavit states that the claim is founded \u201c on a demand arising upon keeping their horses.\u201d This statement does not show that the demand rose upon contract, nor does it prove the existence of a contract between the affiant and the parties proceeded against, relative to the keeping of the horses. It does not show any consent or request of the defendants that the affiant should keep their horses, nor any price, time, place or circumstance of the keeping. No privity of contract is shown by it, nor anything from which a contract could fairly be presumed, and it is just as fair to presume that they were wrongfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>kept as rightfully. But this is a statutory proceeding, and no mere presumptions can be indulged. The affidavit must, conform to the requirements of the statute, state in express terms that the demand arose on contract; or it must contain such an explicit statement of facts, as that the court can readily see that it grew out of contract. <em>(Cook </em>agt. <em>Farren, </em>34 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>95 ; <em>Adkins </em>agt. <em>Brewer, </em>3 <em>Cow. R. </em>206.) It does not state that the demand is notfor the recovery of money collected by a public officer, &amp;c., as required by statute. (3 <em>R. S. </em>462, \u00a7 212, <em>5th ed\", Waters </em>agt. <em>Whitamore, </em>13 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>634.) The statement at the end of the affidavit \u201c that no warrant can issue in this case,\u201d is a mere conclusion of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">II. The bond taken by the justice on the issuance of the attachment, was void for the want of sufficient sureties. The statute provides that \u201c before any attachment shall issue, &amp;c.,\u201d the \u201c plaintiff, or some one in his behalf, shall execute a bond in the penalty of at least one hundred dollars, with such sureties and upon such conditions as is required by section 29, art. 2, tit, 4, chap. 2, part 3, R. S.\u201d <em>(Session Laws </em>1842, <em>ch. </em>107; <em>Id. </em>3 <em>R. S. </em>463, \u00a7 217, <em>5th ed.) </em>Section 29 states the conditions of the bond, and that the sufficiency of the sureties shall be approved by the justice, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">In this case there is no surety in the bond at all, and the justice\u2019s docket shows that the bond taken was the bond of the affiant. Even if the court should conclude that C. S. Hawley, whose name is signed to the bond, is a surety and not a subscribing witness, I contend that the statute requires at least two sureties. The act of 1842, amendatory of the non-imprisonment act, requires a bond \u201c with sureties,\u201d while the Revised Statutes require but one. This is a proceeding under the act of 1842. <em>(Davis </em>agt. <em>Marshall, </em>14 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>96; <em>Homan </em>agt. <em>Brinkerhoff, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>184 ; <em>Robinson </em>agt. <em>West, </em>11 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>309.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-8\">III. The constable\u2019s return of service indorsed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>attachment, is insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the justice. By section 29, chap. 2, art. 2, title 4, part 3, of the Revised Statutes (43), it is provided that \u201c the constable to whom such attachment shall be directed and delivered, shall execute the same at least six days before the return day,\u201d and shall seize sufficient property to satisfy the demand; and \u201c he shall immediately make an inventory of the property seized, and shall leave a copy of the attachment and of the inventory, certified by him, at the last place of residence of the <em>defendant; </em>but if the defendant have no place of residence in the county where the goods and chattels are attached, such copy and inventory shall be left with the persons in whose possession the said goods and chattels shall be found.\u201d Under the non-imprisonment act, the attachment is required to be \u201c served at least two days before the time of appearance therein mentioned \u201d (3 <em>R. S. </em>462, \u00a7 215). And by section 36 of said act, it is provided that \u201c every attachment issued by virtue of this act,\u201d shall be served in the same manner as attachments issued under the second article above quoted from, \u201c except that if the defendant can be found in the county, the copy of such attachment and inventory shall be served upon him personally, instead of leaving the same at the place now prescribed in said article ; and the return of said officer in addition to what is now required, shall state specifically whether such copy was or was not personally served upon the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">It does not appear by the return to the attachment, that a copy thereof, and of the inventory of the property attached, were either personalty served on the defendant, or were left with the person in whose possession the goods were found. <em>(Cook </em>agt. <em>McDoel, </em>3 <em>Denio, 317; same case </em>affirmed, 2 N. <em>Y. R. </em>120 ; 21 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>429 ; <em>Marshall </em>agt. <em>Canty, </em>14 <em>Abb. Pr. R. </em>237.) The return states the manner of service to have been, that a copy was left with Barnaman\u2019s wife at Martinsville, as defendant cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>found in this county.\u201d The return does not show that the attachment was served at least two days prior to the return day thereof. (3 <em>R. S. </em>431, \u00a7 29 ; 3 <em>R. S. </em>463, \u00a7 218.) It should show affirmatively when the attachment was served <em>(Stewart </em>agt. Smith, 11 <em>Wend. R. </em>518). Where the constable\u2019s return does not show sufficient facts to authorize the issuing of a summons, the justice acquires no jurisdiction, and all his subsequent proceedings will be void. <em>(Allen </em>agt. <em>Stone, </em>9 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>60; <em>Waters </em>agt. <em>Whittimore, </em>22 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>593.) The justice acquired no jurisdiction in this case, and the sale of the property under the execution issued on the judgment recovered therein\u2014the defendant not having appeared\u2014constitutes no defence in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">IV. The question of jurisdiction can be raised at any time, in any stage of the proceedings, and in a collateral action or proceeding. (26 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>90 ; <em>Homan </em>agt. <em>Brinkerhoff, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>184 ; <em>Davis </em>agt. <em>Marshall, </em>14 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>96 ; <em>Decker </em>agt. <em>Bryant, </em>7 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>183; <em>Van Alstine </em>agt. <em>Erwine, </em>1 <em>Kern. R. </em>331; 8 N. Y. <em>R. </em>254; 12 N. Y. <em>R. </em>156).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-6\">L. L. Lewis, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b67-7\">Daniels, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">This action was brought to recover the value of certain personal property claimed to be owned by the plaintiff, and wrongfully converted by the defendant. A verdict was recovered by the defendant, which the plaintiff now moves to set aside, and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The only questions arising upon the application, depend upon the validity of proceedings taken in an attachment suit instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff and another, before a justice of the peace in Niagara county, of which the defendants in that action were non-residents. The attachment was issued on the second, returnable on the fifth of June, 1862;\u2014and in his return upon it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>constable wholly omits to state the time when the seizure of the property was made under it. The attachment was not served personally on either of the persons named in it as defendants. But the return states that a copy of it was left with \u201c Barnaman\u2019s wife, at Martinsville, as defendants cannot be found in this county.\u201d There is no statement , whatever contained in the return from which it can be even inferred that she was the person having possession of the property attached when the seizure of it was made, or that any inventory or statement of the property attached was left with the copy of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Before the justice was authorized to proceed with the action, it was necessary that he should have the officer\u2019s return to the attachment showing a service of it in the manner provided for by the statute; and as the defendants had no personal notice of the suit by the service of the process upon them, it was vitally important that the different steps prescribed should be accurately followed. For it was the only manner in which the justice could acquire jurisdiction. The return of the officer is the evidence to be furnished to the justice that the statute has been complied with (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. </em>432, \u00a7 33). In cases where the process is not personally served, the provision is an important one which requires that a copy of the attachment, Avith an inventory of the property seized, shall be left Avith the person in whose possession the goods and chattels shall be found (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. </em>431, \u00a7 28). For the inference is a natural one that the owner Avill leave his property in the hands of one who is charged with the duty of protecting his interest in it. <em>(The Mary, </em>9 <em>Cranch, </em>144; 3 <em>Curtis\u2019 Decisions, </em>296.) Leaving a copy of the attachment with Barnaman\u2019s wife, <em>without an </em>inventory or any statement that the property had been seized under it, would be no notice to her or any one else, that this property was to be. affected by the proceedings, or that any steps were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>necessary for the protection of the owner\u2019s interest in it, even if it were actually in her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">On these defects, without noticing others in the proceedings, they must be held to be so fatally defective as not to afford any protection to the defendant in the sale he after-wards made of the property under an execution upon the judgment recovered in that suit. There was no appearance or waiver of any kind of these omissions to conform to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The rule is well settled, that where a statute prescribes a new mode of proceeding, either unknown to the common law, or contrary thereto, the statute, so far at least as those parts of it essential to jurisdiction are concerned, must be not only proved, but shown to have been strictly pursued, or the proceeding will be held a nullity. The same rule applies to courts of limited and special jurisdiction, as justices\u2019 courts. Nothing is presumed in their favor, so far as it respects jurisdiction, and the party seeking to avail himself of their judgments must show that they had jurisdiction affirmatively. <em>(Mills </em>agt. <em>Martin, </em>19 <em>J. R. 33; Cowen\u2019s Treatise, 2d ed. </em>405), where the same principle is affirmed in these words : \u201c A justice is limited by statute to a certain course of proceedings, and unless those proceedings are adhered to, or waived by the party who has a right to insist on them, the judgment is irregular and void. <em>(Id. </em>400, 403 ; <em>Cowen </em>&amp; <em>Hill\u2019s Notes to Philip\u2019s on Evidence, part </em>1, 468; <em>part </em>2, 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The proceeding relied upon by the defence cannot be sustained without disregarding the principles so fully declared and sustained in these authorities. The verdict rendered in favor of the defendant must therefore be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide, the event of the action. ...</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
