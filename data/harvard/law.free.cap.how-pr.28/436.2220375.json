The defendants Laura Carroll, Jane M. Rathbun and George L. Rathbun (only children of Charles Rathbun, a son of deceased), appeared by Countryman &amp; Moalc, and the defendants Andrew R.

If the defendants represented by Mr. Bates, desired to affect the rights of those who appeared by Countryman &amp; Moak, they were obliged to appeal as against them. It would be strange indeed, if they were necessary parties to the action, and yet as soon as they had established their rights could be dropped, and their rights determined on appeal, without any right to be heard or conduct the litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-11\">The precise point here involved was determined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Thompson </em>agt. <em>Ellsworth </em>(1 <em>Barb. Ch. Rep. </em>624). That was a bill filed against the mortgagor and several others, claiming subsequent interests, to foreclose a mortgage. The mortgagor admitted all the facts in the bill, but the other defendants put the complainant to proof, and were defeated. Judgment was entered against all the defendants for the entire costs. The mortgagor claimed that the costs made oy the other defendants should be charged upon them only. The claim was denied, and he appealed to the chancellor, and executed a joint bond (2 <em>R. S. </em>605, \u00a7 80) to the complainant and five of his co-defendants. The complainant moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the bond as to him was insufficient, and also that it should have been several. Chancellor Walworth says (p. 627): \u201c The adverse party, within the intent and meaning of this 80th section, means the party whose interest in relation to the subject of the appeal is in conflict with the reversal of the order or decree appealed from, or the modification sought for by the appeal.\u201d Again : \u201c Here the appeal is from the whole decree, and the complainant alone is interested in resisting the appellant\u2019s claim to have it entirely reversed \u201d * * * (p.628). \u201c On the other hand, so far as the appellant seeks for a decree over against his co-defendants for the extra costs to which he or his interest in the mortgaged premises may have been subjected by the defence set up by their several answers, the complainant has no interest in the question, and such co-defendants are alone the adverse parties to the appellant, and they only are interested in resisting the modification of the decree in that respect.\u201d The rule was well settled. (1 <em>Barb. Ch. Pr. </em>400, 408, 425-6, 434; 4 <em>Paige, </em>290; <em>Id. </em>279 ; 5 <em>Id. </em>170 ; 9 <em>Id. </em>70, 71; 11 <em>Id. </em>453; 2 <em>Barb. Ch. Rep. </em>434.) Section 471 of the Code retains the former practice in such cases.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"b440-7\">In an action brought by <em>executors </em>for the construction of the <em>will </em>of the testator, where several heirs and devisees claiming under the will are made defendants, and a decree or judgment of the court is pronounced allowing the claims of some of the defendants as against the others, the latter defendants on bringing an <em>appeal </em>from the judgment in order tb effect their appeal, must not only serve their notice of appeal and other papers upon the plaintiffs, but also upon the <em>defendants who have established their claims </em>under the will, as these defendant\u00bb are the <em>adverse party,\u201d </em>within the meaning of the Code (\u00a7 327).'</p><p id=\"b440-8\">Where such adverse defendants are not served with notice of appeal, <em>&amp;c., </em>to effectuate the appeal as to them, but their attorney is served with copies of the caso and notice of argument, on bringing the appeal to a hearing, the attorney thus served, may on motion, have the cause stricken from the calendar as respects the defendants he appears for, with costs.</p><p id=\"b440-9\">The court has no power to allow an appeal to be taken after the time limited in the Code for bringing an appeal. Nor has it any power to extend the time to appeal. And section 327 of the Code only allows an <em>amendment, </em>where <em>notice of appeal shall have been given </em>in good faith, &amp;e.; it applies to acts other than the service of notice of appeal (Balcom, J., <em>dissenting) </em>\u2022</p><p id=\"APu\"><em>January, </em>1865.</p><p id=\"b441-5\">The case was tried at the Otsego special term, in July, 1861. The principal questions litigated were: 1st. Whether the defendant George L. Rathbun, under the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>clauses of the will, on arriving at twenty-one years of age, took the accumulated rents of the Wheeler farm; and 2d. Whether the defendants Laura Carroll and Jane M. Rathbun, were entitled to the interest on the \u00a72,000 bequeathed to each by the <em>third </em>clause, invested on interest by the plaintiffs. The defendants represented by Mr. Bates, claimed the rents and such interest went into the residuum. The court held that George L. Rathbun took the rents, and Laura Carroll and Jane M. Rathbun, were entitled to such interest. Judgment was perfected in Otsego county clerk\u2019s office accordingly, February 5th, 1864. February 27 th, the four defendants who appeared by Mr. Bates, by a notice of appeal directed to the clerk and the attorney for the defendants only, appealed as against the plaintiffs. March 17th, the costs of the defendants were adjusted, and inserted in the entry of judgment. On the 13th of April, the three defendants who appeared by Countryman &amp; Moak, served upon Mr.Bates, the attorney for the four other defendants, a copy of the judgment, with the signature of \u201c D. A. Avery, county clerk of Otsego county,\u201d thereto, and a notice of such judgment, telling him it was done to limit the time for his clients to appeal, and that they understood the law to be that if his clients desired to affect the rights of theirs, as determined by the judgment, his clients must appeal as against theirs. He claimed he had examined the law and should not appeal as against them. No proposed case or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>exceptions was ever served upon or settled as against Countryman &amp; Moak, nor was any notice of appeal served upon them. November 7 th, Mr. Bates served upon Countryman <em>&amp; </em>Moak what purported to be three copies case and notice of argument thereof for November general term at Binghamton. They returned same, and on behalf of their clients moved at that term to strike the cause from the calendar. The court intimated this must be done, and Mr. Bates thereupon asked leave to appeal for his clients as against those of Countryman <em>&amp; </em>Moak.</p><p id=\"b442-9\">(a) The plaintiffs do not represent any of the defendants. All they desire is a construction. They are indifferent as to which class of the defendants succeeds (1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. </em>\u00a7 362).</p><p id=\"b442-10\"><em>(b) </em>The Code (\u00a7 27, <em>sub. </em>1) provides that \u201cjudgment may be given for or against one or more of several plaintiffs, and for or against one or more of several defendants, and it may determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as between themselves.\u201d By section 327, \u201c an appeal must be made by the service of a notice in writing on the adverse party, and on the clerk with whom the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d</p><p id=\"b443-6\">II.
