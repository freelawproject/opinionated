If a plaintiff chooses to commence an action of interpleader, that action must be governed by the practice and rules which obtained in chancery in such cases. By that practice no such order as the one asked for could be granted until after the bill had been taken <em>pro confesso </em>as against all the defendants. Up to that time the defendants had a right to come in and demur to or answer the bill, and the issues raised by the demurrer or answer were then disposed of in the ordinary manner of disposing of issues; if the plaintiff succeeded on the issues, then he obtained his relief by the decree made thereon. An action under the Code for an interpleader, must take the same course. The defendants have a right within twenty days after the service of the summons and complaint on them to present their objections and defences to the complaint and the- relief thereby asked, either by demurrer or answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">An order granting such relief can only be made after all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the defendants have failed either to demur or answer within the time allowed by the Code for an answer or demurrer to be served. On this ground, without considering the other objections urged, I think the motion should be dismissed, with costs. The plaintiff, however, may apply <em>ex parte </em>for an injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
