The plaintiff insists that the wife of the defendant is the owner of two of the houses from which some part of the rent was derived. This objection is met by the defendant fully, by obtaining the consent of his wife in writing, and filing it, to the application of the rent of these houses in the manner asked for by the defendant. I am unable to perceive that the security of the plaintiff will be in any way im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>paired by the application of the rents in the manner asked for, while there will be a continual loss of interest if the money remains uninvested in the hands of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs to the respondent, to await the final judgment in the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
