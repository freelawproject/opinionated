It was then the interest which was to accrue. If the bond had been payable instantly, there would be no question of defendant\u2019s liability. Why limit the liability where it had a term of credit contained in the bond ? The guaranty makes no such limitation. Would it not be interest if the bond was due V Is it not interest after the bond becomes due ? The party has not limited his liability, and the court cannot, if he omits to do it; his interest cannot be inferred or declared from the burden his unrestricted words put upon him. I think the plaintiff entitled to judgment for simple interest only'\u2014the principal debtor cannot be made to pay more, and the surety is only to make good his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Leonard and Sutherland, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
