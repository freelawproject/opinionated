They bring the matter to the cognizance of'the general term, and if it is appealable at all, the court has entire control of the matter on appeal. But this is not an appealable order. Before tlie person who was in the first instance appointed receiver entered on his duties, and indeed before the appointment was consummated by the filing of the requisite bond, the judge in the exercise of the same discretion which induced him to make the first nomination, reconsidered his action, revoked that nomination, and substituted another person. It is of no consequence how or where he received any information which induced him to make the substitution. We think he exercised a discretion which cannot be controlled by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">The appeal should he dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
