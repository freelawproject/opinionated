William S.

For if he had not placed his wall in actual contact with that of the plaintiff, but had left a space of no more than half an inch between the two, it is hardly probable that any vibration would have been communicated to the houses of the latter, of which she would have a right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff must have judgment directing an injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
