By the deed of settlement, Mrs. Lawrence was to have the income for life, with a certain power of appointment by will or otherwise, in the event of her death before that of her husband, and in the absence of any appointment, then the property was to go to her issue then living, and the children of such as might be deceased, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>and in default of such issue \u201c to the next of kin of the party of the first part,\u201d Charlotte E. Ogden, afterwards Mrs. Lawrence. Mrs. Lawrence died before her husband, without issue, and without having made any appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">At the time of the execution of the settlement, Mrs. Lawrence had neither father, mother, nephews or nieces, but she had two sisters, Sarah Goelet and Grace W. Ogden, and one brother, Jonathan Ogden. The two sisters sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>vived Mrs. Lawrence, but the brother died before she did, leaving three children, the defendants, Jonathan Ogden, Charlotte W. Kernochan and Grace W. Kernochan.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u2022The question was whether these children of the deceased brother were entitled to share in the distribution of the fund. The court below held as a conclusion of law, that the two sisters of Mrs. Lawrence were alone entitled to the fund, and that the children of the deceased brother took nothing. From this judgment the defendants Jonathan Ogden, Charlotte W. Kernochan and\u2019Grace W. Kernochan (their husbands joining), have appealed. It is evident that the sole question is as to the meaning of the words next of kin, in that clause of the settlement limiting the property to the next of kin, in default of appointment and of issue. Had. we not been referred to certain comparatively recent English cases <em>(Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>2 <em>Mylne &amp; K. </em>780; <em>and Witty </em>agt. <em>Mangler, </em>4 <em>Beavan, </em>358), affirmed by the House of Lords (10 <em>Clark &amp; Finnelly, </em>215), holding that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliciter, </em>are to be taken to mean \u201c nearest of kin,\u201d I should probably have stated the question in the principal case to be whether the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d were used in the settlement in their technical statutory sense, or meant nearest of kin; and then, assuming that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliciter, </em>had a well known technical statutory meaning, I should have contented myself with saying that there being nothing on the face of the instrument, or in the context, to show that the words were used in a sense other than the technical statutory sense, it was to be presumed the parties used them in that sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Though the English decisions referred to are not obligatory upon us, yet respect for so high authority prevents me from assuming that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d tised <em>simpliciter, </em>in a limitation or disposition' of personal property by voice or deed, have any technical statutory meaning, and I will therefore state, the question in the principal case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to be whether the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d in the limitation by the deed of settlement in default of, issue, and of the exercise of the power of appointment, mean nearest of kin ? By stating this to be the question, I do not assume that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliciter, </em>have a technical meaning, but I undertake to show that they have a technical statutory meaning, and that this meaning is not the nearest of kin, but those of the kindred or relations by blood, who in cases of intestacy, by the statute of distributions, succeed to or share in the intestate\u2019s personal property ; and that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d and the word \u201c distributees,\u201d under^the statute, are not synonymous, but that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d mean such of the distributees as are of the kindred or relations by blood. It may be well to refer to a few of the established rules in construing wills and other instruments disposing of or limiting property, before examining the question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">1. They are \u00bbto be construed so as to carry into effect the intent of the parties, to be gathered from the whole instrument, so far as such intent can by law be carried into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">2. Words are to be taken in their ordinary popular meaning, and the intention is not to be defeated by the use or misuse of technical terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">3. Nevertheless if technical terms are used, it will be presumed that they are used in their technical legal sense, unless the context shows that they were intended to be used in a different sense. (De <em>Kay </em>agt. <em>Irving, </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>646; <em>Lane </em>agt. <em>Lord Stanhope, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>352; <em>Hodgson </em>agt. <em>Ambrose, Douglas, </em>337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In the principal case there is certainly nothing in the context to show that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d in the limitation to the <em>\u201c </em>next of kin,\u201d were not used in their strict technical legal sense, if they had any. On the contrary, I think the use of the words \u201c or 'other next of kin,\u201d in mentioning the objects &lt;Jf the power of appointment, and the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of the technical term <em>per stirpes, </em>and not <em>per capita, </em>in the limitation to the issue of Mrs. Lawrence, and the children of such as may be deceased previously, in the same sentence, tend to indicate that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d in the limitation to the next of kin were used in a technical sense, if they had any. The question then is, whether the words \u201cnext of kin,\u201d simply had or have the technical meaning above stated. I think it maybe said that they have had this, technical meaning since the statute of distributions (22 <em>and </em>23 <em>Car. II, c. </em>10), and that this statute originated and gave this technical meaning to them. The word next, as used in the sixth section of the statute, was not used to express near or nearest alliance by blood to the intestate, but next in place or order, to or after children and their representatives, previously mentioned in the section. The truth is that the word next, as an adjective, is rarely if ever used even in conversation, to express nearness or degree of nearness by blood or affection, between another person and the speaker, except as next after, next in order or degree to some other person previously mentioned. Certainly if one. should\" hear a person call another his next friend, he would not by these words unexplained, understand his near or nearest, dear or dearest friend by affection, without reference to any other person, but he would probably understand his next door neighbor, or a friend next in place, time or degree, to or after some other friend, or technically his \u201c next friend \u201d in some legal proceeding. I suppose it will not be denied that the words \u201c next friend,\u201d have acquired a technical meaning, which originated in a very old statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The word next was not used in the statute of distributions to express the relationship or the degree of relationship by blood to the intestate, but as between the children and their representatives, and other kindred of the intestate, the order in which the kindred should succeed to or share in the personal estate. The children and their representatives are not expressly called kindred in the statute, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>they are impliedly called so, and so are the. legal representatives of the \u201c next of kindred,\u201d within a certain limitation. Now considering that previous to this statute there appears to have been no way of enforcing the distribution of estates of intestates ; that the administrator could keep the whole surplus <em>(Edwards </em>agt. Freeman, 2 P. <em>Wms. </em>447, <em>448; </em>2 <em>Black. Comm. </em>515); that the statute may therefore be said to have first given the right of distribution; that the statute regulates the distribution as between the widow by the term wife, and the kindred, and then the order in which kindred shall take or share ; first, children and their representatives, and then the next kindred in equal degree, and their representatives, within a certain limitation, and that the statute probably originated the principle of representation in the succession to personal estates of intestates, is it not plain as the word heir or heirs acquired its technical legal meaning, from the act or fact of the succession to estates of inheritance <em>(ex her ed\u00edtale) </em>by descent, that is by law, so the words \u201c next of kindred,\u201d or \u201c next of kin,\u201d taken from the statute of distributions, would be likely after the statute to acquire a technical legal meaning from the act or fact of succession under or by the statute, and that this meaning would be likely to be not synonymous with distributees under the statute, but the kindred or blood relations (including those claiming by representation, but excluding a widow as such), who in fact had the right of succession, or the right to share in the distribution by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The whole history of the administration of this statute of distributions, and of the statute 1 <em>Jac. II, c. </em>17, altering it in certain respects, and of our statutes of distribution (1 <em>R. L. </em>313, \u00a716; 2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>96, \u00a7 75), shows that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d have acquired this technical meaning. The cases holding that the widow as such, is not included in these words used <em>simpliciter, </em>nor the husband, where the wife has a power of appointment to her next of kin, simply show that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d have acquired this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>technical meaning. <em>(Green </em>agt. <em>Howard, </em>1 <em>Bro. Ch. R. </em>29; <em>Watt </em>agt. <em>Watt, </em>3 <em>Ves. </em>244; <em>Garrick </em>agt. <em>Lord Camden </em>14 <em>Ves. </em>381, 382; <em>Baily </em>agt. <em>Wright, </em>18 <em>Ves. </em>49; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>Frazier, </em>2 <em>Hump. </em>30; <em>Wright </em>agt. <em>Meth. Epis. Ch. Hoffman, </em>212, 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">No doubt these words have been used frequently as meaning distributees generally, including the widow, when there was no occasion .to discriminate as to the description or character 'by which the distributee or distributees claimed, but when thus used, they were used in a secondary, statutory and technical sense. I doubt whether it can be said that these words have ever acquired, an ordinary, popular meaning,&gt;synonymous with nearest relations or nearest of kin. As was pertinently said on the argument, no one speaks of his or another\u2019s dearest next of kin. Any one would be surprised to hear a sane person say such a one has a next of kin born, or another next of kin born, or has a certain number of next of kin. There has been no occasion (the wants of the language have not required) that the statutory word next should supplant or he used instead of the word near or neatest, to express close or closest alliance by blood or affection to the speaker. The philosophy of language shows that one word is much more likely in course of time to acquire a secondary and a variety of secondary (if the expression is permissible) meanings than three words, used in connection in a particular manner and for a particular purpose in a statute, neither of which could be dropped without destroying their statutory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">It is easy to see how the word heir or heirs, came to have a secondary, and perhaps more than one secondary meaning. First, you have heir or heirs, meaning he or they, who succeed to estates of inheritance by descent by law ; then you have heir or heirs, apparent or presumptive, and then you have heir or heirs, with the word apparent or presumptive dropped, meaning a living child or children. No one would he surprised at the remark that A. B., his neigbor, has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>heir, or another heir, or a certain number of heirs. I think it may be said that all of the English cases prior to <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young </em>(2 <em>Myl. &amp; Keen.), </em>before mentioned (in 1835), tended to show that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliter, </em>in a will or deed, disposing of, settling or limiting personal property, had this meaning. I am certainly safe in saying that this was the first decision to the contrary. In <em>Roach </em>agt. <em>Hammond (Prec. in Ch. </em>401), the devise was to H. of all the testator\u2019s personal estate, for the use of his relations, without specifying any in particular, or using anjr other word ; and it was decreed that those relations (as I understand the report of the case) who by the statute of distributions would be entitled to personal estate in case the testator had died intestate, should take the property in the same proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Thomas </em>agt. <em>Hole (Cases in Eq. in temp. Talbot, </em>251), there was a bequest \u00f3f \u00bf\u00a3500 to the relations of Elizabeth Hole, to b e divided equally between them. At the testator\u2019s death, Elizabeth Hole had two brothers living, and several nephews and nieces. It was determined first, that the word relations should be confined to such relations as were within the statute of distributions ; and next, as the testator had directed the \u00bf6500 to be divided equally among them, that the brothers, nephews and nieces take <em>per capita. </em>This decision appears to have governed the decisions in <em>Edge </em>agt. <em>Salisbury (Ambl. </em>70), and <em>Isaacs </em>agt. <em>Defriez (Ibid, </em>595), where the words were \u201c poorest relations <em>Widmore </em>agt. <em>Woodroffe (Ibid, </em>636), where the words were \u201cthe most necessitous of my relations\u2022\u201d <em>Harding </em>agt. <em>Glynn </em>(1 <em>Atk. </em>469); <em>Winthorne </em>agt. <em>Harris </em>(2 <em>Ves. </em>527), where the words were \u201c near relations <em>Green </em>agt. <em>Howard </em>(1 <em>Bro. Ch. R. </em>28, <em>Perk. ed.), </em>where the words were, \u201c to my own relations who shall then be ali-ve, share and share <em>alike; Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth </em>(3 <em>Bro. Ch. R. </em>64), where the words were, \u201c to be divided among next of kin, share and share <em>alike; Raynor </em>agt. <em>Mowbray (Ibid, </em>234), where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the words were, \u201c to and among all and every such person and persons who shall appear to be related to me only, share and share alike; <em>Loundes </em>agt. <em>Stone </em>(4 <em>Ves. </em>649), where the gift was 'of a residue to the testator\u2019s \u201c next of kin or heir at law, whom I appoint my executor \u201d (the testator in this case leaving one brother, and by deceased brothers a niece and several nephews, one of whom was his heir at law, and distribution according to the statute being decreed); <em>Vaux </em>agt. <em>Henderson, </em>reported in note to <em>Horseman </em>agt. <em>Henderson </em>(1 <em>Jac. </em>&amp; <em>Wal. </em>387), where there was a legacy to A., \u201c and failing him by decease before the testator, to his heirs,\u201d and A. dying before the testator, the legacy was decreed to belong to the next of kin of A. living at the time of the testator\u2019s death; <em>Stamp </em>agt. <em>Cooke </em>(1 <em>Cox, </em>230), where the words were, \u201c next relations,\u201d coupled with words tending to show that the testator meant by \u201c next relations,\u201d sisters, nephews and nieces, and where Lord Kenyon expressly said, if a testator makes a bequest to his \u201c next of-kin,\u201d and stops there, the statute was the rule to go <em>by; Hinckley </em>agt. <em>McLaurens </em>(1 <em>Myl. </em>&amp; <em>Keen, </em>27), where the words were \u201cnext of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliciter, </em>in a gift over, and where it was held that these words, without any explanatory context showing a different intent, must be taken to mean next of kin according to the statute of distributions. Of these cases, the last and <em>Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth </em>(3 <em>Bro. Ch. </em>R.), are directly in point, for in these cases the words \u201cnext of kin,\u201d were usedsm<em>pliciter, </em>and* without any words qualifying them, as descriptive of the object or objects of the gift. It will be recollected that in <em>Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth, </em>the words were, \u201cto be divided among next of kin, share and share alike.\u201d Justice Buller held that the gift should be divided <em>per capita, </em>and not <em>per stirpes, </em>among surviving brothers, and nephews and nieces, representing deceased brothers and sisters, because the gift was to \u201c next of kin, share and share alike,\u201d but I do not see that this holding impeaches the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>decision as to the technical meaning of the words \u201c next of kin.\u201d The words \u201c share and share alike,\u201d did not qualify the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d as descriptive of the objects of the gift. It is probable, however, that the holding that the brothers, nephews and nieces should take per capita, led to the doubting remarks <em>(Brandon </em>agt. <em>Brandon, </em>3 <em>Swanst. </em>319; <em>Garrick </em>agt. <em>Lord Camden, </em>14 <em>Ves. </em>385; <em>and Smith </em>agt. <em>Campbell, </em>19 <em>Ves. </em>404) about the decision in <em>Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth, </em>but those cases did not call for such doubts. In <em>Brandon </em>agt. <em>Brandon, </em>the words of the marriage settlement were, \u201c to the nearest and next of kin \u201d of the wife. In <em>Garrick </em>agt. <em>Lord Camden, </em>the words of the residuary clause of the will were, \u201cto be divided amongst my next of kin, as if I had died intestate.\u201d In <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Campbell, </em>the words of the bequest were, \u201c to my nearest surviving relations in my native country, Ireland.\u201d In none of these cases were the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used without qualifying words. In <em>Brandon </em>agt. <em>Brandon, </em>the word nearest may be said to have qualified the words \u201cnext of kin;\u201d in <em>Smith </em>agt. <em>Campbell, </em>the words \u201c surviving relations,\u201d were qualified by the word nearest, and the subsequent words. The very question in the principal case is whether the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d used <em>simpliciter, </em>mean nearest of kin, and that was the question in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young </em>(2 <em>Myl. </em>&amp; <em>K. </em>780), reversing the decision of the master of the trolls in the same case <em>(Ibid, </em>82), and overruling <em>Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth, </em>and <em>Hinckley </em>agt. <em>McLaurens. </em>In <em>Garrick </em>agt. <em>Lord Camden, </em>the additional words, \u201c as if I had died intestate,\u201d left no room for doubt. If in the principal case, the words \u201c as if she had died intestate,\u201d had been added to the words \u201c the next of kin of the said party of the first part,\u201d we never should have had this case before us. In 1 <em>Maddock, </em>31, <em>Anonymous, </em>and in <em>Wimbles </em>agt. <em>Pitcher </em>(12 <em>Ves. </em>433), where the words were, <em>\u201c </em>next of kin in equal degree,\u201d the decisions went upon the additional words in equal degree. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Colton </em>agt. <em>Scarancke </em>(1 <em>Maddock, </em>35), where the words in a limitation by settlement were, \u201c to the next of kin of the said Anne Parr, her own blood and family, as if she had died sole and unmarried,\u201d it was held that the next of kin took as under the statute of distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">I will refer to a few cases prior to <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>where other general words were used as descriptive of the object or objects of the limitation, devise or bequest. In <em>Robinson </em>agt. <em>Smith </em>(6 <em>Simons, </em>47), the testator bequeathed .\u00a3700 to his daughter\u2019s husband, his executors, &amp;c., in trust, to pay the interest to his daughter, for her separate use for life; after her death to such persons as she should appoint by will, and in default of appointment to \u201c her personal representativesand it was held that her next of kin, to the exclusion of her husband, were entitled to the \u00bf\u00a3700 (see <em>also Baines </em>agt. <em>Otley, 1 Simons, </em>465). In <em>Crosby </em>agt. <em>Clare </em>(Ambl. 397), and <em>Parsons </em>agt. <em>Baker </em>(18 <em>Ves. </em>476), the general word was descendants, but that was qualified by other words, so as to show that a class of descendants was meant. In neither of these cases was there any question of claiming by representation. In <em>Butler </em>agt. <em>Stratton </em>(3 <em>Bro. Ch. R. </em>367), the legacy was to the descend? ants of A. and B. equally, and it was held that the children and grandchildren took <em>per capita. </em>In <em>Wright </em>agt. <em>Alkyns </em>(1 <em>Tur. </em>&amp; <em>Russ. </em>143), it was held that under an immediate devise to A. for life, remainder to \u201c my family,\u201d the heir at law of the testator is entitled in remainder (see <em>the opinion of the Lord Chancellor in this case, </em>158 <em>to </em>164).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">I think it may be said that hot one of the cases prior to the decision in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young </em>(2 <em>Myl. </em>&amp; <em>K. </em>780), interferes with the decisions in <em>Phillips </em>agt. <em>Garth </em>and <em>Hinckley </em>agt. <em>McLaurens, </em>but that most of them tend forcibly to support these decisions ; but it is not to be denied that as the views of the Lords Commissioners in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>were affirmed by the House of Lords in <em>Witty </em>agt. <em>Mangler </em>(10 <em>Clark &amp; Finnelly, </em>215), it maybe said to be now estab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>lished in England that the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d when used <em>simpliciter, </em>as descriptive of the object of a bequest or of a limitation of personal property in a marriage settlement, without any reference to the statute of distributions, or any words in the context to show a different meaning, must be taken to mean \u201c nearest of kin,\u201d but Lord Campbell said in substance, that he concurred in this decision with great reluctance ; that they were driven to put a construction upon the terms \u201c which could not by possibility have entered into the contemplation of the parties, or the gentleman who framed \u201d the settlement j that the law had \u201c by some bad luck got into a strange state,\u201d and that upon the whole, it seemed to him that greater mischief would ensue \u201c from shaking or overturning that case of <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>than by adhering to it.\u201d He further said: \u201c If I had to decide <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>I should certainly have hesitated a good deal before I came to the decision that was pronounced by those very learned judges, the then Lords Commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I think the decision in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>by the Lords Commissioners, shows that the greatest judicial mind is liable to .fall into a rut, and when it does, common sense teaches that its very load of learning tends to keep it in. In my opinion there is nothing in the opinions of the Lords Commissioners in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. <em>Young, </em>or in the opinion of Lords Cottenham and Campbell, in <em>Witty </em>agt. <em>Mangler, </em>which shows that the decisions in these cases should be adopted or followed here. I am not aware of any case in this state deciding the question in the prinipal case. The last sentence in the second paragraph of the head note in <em>Wright et al. </em>agt. <em>Trustees of Methodist Episcopal Church (Hoffman\u2019s Ch. R. </em>202), is wholly unauthorized. It was not decided in the case, and there was no occasion to decide that the phrase \u201c next of kin,\u201d when used <em>simpliciter, </em>does not mean those entitled under the statute of distributions, but the next in blood. It was held in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>that the legacy to Euphemia Murray did not lapse, hut that her next of kin took. She left children, but no grandchildren. There was no claim by representation or <em>per stirpes. </em>Vice-Chancellor Hoffman refers to the decision of the Lords Commissioners in <em>Elmsley </em>agt. Young, but he says that the decision did not interfere with his decision, and it clearly did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Drake </em>agt. <em>Pell </em>(3 <em>Edward\u2019s Ch. </em>251), the words \u201c heirs, devisees, or legal representatives of the child so dying,\u201d were held to mean <em>\u201c </em>next of kin \u201d of the child so dying, the subject of <em>the </em>gift being money. There was no claim <em>per stirpes </em>or by representation, in this case. In <em>Dominick </em>agt. <em>Sayre </em>(3 <em>Sandf. Sup. Ct. Rep.), </em>there was a devise by Dominick of eight lots of land to the testator\u2019s daughter Margaret, for life, with power to give the same by deed or will to any of the main descendants of the testator\u2019s family of the name of Dominick. The daughter by her will devised the lots to male descendants of the testator by the name of Dominick, and among them she gave to her nephew John Jacob, son of her deceased brother Jacob F., two of the lots. The nephew died before his aunt, whereby the devise to him lapsed, and thereby the legal estate to the two lots became vested in the residuary devisees of the original testator and their heirs, subject to the execution by the court of chancery of the power so given to the daughter. The only male descendants of the family of the testator of the name of Dominick, were, as I understand the facts, grandsons of the testator, and sons of two of the grandsons, and it was held that all the male descendants were entitled to take <em>per capita, </em>and not <em>per stirpes. </em>This decision was, probably right, for it might be said that the power of appointment given to the daughter was limited to a class of the testator\u2019s, descendants, that is, his male descendants of his family by the name of Dominick; but I have no. hesitation in saying that in my opinion, a devise to A. B. for life, remainder to his descendants or to \u201c my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>descendants,\u201d simpliciter, should and would be held to be a devise to A. B. for life, remainder to the heirs at law of A. B., or of the testator. In either case I think the word descendants would be held to mean \u201cheirs at law;\u201d whether the heirs at law would be deemed to take by .descent or under the devise, is another question. Since the statute (3 <em>and </em>4 <em>William IV, c. </em>106), no doubt in England 'the heir would be deemed to take in the character of devisee <em>(see </em>4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. 5th ed. </em>412, <em>note c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>Phyfe </em>agt. <em>Phyfe </em>(3 <em>Bradford, </em>45), there was a bequest to sons \u201c and their legal representatives,\u201d adding \u201c the legal representatives or children of my said sons to receive such part only,\u201d &amp;c., and it was held that the words \u201clegal representatives,\u201d meant the children, and not the \u201c next of kin \u201d of the sons, and that substitution was not intended beyond the children of the sons. This decision evidently went on the additional words \u201c or children,\u201d &amp;c <em>(see also Barstow </em>agt. <em>Goodwin, </em>2 <em>Bradford, </em>413). <em>In McCullock </em>agt. <em>Lee </em>(7 <em>Ohio, </em>15), the question was between the mother and aunt of a child, under a statute regulating the descent of lands. The words of the statute were : \u201cIf there be no brothers or sisters, or their legal representatives, the estate shall pass to the next of kin, and of the blood of the intestate,\u201d and it was held that the mother took. I do not see how it could have been held otherwise, considering the additional words, '\u201c and of the blood,\u201d &amp;c., and the extraordinary use of the words \u201cnext of kin,\u201d in a statute regulating the inheritance of'lands. See also <em>McNeilledge </em>agt. <em>Galbraith </em>(8 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>40), and <em>McNeilledge </em>agt. <em>Barcly </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>103), where the devise of real and personal property was to testator\u2019s wife, \u201c and at her decease to be divided between hers and my poor relations equally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It is evident that all that has been said about the English statutes applies to our statutes of distribution, especially to our present statute (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>96, 97, \u00a775), which was worded with much more precision and distinctness than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the English statute. Perhaps the remark in the fore part of this opinion, that the English statute of distributions originated and gave a technical meaning to the words \u201cnext of kin,\u201d requires explanation. I meant that the statute originated and gave the technical meaning contended for, with reference to the succession to or the distribution of the personal property of <em>intestates; </em>I did not mean that the statute originated the phrase next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">- A statute of 31 Edward III, provided that in cases of intestacy \u201c the ordinaries shall depute of the next and most lawful friends of the dead person intestate, to adminter his goods.\u201d Lord Coke in <em>Hensloe\u2019s case </em>(9 <em>Coke, </em>39), speaking of the statute says, \u201c next and most lawful friends,\u201d meant the next of blood. The statute of 21 Henry VIII, chap. 5, provided that in case any person die intestate, or that the executors named in any testament refused to prove it, the ordinary should grant administration \u201c to the widow of the deceased, or to the next of kin, or to both, as by the discretion of the ordinary shall be thought good.\u201d Lord Coke in speaking of this statute in <em>\u25a0Hensloe\u2019s case, </em>just cited, says that it gave power to the ordinary to commit- administration to the next of blood ; but how palpably unauthorized the conclusion <em>(Cooper </em>agt. <em>Denison, </em>13 <em>Simons, </em>295, 296) from this that long after the statute of distributions, the words next of kin and next of blood, were synonymous ; the very point insisted on being that the words next of kin, were likely to acquire and had acquired a technical meaning in consequence of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">It is not probable that Miss Ogden, when she executed the settlement, thought of the meaning of the words \u201cnext of kin.\u201d It was natural that she should think of her anticipated issue and their children. She takes care of them by a special limitation. If she thought of her brothers and sisters, why did she not take care of them by a special limitation ? It is evident that the settlement was drawn with technical precision, by one well acquainted with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>technical meaning of legal terms and phrases. He must be presumed to have inserted the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d in the limitation, to \u201c the next of kin of the said party of the first part,\u201d with knowledge of their technical meaning, if they had any, and the parties by their execution of the settlement must be presumed to have adopted them with such technical meaning\u2019; and as I cannot say that I have a doubt that those words used <em>simpliciter, </em>meant and mean next of kin, under or according to the statute of distributions, including those claiming <em>per stirpes, </em>or by representation, my conclusion is that the judgment of the special term should be reversed, with costs of all parties to be paid out of the fund to be distributed, and that we should declare that the defendants, the three children of Mrs. Lawrence\u2019s deceased brother, are entitled to the share of the fund which their father would be entitled to were he living. We would not be justified in rendering blind obedience to authorities however respectable or high, which have neither the force of constitutional obligation, nor state nor national judicial precedent or approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I will say in conclusion, partly by way of excuse for this rather elaborate examination of a question which unembarrassed by cases would appear to be so simple, that I find in a deservedly popular law dictionary (Burrill\u2019s) the words \u201c next of kin,\u201d defined first and most prominently \u201c nearest of blood \u201d <em>(prochei?i du </em>saunlc); and even Judge Story, in his <em>Eq. Juris, (vol. 2, </em>\u00a7 1065, b), says, \u201c next of kin\u201d is sometimes construed,to mean \u201c next of blood, or nearest of blood,\u201d citing <em>Witty </em>agt. <em>Mangler </em>(10 <em>Clark &amp; Fin. supra), </em>without one word of comment, or of approval or disapproval.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
