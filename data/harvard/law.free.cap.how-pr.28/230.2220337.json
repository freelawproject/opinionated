It prays, that they be enjoined from disposing of or intermeddling with the property of the land association. This recital is sufficient to show that this action in its present shape, cannot be maintained. If it were an action brought by a stranger against this unincorporated association for some claim against it, there would be no necessity to make the shareholders defendants, as it is shown that the association consists of more than seven persons, and Radde-is sued as president and treasurer of it, as well as in his individual capacity. But as we have seen, the action is commenced to compel an accounting of the whole property, and investigation into the whole affairs and business of the association. It is besides an action for a fraudulent breach of trust against a person having the whole management and control of its property and effects. All the shareholders, therefore, should be made parties, or the action should be commenced by the plaintiff for the benefit of all others standing in the same situation, as well as for himself. If such is necessary in an action of this nature against an incorporate association <em>(Cunningham </em>agt. <em>Pell, 5 Paige, </em>407), it is still more necessary in an action against one that is not incorporated (\u00a7 119, <em>Code).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The second cause of action ,is against Radde, under a contract made by him in his individual capacity, for a specified sum of money. This cannot be joined with causes of action against him as the president or trustee .of the association (\u00a7 167, <em>Code). </em>Moreover, this claim against Radde alone is united with causes of action against him and others jointly. The causes of action must not only all belong to one of the enumerated classes under section 167, but all must affect all the parties to it. To employ the language of the court in <em>Enos </em>agt. <em>Thomas </em>(4 <em>How. </em>48), \u201c the causes of action to be joined must be in favor of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the plaintiffs, and against all the defendants, and must belong to the same class,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Judgment for the defendant Radde, with costs, unless the plaintiff amend his complaint within twenty days, and pay costs' of term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
