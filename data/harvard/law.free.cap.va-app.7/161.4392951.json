They contend (1) that the medical evidence overwhelmingly shows the claimant is not disabled as a result of heart disease, and (2) the record contains sufficient medical evidence to rebut the presumption of causation provided in Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1. From our review of the record and consideration of the briefs and arguments presented we agree with these contentions and, accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Oscar Broome, Jr. was employed by the City of Bristol Police Department in 1959 as a patrolman. In 1967, he began teaching radiological monitoring, and in 1974 he was transferred to the Detective Division where he spent forty to fifty percent of his time training officers. In 1980 he was placed in charge of the Administrative Division as a Captain. Broome estimated the percentage of time he spent doing desk work and administering polygraphs in the Administrative Division was between eighty-five and ninety percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Broome first saw Dr. Sarfraz A. Zaidi in 1977. At that time his blood pressure was described as normal; an EKG showed a questionable infarction, and his weight was 254 pounds. He continued with visits to Dr. Zaidi for blood pressure and weight monitoring, and Valium was prescribed. In March, 1984 claimant experienced a blackout spell while eating lunch and was hospitalized for three days. Dr. Zaidi was not able to diagnose the exact cause of this event. Broome returned to work without further incident until June 18, 1985, when he was hospitalized for shortness of breath and ankle swelling. As a result of an echocardiogram, Dr. Zaidi concluded that claimant was suffering from congestive heart failure, with atrial fibrillation. Broome returned to work in August, 1985 without further incident until he took a medical leave of absence on September 22, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Broome then filed a claim with the commission, alleging that he contracted an occupational disease (hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure) as a result of his employment with the City of Bristol Police Department. After receiving notice of the claim, the employer and insurer, by counsel, had claimant\u2019s medical records and job description reviewed by four cardiologists: Dr. George Craddock, Dr. Manta Sayers, Dr. Stephen Davis, and Dr. Joseph Austin. In addition, Drs. Sayers and Austin also performed cardiological examinations of Broome.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The deputy commissioner, after an evidentiary hearing, held that claimant failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was incapable of engaging in his regular duties; therefore, he could not claim the benefit of the statutory presumption with respect to causation. The deputy commissioner found that the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>jority of the physicians associated with the case related the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, such as fatigue, to his obesity and to the medications that he takes, or has taken. Upon review, the full commission reversed and awarded compensation, with one member dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The claimant contends that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-47.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he is entitled as a police officer to compensation for alleged disability due to heart disease. The statute provides police officers with a presumption of causal relationship between their job and heart disease if they establish that they have the disease and are disabled as a result. The presumption may be rebutted upon a showing by the employer that there was a non-work related cause for the heart disease. <em>Estate of Montgomery v. City of Portsmouth Police </em>Department, 4 Va. App. 525, 538, 358 S.E.2d 762, 764 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The commission relied upon the evidence of Dr. Zaidi in finding that Broome was disabled from heart disease. At the time of the claimant\u2019s hospitalization in June, 1985, Dr. Zaidi diagnosed him as suffering from \u201ccongestive heart failure with atrial fibrillation.\u201d He noted that Broome was \u201cmarkedly overweight.\u201d In his report of October 30, 1985, Dr. Zaidi stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Mr. Broome suffers from atrial fibrillation and has been in heart failure which is under control by drug therapy. He is on anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation. He has been advised to avoid undue exertion but should be able to continue normal activities <em>and should be able to resume work, which does not involve undue labor and is basically a desk-type position, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>However, almost a year later in a report to the Virginia Supplemental Retirement System, Dr. Zaidi indicated that the claimant, because of his heart condition, was \u201cunfit to work\u201d and was \u201cpermanently disabled for his job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The office notes of Dr. Zaidi, for the period between October, 1985 and October, 1986, do not disclose a worsening of claimant\u2019s condition. In fact, on several of the visits the notes indicated improvement. Also, the basic nature of the claimant\u2019s normal duties, i.e., sedentary work as an administrative officer, remained the same. We agree with the deputy commissioner\u2019s observation that \u201cthe rationale ... for Dr. Zaidi\u2019s marked change in his assessment of the claimant\u2019s ability to work is not readily apparent.\u201d Thus, there is an internal conflict in the claimant\u2019s expert evidence, or at least an inexplicable change of position without foundation in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Another conflict in the expert evidence is Dr. Zaidi\u2019s September, 1986 finding that Broome was disabled by congestive heart failure. He based this diagnosis on an echocardiogram taken when claimant was admitted to the hospital in June, 1985. Three of the four cardiologists engaged by the employer to review the case and/or examine claimant reviewed the June, 1985 echocardiogram and concluded that it showed normal function. Drs. Craddock, Austin, and Davis attributed Dr. Zaidi\u2019s incorrect diagnosis of congestive heart failure to his failure to adjust the echo-cardiogram for claimant\u2019s gross obesity of 312 pounds. The doctors stated that, due to such obesity, the measurements of the chamber size had to be corrected according to the body surface area. Once this was done, the results of the echocardiogram showed claimant\u2019s chamber size to be normal and his heart pumping strength, or contractibility, also to be normal. Those reports were furnished to the commission and the claimant\u2019s counsel in January, 1987. In Dr. Zaidi\u2019s final medical report of March 3, 1987, no mention was made, as was previously, of congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy, the condition allegedly diagnosed from the echocardiogram. The doctor stated the claimant was in atrial fibrillation that, when combined with physical or psychological stress, could adversely affect his heart rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">While we are bound by findings of fact made by the commission on credible conflicting medical opinion, in those instances where an internal conflict exists in the expert opinion of the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ant\u2019s attending physician, it is proper for us to review and consider the other medical opinions in the record to resolve that conflict. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Island Creek Coal Co., </em>223 Va. 645, 292 S.E.2d 328 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The other medical evidence in the record consists of the opinions of Drs. Davis, Sayers, Craddock and Austin. Dr. Stephen V. Davis, a fellow in clinical cardiology at the Univeristy of Virginia Medical School, reviewed the medical records and reported that although claimant\u2019s atrial fibrillation placed him at \u201cincreased risk for future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events,\u201d it was \u201cnot disabling for a sedentary occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Dr. Marta C. Sayers, a cardiologist at the Community Hospital of Roanoke Valley, examined Broome on January 2, 1987. She found no physical evidence of congestive heart failure and saw no reason why he should not continue to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Dr. Joseph L. Austin,' a Roanoke, cardiologist, reviewed claimant\u2019s records and subsequently conducted an examination on February 16, 1987. He opined that there was no objective evidence that Broome was suffering from congestive heart failure. He further opined that the left ventricle, which he identified as being the \u201cmain pumping chamber of the heart,\u201d was normal in size, and that Broome\u2019s blood pressure was under good control. Noting that the claimant had stopped work in September, 1986 because of difficulties with fatigue and sleeplessness, Dr. Austin stated that these symptoms were \u201cmore likely to be secondary to Mr. Broome\u2019s obesity and his emotional response to stress rather than to his heart disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Broome\u2019s records were also examined by Dr. George B. Craddock, an Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, at the University of Virginia\u2019s School of Medicine. He questioned Dr. Zaidi\u2019s interpretation of the echocardiogram in light of that physician\u2019s failure to take into account the claimant\u2019s body size. He found that Broome was not suffering from any significant heart muscle disease and found no evidence that claimant\u2019s occupation had \u201cany bearing on his clinical diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The commission\u2019s opinion made no mention of the apparent misreading of the echocardiogram by Dr. Zaidi. The commission further disregarded the defense cardiologists\u2019 opinions that the claimant was not disabled from heart disease, concluding that \u201cthere is little in those reports (reports of Drs. Davis, Sayers and Austin) to reflect any familiarity with the duties of the Claimant\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We find that the commission\u2019s conclusion is not supported by the evidence in the record. Broome\u2019s job description was approved by the claimant and was attached as an exhibit to his deposition. It was submitted for review to all four doctors. Dr. Austin, in a letter dated January 5, 1987, stated that he had reviewed Mr. Broome\u2019s detailed job description. He also stated that he discussed the various stresses, aggravations and frustrations of his job with Broome at the time of the cardiac examination on February 16, 1987. Similarly, the record contains evidence that both Dr. Davis and Dr. Sayers had reviewed and/or were familiar with the claimant\u2019s job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We review a decision of the Industrial Commission under familiar principles. Although findings of the commission, if based on credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on us, the commission\u2019s findings of fact are not binding upon us when there is no credible evidence to support them. The question of the sufficiency of the evidence then becomes one of law. <em>Breckenridge </em>v. <em>Marval Poultry Co., </em>228 Va. 191, 196, 319 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1984). In the recent decision of <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va. App. 276, 348 S.E.2d 876 (1986), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The trier of fact must determine the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, but it may not arbitrarily disregard uncontradicted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 279, 348 S.E.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">In mistakenly finding that the majority of the physicians involved in the case were not familiar with the claimant\u2019s duties, the commission erroneously disregarded their opinions regarding disability and causation. Our review of the entire record satisfies us that Broome failed to establish that he was incapacitated by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>hypertension or heart condition. He, thus, was not entitled to the benefit of the statutory presumption. The weight of the expert evidence points to obesity and medication as the causes of Broome\u2019s fatigue and sleeplessness, which he assigned as the primary reasons for his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">For these reasons, the decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Coleman, J., and Hodges, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> The death of, or any condition or impairment of health of, salaried or volunteer fire fighters caused by respiratory diseases, and the death of, or any condition or impairment of health of, salaried or volunteer fire fighters, or of any member of the State Police Officers Retirement System, or of any member of a county, city or town police department, or of a sheriff, or of a deputy sheriff, or city sergeant or deputy city sergeant of the City of Richmond, caused by hypertension or heart disease, resulting in total or partial disability shall be presumed to be an occupational disease suffered in the line of duty that is covered by this Act unless the contrary be shown by a preponderance of competent evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
