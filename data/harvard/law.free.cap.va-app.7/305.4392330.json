He was sentenced in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict to three years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Moss contends that he was illegally detained by the police, thereby rendering the cocaine seized as a result thereof inadmissible. We agree and reverse. Because we find this issue to be dispositive, we need not address the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">At approximately 9:55 p.m. on October 9, 1986, Officer Donald Dalton of the Lynchburg Police Department drove his patrol wagon south on Fifth Street past the intersection of Fifth and Taylor Streets. He observed Moss and two other people standing on the corner. Moss caught the officer\u2019s attention because his arms were extended in front of him and he was making a twisting motion with something between his fingers. Officer Dalton continued watching Moss in his mirror as he drove down the street. He then turned and drove to a position two blocks from Moss, where he exited his vehicle and positioned himself nearby in a private yard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>behind some bushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Moss and his companions approached the area on foot. When they were directly in front of him, Officer Dalton jumped out and shined the flashlight on Moss. Moss froze for a few seconds and Officer Dalton observed a white object in his fingers. Moss placed his hand behind him and when his hand reappeared it was empty. Officer Dalton found a white object containing cocaine directly behind Moss\u2019s left foot. He then placed Moss under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Moss contends on appeal that Officer Dalton had no specific, objective basis for stopping him, thereby rendering the stop unconstitutional and the seized cocaine inadmissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that the exclusionary rule is inapplicable because there was no stop or search.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">At the outset, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the encounter between Officer Dalton and the defendant did not amount to a \u201cstop,\u201d but was merely a confrontation during which the officer asked some questions. Citing <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983), the Commonwealth points out that when a police officer approaches and addresses questions to people in public there is no seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment. The Commonwealth contends that the evidence does not support the conclusion that Moss was detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">A \u201cseizure\u201d for purposes of the fourth amendment occurs when the \u201ccircumstances . . . amount to a show of official authority such that \u2018a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 502 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980)). \u201c[Wjhenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has \u2018seized\u2019 that person.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16 (1967). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the manner in which Officer Dalton suddenly confronted Moss with a flashlight amounted to a \u201cseizure\u201d of Moss\u2019s person. Officer Dalton testified that the flashlight he used was \u201cbright and has an effect of blinding the other parties, which stuns them.\u201d The blinding and stunning effect of the flashlight in the hands of a uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>formed officer who is asking questions amounts to a \u201cshow of official authority\u201d such that a reasonable person would conclude he was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Having found that Officer Dalton \u201cseized\u201d Moss, we must now determine whether the officer had adequate grounds to make the stop. \u201cThe essential purpose of the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 upon the exercise of discretion by government officials ... in order \u2018to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653-54 (1979) (footnote and citation omitted). It is well-established that \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22. However, the officer must have a \u201creasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979). In <em>Brown, </em>police officers stopped the ndant in an area with a high incidence of drug traffic, because as one officer testified the situation \u201c \u2018looked suspicious and we had never seen that subject in that area before.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 49. The Supreme Court found the stop on these grounds violated the fourth amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 53. The Court held that \u201c[i]n the absence of any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest and appellant\u2019s right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Upon review of the record in the present case, we find that the officer could not reasonably have suspected Moss of criminal activity based on what he observed. Officer Dalton admitted at trial on direct examination that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t make out what it was\u201d in Moss\u2019s hand when he drove by. On cross-examination, when asked whether the object in Moss\u2019s hands could have been a popsicle stick, matches, or any type object, Officer Dalton again responded, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell what it was.\u201d The officer\u2019s own testimony reveals that Moss\u2019s seizure was based more on an \u201cinchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch,\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, than on a reasonable suspicion based on objective facts. Therefore, finding that the police officer lacked adequate grounds to stop Moss, we hold that the stop was illegal and the cocaine seized as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>thereof was improperly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In so holding, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Moss abandoned the cocaine and, therefore, lacked standing to challenge its admission into evidence. \u201cWhile it is true that a criminal defendant\u2019s voluntary abandonment of evidence can remove the taint of an illegal stop or arrest, it is equally true that for this to occur the abandonment must be truly voluntary and not merely the product of police misconduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>602 F.2d 726 (5th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted). Here, it is clear that the contraband was abandoned because of the illegal stop; thus, it was not a truly voluntary abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Coleman, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\"> While Moss\u2019s challenge at trial to the validity of his seizure and the admissibility of the cocaine would have been more appropriate and better articulated in the form of a pretrial motion to suppress, counsel\u2019s pretrial objection, although it allowed the jury to hear the challenged evidence, was sufficient to preserve the matter for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
