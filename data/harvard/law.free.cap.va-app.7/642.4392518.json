Code \u00a7 53.1-203(2). On this appeal Gosling asserts that the trial judge erred in not striking for cause a member of the venire who acknowledged that he would accept the testimony of a correctional officer over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the testimony of an inmate. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On February 22, 1985, Gosling was charged with removing the vent plate and window from his cell at the Nottoway Correctional Center. The Commonwealth\u2019s sole witness at trial was Sergeant C.O. Gibbs, a correctional officer in charge of the facility. The witnesses for the defense included Gosling and Carl Shiflett, another inmate at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">During voir dire, the judge asked members of the jury panel the relevant questions enumerated in Rule 3A:14. Gosling\u2019s counsel then asked the jury panel, \u201cWould any of you tend to give greater weight to the testimony of a correctional officer simply because he is a correctional officer?\u201d One of the panel members, Joseph Irby, responded, \u201cSure I would.\u201d When asked why, Irby stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s particularly got any axe to grind. After all the prisoner is serving time and I don\u2019t think the correctional officer wants to give him any more time.\u201d Upon further questioning by defense counsel, Irby stated that he would tend to believe a correctional officer and to disbelieve witnesses that were inmates. At this point, defense counsel moved to strike Irby for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Without ruling on the motion, the judge asked Irby whether he would examine the testimony of a correctional officer in the same way that he would examine the testimony of an inmate. Irby stated, \u201cJudge, I would certainly listen to the inmate, but I would feel that the correctional officer that\u2019s got no axe to grind, he\u2019s not trying to get somebody in trouble, and the inmate would be trying to get himself out of trouble, or get his fellow inmate out. I think he would have a motive not to tell the truth where I don\u2019t think the correctional officer would have a motive.\u201d The judge then explained at length to the entire jury panel the general rules concerning credibility of witnesses, opportunity for knowing the truth and standards for examining credibility. At the conclusion of this discourse, the trial judge again asked Irby whether he would credit the testimony of the correctional officer over the testimony of the inmates. Irby responded \u201cI feel like I can give the man a trial. I would not be convicting him unless its proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.\u201d After these exchanges, defense counsel again moved to strike Irby for cause. The judge denied the motion and Irby was peremptorily struck from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend VI; Va. Const, art I, \u00a7 8. This guarantee is reinforced by legislative enactment and by the rules of court. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-357, 8.01-358; Rule 3A:14(a)(7). It is the trial judge\u2019s duty to secure an impartial jury for the parties. <em>Salina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 92, 93, 225 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1976). Resolution of the question of a juror\u2019s impartiality depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <em>Educational Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 384, 387, 349 S.E.2d 903, 906 (1986). At a minimum, however, the law requires that the juror \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d <em>Id.', see also Breeden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976). Any reasonable doubt regarding the prospective juror\u2019s ability to give the accused a fair and impartial trial must be resolved in favor of the accused. <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 90 (1980); <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735; <em>Educational Books, Inc., </em>3 Va. App. at 387, 349 S.E.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Although jurors have a right and a duty to determine the credibility of witnesses in a particular case, giving unqualified credence to the testimony of a law enforcement officer based solely on the officer\u2019s official status constitutes impermissible bias. <em>Mullis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 564, 571, 351 S.E.2d 919, 923 (1987). In appropriate cases, counsel are entitled to inquire as to whether a prospective juror would assign undue weight to the testimony of a law enforcement officer based on official status alone. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, in those cases whose outcomes turn in large part upon a credibility determination between prosecution witnesses with official status and defense witnesses with no official status, such inquiry into potential bias may be required. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 351 S.E.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Upon review of the entire record of <em>voir dire </em>in the present case we conclude that the judge\u2019s refusal to exclude Irby from the jury panel constituted reversible error. We emphasize that the prosecution\u2019s case rested entirely upon the testimony of correctional Officer C.O. Gibbs and that Gosling\u2019s evidence in defense consisted of his own testimony and that of another inmate. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s case turned solely upon a credibility determination to be made by the jurors. In this respect, the present case is distinguishable from <em>Mull\u00eds, </em>for in <em>Mull\u00eds, </em>credibility issues did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>play a significant role. 3 Va. App. at 572, 351 S.E.2d at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s inquiry whether any jurors would tend to assign greater weight to the testimony of a correctional officer simply because he was a correctional officer, Irby revealed his bias in clear, unequivocal terms, stating, \u201cSure I would.\u201d Upon further inquiry, Irby indicated that he would do so because, to his mind, correctional officers have no motive to be untruthful. The question was then rephrased and repeated by both defense counsel and the judge. Irby did not at this point waver either in his position or his rationale. This unfaltering biased viewpoint, viewed in light of the significance of the credibility issue to the outcome of the case, raised a reasonable doubt as to Irby\u2019s qualifications and should have led to his exclusion from the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Commonwealth argues that Irby\u2019s additional statements that he could give Gosling a fair trial indicate that Irby was not committed to any preconceived views. A juror\u2019s subsequent statement that he can give the defendant a fair and impartial trial, however, is not dispositive when preceded by positive, unequivocal testimony of bias. <em>See Justus, </em>220 Va. at 977, 266 S.E.2d at 91. Even if we were to assume that the demonstrated bias in this case was of a type where rehabilitation of the juror was possible, the statements and questions propounded by the judge were insufficient to rehabilitate Irby. Instead of engaging in a specific inquiry regarding the nature and extent of Irby\u2019s bias, the judge gave a general lecture to the jurors concerning the standards for determining credibility of witnesses. When he was through, the judge again queried:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\"><em>Now, in light of that, Mr. Irby, </em>would you give more credit to the testimony of an officer just because he comes in in a uniform and says I\u2019m a correctional officer, than you would an inmate who comes in in prison clothes and says I\u2019m an inmate and I\u2019m in prison?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">(emphasis supplied). This question, posed to Irby as it was after the lecture to all the jurors, was unduly suggestive, \u201cvitiat[ing] any element of independent consideration by the juror.\u201d <em>Educational Books, </em>3 Va. App. at 389, 349 S.E.2d at 908; <em>see also Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300, 227 S.E.2d at 736 (in response to long leading questions, juror merely gave expected answers). Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of the requisite qualifications for impartial service must emanate from the juror, unsuggested by leading questions. <em>Educational Books, Inc., </em>3 Va. App. at 389, 349 S.E.2d at 907 (citing <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>138 Va. 764, 773, 121 S.E. 68, 70 (1924)). The judge\u2019s question to Irby must be viewed in the context of the lecture that preceeded it, the relative position of judge to juror, and the weight generally accorded statements by the trial judge. <em>See Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 134, 138, 342 S.E.2d 65, 67 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The judge\u2019s failure to rehabilitate Irby is further evidenced by Irby\u2019s response to additional questions propounded by defense counsel. Although Irby stated that he would give Gosling a \u201cfair trial to the best of [his] ability,\u201d when asked if his ability would be impaired by the fact that the defense witnesses were inmates, he stated, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t <em>think </em>so.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Irby\u2019s statement, in response to the question whether he still held to his position favoring the testimony of correctional officers generally, is also revealing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Mr. Robinett, I haven\u2019t heard any testimony. I have no idea what they will testify to; but you believe some people and you don\u2019t [believe others]. <em>You could get a correctional officer that to me could be lying; I don\u2019t know.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Irby\u2019s responses to these questions indicate that he was still predisposed to believe correctional officers over other witnesses. These responses were simply insufficient to dispel the reasonable doubt lingering as to the juror\u2019s qualifications to serve. The doubt should have been resolved in favor of the accused. <em>Salina, </em>217 Va. at 94, 225 S.E.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-357 provides that peremptory challenges are to be made from \u201ca panel free from exceptions.\u201d <em>See also Justus, 220 </em>Va. at 975, 266 S.E.2d at 90. Putting the defense in a position where it is forced to exercise its peremptory challenges to exclude a biased juror is not harmless error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.; Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>227 S.E.2d at 737. The conviction is therefore reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALe\">Barrow, J., and Hodges, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\"> Although the Commonwealth argues that the record does not disclose whether the defense actually used one of its peremptory challenges to exclude Irby, this fact is not relevant to our determination of prejudicial error. <em>See id. </em>n. *.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
