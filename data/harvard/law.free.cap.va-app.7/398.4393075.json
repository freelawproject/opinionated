Hawks contained a positive diagnosis of occupational disease and in concluding that Hawks\u2019 failure to file until January 12, 1987, bars his claim under Code \u00a7 65.1-52. We conclude that the commission\u2019s finding that Hawks received a first communication of an occupational disease on March 23, 1984, is supported by credible evidence, and we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">On March 16, 1984, Hawks visited Dr. Scott Radow with complaints of sinus problems and abnormal breathing. Dr. Radow examined Hawks and reviewed chest x-rays which showed some old nodular and reticular fibrosis. Dr. Radow diagnosed interstitial infiltrates, most likely related to Hawks\u2019 inhalation of metal fumes for 40 years, and noted that Hawks utilized lead, steel, iron, tin and aluminum in his welding job, all metals known to produce interstitial infiltrates. Dr. Radow sent the following letter to Hawks on March 23, 1984:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Your x-ray has been reviewed by the radiologist. As we discussed in the office, there is evidence of <em>scarring in the lungs most likely caused by the different metals you are exposed to on your welding job. </em>As we discussed in the office, your lung function remains good and there is no treatment necessary for this scarring at the current time, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Hawks did not file a ^laim for compensation. On August 12, 1986, complaining of a cough accompanied by small traces of blood, Hawks consulted Dr. Olan Evans. Dr. Evans\u2019 records indicate that he believed Hawks\u2019 condition to be consistent with mild interstitial scarring associated with his welding job. On a return visit to Dr. Radow on August 22, 1986, Hawks was diagnosed as having \u201cmild chronic bronchitis throughout\u201d with \u201cmild acute bronchitis in the upper left lobe\u201d of the lung. Dr. Radow\u2019s report of September 30, 1986 states that Hawks suffered from \u201c? interstitial disease secondary to metal fume inhalation.\u201d His notes further state that \u201cHawks had rather intense bronchitis [;however,] [t]he etiology is not clear.\u201d Dr. Radow observed that Hawks\u2019 symptoms suggested \u201cperhaps reactive airways disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">After further testing, Dr. Radow made the following observations in his November 14, 1986, reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">Impression: 1. Paroxysmal cough. This is clearly work-related historically. The probability is that the patient has interstitial fibrosis secondary to metal fume inhalation. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">Chronic cough, most likely diagnosis is industrial bronchitis. The contribution of interstitial disease is uncertain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Radow then wrote to the school board employee recommending a one month rest period for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this letter he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">Mr. Hawks has a paroxysmal cough which is work related historically. There are signs of interstitial lung disease suggestive of disease cause [d] by inhalation of metal fumes. This has resulted in pulmonary disability manifested by paroxysmal cough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>After discontinuing work for one month, Hawks\u2019 cough was less frequent and severe, but still unresolved. On January 12, 1987, he applied for a hearing, alleging industrial bronchitis and interstitial fibrosis. At the hearing, counsel for both parties stipulated that Dr. Radow had communicated his diagnosis to Hawks on November 14, 1986. The school board\u2019s sole ground of defense was that claimant\u2019s condition was a noncompensable ordinary disease of life. The deputy commissioner concluded that Dr. Radow had diagnosed employment-related industrial bronchitis and awarded benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In its request for a review by the full commission, the school board did not challenge the finding that Hawks suffered from an occupational disease, but instead asserted that the award was barred by the statute of limitations. Finding that Dr. Radow\u2019s March 23, 1984 letter to Hawks, together with his medical history, established the first communication of occupational disease on that date, the commission held that Hawks was barred from any benefits \u201cresulting from his occupational lung disease or from symptomatic manifestations of such lung disease including bronchitis which may follow as incidents of occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Code \u00a7 65.1-52 provides that the right to compensation for occupational diseases (other than coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis, byssinosis or asbestosis) shall be forever barred unless a claim is filed within two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee. The filing requirement is jurisdictional, <em>Musick </em>v. <em>Codell Construction Co., </em>4 Va. App. 471, 473, 358 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1987)(citing <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>214 Va. 674, 675, 204 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1974)), and cannot be satisfied by mere consent or stipulation of the parties. <em>Stuart Circle Hospital </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 208, 288 S.E.2d 445, 447 (1982). Moreover, the burden is upon the claimant to prove compliance with the statute. <em>Anderson, </em>214 Va. at 675, 204 S.E.2d at 258. It follows, therefore, that the parties\u2019 stipulation at the evidentiary hearing that diagnosis and communication of occupational disease first occurred in November, 1986 is not determinative of when the limitation period began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We must therefore consider whether the full commission erred in finding that Dr. Radow\u2019s March 23, 1984, letter contained a positive diagnosis of occupational disease. The school board correctly points out that <em>Kiser </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Va. 357, 302 S.E.2d 44 (1983), which contained a communication similar to the one at issue here, controls the disposition of this case. In <em>Kiser, </em>the claimant testified that \u201cnine or maybe ten years ago\u201d his doctor informed him \u201cyou\u2019ve got a little [black lung],\u201d but \u201cyou don\u2019t have the first stage yet.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 302 S.E.2d at 45. The claimant was also told at that time that \u201c[t]here is no use in filing now . . . but keep taking x-rays and keep a check at it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that according to the plain language of the statute, the limitation period began to run upon communication that a work related disease existed, regardless of its severity or compensability. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 302 S.E.2d at 46. The claimant was required to file even if the claim would have been dismissed as not yet compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 302 S.E.2d at 45; <em>see also Anderson v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>214 Va. at 675, 204 S.E.2d at 258 (claimant who received conflicting diagnoses was obligated to file even if his claim would have been dismissed due to conflicting medical testimony); <em>Parris v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>2 Va. App. 219, 226, 343 S.E.2d 455, 459 (1986) (where the commission determines that the evidence is insufficient to establish occupational disease, or that the claim is not compensable, claimant is not barred from filing a second claim based upon subsequent diagnosis and communication of occupational disease). Having failed to timely file a claim upon communication of the existence of occupational disease, the claimant in <em>Kiser </em>was barred by the statute of limitations. 225 Va. at 360, 302 S.E.2d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Hawks received a first communication of a work related condition in March, 1984. Based upon the reasoning in <em>Kiser, </em>Hawks was under an obligation to file within two years of that date. Dr. Radow based his 1984 diagnosis on an x-ray report, which showed some \u201cold nodular and reticular fibrosis\u201d but no sign of active disease. Dr. Radow\u2019s medical report identified the presence of bilateral interstitial infiltrates most likely related to inhalation of metal fumes. His 1984 letter to Hawks communicated in ordinary language the existence of a lung condition \u201cmost likely caused by the different metals [Hawks was] exposed to on [his] welding job.\u201d As in <em>Kiser, </em>Dr. Radow\u2019s subsequent statement that \u201cthere is no treatment necessary for the scarring at this time\u201d was merely an indication that Hawks had not yet reached the first stage of the disease, a fact relating only to the question of compensability.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Hawks argues that communication of \u201cscarring\u201d is not equivalent to communication of the occupational disease interstitial fibrosis. It is true that Dr. Radow did not actually communicate that claimant had interstitial fibrosis. However, a physician is not required to utilize precise medical terminology to communicate the existence of occupational disease in order to trigger the obligation to file a claim. A person receives a diagnosis of occupational disease when he receives a diagnosis that he suffers from a disease that arises out of and in the course of employment. <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Prince William County Board of Supervisors, </em>220 Va. 913, 917, 265 S.E.2d 687, 689 (1980). In the present case, Hawks was unequivocally told in understandable language that he had a lung condition (scarring) most likely caused by his working conditions as a welder. At a minimum, this was sufficient notice to trigger his legal obligation to file a claim so as to allow the commission to determine whether in fact he suffered from an occupational disease as defined by the statute. <em>See Parris, 2 </em>Va. App. at 225-26, 343 S.E.2d at 458-59. Hawks\u2019 failure to file upon receipt of this communication deprived the commission of the opportunity to make a finding of occupational disease at that time. The commission\u2019s determination on review, however, that notice in 1984 of scarring constituted communication of occupational disease, indicates that it would have so found had the question been timely presented. Hawks was required to file even if the claim would have been dismissed as not yet compensable. <em>See Kiser, </em>225 Va. at 360, 302 S.E.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Hawks also argues that the March 23, 1984 letter represents, at best, a tentative diagnosis which was insufficient to commence running of the limitation period. <em>See Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Pannell, </em>203 Va. 49, 52, 122 S.E.2d 666, 668 (1961)(physi-cian\u2019s statement to claimant that he \u201cmay\u201d have pneumoconiosis and should therefore be x-rayed was not a communication of a diagnosis sufficient to trigger the limitation period). <em>Pannell, </em>however, is distinguishable because the physician clearly conditioned a positive diagnosis of pneumoconiosis on the outcome of further tests. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 122 S.E.2d at 668. Unlike <em>Pannell, </em>Dr. Radow\u2019s diagnosis distinctly communicated the causal connection and was not dependent upon subsequent test results. Although Hawks asserts that the March 23 diagnosis is made tentative by the equivocal nature of Dr. Radow\u2019s November 14, 1986 notes, these later notes, however, appear to focus on the nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>source of the symptomatic cough, \u201cwhose etiology is not clear.\u201d Moreover, the commission has resolved any dispute concerning the construction of medical records in favor of the school board. Where reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence in support of the commission\u2019s factual findings, they will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal. <em>See Board of Supervisors of Henrico County v. Taylor, </em>1 Va. App. 425, 430-31, 339 S.E.2d 565, 568 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Finally, Hawks asserts that because the issue was not before the commission on review, the commission erred in finding that bronchitis was a symptomatic manifestation of a previously communicated lung disease. In requesting review pursuant to Rule 2 of the commission\u2019s Rules, the school board took exception to the deputy commission\u2019s lack of finding that interstitial fibrosis was barred by the statute of limitations. The school board did not challenge the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding of industrial bronchitis, but did assert on review that Hawks\u2019 cough was associated with interstitial fibrosis. Dr. Radow\u2019s November 17, 1986 letter stated that there were \u201csigns of interstitial lung disease\u201d which \u201cresulted in pulmonary disability manifested by paroxysmal cough.\u201d Thus, not only was the source of Hawks\u2019 symptoms at issue, but there was also credible evidence to support a finding that interstitial lung disease was the source of claimant\u2019s pulmonary disability and cough. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">For the forgoing reasons, the decision of the Industrial Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Koontz, C.J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
