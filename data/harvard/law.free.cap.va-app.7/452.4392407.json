Code \u00a7 19.2-398(2) specifically provides, in pertinent part, that the Commonwealth may appeal \u201c[a]n order of a circuit court prohibiting the use of certain evidence at trial on the grounds such evidence was obtained in violation of the provisions of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States or Article I, Sections 8, 10 or 11 of the Constitution of Virginia prohibiting illegal searches and seizures and protecting rights against self-incrimination . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">We have reviewed the record and find that the trial court prohibited the use of certain evidence at trial solely on the grounds such evidence was obtained in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-59 and 19.2-60. The Commonwealth contends that the statutes are merely a codification of the constitutional proscriptions against illegal searches and seizures and of the exclusionary rule. Here, the trial court suppressed the evidence solely on the provision of the statute which purports to prohibit warrantless searches by \u201cany other person\u201d and not on constitutional grounds; therefore, we need not respond to that assertion in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Because the legislature has narrowly limited the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal suppression orders of the trial courts to orders which are based on constitutional violations, this Court may not entertain the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Koontz, C.J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
