We do not agree that the trial judge erred in increasing the amount of the periodic awards; however, we conclude that because the trial judge erred in making certain factual findings contrary to the findings of the commissioner, the trial judge\u2019s decision concerning the lump sum spousal support award must be reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u201cThe court, in its discretion, may decree that maintenance and support of a spouse be made <em>in periodic payments, or in a lump sum award, or both.\u201d </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1 (emphasis added). In determining spousal support, the trial court\u2019s consideration must include earning capacity, obligations, needs, the property interests of the parties, and the provisions if any, made with regard to marital property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The evidence before the commissioner in chancery supports the trial judge\u2019s letter opinion that the wife\u2019s net monthly earnings were $610, less the amount withheld to pay garnishments on account of judgment levies for debts incurred .by the wife and husband; that the wife has substantial monthly obligations, including joint debts created during the marriage in excess of $15,000; that the wife and the parties\u2019 eleven year old son have monthly medical costs that total $285; and that the husband\u2019s net monthly earnings of approximately $1429.75 are significantly less than the earnings that he received from the employment he lost after the marital separation. The husband has paid little, if any, toward meeting the parties\u2019 $15,000 joint obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Referring to the factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.1, the trial judge increased the commissioner\u2019s recommended award of $450 monthly spousal support and $200 monthly child support to $500 and $285 respectively. He also awarded the wife an additional $15,000 \u201clump sum monetary award . . . under . . . Code \u00a7 20-107.1.\u201d The trial judge stated that the wife\u2019s \u201cneed is greater\u201d and the husband \u201chas the ability to pay more and indeed earn more if he chooses.\u201d The trial judge further noted his disagreement with the following portion of the commissioner\u2019s report concerning the marital debt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">It is apparent to the commissioner that the amount of debts incurred by the [wife] cannot be paid from her salary nor from any income payable to her from her husband. It is also clear to the commissioner that the [wife], to alleviate her debts, must go bankrupt and be able to re-establish her expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The trial judge, recognizing \u201cthe practicality of [the commissioner\u2019s] point of view,\u201d stated, however, that he was \u201cnot willing to deny [the wife] further assistance from [the husband] for that reason.\u201d The trial judge further observed that the husband could request a modification of the support order if the wife filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">We conclude that the trial judge correctly determined that one of the premises upon which the commissioner based his spousal support recommendation was faulty. The commissioner\u2019s view that the wife was better served by filing for bankruptcy protection was an inappropriate basis for failing to consider the amount of mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tal debt in assessing a support award. We further conclude that the trial judge gave due consideration to the possibility of bankruptcy by recognizing it as a factor that would support a future request for a modification of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We are unable to discern, however, the b\u00e1sis upon which the trial judge determined that the husband could pay a lump sum spousal support award of $15,000. <em>See Collier </em>v. <em>Collier, 2 </em>Va. App. 125, 129, 341 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1986). While the evidence establishes that the marital debt is approximately $15,000, the trial judge did not make a finding that the husband\u2019s earnings or assets provide a sufficient source from which a lump sum award may be derived. Moreover, it appears that the $15,000 lump sum spousal support award may have been premised upon the belief that the husband continues to earn a significant amount of unreported cash income from \u201cside jobs.\u201d The wife\u2019s brief also asserts that the \u201cevidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s findings based upon the fact that [the husband] earned substantial income from \u2018side jobs.\u2019 \u201d On the contrary, the commissioner\u2019s finding, based upon <em>ore terms </em>evidence, was that the amount of and \u201cextent of any side jobs, if any, [have] not been established.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">While the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict, it should be sustained unless the trial court concludes that the commissioner\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence. This rule applies with particular force to a commissioner\u2019s findings of fact based upon evidence taken in his presence. . . . [W]here the chancellor has disapproved the commissioner\u2019s findings, this Court must review the evidence and ascertain whether, under a correct application of the law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusions of the trial court. Even where the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact have been disapproved, an appellate court must give due regard to the commissioner\u2019s ability, not shared by the chancellor, to see, hear, and evaluate the witness at first hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 576-77, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296-97 (1984)(citations omitted). The evidence before the commissioner concerning the \u201cside jobs\u201d consisted solely of oral testimony of the parties and the wife\u2019s witnesses. The commissioner\u2019s findings with respect to the weight of the testimony, therefore, contain credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ity judgments that must be given due consideration. We conclude that the evidence supports the commissioner\u2019s finding concerning the \u201cside jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the decree granting the lump sum spousal support award and remand the issue to the trial judge for reconsideration. Because we cannot say on the record before us whether an application of the factors cited in Code \u00a7 20-107.1 to the circumstances of the parties in this case will support a lump sum award, we remand that issue to the trial court. In addition, because the trial court may on reconsideration determine that the husband\u2019s salary and assets are insufficient to support a lump sum award, nothing in this opinion should be taken to preclude the trial judge from modifying the periodic support award if, upon reconsideration of the lump sum award, the evidence requires a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Coleman, J. and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
