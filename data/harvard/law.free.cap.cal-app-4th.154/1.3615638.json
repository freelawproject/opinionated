They sought reimbursement and declaratory and injunctive relief, and obtained class certification for their reimbursement claim. In a trifurcated trial, the court found the drivers were employees within the meaning of Labor Code section 2802 (Phase I), ordered FedEx to reimburse some (about $5 million, including prejudgment interest) but not all of their expenses (Phase II), granted most of the equitable relief sought by the drivers (Phase HI), and ordered FedEx to pay the drivers\u2019 costs and attorneys\u2019 fees (about $12.3 million).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">This is the third appeal in this case. In <em>Estrada I, </em>we held that orders dismissing some potential class members were not appealable, and dismissed the appeal as premature. <em>(Estrada </em>v. <em>RPS, Inc. </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 976 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 261] <em>(Estrada I).) </em>In <em>Estrada II, </em>we reversed all of the equitable orders, resolving those issues against the drivers and in favor of FedEx. <em>(Estrada </em>v. <em>FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. </em>(Nov. 22, 2006, B187951) [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Estrada II).) </em>On this appeal, we consider FedEx\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s class certification order, the court\u2019s Phase I finding that the drivers are employees, its Phase II reimbursement awards, and its posttrial attorneys\u2019 fee award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the drivers\u2019 cross-appeal, we consider their challenges to limitations imposed on the Phase II reimbursement awards and to the pretrial orders dismissing potential class members (the issue prematurely before us in <em>Estrada I). </em>We affirm the finding that the drivers are employees, the certification order, and the finding that attorneys\u2019 fees are recoverable, but reverse the fee award because the amount must be reconsidered, reverse two orders limiting the scope of reimbursable expenses, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings and recalculation of the attorneys\u2019 fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">A. <em>The Evidence at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">1. <em>The Operating Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Men and women who apply to FedEx for positions as drivers must complete applications, submit to background checks and strength tests, and satisfy appearance standards. The only required skill is driving and no commercial driving experience is needed. Upon acceptance, a driver must execute a nonnegotiable \u201cPick-up and Delivery Contractor Operating Agreement\u201d that obligates him to \u201cprovide daily pick-up and delivery service, and to conduct his . . . business so that it can be identified as being a part of the [FedEx] system.\u201d The \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d identifies the driver as an \u201cindependent contractor, and not as an employee ... for any purpose,\u201d sets forth the parties\u2019 \u201cmutual business objectives,\u201d notes that \u201cthe manner and means of reaching [these objectives] are within the discretion of the [driver],\u201d and states that \u201cno officer or employee of [FedEx] shall have the authority to impose any term or condition [including hours of work or travel routes] contrary to this understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, the driver must provide his own truck meeting FedEx\u2019s specifications, mark the truck with the FedEx logo, pay all costs of operating and maintaining the truck (including repairs, cleaning, fuel, tires, taxes, licenses and insurance), and use the truck exclusively in the service of FedEx (or mask the logo if the truck is used for any other purpose). The driver must provide \u201cfully competitive\u201d service to a \u201cprimary service area\u201d assigned by FedEx, and the Operating Agreement acknowledges the driver\u2019s \u201cproprietary interest\u201d in his primary service area\u2019s customer accounts\u2014but gives FedEx the right to reconfigure primary service areas (and to reassign packages to another driver) if the volume of packages in the driver\u2019s primary service area exceeds the amount the driver could reasonably be expected to handle on any given day. In the event of reconfiguration, the driver has a right \u201cto receive payment\u201d from FedEx or the benefited driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Operating Agreement obligates the driver to try to \u201cretain and increase\u201d business within his primary service area; to \u201ccooperate\u201d with FedEx\u2019s employees, customers, and other drivers for the common goal of efficient pickup and delivery; to load, handle, and transport packages using methods designed to avoid theft, loss and damage; and to foster FedEx\u2019s \u201cprofessional image\u201d and \u201cgood reputation.\u201d The driver agrees to drive safely; to prepare driver logs, inspection reports, fuel receipts, and shipping documents; and (on a daily basis) to return these items and any collected charges and undeliverable packages to FedEx. He agrees to wear a FedEx-approved uniform and to maintain his appearance \u201cconsistent with reasonable standards of good order,\u201d his uniform \u201cin good condition,\u201d and his truck in a \u201cclean and presentable fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">For its part, FedEx reserves the right to have its management employees travel with the driver four times each year to verify that the driver is meeting FedEx\u2019s standards, and agrees to train or \u201cfamiliarize [the driver] with [its] quality service procedures.\u201d FedEx pays or \u201csettles\u201d with a driver weekly based on a stated calculation, and offers the driver a \u201cbusiness support package\u201d to help him obtain and maintain a truck, a scanner, clean uniforms, and other similar items, the cost of which is paid by the driver by deductions from his weekly \u201csettlements.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The driver may elect the initial term of his Operating Agreement (from one to five years), with automatic yearly renewals unless, 30 days before expiration of the term, one party gives the other written notice of termination. The Operating Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual consent, by FedEx for \u201cintentional misconduct or reckless or willfully negligent operation\u201d of equipment, by either party for breach of the Operating Agreement\u2019s obligations, by either party if FedEx stops doing business or reduces its operations at the driver\u2019s terminal, and by a driver on 30 days\u2019 written notice. The driver has the right to challenge his termination by an arbitration at which, if he prevails, he may be awarded reinstatement or damages or both. A driver in good standing has the right to assign his rights under the Operating Agreement to a replacement contractor acceptable to FedEx. The Operating Agreement recites that it and its attachments constitute the \u201centire agreement and understanding between the parties,\u201d and that it can be modified only by a writing signed by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>2. <em>Implementation of the Operating Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Although FedEx claimed at trial that the Operating Agreement (and only the Operating Agreement) determined the drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, both sides presented anecdotal and other evidence through the testimony of numerous drivers, FedEx managers, and experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Notwithstanding the merger clause in the Operating Agreement, the drivers\u2019 relationship to FedEx is defined by a number of other sources, including the FedEx \u201cGround Manual\u201d and \u201cOperations Management Handbook,\u201d which set forth \u201cpolicies and procedures\u201d in great detail to ensure the uniform operation of FedEx terminals throughout California, as well as by recruiting materials, welcome packets, memoranda, training videos, bulletin board posters, roundtable presentations, and similar means of communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">A new driver leases a scanner and purchases or leases a truck (usually obtained from FedEx preferred vendors) that meets FedEx\u2019s size, model and condition specifications, paints the truck \u201cFedEx White,\u201d and applies the FedEx logo to the truck. To pay for these items, drivers may obtain loans through FedEx\u2019s business support programs (with repayment through pay deductions). FedEx offers its drivers , a deferred compensation or retirement plan (the record is ambiguous on this point) and other \u201cemployee benefits\u201d (including direct deposit, a seniority-based \u201ctime-off program\u201d for unpaid leave, and a scholarship program for the drivers\u2019 children). As is true of all FedEx employees, drivers are paid weekly at rates set by FedEx without negotiation (the drivers\u2019 rate is based on a daily rate, a piece rate for packages handled, and bonuses for length and quality of service).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Customers are billed by FedEx, not the drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Regional managers supervise terminal managers and have weekly discussions about goals and procedures. Terminal managers, in turn, supervise and train drivers. Drivers work full time and exclusively for FedEx, and must work every day FedEx provides service unless they have preapproved replacements. FedEx sets the drivers\u2019 work hours (9.5 to 11 hours a day), and the average driver has worked for FedEx for eight years, with an annual income of $35,000 to $50,000 after expenses. The drivers and their trucks are subject to inspection every day (the trucks must be clean, the drivers in uniform and well groomed), and if either fails inspection, the driver may be barred from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Tracks must be parked in assigned spots and loaded by FedEx employees with the packages assigned to the driver by management (the drivers may not refuse an assignment).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FedEx adjusts the number of assigned packages (thereby controlling the driver\u2019s hours and pay) by \u201cflexing\u201d from an adjacent route to balance the workload between drivers and in furtherance of its goal\u2014deliver \u201cevery package, every day.\u201d Almost all drivers participate in the flex program. When necessary (as determined by FedEx), FedEx reconfigures primary service areas without payment by FedEx to the driver for lost customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Drivers may not leave the terminal at the beginning of the workday until sorting is completed, and terminal managers may contact drivers during the day about additional assignments. Drivers may \u201csequence\u201d the order of deliveries and pickups but must meet all pickup and delivery times or \u201cwindows\u201d arranged by FedEx\u2019s sales representatives and certain customers. These windows affect a driver\u2019s ability to sequence his own route. Drivers must comply with FedEx\u2019s rales for obtaining signatures on scanners, releasing packages without signatures, special handling of overnight and C.O.D. packages, and tracing undelivered or improperly delivered packages. Drivers must place their scanners in their computers after each delivery (fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>and at the end of each day must return to their assigned terminal parking spaces, deliver all paperwork and cash from C.O.D. payments, download their scanners, and provide details about any unsuccessful deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">When on any given day a driver makes no attempt to deliver a package, misses a pickup time or window, or is the subject of a complaint, the matter must be discussed with the terminal manager who, in addition, meets with each driver twice each year to communicate and document shortcomings. Several times each year, terminal managers evaluate each driver\u2019s performance by means of a \u201ccustomer service ride\u201d and there are covert checks and security audits conducted in the field. Each driver receives an annual progress review. Terminal managers decide which \u201cfailures to service\u201d or alleged breaches of the Operating Agreement to document, and they have discretion (subject to the regional managers\u2019 and upper management\u2019s approval) to recommend termination or nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In practice, therefore, the work performed by the drivers is wholly integrated into FedEx\u2019s operation. The drivers look like FedEx employees, act like FedEx employees, are paid like FedEx employees, and receive many employee benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">B. <em>The Phase I Statement of Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The trial court found, and set forth in its statement of decision, that the drivers were FedEx employees, not independent contractors, and that they had not been indemnified for any of the expenses at issue. The court described the Operating Agreement as \u201ca brilliantly drafted contract creating the constraints of an employment relationship with [the drivers] in the guise of an independent contractor model\u201d\u2014because FedEx \u201cnot only has the right to control, but has close to absolute actual control over [the drivers] based upon interpretation and obfuscation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that FedEx\u2019s management witnesses \u201cdiffered dramatically in their testimony as to the available remedies\u201d for a driver challenging termination, with the head of contractor relations \u201cadmitting that he did not volunteer to [the drivers] any information about [their] rights to arbitrate or sue.\u201d In the trial court\u2019s view, FedEx\u2019s conduct established that the drivers could be terminated \u201cat will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The court found, in addition, that the drivers are \u201ctotally integrated into the [FedEx] operation,\u201d that they perform work essential to FedEx\u2019s core business, that they are required to work exclusively and full time for FedEx, that their customers are those assigned to them by FedEx, that no specialized skills are required, that they must wear uniforms and conform absolutely to FedEx\u2019s standards and that, in the end, each driver has a \u201cjob\u201d with \u201clittle or no entrepreneurial opportunities.\u201d Although the drivers provide their own trucks and equipment, FedEx is involved in the purchasing process, providing funds and recommending vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The essence of the trial court\u2019s statement of decision is that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\n<em>FedEx\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The trial court found that, for purposes of determining the drivers\u2019 right to reimbursement for their expenses, the drivers are employees within the meaning of Labor Code section 2802.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> FedEx contends the trial court is wrong. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Subdivision (a) of section 2802 provides that \u201c[a]n employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Because the Labor Code does not expressly define \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of section 2802, the common law test of employment applies. <em>(Reynolds v. Bement </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1075, 1087 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 483, 116 P.3d 1162].) The essence of the test is the \u201ccontrol of details\u201d\u2014that is, whether the principal has the right to control the manner and means by which the worker accomplishes the work\u2014but there are a number of additional factors in the modem equation, including (1) whether the worker is engaged in a distinct occupation or business, (2) whether, considering the kind of occupation and locality, the work is usually done under the principal\u2019s direction or by a specialist without supervision, (3) the skill required, (4) whether the principal or worker supplies the instmmentalities, tools, and place of work, (5) the length of time for which the services are to be performed, (6) the method of payment, whether by time or by job, (7) whether the work is part of the principal\u2019s regular business, and (8) whether the parties believe they are creating an employer-employee relationship. <em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 350-351 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399] <em>(Borello); Tieberg v. Unemployment Ins.

Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1363, 1367, 1373 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 64]; <em>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 877.) Because the trial court expressly relied on <em>Borello, </em>and because FedEx does not dispute the applicability of the <em>Borello </em>test, there is no question of law with regard to this issue, only one of substantial evidence. <em>(Air Couriers, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at pp. 932-933, 937.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">FedEx contends the trial court misapplied the test (by an erroneous analysis of the \u201cright to control\u201d factor and otherwise) and made \u201cinsupportable inferences of fact\u201d in determining that the drivers are employees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">First, FedEx\u2019s assumptions are wrong. Although it is true that the Operating Agreement says \u201cthe manner and means\u201d to satisfy the objectives of the contract \u201care within the discretion of the [drivers],\u201d and that FedEx does not have the \u201cauthority to impose any term or condition\u201d to the contrary, the evidence shows unequivocally that FedEx\u2019s conduct spoke louder than its words. As noted above, the parties\u2019 label is not dispositive and will be ignored if their actual conduct establishes a different relationship. <em>(Borello, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 349; <em>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 877-878.) The same is true with regard to FedEx\u2019s claim that it cannot terminate the drivers at will. Although the Operating Agreement provides for termination with cause, it also provides for nonrenewal without any cause at all\u2014and substantial evidence established that FedEx discharges drivers at will. <em>(Toyota, </em>at p. 875.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Second and most significantly, the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. FedEx\u2019s control over every exquisite detail of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>drivers\u2019 performance, including the color of their socks and the style of their hair, supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the drivers are employees, not independent contractors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The drivers must wear uniforms and use specific scanners and forms, all obtained from FedEx and marked with FedEx\u2019s logo. The larger items\u2014trucks and scanners\u2014are obtained from FedEx-approved providers, usually financed through FedEx, and repaid through deductions from the drivers\u2019 weekly checks. Many standard employee benefits are provided, and the drivers work full time, with regular schedules and regular routes. The terminal managers are the drivers\u2019 immediate supervisors and can unilaterally reconfigure the drivers\u2019 routes without regard to the drivers\u2019 resulting loss of income. The customers are FedEx\u2019s customers, not the drivers\u2019 customers. FedEx has discretion to reject a driver\u2019s helper, temporary replacement, or proposed assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Drivers\u2014who need no experience to get the job in the first place and whose only required skill is the ability to drive\u2014must be at the terminal at regular times for sorting and packing as well as mandatory meetings, and they may not leave until the process is completed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The drivers are not engaged in a separate profession or business, and they are paid weekly, not by the job. They must work exclusively for FedEx. Although they have a nominal opportunity to profit, that opportunity may be lost at the discretion of the terminal managers by \u201cflexing\u201d and withheld approvals, and for very slight violations of the rules. Most drivers have worked for FedEx for a long time (an average of eight years), and drivers employed by FedEx\u2019s competitors (UPS, DHL, and FedEx\u2019s sister corporation, FedEx Express) are classified as employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Based on these facts, we reject FedEx\u2019s contention that this is a \u201ctrue entrepreneurial opportunity depending on how well the [drivers] perform\u201d and conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the drivers are employees, not independent contractors, for purposes of section <em>2802. (Air Couriers, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at pp. 937-939; <em>JKH Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>pp. 1064-1065; <em>Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 876-878.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">FedEx contends the drivers\u2019 claims were unsuitable for class treatment, and that a classwide judgment is inappropriate on the evidence presented. More specifically, FedEx complains that the class certification order was flawed from the outset because it was based on the incorrect assumption that proof would focus on the terms of the Operating Agreement, when in fact the drivers offered \u201canecdotes about various alleged individual violations.\u201d In short, the claim is that individual facts predominated over the common issues. We disagree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The decision whether to certify a class is one within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will be set aside only upon a showing of abused discretion, <em>(Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 319, 326-327 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 906, 96 P.3d 194]; <em>Linder </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435-436 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27].) On this record, FedEx cannot make the required showing because it is clear that common issues\u2014whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the drivers were employees and, if so, which expenses would be reimbursable\u2014predominated. The anecdotal evidence was admitted to show FedEx\u2019s power to interpret the Operating Agreement and was relevant to the class as a whole, not just to the drivers who happened to be the subject of a particular anecdote. FedEx\u2019s failure to raise this point below suggests it understood that it would fail (it did not at any time during the nine-week trial move for decertification on the basis of the anecdotal evidence). <em>(Telles Transport, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1166-1167 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 540]; <em>Mesecher v. County of San Diego </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1677, 1685-1686 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In a related argument, FedEx contends the class \u201cnever proved to be ascertainable or manageable in any reasonable sense: 209 distinct \u2018mini cases\u2019 . . . were required to ascertain who was actually within the class and . . . entitle[d] to reimbursement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">A class action requires an ascertainable class with a well-defined community of interest among its members. Community of interest, in turn, requires that common questions of law or fact predominate, and that class representatives (who must be able to adequately represent the class) have claims typical of the class. The class is ascertainable if it identifies a group of unnamed plaintiffs by describing a set of common characteristics sufficient to allow a member of that group to identify himself as having a right to recover based on the description. <em>(Bartold v. Glendale Federal Bank </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 816, 828 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">After much effort and briefing, the class was limited to SWA drivers who drive (or had driven) full time and who do not (or did not) subcontract their service areas out to others for reasons other than vacation, sick leave, or other commonly excused employment absences. The trial court found that the members of this class could reasonably be identified from FedEx\u2019s records and through discovery and, for the most part, they were. Discovery limited the class to 209 putative members. FedEx\u2019s suggestion that the members of this class shifted \u201cin and out, sometimes on a day-to-day basis,\u201d is unsupported by a reference to the record and meaningless in the context of the trial transcript. If FedEx\u2019s claim is that every member of the class had to be identified from the outset, FedEx is simply wrong. <em>(Daar v.

Stds. Enforcement Interpretive Bulletin No. 84-7 (Jan. 8, 1985)), and the settlement formula in the Operating Agreement \u201ceffectively provided reasonable compensation\u201d for the drivers\u2019 business expenses. FedEx is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The Operating Agreement obligates the drivers to provide their own trucks, scanners, and clean uniforms, and to \u201cbear all costs and expenses incidental to operation\u201d of the trucks, including maintenance, cleaning, depreciation, fuel, oil, tires, repairs, taxes, licenses, tolls, and insurance. The drivers, the terminal managers, and FedEx\u2019s upper management all testified that drivers are expected to bear their own costs. As for the \u201csettlement,\u201d the Operating Agreement provides that it is \u201cfor services provided,\u201d not expenses incurred (for example, \u201ccontractor and van availability\u201d). FedEx\u2019s suggestion that the settlement formula is keyed to specific expenses and, as such, includes reimbursement for those expenses, is not supported by any evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">FedEx contends the attorneys\u2019 fee award is \u201cmanifestly improper,\u201d that it cannot be justified under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>must in any event be revisited in light of our reversal of the equitable orders in <em>Estrada II.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We reject FedEx\u2019s substantive challenges but agree that the amount cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 provides as relevant that \u201c[ujpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement... are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Estrada\u2019s motion asked for $619,691 in costs and $6,789,325 for his attorneys\u2019 fees, a total of $7,409,016\u2014plus a 2.0 multiplier as compensation for delay and contingency, a total of $14,818,032. The trial court reduced the fee by 18 percent (finding the amount \u201cslightly bloated\u201d) but otherwise granted the motion (including the 2.0 multiplier) and gave Estrada a total of $12,373,875 for costs and fees, noting the risk inherent in a contingent fee, the \u201cfinancial burden of private enforcement,\u201d and the years of \u201clong, hard-fought\u201d and \u201clabor intensive\u201d litigation involving \u201cenforcement of an important right\u201d that conferred a \u201csignificant benefit on a large class.\u201d FedEx contends the award is erroneous because Estrada was motivated primarily by his own financial interests, that any benefit to a larger class was incidental, that no significant benefit was conferred on the public or a larger class, and that the trial court\u2019s dual use of the same reasons to both calculate the fee and justify the multiplier created a windfall. We reject FedEx\u2019s claim that fees were not recoverable in this case but agree that the amount must be reduced and that the same facts cannot be used to trigger the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 <em>and </em>justify a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Estrada\u2019s personal motivation does not diminish the fact that he pursued this public interest class action not only for himself but on behalf of a class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>comprised of FedEx\u2019s past and present drivers and ultimately obtained awards for 209 drivers. <em>(Beasley </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1414 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 459]; <em>Citizens Against Rent Control v.

In <em>Estrada II, </em>we reversed all the equitable orders, finding that Estrada lacked standing to pursue his claims for prospective equitable relief (a) because his relationship with FedEx ended before this lawsuit was filed, and (b) because the class certification order was expressly limited to the reimbursement issue. <em>(Estrada II, supra, </em>B187951.) The equitable orders were a significant part of the litigation and the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In Phase III of these proceedings, Estrada sought declaratory relief and a permanent injunction on behalf of \u201call California single work area pick-up and delivery drivers who at any time since May 11, 1996 worked or currently work or in the future are employed to work under FedEx\u2019s Operating Agreement.\u201d The trial court rejected FedEx\u2019s defenses, finding among other things that it was necessary to address the equitable claims in light of the \u201cimportance and recurring nature of the employment issues of the [drivers].\u201d A permanent injunction issued, enjoining FedEx from (1) misclassifying drivers as independent contractors or participating in any agreement to misclassify them as independent contractors, and (2) violating or attempting to violate <em>any provision of the California Labor Code, Industrial Welfare Commission orders, or other state laws and regulations protecting the drivers as employees\u2014both in the present and for as long as FedEx retained the employment model or substantially similar employment model used by FedEx at the time of trial. </em>We reversed all of the equitable orders, finding that Estrada lacked standing to seek prospective declaratory or injunctive relief and that the trial court thus lacked jurisdiction to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">When we reversed the equitable orders in <em>Estrada II, </em>we disposed of all of the benefits Estrada had obtained in the third phase of trial. Although we agree that Estrada is still the prevailing party, the factual predicate for the trial court\u2019s award\u2014that Estrada won on all points, including the far-reaching injunctions\u2014is no longer valid. Estrada concedes as much, noting in his respondent\u2019s brief that, under the short-lived injunctions, \u201cthe benefits of the instant litigation [would have been] enjoyed by thousands of people who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>not members of the class, including future [drivers] and employees,\u201d and that the equitable orders were \u201c[m]ore important\u201d to the trial court than the damages award because \u201cthe injunctive and declaratory relief require[d] [FedEx] to treat all its current and future [drivers] as employees and thus provide[d] ongoing relief to a huge group of people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The $12,373,875 award is excessive and cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In recalculating an appropriate fee award on remand, the trial court must determine anew whether any multiplier is appropriate in this case. The fee award sans multiplier ($5,567,246) exceeded the amount of the award to the entire class of plaintiffs (about $3 million before interest was added, about $5 million with prejudgment interest). By the time the trial court revisits this issue, the total monetary award to plaintiffs will have increased for the reasons explained below with regard to the drivers\u2019 cross-appeal, and the attorneys will have spent more time on this case both on appeal and on the postappeal trial court proceedings. While the amount of the fee is ultimately a decision within the trial court\u2019s discretion <em>(Ketchum </em>v. <em>Moses </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 17 P.3d 735]), the fee must above all else be reasonable and a multiplier, if used, must be based on facts other than those used to trigger the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. <em>(Ramos v.

All members of the proposed class . . . incurred the below-listed similar expenses, delineated in the Operating Agreement and certified by the Court as susceptible to proof on a class basis, as a direct consequence of performing services for [FedEx] . . . .\u201d Ten categories of \u201c[e]xpenses the [Operating Agreement] requires\u201d were listed: (1) purchasing or leasing a vehicle for the purpose of performing pickup and delivery services; (2) operating the vehicle, including fuel, oil, tires, repairs, business taxes, cleaning, insurance, registration and tolls; (3) maintaining the vehicle in accordance with federal, state and local law; (4) marking the vehicle with logos, colors, numbers, marks and insignia; (5) licensing the vehicle; (6) paying into the contractor performance escrow account; (7) purchasing, renting and cleaning uniforms; (8) purchasing or otherwise securing communications equipment, including but not limited to scanners and other required equipment; (9) obtaining liability insurance; and (10) obtaining and keeping in force \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation insurance for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">On September 8, 2004, the trial court limited reimbursement to items actually paid out by the drivers or deducted from their settlement checks, ruled that proof of the claimed expenses would be \u201climited to receipts and personal records of the [drivers] ... as well as records in the hands of [FedEx],\u201d and limited some of the categories of recoverable expenses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Four of the court\u2019s rulings are challenged on the drivers\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The trial court refused to permit proof of expenses by expert analysis and lay testimony about FedEx\u2019s estimates of the drivers\u2019 expenses, limiting the drivers\u2019 proof to receipts and records. More specifically, the trial court ruled \u201cthat sampling or statistical analysis [would] not suffice, as the amounts of monies that must be the subject of the accounting [would] be too disparate because of the economic differences in the California geographic area. ...[]\u25a1 The [drivers] have the burden of proving areas of compensability by means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>limited to receipts and personal records . . . and [FedEx\u2019s] records ....[][] The [drivers] will present a package to the referee containing the above items as to each [driver]. Upon receipt of said package, [FedEx] can either stipulate as to the amounts sought or file documents or records controverting those amounts.\u201d We reject Estrada\u2019s challenge to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">According to the drivers, they should have been permitted to offer \u201cexpert analysis computing the [drivers\u2019] damages based on an economic model [that] used actual receipts produced by [the drivers] from around the state, together with expense estimates published in [a FedEx] recruiting booklet entitled, \u2018Becoming [a FedEx] Pickup and Delivery Contractor\u2019 [because the booklet included] data in the form of weekly and annual expense estimates,\u201d and a spreadsheet showing \u201cthe estimated costs for ten specific expense items projected over a ten-year period.\u201d The problem with this argument is that it is premised on a finding that the amounts due to the drivers were not susceptible of exact proof <em>(Long Beach Drug Co. v. United Drug. Co. </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 158, 174 [89 P.2d 386] [uncertain consequential damages]; <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Tweedy </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 738, 745 [203 P.2d 778] [future damages]; <em>Suburban Mobile Homes, Inc. v.

In short, estimates and educated guesses are allowed where damages cannot be proved. That was not this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Although the September 2004 order required proof by receipts and other personal records, Estrada\u2019s lawyer\u2014claiming she had an agreement with FedEx\u2019s lawyer\u2014prepared spreadsheets listing the drivers\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses (such as gasoline and maintenance costs that were not deducted from the drivers\u2019 checks) with Bates-stamp references to each supporting document, the idea being that FedEx\u2019s lawyers would review the spreadsheets, determine which items were disputed, and request production of receipts for only the disputed items. After the deadline for the submission of evidence passed, FedEx objected to the spreadsheets as incompetent, contending there was no agreement to relieve the drivers of the court-ordered requirement to present all supporting documentation. The referee sustained the objection but found the drivers\u2019 lawyers had honestly \u201cbelieved\u201d an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>agreement had existed, and therefore found that the drivers should be allowed to present proper proof\u2014and accepted 40,000 documents (all of which had been produced to FedEx during discovery) which, if allowed, would result in an award to the drivers of about $5.23 million for these expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">FedEx objected to the referee\u2019s order. The trial court agreed with the referee that there had been no agreement,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> found the drivers had offered \u201cincompetent evidence,\u201d and approved the referee\u2019s decision to allow the drivers to reopen\u2014but only with regard to expenses provable by documents FedEx had produced during discovery, which necessarily excluded all of the drivers\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses provable only by the drivers\u2019 documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The trial court\u2019s reason for allowing the partial reopening\u2014so that FedEx would not obtain a \u201cwindfall\u201d\u2014is entirely inconsistent with its order limiting the scope of the allowed reopening. Because the trial court\u2019s reasoning was correct (FedEx would indeed obtain a windfall if it was not required to reimburse the drivers for provable expenses that had been part of the case from the beginning, all of which were fully documented and produced to FedEx during discovery), the only possible conclusion is that the trial court\u2019s order is wrong and must be reversed. <em>(In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].) However wrong Estrada\u2019s lawyer might have been in believing she had an agreement with opposing counsel to use the spreadsheets without the related proof packets, her error caused absolutely no prejudice to FedEx.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court must revisit this issue and conduct such further proceedings as are necessary to determine the amounts to be awarded to the drivers for these expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The trial court, relying on a January 1985 interpretive bulletin (Bulletin 84-7) issued by the Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), found the drivers were not entitled to reimbursement for expenses related \u201cto purchasing or leasing a vehicle for the purpose of performing pick up and delivery services\u201d because \u201cemployers in the pick up and delivery industry in California can require as a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>employment that their drivers, at their own expense, purchase or lease a truck to the employer\u2019s specifications.\u201d Estrada contends the trial court should instead have relied on a January 2, 1997 DLSE opinion letter (No. 1997.01.02) opining that employees may not be required to purchase a $50,000 customized truck as a condition of employment. <em>(Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 805, 815 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 59] [we do not defer to DLSE bulletins and opinion letters but may nevertheless consider them for what they are worth].)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Bulletin 84-7 was a response to a question about \u201cwhether employers . . . may require mechanics or other employees to provide and maintain their own tools, regardless of the wages paid the employees, if it is customary in the industry for mechanics or other employees to do so.\u201d In response, the Labor Commissioner opined that \u201cif an employee is paid at least twice the minimum wage, such employee may, as a condition of employment, be required to provide and maintain his[] own hand tools and equipment customarily required by the trade or craft.\u201d In addition, the Labor Commissioner opined that \u201c[i]f an employee is paid at least twice the minimum wage, he[] may be required, as a condition of employment, to furnish his[] own tools, regardless of the custom or practice in the industry to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In that context, the Labor Commissioner was also asked \u201cwhether an automobile or truck used in the course of employment by an employee ... is a \u2018tool\u2019 within the meaning of [section 2802].\u201d The commissioner answered that \u201cneither an automobile nor a truck is considered a tool within the meaning of [section 2802], and <em>an applicant for employment may be required, as a condition of employment, to furnish </em>his[] <em>own automobile or truck to be used in the course of employment, regardless of the amount of wages paid. </em>[1] Under . . . [s]ection 2802, an employer who requires an employee to furnish his[] own car or truck to be used in the course of employment would be obligated to reimburse the employee for the costs necessarily incurred by the employee in using the car or truck in the course of employment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The January 2, 1997 opinion letter is a response to a question based on this situation: \u201c \u2018An employer hires a sales employee and requires him to purchase a customized truck for about $50,000.00, bearing the employer\u2019s name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>as a condition of employment. The employer then directs the employee to the vendor who sells the trucks and to a leasing company that will finance the truck. Finally, the employer directs the employee to an insurance company that will insure the truck.\u2019 \u201d (DLSE Opinion Letter No. 1997.01.02.) The question was whether section 450 prohibits the employer from requiring the employee to patronize specific and identifiable third persons.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As relevant, the chief counsel for DLSE replied: \u201cCalifornia courts have determined that [section] 450 promotes] the right of a wage earner to all wages lawfully accrued to him.\u2019 [1] Clearly, a condition of employment which requires the employee or applicant to make a $50,000.00 purchase of a vehicle which advertises the name of the employer and further requires that the vehicle be purchased from one vendor (or any number of vendors) chosen by the employer is violative of [section] 450. [f] <em>While your </em>[question] <em>does </em>@ <em>not [mention section 2802, JI feel that it is imperative that you also consider [that statute]. </em>... [f] ...

Letter No. 1997.01.02, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The essence of Estrada\u2019s argument is that, by implication, the 1997 opinion letter is a clarification of Bulletin 84-7, and it is the 1997 opinion letter, not the bulletin, that is factually similar to FedEx\u2019s position vis-a-vis its drivers. The problem with this argument is that it fails to consider the DLSE\u2019s other relevant opinion letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">According to the 2002 Update of The DLSE Enforcement Policies and Interpretations Manual (Revised) (\u00a7 29.2.3.2, p. 29-2, &lt;http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Manual-Instructions.htm&gt; [as of Aug. 13, 2007]), Bulletin 84-7 is still valid and has <em>not </em>been superseded by the 1997 opinion letter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>particularly, IWC wage order No. 9-2001, effective July 1, 2004, provides that <em>in the transportation industry, </em>\u201c[w]hen tools or equipment are required by the employer or are necessary to the performance of a job, such tools and equipment shall be provided and maintained by the employer, <em>except that an employee whose wages are at least two </em>. . . <em>times the minimum wage . . . may be required to provide and maintain hand tools and equipment customarily required by the trade or craft. </em>\u201d (Id., \u00b6 9, p. 7.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This 2004 statement by the IWC is entirely consistent with the DLSE\u2019s Bulletin 84-7, which provides that, because \u201cneither an automobile nor a truck is considered a tool within the meaning of [section 2802], <em>... an applicant for employment may be required, as a condition of employment, to furnish his[] own automobile or truck to be used in the course of employment, regardless of the amount of wages paid. \u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Other DLSE opinion letters presume it is proper for an employer to require an employee to provide his own car or truck for use on the job. Thus, a February 25, 1991 opinion letter (No. 1991.02.25-1) opines that when an employee uses his own automobile for his work, the employer must pay for the employee\u2019s insurance premiums. An August 30, 1991 opinion letter (No. 1991.08.30) responds to an inquiry about employees in the trucking business who own their own trucks and states that the DLSE\u2019s \u201cenforcement policy requires that the employer agree to reimburse the employee for all the costs incurred by the employee in the operation of the equipment.\u201d An August 14, 1994 opinion letter (No. 1994.08.14) states that the reimbursement rates for an employee\u2019s use of his own truck differs from the rate applicable to automobiles. An opinion letter dated November 5, 1998 (No. 1998.11.05) responds to a question about employees who regularly drive their personal vehicles for business purposes and discusses the employer\u2019s obligation to pay insurance premiums for coverage above the legal minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Implicit in all of these opinion letters is the assumption that it is perfectly lawful for an employer to require its employees to provide their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>own vehicles as a condition of employment, provided only that the employees must be reimbursed for the expenses thereby incurred. (And see <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1958) 164 Cal.App.2d 523 [331 P.2d 99].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The only commentary we have found (none being cited by either party) supports our conclusion that an employer may require its employees to provide their own trucks: \u201cAn applicant or employee may be required, as a condition of employment, to furnish his . . . own vehicle to be used in the course of employment. [Section] 2802 requires an employer to indemnify its employees for all necessary expenses or losses incurred in the course of his . . . duties.\u201d (Advising California Employers and Employees (Cont.Ed.Bar (2005) \u00a7 5.89, p. 454.) In sum, aside from two tangential and conclusory sentences in one DLSE opinion letter, we have not found any authority for Estrada\u2019s proposition that an employer cannot require an employee to provide his own truck as a condition of employment. To the contrary, the DLSE\u2019s other opinion letters, Bulletin 84-7, and the IWC wage order all assume that an employer can in fact do just that. Accordingly, we conclude that FedEx need not reimburse the drivers for the cost of their trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The certification order and the September 8, 2004 order listed \u201cworkers compensation\u201d insurance as a recoverable expense, notwithstanding that virtually all of the drivers carried \u201cwork accident\u201d insurance (a form of insurance for self-employed workers). Although this technical error was discovered during discovery (in 2002), the drivers\u2019 lawyers failed to clarify the point at that time and the trial court later refused to allow reimbursement for work accident insurance.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We agree with Estrada\u2019s challenge to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Although the drivers\u2019 lawyers should have sought clarification instead of assuming that everyone understood that the drivers would be reimbursed for their work accident insurance premiums, the failure to do so does not justify a windfall to FedEx\u2014particularly since it caused the confusion by treating the drivers as independent contractors and was at all times fully aware of the ambiguity in the court\u2019s orders (the Operating Agreement itself obligates the drivers \u201cto obtain and keep in force at all times . . . work accident and/or workers compensation insurance . . .\u201d). (See <em>Rainer </em>v. <em>Community Memorial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Hosp. </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 240, 254 [95 Cal.Rptr. 901]; <em>Trafton v.

The drivers are entitled to reimbursement for their work accident insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Estrada contends the trial court erred in \u201cusing the class questionnaires as a litmus test to determine which of the 700 absent class members wished to participate rather than . . . determining] which fit the class definition\u201d (thus making it a prohibited \u201copt-in\u201d class action) and then \u201cdismissing all absent class members who did not fully participate in discovery.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">After the class certification order and after our decision in <em>Estrada I, Hypertouch, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1543 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 839], held that \u201can \u2018opt-in\u2019 procedure is not authorized by and conflicts with California class action rules.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) But <em>Hypertouch </em>does not support Estrada\u2019s challenge to his certification order because, as <em>Hypertouch </em>notes, \u201cthe existence of an ascertainable class is a precondition of class certification . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1549.) In our case, discovery was necessary to determine whether in fact there was an ascertainable class and, if so, whether it was manageable. <em>(Estrada I, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 983.) More to the point, Estrada\u2019s current argument ignores the fact that class certification was granted on the accepted condition that discovery would define the class. When prospective class members failed to respond (or responded inadequately) to the court-approved discovery requests, the court could not determine whether they fit the class definition or had compensable damages. Under these circumstances, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The judgment is reversed (1) insofar as it awards $12,373,875 to plaintiffs for their attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and (2) insofar as it disallowed the expenses discussed in parts V.A.2 and V.A.4 of this opinion; in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to conduct such further proceedings as are necessary to determine the amounts to which the drivers are entitled for out-of-pocket expenses (pt. V.A.2.) and the amounts due for their work accident insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>premiums (pt. V.A.4.), and to thereafter determine the reasonable amount of fees and costs to be awarded (pt. IV.). Estrada is entitled to his costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Mallano, Acting P.

Drivers who operate or operated in multiple work areas or routes (MWA\u2019s), corporate entities, and others were excluded from the class. Two of the three named plaintiffs (Anthony Estrada and Jeffrey Morgan) were SWA\u2019s; the third named plaintiff (Harvey Roberts) was an MWA and was dismissed on that ground (he is not a party to this appeal). In the end, we are dealing with only the SWA\u2019s on appeal and we thus refer to them as drivers except when necessary to distinguish between SWA\u2019s and MWA\u2019s, and for simplicity use only masculine pronouns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> Our statement of facts is based on the evidence (and inferences supporting the judgment) presented during a nine-week trial. <em>(Air Couriers Internat. </em>v. <em>Employment Development Dept. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 923, 937 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 37].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\"> The scanner, which is leased from FedEx, is the device used by the driver to obtain signatures when packages are delivered. Every driver\u2019s truck has a computer, and the driver must insert the scanner into the computer after each delivery so that customers have immediate access to delivery information via the FedEx Web site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"> Drivers are paid according to a complex formula that includes $40 per day for working in uniform and providing a van, $5 per day for participating in the flex program, a piece-rate component based on the number of stops made and packages handled, and a daily \u201ctemporary core zone density\u201d payment, plus a quarterly performance bonus based on years of service and a monthly bonus based on both the individual driver\u2019s performance and the performance of his terminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\"> Under federal law, the drivers\u2019 trucks cannot be used for personal use during the hours they are used to deliver packages for FedEx. (See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 376.12(c) (2007).) Because the drivers must park their trucks in assigned spaces at their terminals, and because the logos on most of the trucks are difficult if not impossible to conceal, FedEx\u2019s assertion that the drivers may use their trucks for other purposes during off-hours is more imagined than real. As a practical matter, most drivers rarely use their trucks for personal matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> The court found the drivers\u2019 right to control their own routes and schedules was illusive because they were \u201cconstrained by customer pick up and delivery windows contracted by the [FedEx] sales force\u201d and by FedEx\u2019s paperwork requirements that required the drivers\u2019 presence at the terminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b32-10\"> Undesignated section references are to the Labor Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b32-11\"> <em>Air Couriers </em>and <em>JKH Enterprises </em>both involve package delivery drivers, albeit in different postures.

In <em>JKH Enterprises, </em>the Department of Industrial Relations found in administrative proceedings that a courier service\u2019s drivers were employees for whom workers\u2019 compensation insurance had to be provided; the courier service challenged the order by a petition for a writ of mandate, claiming the drivers were independent contractors. The trial court found the drivers were employees and the Sixth District affirmed. <em>(JKH Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th 1046.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\"> The drivers were told they could not wear white shoes or socks; the men were told they could not wear earrings or ponytails, and sometimes that they needed to shave or get a haircut. We summarily reject FedEx\u2019s suggestion that constraints such as these are necessary to ensure the drivers\u2019 compliance with government regulations. (See <em>Southwest Research Institute v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 705, 709 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 769].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\"> FedEx\u2019s reliance on <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 188 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 98], is misplaced. Although that case observes that \u201ctruck driving\u2014while perhaps not a skilled craft\u2014requires abilities beyond those possessed by a general laborer\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 202-203), the finding of independent contractor status in that case is based primarily on the facts that the truckdrivers worked for more than one broker at a time and were compensated on a job-by-job basis, \u201cwith no obligation on the part of the [drivers] to accept any assignment and no retribution ... for refusing assignments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 203.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\"> The federal cases relied on by FedEx are factually inapposite. The truckers in <em>Berger Transfer </em>v. <em>Central States </em>(8th Cir. 1996) 85 F.3d 1374 were paid by the trip, could refuse assignments, and did not have to wear uniforms or paint their trucks with any special marks. The drivers in <em>C.C. Eastern, Inc. </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995) 60 F.3d 855 were paid by the job, did not have to wear uniforms, and could choose any kind of truck. The drivers in <em>Merchants Home Delivery Serv., Inc. v. N. L. R. B. </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 580 F.2d 966 were paid by the job, chose their own work hours, could refuse assignments, could sometimes work for other businesses, and operated as partnerships or corporations, not individuals. The drivers in <em>North American Van Lines, Inc. v. N.L.R.B. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1989) 869 F.2d 596 selected the frequency of their jobs, the type of loads, and the routes taken, and they did not have to wear uniforms. The drivers in <em>United States v. Silk </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 704 [91 L.Ed. 1757, 67 S.Ct. 1463] hired their own helpers and hauled for more than one business. Meanwhile, the drivers in our case are not paid by the job but by a formula established by FedEx and must work only for FedEx, must wear uniforms, must conform their personal appearance to FedEx\u2019s rules and regulations, must work on the days required by FedEx, and must use FedEx\u2019s method of delivery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> We reject FedEx\u2019s assertion that the certification order assumed the trial would be limited to the terms of the Operating Agreement. There is nothing in the order itself or FedEx\u2019s brief to support this assumption. In fact, the reporters\u2019 transcripts of the hearings leading up to and following the certification order include several discussions about the scope of the evidence at trial\u2014and it is clear that everyone understood the drivers were not \u201cgoing to stand or fall on the operating agreement\u201d but were \u201cgoing to put in individual proof of the way things operate, and then we get to the issue of the way they operate at the time at each terminal, or span of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> The trial court found that \u201c[n]o evidence was presented to support [FedEx\u2019s] position [that the drivers had already been indemnified for the expenses they sought under section 2802] and no language in the [Operating Agreement] would bolster that theory. Rather all witnesses testified that the [drivers] were responsible for their own expenses.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\"> We summarily reject FedEx\u2019s claim of evidentiary error. It says it \u201csought to introduce evidence . . . establishing that the settlement was designed <em>overall </em>to provide de facto compensation for <em>all </em>expenses incurred by contractors,\u201d and it says it wanted to do this by \u201cshowing that the payments contractors made to their own hired drivers were far less than what contractors received through the settlement system for equivalent work.\u201d FedEx\u2019s record references do not support this point. Instead, the cited pages show that FedEx tried to ask witnesses about information in their tax returns, and that the trial court properly sustained objections to those questions based on the taxpayer privilege and because FedEx had other means to present the same information. <em>(Sav-On Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 1, 6 [123 Cal.Rptr. 283, 538 P.2d 739].)
