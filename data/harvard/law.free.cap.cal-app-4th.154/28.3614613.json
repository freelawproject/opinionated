During the period of the disputes, the attorney for the brother became dissatisfied when the proposed listing agent for one of the father\u2019s real property assets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>allegedly at the sister\u2019s direction, failed to send the attorney a listing agreement for the property and a proposal from a potential buyer. The attorney left voice mail messages that accused the listing agent of conspiring with the sister to defraud the brother and that threatened to take \u201cappropriate action.\u201d The sister sued the brother\u2019s attorney for defamation based on those messages. The attorney filed a motion to strike the sister\u2019s complaint under the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute\u2014Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (section 425.16). The trial court denied the motion, and the attorney appeals. In reversing, we hold that the messages, under these circumstances, are covered by the anti-SLAPP statute and the litigation privilege in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) (section 47), and that the lawyer\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Peter Metsos died on March 29, 2004. He left a will, the Metsos Family Trust, and the Peter Metsos Trust. George Metsos (Metsos), Peter Metsos\u2019s son, was appointed executor of the Peter Metsos Trust. The Metsos Family Trust included a number of corporations that managed and operated individual restaurants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Metsos Family Trust also owned real estate related to at least some of these restaurants. Among the corporations in the Metsos Family Trust was P.S.G., Inc., which managed and operated the Lamplighter No. 3 restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">From at least January 2006, Metsos and his sister, plaintiff and respondent Sophia Metsos Rohde (plaintiff), had a dispute concerning the distribution of their father\u2019s assets. Defendant and appellant Michael Wolf (defendant), an attorney, and his law firm, Wolf, Rifkin, Shapiro &amp; Schulman, LLP, represented Metsos in that dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On February 10, 2006, defendant wrote a letter to T. Randolph Catanese, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, addressing a number of issues in the dispute. By letter dated that same day, Catanese responded, \u201cGenerally, when I receive letters of this type I do not respond with a letter, but rather with a lawsuit. It is readily apparent that you and your client have no desire to resolve the issues between our respective clients absent court intervention. Accordingly, the intended purpose of this letter is to apprise you and your client of what will be contained in a lawsuit, in part, when one is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Thereafter, on April 17, 2006, Catanese, plaintiff, plaintiff\u2019s husband, and defendant met and agreed that certain real property located in Chatsworth (the real estate related to the Lamplighter No. 3 restaurant) would be sold and the net proceeds divided equally between plaintiff and Metsos. Steve Weiss of NAI Capital was to be the listing agent and to prepare a listing agreement. Each of the sides was to keep the other informed of any developments concerning the listing and sale of the property. Nothing was to proceed with respect to the sale of the property without the mutual consent of Metsos and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">On April 25, 2006, defendant spoke with Weiss and advised him that he was to be included in all communications regarding the listing and sale of the property. Weiss informed defendant that he would be putting together a proposal for plaintiff and Metsos that week. Defendant asked Weiss to prepare a listing agreement for \u201cour review\u201d (presumably for the review by defendant and Catanese).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">On May 3, 2006, defendant had not heard from Weiss. He called Weiss and, apparently, left a message. In a responding voice mail message, Weiss \u201cindicated\u201d that he had prepared a listing agreement and had sent the listing agreement to plaintiff along with a proposal from a potential buyer for the property. Weiss stated that plaintiff had \u201cspecifically instructed\u201d him not to send the listing agreement and proposal to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Later that day, defendant attempted, unsuccessfully, to reach Weiss. Defendant left a voice mail message for Weiss demanding the listing agreement and proposal, expressing his dissatisfaction with not having been sent these documents, and stating, \u201cI believe you are obviously engaged in a conspiracy to defraud my client with Sophia Rohde and I plan on taking appropriate action.\u201d Shortly thereafter, defendant left Weiss a second voice mail message stating, \u201cSince you are obviously avoiding my calls, I can only assume that you are engaged in some kind of conspiracy with Sophia Rohde to deprive George Metsos of his interest in his property.\u201d In his declaration in support of his anti-SLAPP motion, defendant states, \u201cI know that, had my client and I continued to be excluded from communications concerning the listing and sale of the Chatsworth Property, an action would have been filed to protect my client\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">On May 9, 2006, plaintiff and her husband filed an action alleging various causes of action against Metsos and a corporation of which he is allegedly the controlling shareholder and sole officer and director. Plaintiff and her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>alleged that through defendant\u2019s statements, Metsos attempted to interfere with the negotiations for the sale of the real estate in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On May 26, 2006, plaintiff filed a separate action\u2014this one against defendant\u2014alleging that defendant\u2019s voice mail messages to Weiss defamed plaintiff and constituted slander per se. According to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, defendant stated \u201cwords actually or to the effect \u2018Sophia Rohde is engaged in a conspiracy with you to defraud my client George Metsos of his real estate or personal property.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On July 31, 2006, defendant filed his anti-SLAPP motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s complaint in her slander per se action. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his section 425.16 anti-SLAPP motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s complaint in her slander per se action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">A. <em>The Anti-SLAPP Statute and the Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u201cA SLAPP suit\u2014a strategic lawsuit against public participation\u2014 seeks to chill or punish a party\u2019s exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances. [Citation.] The Legislature enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16\u2014known as the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014to provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rusheen v. Cohen </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1055-1056 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 516, 128 P.3d 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">In considering the application of the anti-SLAPP statute, courts engage in a two-step process. \u201c \u2018First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from'protected activity. ... If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Taus v.

[Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018Only a cause of action that satisfies <em>both </em>prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning <em>and </em>lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Governor Gray Davis Com. </em>v. <em>American Taxpayers Alliance </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 449, 456 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].) Our review of the denial of a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute is de novo. <em>(Soukup </em>v. <em>Law Offices of Herbert Hafif </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 269, fn. 3 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638]; <em>Flatley </em>v. <em>Mauro </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 325 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606] <em>(Flatley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">B. <em>Protected Activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Section 425.16 defines an \u201cact of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u201d covered by the anti-SLAPP statute and subject to an anti-SLAPP motion, as including statements or writings made before a judicial proceeding or made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1), (e).) Thus, statements, writings and pleadings in connection with civil litigation are covered by the anti-SLAPP statute, and that statute does not require any showing that the litigated matter concerns a matter of public interest. <em>(Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope &amp; Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] <em>(Briggs); Healy </em>v. <em>Tuscany Hills Landscape &amp; Recreation Corp. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1, 5 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 547] <em>(Healy).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Section 425.16 is \u201cconstrued broadly, to protect the right of litigants to \u2018 \u201cthe utmost freedom of access to the courts without [the] fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Rubin v.

Centex Real Estate Corp. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 39 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 518], italics omitted.) A later case noted that <em>Edwards </em>\u201cdoes not hold or suggest that a complaint must be drafted before the privilege will apply.\u201d <em>(Aronson v. Kinsella </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 254, 268 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 305].) \u201c[T]he question in <em>Edwards </em>was not \u2018imminentness,\u2019 but remoteness ...[;] \u2018imminency\u2019 is not an issue in the case of a classic demand letter ...[;] the litigation privilege is not conditioned upon an \u2018imminency\u2019 requirement separate from the requirement that prelitigation statements be made in serious and good faith consideration of litigation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Recently, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[a] prelitigation communication is privileged only when it relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Action Apartment Assocation, Inc. v. City of Santa Monica </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1251 [163 P.3d 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Defendant and his law firm represented Metsos in an ongoing dispute with plaintiff concerning the distribution of their father\u2019s assets. During that representation, plaintiff\u2019s attorney threatened to file a lawsuit on her behalf against her brother. In a detailed letter, plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u201capprised\u201d defendant of what would be contained in that lawsuit when filed. In connection with the dispute, the parties agreed to sell one property. During the attempted sale and distribution of that property, plaintiff allegedly instructed Weiss to exclude Metsos\u2019s attorney and defendant from the distribution of documents relevant to the sale of that asset. In response to his exclusion, defendant left the voice mail messages to Weiss in which he accused Weiss and plaintiff of conspiring to defraud Metsos of Metsos\u2019s interest in the asset and stated his intention to take \u201cappropriate action.\u201d In his declaration in support of his anti-SLAPP motion, defendant states that if he and Metsos continued to be excluded from receiving such documents, he would have filed an action to protect Metsos\u2019s interests. Shortly after defendant\u2019s voice mail messages to Weiss, plaintiff filed her action against Metsos concerning the distribution of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Defendant\u2019s voice mail messages to Weiss were statements made in connection with an asset that was the subject of the dispute in which <em>both </em>plaintiff and defendant threatened litigation. In short, the spectre of litigation loomed over all communications between the parties at that time. Thus, the messages concerning the subject of the dispute and threatening appropriate action in that context had to be in anticipation of litigation \u201ccontemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment Association, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Inc. v. City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.) Accordingly, defendant\u2019s communications in issue satisfied his burden under the first step in applying the anti-SLAPP statute by establishing that his conduct was protected activity under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">C. <em>Probability of Prevailing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201c \u2018In order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), a plaintiff responding to an anti-SLAPP motion must \u201c \u2018state[] and substantiate[] a legally sufficient claim.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] Put another way, the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d [Citations.] In deciding the question of potential merit, the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(2)); though the court does not <em>weigh </em>the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence, it should grant the motion if, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim. [Citation.]\u2019 <em>([Wilson </em>v. <em>Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester </em>(2002)] 28 Cal.4th [811,] 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733], original italics.) (See also, e.g., <em>Equilon, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th 53, 63 [section 425.16 \u2018subjects to potential dismissal . . . those causes of action as to which the plaintiff is unable to show a probability of prevailing on the merits [citation], a provision we have read as \u201crequiring the court to determine only if the plaintiff has stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim\u201d \u2019]; <em>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Delfino </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 192 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 106 P.3d 958] [under section 425.16 \u2018the trial court evaluates the merits of the lawsuit using a summary-judgment-like procedure at an early stage of the litigation\u2019].)\u201d <em>(Taus v.

[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365].) Prelitigation statements are protected under section 47 when they are made in connection with a proposed litigation that is \u201ccontemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.\u201d <em>(Action Apartment Association, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">As with section 425.16, courts broadly construe section 47 to protect a litigant\u2019s right to access to the courts without fearing subsequent harassing derivative tort actions. <em>(Healy, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 5; see <em>Flatley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 321-322.) The litigation privilege under section 47 is \u201c \u2018an \u201cabsolute\u201d privilege, and it bars all tort causes of action except a claim of malicious prosecution.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Flatley, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th p. 322.) As noted above, \u201c[t]he privilege has also been held to apply to \u2018statements made prior to the filing of a lawsuit.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>Briggs, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1115 [\u201c \u2018communications preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an action or other official proceeding are within the protection of the litigation privilege of Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b) [citation], . . .\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The privilege in section 47 is \u201crelevant to the second step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive defense plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing. (See, e.g., <em>Kashian v. Harriman </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 926-927 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 576] [where the plaintiff\u2019s defamation action was barred by Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b), the plaintiff cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing under the anti-SLAPP statute]; <em>Dove Audio, Inc. v.

Because we have held that the statements were a protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, they are also privileged under section 47 as statements made in anticipation of litigation \u201ccontemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.\u201d <em>(Action Apartments Assocation, Inc. v. City of Santa Monica, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 1251.) Thus, defendant\u2019s voice mail messages to Weiss are absolutely privileged under section 47. That privilege provides a substantive defense to plaintiff\u2019s slander per se action. <em>(Flatley, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 323.) Plaintiff cannot meet her burden under the second step in applying the anti-SLAPP statute of demonstrating a probability of prevailing\u2014i.e., a \u201c \u2018 \u201cprima facie showing\u201d \u2019 \u201d\u2014in her slander per se action. <em>(Taus v.
