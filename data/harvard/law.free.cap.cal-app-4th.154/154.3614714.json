J .</author>\n<p id=\"A1O\">Two tenants of the Lincoln Place Garden Apartments brought this action against their landlords for a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights under the Ellis Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the action after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>granting defendants\u2019 motion to strike the tenants\u2019 complaint as a SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We address the following issues: (1) Did the landlords\u2019 instigating eviction proceedings against the tenants after the judgment in this action moot the tenants\u2019 appeal or their underlying action for a declaration of rights? (2) Did the landlords establish the tenants\u2019 declaratory rights cause of action \u201carose from\u201d actions by the landlords in furtherance of their constitutional rights of petition or free speech? (3) Did the tenants\u2019 prayer for injunctive relief to prevent \u201cdefendants from evicting plaintiffs from their residence\u201d subject this action to a motion to strike under the SLAPP statute? We answer each of these questions in the negative and therefore reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Frieda and Leslie Marlin are among the last remaining tenants of the Lincoln Place Garden Apartments in the City of Los Angeles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants are the owners and managers of Lincoln Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In March 2005, pursuant to the Ellis Act and a city ordinance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defendants gave notice to the City of Los Angeles they intended to permanently remove 27 Lincoln Place units from the rental market including the unit occupied by the Marlins. At the same time defendants served the Marlins with a notice their unit was being withdrawn from the rental market and that they must vacate their apartment by March 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">A few months after receiving the notice to vacate the Marlins filed a complaint against defendants seeking a declaration of their rights under the Ellis Act. The complaint alleged in relevant part: \u201cA present and actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the plaintiffs and defendants concerning their respective rights and duties in that plaintiffs contend that defendants are not entitled to invoke or rely upon the Ellis Act to evict plaintiffs from their home .... Defendants dispute these contentions and contend that they are entitled to invoke and rely upon the Ellis Act to evict plaintiffs from their home . . . The prayer of the complaint asked the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>among other things, to \u201cdeclare the respective rights, duties, and responsibilities of plaintiffs and defendants under the Ellis Act\u201d and to \u201cenjoin defendants and each of them from evicting plaintiffs from their residence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Defendants responded to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with a SLAPP motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They contended plaintiffs\u2019 complaint arose from defendants\u2019 acts of filing and serving the Ellis Act notices described above as well as from other litigation involving defendants\u2019 right to evict the Lincoln Place tenants and remove the property from the rental market and there is no probability plaintiffs will prevail in their action. For these reasons, defendants argued, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint should be stricken under the SLAPP statute which provides: \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action. Plaintiffs filed a timely appeal. Our review is de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">I. <em>DEFENDANTS\u2019 INSTIGATING EVICTION PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE MARLINS AFTER THE JUDGMENT IN THIS ACTION DID NOT MOOT THE MARLINS\u2019 APPEAL OR THEIR UNDERLYING ACTION FOR A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The ground has shifted considerably since the Marlins filed their original complaint for a declaration of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">While defendants\u2019 SLAPP motion was pending the Marlins filed a first amended complaint, which pleads an additional controversy between the Marlins and defendants: whether defendants should be prohibited from removing their property from the rental market and evicting their tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>under the Ellis Act until they have complied with the relocation and notice provisions contained in the tentative tract map approved for the Lincoln Place redevelopment project. The trial court properly did not consider the Marlins\u2019 amended complaint in ruling on defendants\u2019 SLAPP motion, and its allegations are not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">While this appeal from the dismissal of the Marlins\u2019 action was pending, defendants instituted an unlawful detainer action against the Marlins. Defendants contend their unlawful detainer action moots the Marlins\u2019 declaratory rights action and this appeal because \u201cthe Marlins can attempt to raise their concerns about demolition permit conditions as issues in the [unlawful detainer] proceedings . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Defendants\u2019 instigating unlawful detainer proceedings against the Marlins did not moot the controversy between the parties over the applicability of the Ellis Act, the conditions on the tentative tract map and the city rent control ordinances. Mootness occurs when a case has \u201c \u2018lost that essential character\u2019 \u201d of an existing controversy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A controversy remains between the parties as to their respective rights. Indeed defendants concede this in their statement claiming the Marlins can raise their concerns in the unlawful detainer action. The question is not whether the controversy is moot but where the controversy should be adjudicated: in the Marlins\u2019 declaratory rights action or in defendants\u2019 unlawful detainer action. The parties have not briefed this issue and we express no view on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Furthermore, we have broad discretion to render an opinion in a case which poses issues of broad public interest and which are likely to recur even if an event occurring during the pendency of the appeal might otherwise render the underlying controversy moot.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Leaving aside the merits of the parties\u2019 underlying disputes, this appeal raises important issues concerning the interpretation and application of the SLAPP statute which we discuss in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>parts II. and HI., below. The California Attorney General considers these issues important enough for him to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the Marlins.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, these issues are likely to recur in other proceedings involving disputes between landlords and tenants or public entities such as rent control boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">H. <em>DEFENDANTS FAILED TO SHOW THE MARLINS\u2019 LAWSUIT AROSE FROM ANY ACT OF DEFENDANTS IN FURTHERANCE OF THEIR RIGHT OF PETITION OR FREE SPEECH.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In order for a complaint to be subject to a motion to strike under section 425.16 the defendant must make a threshold showing the complaint entails \u201c[a] <em>cause of action </em>against a person <em>arising from </em>any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the complaint does not meet this criterion it is not subject to a motion to strike and the court never reaches the issue of whether the plaintiff can show a probability of success on the merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Even if we assume filing and serving the Ellis Act notice and the notice to vacate constituted protected petitioning or free speech activity \u201cthe mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, the critical question in a SLAPP motion \u201cis whether the cause of action is <em>based on </em>the defendant\u2019s protected free speech or petitioning activity.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Defendants have fallen victim to the logical fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc\u2014because the notices preceded plaintiffs\u2019 complaint the notices must have caused plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The filing and service of the notices may have triggered plaintiffs\u2019 complaint<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the notices may be evidence in support of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but they were not the cause of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Clearly, the cause of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was defendants\u2019 allegedly wrongful reliance on the Ellis Act as their authority for terminating plaintiffs\u2019 tenancy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Terminating a tenancy or removing a property from the rental market are not activities taken in furtherance of the constitutional rights of petition or free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The opinion in <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Pearl Street, </em>LLC<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Pearl Street) </em>illustrates the difference between filing a notice with a public agency and petitioning the agency. In that case the city\u2019s rent control board believed certain forms a landlord filed with the board were part of a scheme to evade the city\u2019s rent control law and roughly triple the rent for two of the landlord\u2019s apartments. The board filed an action against the landlord for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking a judicial determination of the maximum allowable rent for the two apartments. The landlord filed a SLAPP motion contending the board was attempting to punish it for seeking redress of government through means of the rent control process established by the ordinance for increasing the rental rate of an apartment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action but the Court of Appeal reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In reversing the judgment dismissing the board\u2019s suit as a SLAPP the Court of Appeal was willing to assume the landlord\u2019s filing of the forms necessary to obtain a rent increase was \u201cundertaken by defendants in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech, as that phrase is used in section 425.16\u201d and \u201cthis suit may have been \u2018triggered by\u2019 defendants\u2019 submission of such documents to the Board.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But \u201cit is <em>not </em>true,\u201d the court held, \u201cthat this suit is <em>based on </em>the filing of such papers. . . . <em>This suit is based on the Board\u2019s claim that defendants are charging an illegal rent for units A and </em>C.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c[Defendants were not sued for their conduct in exercising [their] constitutional rights,\u201d the court explained. \u201cThey were sued by the Board to compel their compliance with the provisions of the rent control law.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Similarly, in the present case defendants contend \u201c[t]his lawsuit \u2018arises from\u2019 [their] petitioning activity\u201d because they \u201cutilized administrative channels by filing and serving the Ellis Notice and otherwise satisfying statutory and municipal prerequisites to withdraw rental units . . . including the Marlins\u2019 apartment from the market.\u201d But, as in <em>Pearl Street, </em>the Marlins\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>suit is not based on defendants\u2019 filing and serving of a notice required under the Ellis Act, it is based on the Marlins\u2019 contention \u201cdefendants are not entitled to invoke or rely upon the Ellis Act to evict plaintiffs from their home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Based on this same reasoning we reject defendants\u2019 argument the Marlins\u2019 complaint is a SLAPP because it is somehow\u2014defendants do not explain exactly how\u2014\u201cintertwined\u201d with other litigation involving defendants\u2019 right to evict the Lincoln Place tenants and remove the property from the rental market.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">m. A <em>SLAPP MOTION MUST BE BASED ON </em>A <em>CAUSE OF ACTION, NOTA PRAYER FOR RELIEF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Defendants maintain the Marlins\u2019 prayer for injunctive relief to prevent \u201cdefendants from evicting plaintiffs from their residence\u201d is aimed directly at defendants\u2019 right to petition the government for redress through a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d which is specifically designated an \u201c \u2018act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech\u2019 \u201d in section 425.16, subdivision (e)(1). Here, the judicial proceeding would be an unlawful detainer action to remove the Marlins from their apartment. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">A SLAPP motion lies to strike \u201c[a] cause of action\u201d arising from a person\u2019s act in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201c[A] \u2018cause of action\u2019 is comprised of a \u2018primary right\u2019 of the plaintiff, a corresponding \u2018primary duty\u2019 of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A \u201ccause of action\u201d must be distinguished from the remedy sought: \u201c \u2018The violation of one primary right constitutes a single cause of action, though it may entitle the injured party to many forms of relief, and the relief is not to be confounded with the cause of action, one not being determinative of the other.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> An injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, the SLAPP statute does not apply where it is the prayer for an injunction which arises from an act in furtherance of a person\u2019s right of petition or free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Appellants are awarded their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Woods, J., and Zelon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 22, 2007, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 31, 2007, S156376.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> The Ellis Act, Government Code section 7060 et sequitur, allows landlords who comply with its terms to go out of the rental business by evicting their tenants and withdrawing all units from the market even if doing so would otherwise violate a local rent control ordinance.
