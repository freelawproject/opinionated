On appeal, Fire contends that the judgment should be reversed because the appointment of respondent James H. Baron as receiver for the insured property was void or at least invalid for purposes of recovering punitive damages. Notwithstanding the righteous, histrionic tone of respondent\u2019s brief, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s judgment upholding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">From 1992 to 2001 Dennis Sanfilippo and Carole Vemi were engaged in a joint venture pertaining to property located on Big Talk Court in San Jose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>Under the terms of their written agreement, any disputes were to be settled by arbitration. In 2001 a dispute did arise, and in March they engaged an arbitrator, the Honorable Read Ambler (ret.).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">On May 28, 2001, the property was extensively damaged by a fire. Vemi was insured on the property under a Farmers Insurance Company policy provided by Fire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vemi filed a claim, which was assigned to Gary Corbett, an independent adjuster. Independent adjusters handled claims when in-house adjusters were unavailable, but unlike the latter, independent adjusters had no authority to settle claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In July 2001 the arbitrator reached a decision in Sanfilippo\u2019s favor. In accordance with the parties\u2019 subsequent stipulation, he appointed respondent as receiver to take possession of the property, together with \u201cany and all insurance proceeds relating to past, present, or future claims for damages to the [property] . . . including . . . those settlement proceeds in response to claims made against Farmers Insurance Exchange <em>[sic] </em>Policy No. 91261-54-57.\u201d The order also specifically authorized respondent to restore or sell the property and to \u201cinstitute, prosecute, defend, compromise, intervene in or become a party to such suits, actions or proceedings as may in his reasonable judgment be necessary or proper for the protection, maintenance, operation, preservation or enhancement of the Receivership Estate, or the performance of his obligations pursuant to the terms of this Order . . . .\u201d Respondent was to be compensated at an hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In December 2001 Gregory Sterling, respondent\u2019s associate, wrote to Corbett advising him that respondent had been appointed as receiver to handle the insurance claim. Corbett appeared to welcome the appointment because he had been frustrated that the claim had not progressed. Corbett gave Sterling the names of two \u201capproved contractors\u201d for the purpose of repair, including Double R Construction. Corbett told Sterling that if he and respondent used an approved contractor, processing the claim would be \u201cmuch smoother\u201d and it would be easier to get \u201cfull value\u201d for their insurance claim; but if they selected a contractor that was not on the approved list, it would be more difficult to give them \u201cfull value\u201d for the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Corbett affirmed his recommendation in a followup letter and advised respondent that he was forwarding respondent\u2019s contact information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>Double R Construction. In a subsequent meeting at the property site, Corbett told Sterling that based on Farmers\u2019 experience, Double R would be a \u201cvery good choice.\u201d Sterling made it clear that he and respondent expected to pay for any improvements not covered by the policy, but Corbett suggested that some of those additions might be compensated if some covered repairs were not made. Corbett estimated the total cost of the repairs to be $200,000 or more. He represented to respondent and Sterling that he had \u201cfull authority to settle the claim, and that he was Farmers.\u201d He promised that he would take care of respondent on the claim \u201ccompletely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">At trial Ron Iwasaki, Corbett\u2019s supervisor, testified, as did Suzanne Slater, a former manager of adjusters in the large-loss division, and Sharon Sims, a Northern California zone manager, that there had never been any list of approved contractors for large losses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both Iwasaki and Slater admitted that using the term \u201capproved contractor\u201d could mislead an insured into believing that the contractors had been screened by the insurer and that the insurer was guaranteeing the contractor\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Iwasaki understood that the property was under the management of a receiver and that all payments were to be made to that person. He testified that he treated respondent the same way he would have treated a homeowner. However, Iwasaki \u201cprobably\u201d did not correct Corbett\u2019s misrepresentation to respondent that Double R Construction was on a list of approved contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Based on Corbett\u2019s \u201cvery strong\u201d recommendation and representation about the ease of reimbursement, respondent hired Double R Construction to perform the repairs on the property. Respondent notified Corbett that he intended to hire Double R since it was an approved contractor for Farmers. Respondent added that he expected the insurance proceeds to be \u201cadequate to fully repair the home with the exception of the pool.\u201d Respondent asked Corbett to advise him if his understanding was incorrect; but he received no response to that effect. On March 4, 2002, Sterling wrote to Corbett, asking him to address specific coverage conditions and to verify that certain repair costs would be compensated. Corbett did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Farmers sent respondent a payment of $127,950.88, representing its estimate of the actual cash value of the loss. The company also paid for the removal of asbestos in the damaged house. Additional payments were expected once repairs were completed. Other work, such as city-mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>structural upgrades, became necessary, but when Sterling requested confirmation that the costs would be reimbursed, he received no response from anyone at Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Double R began demolition work in March or April of 2002. The repair did not progress expeditiously, however. By September both respondent and Sterling were \u201cextremely worried.\u201d In mid-July respondent had already paid the contractor $63,361.44 of the amount he had received from Farmers. Around the beginning of October, Sterling expressed his concern to Corbett. He asked Corbett whether there was something he should know about Double R, but Corbett said he could not talk to Sterling about that. No one associated with Farmers informed respondent or Sterling that as early as June 2002 the company had been sending checks to Double R at an address in Arizona. Respondent and Sterling nevertheless decided that Double R had abandoned the job. Sterling called Corbett to obtain additional names from the \u201capproved\u201d list and thereafter solicited bids from other contractors. Eventually, respondent hired Sun Restoration, which completed the reconstruction of the home between January and June of 2003 at a cost of $258,528.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Meanwhile, on November 1, 2002, Sterling received a letter from Corbett stating that his office would \u201caddress\u201d only \u201csupplemental changes required by the Building Department and unit prices for existing line items. Demolition or construction initiated by the previous contractor which was not agreed to in writing by this office will not be addressed.\u201d According to respondent\u2019s expert at trial, this statement amounted to a denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Sterling was \u201ctotally confused and somewhat stunned\u201d by this correspondence, as it was contrary to the promises Corbett had made regarding the process of reimbursement. Later that month he and respondent met with Corbett and another prospective contractor regarding an alternative bid. Corbett was angry about the extent of the demolition that had been done, such as the removal of the roof, even though his recommended contractor, Double R, had performed that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">During this brief meeting respondent asked Corbett how Farmers was going to help recover the money Double R had taken. Corbett, however, got \u201cvery angry\u201d and \u201cpretty aggressive,\u201d insisting that there was \u201cno way\u201d Farmers would pay twice. When respondent suggested that perhaps he should talk to a lawyer, Corbett \u201cblew up,\u201d announced that respondent would not be getting anything more out of him, and walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Respondent initiated this action against Farmers, Corbett, and the Large Loss Center of Excellence on May 13, 2003, alleging breach of an insurance contract, bad faith refusal to pay policy benefits and damages caused by Double R, declaratory relief, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation. Fire\u2019s July 2003 demurrer to respondent\u2019s first amended complaint was sustained and its request to strike a request for punitive damages was granted with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The second amended complaint substituted Fire for Farmers. In the meantime, Sanfilippo filed a petition in superior court to confirm the arbitration award. Vemi stipulated to such an order, which was granted by the court on August 22, 2003. The court confirmed not only the arbitrator\u2019s award but also his 2001 appointment of respondent as receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In February 2005 respondent settled with Corbett for $60,000, and the matter proceeded to trial against Fire. In bifurcated proceedings the jury submitted a special verdict in respondent\u2019s favor on all issues. As to intentional misrepresentation and concealment, it found damages of $60,000. On the questions of breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to pay policy benefits, and bad faith failure to investigate the claim, the jury determined the loss to be approximately $93,462. In the second phase of the proceeding, the jury determined that Fire, both independently and through approval or adoption of Corbett\u2019s conduct, had acted with malice, oppression or fraud. In accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court entered judgment awarding respondent compensatory damages of $96,462<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and punitive damages of $1.5 million. In an amended judgment, the court added attorney fees and costs, for a total award of $2,155,599.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">1. <em>Respondent\u2019s Authority to Litigate as Receiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Fire\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that respondent had no authority to proceed in this action because the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>him as receiver. Because that appointment was \u201cvoid for all purposes,\u201d Fire argues, he was \u201cnot the proper real party in interest\u201d and therefore was not entitled to damages, attorney fees, or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Code of Civil Procedure section 564<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> sets forth the conditions under which a receiver may be appointed. Subdivision (b)(1) of the statute permits an appointment \u201cby the court in which an action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof\u2019 in an action \u201cbetween partners or others jointly owning or interested in any property ... on the application of the plaintiff, or of any party whose right to or interest in the property ... or the proceeds thereof, is probable, and where it is shown that the property ... is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured.\u201d Subdivision (b)(9) broadly permits such appointments in any case in which a receiver is necessary \u201cto preserve the property or rights of any party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Fire contends, citing <em>Marsch </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 238 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 402], that any appointment made by an arbitrator is not specifically authorized by section 564 and therefore is void. In <em>Marsch, </em>as here, a partnership agreement provided for binding arbitration of disputes. The partners had a dispute that was submitted to arbitration, and the trial court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award. The appellate court reversed, holding that section 564 vested the power to appoint a receiver in the superior court and did not extend to arbitrators, even by agreement of the parties. (23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 245-248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Respondent correctly observes that the challenge to the appointment in <em>Marsch </em>was made by a party to the arbitration. He also points out that the appointment would be valid on remand if the trial court determined that an appointment would be warranted. In this case, respondent argues, Fire is not a party entitled to the benefit of the procedures for securing appointment of a receiver set forth in section 1281.8, subdivision (b). Respondent further insists that Sanfilippo and Vemi properly applied for the appointment of respondent and thus substantially complied with the procedures outlined in section 1281.8, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">We need not reach these arguments because we agree with respondent\u2019s last point, that Fire\u2019s challenge to the appointment is precluded by its failure to attack it earlier. Had it done so and prevailed, respondent urges, he \u201cwould have saved in excess of $700,000 in attorney fees . . . [and] [t]he right to pursue the insurance benefits would have reverted to the insure[d], who could have timely pursued [Fire].\u201d Because any action by the insured is now time-barred, respondent suggests, Fire would obtain a windfall by invalidating the appointment, thereby escaping payment of damages for its bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Respondent\u2019s position, though framed as one of \u201cestoppel, ratification, and acquiescence\u201d rather than waiver or forfeiture, has merit. (Cf. <em>Hise v. Superior Court </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 614, 622 [134 P.2d 748] [estoppel to deny validity of appointment, based on failure to make timely objection and affirmative acts recognizing authority of receiver].) While Fire did contest respondent\u2019s standing as a party to assert the first two contract-based causes of action and disputed his right to claim punitive damages, it did not seek dismissal of the lawsuit based on the invalidity of the receivership appointment. Addressing Fire\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint on September 16, 2003, the court recognized the \u201cunusual\u201d procedural posture of the case presented by the arbitrator\u2019s appointment. But the focus of the court at that point was whether the arbitrator had authorized respondent specifically to prosecute this lawsuit. Respondent\u2019s counsel noted that the appointment had been made a court order in August 2003 in the course of confirming the interim award. Counsel for Fire did not contest respondent\u2019s status as a duly appointed receiver; indeed, he conceded that the appointment order gave the receiver the authority to maintain contract-related causes of action arising out of the property itself. Instead, defense counsel\u2019s point was only that respondent was not authorized to pursue \u201cpersonal tort causes of action\u201d because they belonged exclusively to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In a motion to dismiss respondent as a party on October 28, 2005, Fire again challenged respondent\u2019s standing, arguing that \u201cBaron, as a receiver, is a stranger to the insurance contract\u201d and the insured had not made a valid assignment of her causes of action. The trial court, while acknowledging that this argument was \u201cpowerful and seductive,\u201d rejected it, affirming that respondent was proceeding \u201cwith prior court authorization\u201d as receiver, and not as assignee or transferee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also expressed the view that \u201cthe equities require recognition of the capacity of the receiver to proceed as previously authorized, because failure to do so, among other things, could lead to the parties to the arbitration being time barred from prosecuting claims\u2014claims which they relied on the receiver to attend to within the scope of his court[-]conferred authority.\u201d In its answer to the second amended complaint (which was filed one week after the judicial order confirming respondent\u2019s authority to litigate), Fire asserted only that respondent lacked standing to sue because he was not an insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We thus conclude that Fire has forfeited its challenge to the validity of respondent\u2019s appointment by failing to raise it below. We further agree with the trial court that to deem the judicial appointment invalid merely because it occurred through the ratification of the arbitrator\u2019s act would effect an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>injustice not only to respondent but to the insured, who by stipulating to his appointment removed herself early from the pursuit of the policy benefits and of a remedy for the damage caused by Corbett\u2019s misconduct. A major reason the statutory limits are so stringent is that the appointment of a receiver necessarily \u201cmeans the taking of property by the court from one who may turn out to be the rightful owner thereof,\u201d and it may thus \u201cstrike at the very substance of a person\u2019s property rights.\u201d <em>(Takeba v. Superior Court </em>(1919) 43 Cal.App. 469, 475 [185 P. 406]; accord, <em>Marsch, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 247-248.) In this case, however, neither Sanfilippo nor Vemi complained that the appointment of a receiver deprived him or her of possession or control. The rationale underlying the restrictive and cautionary application of section 564 is not applicable in these procedural circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Fire attempts to overcome its untimely opposition by arguing that a void order may be challenged at any time. The order was not void, however, as the court unquestionably had fundamental jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter before it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a trial court has personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, then an order entered in excess of that jurisdiction \u201cremains valid but voidable.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Jackson </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 980, 988 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 365]; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 989 [whether act in excess of jurisdiction and thus voidable is enforced depends in large part on \u201cthe degree of the procedural irregularity and whether the court\u2019s act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Thus, even if the court exceeded its jurisdiction by ratifying and adopting the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, that error does not compel reversal. Nevertheless, the order was not unjustified in the circumstances before the court. Confirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>respondent\u2019s appointment made it a judicial one, and we cannot presume that the order was made without due consideration of the merits of the parties\u2019 joint request.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">2. <em>Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We reach a different conclusion regarding the viability of Fire\u2019s challenge to the punitive damages award. Fire objected to this claim multiple times in the proceedings below. In its July 2003 demurrer to the first amended complaint, Fire contended that respondent lacked standing to maintain the tort causes of action or recover punitive damages because these were \u201cpurely personal\u201d claims that are not assignable under California law. <em>(Murphy v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 937, 942 [132 Cal.Rptr. 424, 553 P.2d 584].) As to these claims the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, as respondent had not established that he had received the arbitrator\u2019s permission to institute the claims against Fire. <em>(Morand </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 347, 352-353 [113 Cal.Rptr. 281].) The next day, October 16, 2003, the arbitrator signed an amended order nunc pro tunc, which more precisely authorized respondent to pursue the claims made against the policy at issue, \u201cincluding but not limited to any suits or actions arising out of the insurance carrier\u2019s handling of such claims including but not limited to the right to institute any action for breach of contract, bad faith, negligence, fraud, concealment, or any other contract or tort cause of action and specifically including the right to recover any and all damages including but not limited to punitive damage.\u201d On October 23, 2003, the trial court confirmed \u201cas an order of this Court\u201d the arbitrator\u2019s clarification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Fire repeated its standing argument in a motion in limine to dismiss respondent as a party, a motion in limine to strike the claim for punitive damages, and its trial brief, all filed on October 28, 2005. In a posttrial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Fire again contended that respondent was not entitled to recover damages on behalf of the insured (Vemi) for \u201cpurely personal tort claims.\u201d Clearly the issue of whether respondent was entitled to seek punitive damages was before the trial court and is therefore properly before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Respondent maintains that he had standing to sue for bad faith and fraud and to recover punitive damages because he served a function analogous to that of a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the court to take possession of the assets of the debtor. Whether respondent was permitted to assert bad faith and fraud is not an issue Fire raises on appeal, and we need not address it. As to respondent\u2019s standing to pursue the remedy of punitive damages, he relies on inapposite authority for litigation of claims existing <em>before </em>the trustee\u2019s (or here, the receiver\u2019s) appointment. (See, e.g., <em>Mosier v. Southern Cal. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number><em>Physicians Ins. Exchange </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1040 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 550] [because fraud action arose before bankruptcy petition was filed, trustee properly prosecuted action on debtor\u2019s behalf];<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Reichert v. General Ins. Co. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 822, 831-832 [69 Cal.Rptr. 321, 442 P.2d 377] [plaintiff\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, not plaintiff, was proper party to assert claim for breach of contract, as claim related back to contract with insured].) In this case the claims for which punitive damages were sought arose after respondent took control of the property and was subjected to Fire\u2019s tortious conduct. In any event, it is unnecessary to decide the extent to which respondent was serving a function like that of a bankruptcy trustee, because we are convinced that respondent\u2019s judicially authorized role encompassed the pursuit of the controverted request for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Fire argues that respondent could not pursue punitive damages because he was the receiver not for Sanfilippo and Vemi personally, but for a limited estate consisting of \u201conly those assets that were subject to the <em>dispute, </em>i.e., the property and the insurance proceeds.\u201d As so limited, the receivership estate \u201ccould not include a punitive damage claim, which is neither \u2018real property\u2019 nor part of the \u2018insurance proceeds\u2019 that were subject to dispute, but a statutory claim requiring proof of a tort violation and malice, oppression, or fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The initial appointment, as Fire observes, encompassed \u201cany and all insurance proceeds relating to past, present or future claims for damages to the Real Property or to personal property of either property that was damaged along with the Real Property by fire or other covered event including, but not limited to, those settlement proceeds in response to claims made against [Fire].\u201d But the subsequent clarification made in response to the sustaining of the demurrer further defined the receiver\u2019s authority to include not only the right to institute the lawsuit against Fire but also \u201cthe right to recover any and all damages <em>including but not limited to punitive damage[s].\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Fire\u2019s description of the receivership estate as being limited to the physical property and insurance proceeds does not undermine the broader scope of the appointment, which conferred a more expansive authority on respondent in order to benefit the receivership estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Fire insists, however, that the appointment was of no legal effect because a claim for punitive damages is personal and not assignable as a matter of law. It points out that the final arbitration award in January 2004 (confirmed by the court in June 2004) referred to the litigation as having been assigned to respondent. Closer examination of the distribution approved by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>reveals, however, that an \u201cassignment\u201d of a personal claim did not take place in the sense urged by Fire, and, as noted earlier, the trial court expressly found that this matter did not involve an assignment of rights. In his final award the arbitrator delineated the distribution of the funds received from sale of the property, settlement proceeds, and other sources. The arbitrator\u2019s phrase \u201cassignment of claims against insurer\u201d was used in the context of defining the compensation for receiver\u2019s service. The arbitrator explained that respondent had been awarded fees and costs in September 2003 \u201cin addition to other consideration (assignment of claims against insurer and judgment against the general contractor).\u201d By way of further explanation, the arbitrator incorporated an attached breakdown of respondent\u2019s expenses, and stated that \u201c[ajfter the Receiver\u2019s fees and costs are paid from the funds held by the Receiver, there should be a balance available for distribution from the sale of the Property of $75,268.35.\u201d There were other assets in the receivership account, leaving $86,612.02 available for distribution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The receiver was to distribute \u201call remaining funds, consistent with this final award, to [Sanfilippo\u2019s counsel].\u201d And \u201cany recovery and/or settlement in the lawsuit against [Fire] which was assigned to the Receiver, which would have otherwise been payable to Ms. Vemi, shall be paid to Mr. Sanfilippo . . . .\u201d The distribution outlined by the arbitrator and adopted by the court indicates that it was the receivership estate that was to recover damages. Whatever amount respondent was permitted to retain was in the nature of compensation, not the product of a personal assignment of an insured\u2019s legal rights. Thus, neither the facts found by the trial court nor the cases on which Fire relies support its premise that an assignment took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Fire notes that an earlier order by the arbitrator (which was adopted by the court) called for distribution of any recovered damages to respondent, Sanfilippo, and Vemi such that respondent would receive 80 percent of any amount recovered <em>after </em>paying himself $60,000 from the cash in the receivership estate, repaying himself for his costs and attorney fees, paying himself an additional $40,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In Fire\u2019s view, this aspect of the order demonstrates that respondent is an assignee. Although it is impossible to discern from the record whether respondent was permitted <em>personally </em>to retain more than $1.4 million, as Fire represents, that question is not relevant to the issue of whether Fire\u2019s conduct made it liable for punitive damages, and Fire has correctly refrained from raising it as a separate challenge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>was not acting as an assignee and Fire does not further contest the amount awarded as excessive,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there is no basis for overturning this part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">3. Brandt <em>Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Respondent seeks attorney fees under <em>Brandt v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 813 [210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796] for defending the judgment on appeal. Although his argument and citation of authority are late in coming, having been produced only a day before oral argument, Fire has not complained about untimeliness. Taking the initiative in its reply brief, Fire pointed out that the Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on the question of whether appellate attorney fees are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">In <em>Brandt </em>our Supreme Court resolved a conflict among the Courts of Appeal by holding that an insured may recover <em>as damages </em>the attorney fees he or she has incurred to obtain the benefits due under a policy when the insurer has wrongfully refused to compensate the insured for the loss. The court emphasized that the recoverable fees \u201cmay not exceed the amount attributable to the attorney\u2019s efforts to obtain the rejected payment due on the insurance contract.\u201d <em>(Brandt v. Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 819.) The <em>Brandt </em>holding was reaffirmed in <em>Cassim </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 812 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 94 P.3d 513] (explaining proper method of calculating recoverable fees incurred under contingent-fee contract) and most recently in <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Five Star Dye House, Inc. </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1252 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 362, 137 P.3d 192] (assignee of insured may recover <em>Brandt </em>fees). As the parties tacitly recognize, the Supreme Court has not expressly taken a position on the extension of <em>Brandt </em>to legal fees the insured has incurred in defending a judgment on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Fire directs our attention to two decisions, <em>Burnaby v. Standard Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 787 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 326] and <em>Shade Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Innovative Products Sales &amp; Marketing, Inc. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847 [93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 364], in which such fees were denied. The <em>Shade </em>court did not independently decide the question of attorney fees on appeal, but only cited <em>Burnaby </em>without analysis, denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for <em>Brandt </em>fees in a footnote. (78 Cal.App.4th at p. 909, fn. 17.) In <em>Burnaby, </em>the appellate court denied attorney fees on appeal, relying in large part on the dissenting opinion in <em>Brandt. </em>After examining the amount of damages awarded by the jury at trial, the court noted that \u201cfor all we know,\u201d the insured might have already recovered fees attributable to the attorney\u2019s efforts to recover the payment due under his policy. (Burnaby, <em>supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 793.) The court emphasized that <em>Brandt </em>did not specifically address the question of whether attorney fees on appeal are recoverable. It rejected the language of the disposition in <em>Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1072, 1101 [234 Cal.Rptr. 835], where the court allowed attorney fees on appeal without analysis. In the <em>Burnaby </em>court\u2019s view, \u201cthere is nothing in <em>Brandt </em>to suggest that the Supreme Court intended that an additional item of <em>damages </em>be awarded following an insured\u2019s successful effort to repel an insurer\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>(Burnaby, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Respondent answers Fire by citing <em>Downey, </em>along with <em>Track Mortgage Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crusader Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 857, 871 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 228] and <em>McGregor v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 2004) 369 F.3d 1099. <em>Track </em>(as Fire pointed out in oral argument) did not engage in an analysis of the recoverability of appellate attorney fees. <em>McGregor </em>was a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Recognizing the conflict between <em>Downey </em>and <em>Track </em>on the one hand and <em>Burnaby </em>and <em>Shade </em>on the other, the federal court rejected the reasoning and conclusion of <em>Burnaby </em>as unpersuasive. The court concluded that if the California Supreme Court were to address the issue, it would allow the fees the insured incurred to defend the jury\u2019s verdict against the insurer\u2019s appeal. \u201cIn this case, McGregor proved bad faith to the jury, but could not obtain the benefits due her until she had successfully defended the jury\u2019s verdict against Paul Revere\u2019s appeal. Because the fees McGregor incurred on appeal were necessary to obtaining her policy benefits, the logic of <em>Brandt </em>necessarily implies that they should be recoverable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We agree with the Ninth Circuit in <em>McGregor </em>that attorney fees the insured has incurred to defend a judgment against the insurer\u2019s appeal are a logical extension of the fees incurred in pursuing the recovery in the trial court. The collection of the benefits due is not complete when the insurer resists the judgment by challenging the judgment on appeal. Thus, to the extent that appellate attorney fees reflect the continuation of services performed to obtain the rejected payment of policy benefits, they should be recoverable under the rationale of <em>Brandt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondent is entitled to attorney fees for this appeal in an amount to be determined by the trial court, consistently with <em>Brandt v. Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pages 817-819. The parties shall otherwise bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Rushing, P. J., and Premo, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\"> The appellate briefs of both parties contain factual assertions with references to pages in the record that do not support their statements and, in respondent\u2019s brief, statements highlighted in boldface without any record references at all. The parties\u2019 carelessness amounts to a disregard of California Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(C) and rule 8.204(a)(2)(C). We will disregard any factual references that violate these provisions. We cannot, however, ignore respondent\u2019s unprofessional tone, including rhetorical queries, a fawning portrayal of the arbitrator as a \u201cpractical, savvy former trial judge,\u201d and the suggestion that this court \u201cshould be similarly outraged\u201d by Fire\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\"> Fire Insurance Exchange is an affiliate member of the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\"> Real property losses exceeding $75,000 were handled by a separate department, the Large Loss Center of Excellence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b876-9\"> This amount consists of $93,462 for insurance contract claims and $3,000 for fraudulent misrepresentation.

In its motion in limine to preclude testimony by respondent that he was acting for the benefit of the receivership estate, Fire argued that such evidence would give the jury the false impression that Sanfilippo and Vemi would be the primary beneficiaries of any recovery and that respondent would receive only an hourly fee for his time. Fire wanted the jury to hear that respondent and Sterling would be receiving 90 percent of any settlement proceeds from the litigation. But it did not argue that respondent lacked the legal capacity to retain personally 80 percent of the $1,500,000 awarded, and respondent did not have occasion to defend or explain the award on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b883-10\"> Fire did complain in its motion for a new trial that the amount awarded was grossly excessive, based on the disparity between the punitive and compensatory awards and on the amount of evidence regarding Fire\u2019s conduct and the harm caused.
