At the conclusion of these proceedings, Mesdaq\u2019s objections to the taking of his property were overruled, and he was awarded compensation in the amount of $7,785,131.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Both Mesdaq and the Agency appeal. The Agency contends that the compensation award must be reversed because it is based on (1) an erroneous valuation date; (2) speculative expert testimony as to lost business goodwill; and (3) an improper award of damages based on the Agency\u2019s issuance of an environmental remediation notice under the Polanco Redevelopment Act (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33459 et seq. (Polanco Act)). In addition, the Agency contends that the trial court erred in awarding Mesdaq $1,230,714.41 in litigation expenses under Code of Civil Procedure section 1250.410, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">As discussed in greater detail below, we agree with the Agency\u2019s contentions. With respect to the first issue, our Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Mt. San Jacinto Community College Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 648, 659 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 752, 151 P.3d 1166] <em>(Mt. San Jacinto) </em>compels the conclusion that the trial court erroneously set the date of valuation as the date of trial, rather than the earlier date of deposit, for purposes of the jury trial on compensation. On the second issue, we agree with the Agency that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting expert testimony that relied upon a goodwill valuation methodology that did not value Mesdaq\u2019s actual business but instead valued a hypothetical business operating at Mesdaq\u2019s facility. Third, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing the jury to assess $77,823.83 of precondemnation damages based on the Agency\u2019s issuance of a Polanco Act notice was erroneous. As a result of these determinations, the jury\u2019s compensation award must be vacated and relitigated. We reverse as well the award of attorney fees to Mesdaq, which was based, in substantial part, on the now vacated award.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">On appeal, Mesdaq contends that the trial court erred by failing to find that the Agency\u2019s action in taking his property constituted a \u201cgross abuse\u201d of the Agency\u2019s discretion and was not in the public interest, and by limiting the evidence that he was permitted to introduce in his challenge to the Agency\u2019s actions. We need not reach these contentions because, by statute, Mesdaq has waived his appellate right to challenge the taking of his property by consenting to the withdrawal of the Agency\u2019s deposit of \u201cprobable compensation\u201d by his lender, First National Bank, to pay off Mesdaq\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">In 2001, Mesdaq purchased a 5,000-square-foot commercial property at 502 J Street in the Gaslamp District of San Diego for $1.3 million. In 2003, after improving the property, Mesdaq opened the Gran Havana\u2014a coffee shop and cigar store.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">On April 27, 2004, the Agency adopted a \u201cresolution of necessity,\u201d which resolved that the public interest and necessity required that Mesdaq\u2019s property be acquired through an exercise of the power of eminent domain, so that a planned 40,000-square-foot hotel could be erected on his and the adjoining properties. Three days later, the Agency filed a complaint in eminent domain with respect to Mesdaq\u2019s property. In concert with its complaint, the Agency deposited $3,091,000 as probable compensation for the property and requested an order for possession. After a hearing, the trial court denied Mesdaq\u2019s initial objections to the Agency\u2019s right to take his property and granted possession to the Agency. At Mesdaq\u2019s request, however, the court delayed actual transfer of title to allow Mesdaq to continue operating his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The court then held three separate trials with respect to the proposed taking; (1) a court trial regarding whether the Agency engaged in a \u201cgross abuse of discretion\u201d (\u00a7 1245.255, subd. (b)) in adopting its resolution of necessity and whether the taking was for a public use; (2) a court trial regarding Mesdaq\u2019s request for precondemnation damages under <em>Klopping v. City of Whittier </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 39 [104 Cal.Rptr. 1, 500 P.2d 1345] <em>(Klopping); </em>and finally (3) a jury trial to determine \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the taking of the property. At the conclusion of the first two proceedings, the trial court determined that the Agency had not engaged in a gross abuse of discretion; that the property was taken for a public use; and that the Agency had acted unreasonably by issuing a Polanco Act notice during precondemnation proceedings, and the jury could include damages for that conduct in calculating its compensation award. In the jury trial, Mesdaq was awarded $7,785,131.83 in compensation for the taking. The award consisted of (1) loss of the fair market value of the property of $4,250,000; (2) loss of business goodwill of $3,361,208; (3) loss of furniture and equipment worth $96,100; and (4) precondemnation damages of $77,823.83. The trial court subsequently awarded Mesdaq attorney fees and costs in the amount of $1,230,714.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">THE AGENCY\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"Aip\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Erred by Ruling That the Date of Valuation of the Property Was the Date of Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The Agency contends that the trial court improperly disregarded the statutory requirement that when probable compensation is deposited, the date of valuation for purposes of determining any compensation award is the date of the deposit, not the date of trial. We agree with the Agency under the authority of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th 648) and consequently reverse the jury\u2019s award of compensation to Mesdaq.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">1. <em>Applicable Statutory and Constitutional Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The starting point for any analysis of eminent domain law is the California Constitution, which states in article I, section 19: \u201cPrivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation, ascertained by a jury unless waived, has first been paid to, or into court for, the owner. The Legislature may provide for possession by the condemnor following commencement of eminent domain proceedings upon deposit in court and prompt release to the owner of money determined by the court to be the probable amount of just compensation.\u201d The federal Constitution also contains a provision regarding eminent domain, stating that private property shall not \u201cbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The Legislature has promulgated a \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d to implement article I, section 19 of the California Constitution, known as the Eminent Domain Law (\u00a7 1230.010 et seq.). <em>(Escondido Union School Dist. </em>v. <em>Casa Sue\u00f1os De Oro, Inc. </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 944, 959 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 89] <em>(Escondido Union); </em>see \u00a7 1230.010 et seq.; cf. <em>Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 656 [\u201cThere is a \u2018strong presumption in favor of the Legislature\u2019s interpretation of a provision of the Constitution\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">The Eminent Domain Law delineates two different types of proceedings for the governmental taking of property. The first is a standard condemnation proceeding in which the public agency does not take possession and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>title to condemned property until after a jury has awarded just compensation; thus, the \u201ctaking\u201d and the \u201ccompensation\u201d are contemporaneous and occur at the conclusion of court proceedings. Until then, the property owner bears the risk of loss to the property. <em>(Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 414, 417-418 [14 Cal.Rptr. 170]; \u00a7 1268.030.) The second procedure, a quick-take proceeding, allows a public agency to take possession of a condemned property and the property owner to obtain the probable compensation for that property well in advance of the termination of court proceedings.  Under section 1255.010, a public entity may accomplish an early taking of property by making a deposit of the \u201cprobable amount of compensation\u201d at any time prior to entry of judgment. The amount of the deposit must be based on an appraisal of an expert qualified to express an opinion as to the value of the property and must be supported by a written statement of, or summary of the basis for, the appraisal. (\u00a7 1255.010, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a deposit of probable compensation has been made, the court may order that possession of the property be transferred to the condemner, after considering any opposition from the owner of the property and making certain findings regarding the public entity\u2019s legal right to take the property and the relative hardships that would befall the parties were title not transferred until after legal proceedings are completed. (\u00a7 1255.410.) Once the deposit is made, the property owner can apply to withdraw \u201call or any portion of the amount deposited,\u201d and the court \u201cshall order the amount requested in the application, or such portion of that amount as the applicant is entitled to receive, to be paid to the applicant.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1255.210, 1255.220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">While the valuation date in standard condemnation proceedings \u201c \u2018is either the date of commencement of proceedings, or of commencement of trial (\u00a7\u00a7 1263.120, 1263.130), a different rule applies in quick-take situations. There, the land is to be valued as of the date of the deposit of estimated value which permits an order for early possession. (\u00a7 1263.110.)\u2019 \u201d <em>(Escondido Union, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 960, quoting <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Gilmore </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 790, 800-801 [214 Cal.Rptr. 904, 700 P.2d 794]; cf. <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. of So. California </em>v. <em>Campus Crusade for Christ, Inc. </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 954, 963 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 623, 161 P.3d 1175] <em>(Metropolitan Water) </em>[\u201cOn December 23, 1996, MWD deposited funds into the State Treasury, thereby setting the date of valuation\u201d].) These valuation provisions \u201c \u2018give effect to the fact that, except for defenses to the exercise of eminent domain, a landowner in California is permanently deprived of all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>Ms rights in property sought by a public agency when the agency exercises its option to deposit estimated value and obtain early possession for the intended public use.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Escondido Union, </em>at p. 960, quoting <em>Gilmore, </em>at p. 801; see \u00a7 1263.110 [if the public entity \u201cdeposits the probable compensation in accordance with\u201d the statutory procedures, \u201cthe date of valuation is the date on which the deposit is made\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Additional \u201cstatutory procedural safeguards\u201d apply to the determination of probable compensation in quick-take proceedings. <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 660.) For example, at any time after a deposit has been made, the trial court shall, upon motion of any party with an interest in the property, \u201cdetermine or redetermine whether the amount deposited is the probable amount of compensation that will be awarded in the proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.030, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In ruling on the motion, the \u201ccourt may order the plaintiff to increase the deposit or may deny the plaintiff possession of the property until the amount deposited has been increased to the amount specified in the order\u201d; or if possession has already transferred \u201corder the amount deposited to be increased to the amount determined to be the probable amount of compensation,\u201d and if the plaintiff does not comply, dismiss the action and award litigation costs and damages to the defendant. (\u00a7 1255.030, subds. (b), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">2. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The Agency employed the quick-take procedures under the Eminent Domain Law in the instant case. On April 30, 2004, the Agency filed, along with its complaint in eminent domain and application for an order of possession, a \u201cRequest for Deposit.\u201d The Agency included with its filing a \u201cnotice of deposit and summary of the basis for the appraisal\u201d and attached the appraisal reports of two certified real estate appraisers valuing Mesdaq\u2019s property at over $3 million. Mesdaq objected to the application for possession, contending that his objections to the Agency\u2019s right to take his property must be heard before any transfer of possession, and informing the court that he has \u201can active, thriving business, and his revenues increase every month.\u201d Mesdaq also objected that the Agency was not entitled to possession because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>the deposit was not sufficient in that it included a deduction for \u201cenvironmental remediation\u201d and did not include compensation for lost goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">At a hearing on these contentions, the trial court implicitly found that the amount of the deposit was sufficient and postponed its decision on the Agency\u2019s request for an order of possession. At the subsequent hearing, the trial court granted Mesdaq\u2019s request to delay decision on the Agency\u2019s request for possession until December 28, 2004, to enable it to first rule on Mesdaq\u2019s objections to the taking. The court then issued an order that: \u201cAGENCY shall make a deposit of probable compensation with the County Treasury in the amount of $3,091,000,\u201d at which time, pursuant to section 1255.410, it would be empowered to take exclusive possession of the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mesdaq did not file a motion seeking determination or redetermination of the deposit amount under section 1255.030, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Immediately prior to trial, the court determined that the date of trial, not the statutorily determined date of deposit, would be the date of valuation. The court reasoned rising property values and delays in concluding the proceedings necessitated a later valuation date to enforce the constitutional mandate of just compensation, citing <em>Saratoga Fire Protection Dist. </em>v. <em>Hackett </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 895, 905-906 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 696] (holding that where necessary to enforce the California Constitution\u2019s requirement of just compensation for a taking, courts can disregard statutory eminent domain requirements). The parties and the trial court recognized that the court\u2019s ruling on the date of valuation was a \u201ccritical issue\u201d for purposes of determining the compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">3. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Disregarding Section 1255.010 in Setting the Date of Valuation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We begin our analysis by noting that the factual and procedural posture of the instant case is indistinguishable in any salient respect from that recently considered by our Supreme Court in <em>Mt. San Jacinto. </em>In that case, the condemner deposited the probable amount of compensation supported by an appraisal, and the deposit was deemed sufficient \u201cprobable compensation\u201d by the trial court. <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 662.) The trial court nevertheless subsequently ruled that given increasing property values, the statutory date of valuation should not control and that the date of valuation would be the date of trial, resulting in a significant increase in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>compensation awarded. The Court of Appeal reversed, and our Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In evaluating contentions virtually identical to those raised here, our high court recognized that in certain circumstances, as in the <em>Saratoga </em>case relied on by the trial court, a court may deem a statutory provision regulating eminent domain \u201cunconstitutional as applied,\u201d and disregard the provision in favor of an alternative procedure that ensures adequate compensation. <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 661.) The court clarified, however, that such action is not called for in a quick-take proceeding where a public entity has made a deposit of probable compensation for the property. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 661, 662 [emphasizing that \u201cit is of critical importance that <em>Saratoga </em>was a straight condemnation proceeding where there was no deposit of probable compensation before trial\u201d and distinguishing <em>Kirby Forest Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 1, 17 [81 L.Ed.2d 1, 104 S.Ct. 2187] on same grounds]; <em>City of Santa Clarita v. NTS Technical Systems </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 264, 273 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 244] <em>(NTS </em>Technical) [rejecting reliance on <em>Saratoga </em>where that case was \u201cfactually inapplicable for the reasons that it was a straight condemnation, not a quick-take action and, unlike here, there was no deposit of probable compensation\u201d].) In a quick-take proceeding, the constitutional requirement that an owner receive \u201cjust compensation\u201d does not support a court\u2019s decision to disregard the statutory mandate because, under the state Constitution itself, \u201cjust compensation\u201d is made available to the owner at the time of the deposit. <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, </em>at p. 662.) Consequently, in the words of our Supreme Court, \u201c[n]o credible reason exists to invalidate the statutory date of valuation . . . when a deposit was made before trial and the owner had access to the money at that time.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Mesdaq contends that <em>Mt. San Jacinto </em>is distinguishable on two grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, he argues that in <em>Mt. San Jacinto, </em>\u201cthere was a judicial determination that the amount deposited was probable compensation,\u201d and in Mesdaq\u2019s case \u201cthe Agency did <em>not </em>seek such a determination\u201d and instead \u201ctook a calculated gamble in not filing such a motion.\u201d This argument fails because it misconstrues both the statutory framework and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>Under the quick-take statutory framework, once the Agency, in accordance with section 1255.010, deposited its estimate of probable compensation and supported that estimate with expert appraisals and a written summary of the basis for the appraisal (\u00a7 1255.010, subd. (b)), it was not required to make any further motion seeking a determination that its deposit was adequate. Having followed the <em>procedural </em>requirements of section 1255.010, the Agency triggered section 1263.110, which commands that \u201cif the plaintiff deposits the probable compensation\u201d in accordance with section 1255.010, \u201cthe date of valuation is the date on which the deposit is made.\u201d (\u00a7 1263.110, subd. (a).) Contrary to Mesdaq\u2019s contention, this valuation provision is not conditioned upon a trial court finding that the deposit was adequate; it applies <em>unless </em>\u201cthe court determines pursuant to Section 1255.030 that the probable amount of compensation exceeds the amount previously deposited.\u201d (\u00a7 1263.110, subd. (b).) Here, the trial court never made such a determination, and indeed Mesdaq never requested it do so by moving under section 1255.030 for a determination of the deposit\u2019s adequacy. (\u00a7 1255.030 [conditioning trial court determination of adequacy of deposit \u201cupon motion ... of any party\u201d]; see <em>NTS Technical, supra, 131 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 273-274 [rejecting contention that deposit date was not appropriate date of valuation because \u201cif appellants believed that the \u2018probable compensation\u2019 was an amount greater than the original deposit, they could have made a motion for redetermination of the appropriate amount of deposit, which they elected not to do\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Mesdaq\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Mt. San Jacinto </em>are particularly unconvincing because despite Mesdaq\u2019s failure to properly invoke section 1255.030, the trial court nevertheless considered his informal challenges to the adequacy of the deposit and rejected them, thereby placing this case squarely within the holding of <em>Mt. San Jacinto. </em>As noted earlier, the trial court, in fact, found that the Agency\u2019s deposit was adequate, at first tentatively at a hearing addressing that issue and then definitively in a subsequent written order that the \u201cAGENCY shall make a deposit of probable compensation with the County Treasury in the amount of $3,091,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Mesdaq\u2019s second argument is that <em>Mt. San Jacinto </em>does not apply because the case \u201cdoes not speak at all to the effect of . . . section 1263.130.\u201d Mesdaq contends section 1263.130 controls here because it separately sets the date of valuation as the date of trial if the \u201cissue of compensation is not brought to trial within one year after the commencement of the proceeding\u201d and any delay was not the fault of the defendant. (\u00a7 1263.130.) This argument fails because section 1263.130 is explicitly \u201c[s]ubject to Section 1263.110\u201d\u2014 the provision that sets the date of valuation as the date of deposit in a quick-take procedure. Thus, as the Law Revision Commission comment to the statute makes clear, section 1263.130 establishes the date of valuation only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>\u201cwhere that date is not established by an earlier deposit (Section 1263.110).\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 19A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1982 ed.) foll. \u00a7 1263.130, p. 18.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In sum, <em>Mt. San Jacinto </em>is not distinguishable and we must therefore follow our Supreme Court\u2019s unambiguous instruction that: \u201cWhere, as here, a deposit of probable compensation is made, and the trial court determines that the deposit equals or exceeds the probable amount of the owner\u2019s just compensation, the property <em>must </em>be valued on the date of the deposit.\u201d <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 666, italics added; see also <em>NTS Technical, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.4th at p. 273 [trial court properly ruled that date of valuation was date of deposit even though condemner later voluntarily increased deposit to more accurately reflect probable compensation].) The trial court, thus, erred in disregarding the statutory requirement under section 1263.110 that the date of valuation is the date of deposit and the award of just compensation, which is based on the erroneous valuation date, must be reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Erred in Permitting Speculative Testimony Regarding the Value of Lost Goodwill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The Agency contends that the trial court also erred by allowing an expert witness to testify to his conclusion that Mesdaq lost over $3.3 million in foregone business goodwill by virtue of condemnation. The Agency contends the expert\u2019s calculations, and thus his testimony, did not represent the goodwill actually lost based on the taking of Mesdaq\u2019s business, but rather represented speculative goodwill lost for a hypothetical alternative business.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">1. <em>Mesdaq\u2019s Expert Testimony Regarding Lost Business Goodwill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Mesdaq presented an expert, Nevin Sanli, to testify regarding the business goodwill lost as a result of the taking of Mesdaq\u2019s business. Prior to Sanli\u2019s testimony, the trial court granted the Agency\u2019s in limine motion precluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>any testimony as to lost goodwill that was based not on Mesdaq\u2019s actual operations but rather on hypothetical uses of the property. Immediately prior to and throughout Sanli\u2019s testimony there were objections and subsequent discussions between counsel and the court regarding the implications of the court\u2019s in limine ruling. During these discussions, Sanli and Mesdaq\u2019s counsel assured the court that Sanli\u2019s testimony solely concerned the facilities and operations that currently existed, and consequently the court permitted Sanli to testify. The court emphasized, however, that \u201chypothetical restaurant evidence is not coming in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">At trial, Sanli testified that Mesdaq lost over $3.3 million in business goodwill as a result of the taking of the Gran Havana\u2014a business Sanli characterized as an \u201ceating and drinking establishment\u201d (as opposed to \u201ca restaurant\u201d) that sold \u201ccigars and . . . nonrestaurant items,\u201d as well as hot and cold beverages and premade food items, such as pastries, sandwiches and salads.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Sanli explained that in reaching his opinion, he attempted to determine the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the business, which he defined as the \u201chighest price on the date of valuation,\u201d in light of \u201call uses of the facility\u201d to which it is \u201creasonably adaptable\u201d\u2014in essence, the value of a business at Mesdaq\u2019s location that engaged in the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of Mesdaq\u2019s existing facilities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Sanli relied on the discounted cash flow methodology, projecting Mesdaq\u2019s future profits and then discounting those profits to a present value. To project future profits (essentially, projected gross sales minus projected expenses), Sanli first reviewed the existing financial statements for the almost three years the Gran Havana had been in operation, noting that 2003 (annualized) sales were $676,000; 2004 sales were $947,000; and 2005 (annualized) sales were $1,154,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sanli then projected future sales by creating \u201crepresentative\u201d income statements for years 2005 and 2006. Instead of simply relying on 2005\u2019s actual annualized sales of just over $1 million for purposes of valuation, he projected 2005 sales to be $3.1 million. Sanli acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>that \u201cmy projections\u201d were the reason sales jumped from $1 million to $3 million in 2005, \u201cnot something [Mesdaq] did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Sanli arrived at the 2005 figure by breaking down the potential sales into approximately $1.3 million in projected nonrestaurant sales and approximately $1.7 million in projected restaurant sales. While the nonrestaurant sales were tied to Mesdaq\u2019s historical sales, Sanli explained the restaurant sales projections were not, but rather were a product of the number of seats that Mesdaq had available multiplied by the median sales per seat in a comparably sized California restaurant: $9,000 in food sales and $2,140 in beverage sales.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Utilizing a projected growth rate, Sanli next determined that 2006 sales (restaurant and nonrestaurant) would grow to $3.25 million, with sales plateauing at that figure for the foreseeable future. Sanli freely acknowledged the 2005 and 2006 calculations were not grounded in historical data but were based on \u201c[w]hat the business would have done with a better use ... of its resources,\u201d and were obtained by \u201cmaximizing sales\u201d at the Gran Havana.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">At the conclusion of Sanli\u2019s testimony, the court denied the Agency\u2019s motion to strike the testimony, and later denied the Agency\u2019s request for a new trial on the ground that the testimony was based on speculative calculations. The court recognized that the admission of Sanli\u2019s testimony was a \u201cclose call\u201d but determined that it was too late to strike the testimony. The court stated: \u201cI welcome the Court of Appeal to scrutinize this and sort it out rather than have me mess with it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">2. <em>Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">By statute, the owner of a business on a condemned property is entitled, after establishing certain preconditions, to be compensated for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>\u201closs of goodwill\u201d that results from a taking.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1263.510, subd. (a).) The statute defines \u201c \u2018goodwill\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location, reputation for dependability, skill or quality, and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage.\u201d (\u00a7 1263.510, subd. (b).) Compensation for loss of \u201c \u2018business goodwill\u2019 \u201d is a statutory, not constitutional, requirement. <em>(Barthelemy v. Orange County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 558, 566 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 575] <em>(Barthelemy).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The statute does not provide any guidance as to how the value of lost goodwill should be calculated. Consequently, the courts have recognized that \u201cthere is no single method by which to measure goodwill\u201d <em>(Barthelemy, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 567) and that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[e]ach case must be determined on its own facts and circumstances <em>{Redevelopment Agency of San Diego </em>v. <em>Attisha </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 357, 368 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 126].) Nevertheless, the evidence presented to a jury regarding lost goodwill \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust be such as legitimately establishes value\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Attisha, </em>at p. 368) and \u201cgenerally represents the present value of the anticipated profits of the business.\u201d <em>(Barthelemy, </em>at p. 567; see <em>People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Leslie </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 918, 922 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 252] [\u201cGoodwill may be measured by the capitalized value of the net income or profits of a business or some similar method of calculating present value of anticipated profits\u201d].) In other words, while there are no explicit statutory requirements regarding an expert\u2019s use of a particular methodology for valuing lost goodwill, the expert\u2019s methodology must provide a fair estimate of <em>actual </em>value and cannot be based on hypothetical or speculative uses of a condemned business. (See <em>County of San Diego v. Rancho Vista Del Mar, Inc. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1046, 1059 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 675] <em>(Rancho Vista Del Mar) </em>[\u201ca property owner may not value his property based upon its use for a projected special purpose or for a hypothetical business\u201d]; <em>City of Stockton v. Albert Brocchini Farms, Inc. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 193, 198 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 662] [\u201cwhen a valuation expert employs an unsanctioned methodology, the opinion may be excluded in part or in whole in the discretion of the trial court\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In addition, a trial court has a special obligation to oversee the admission of expert testimony and, where an objection has been made, \u201cshall\u201d exclude \u201ctestimony in the form of an opinion that is based in whole or in significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an opinion.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 803.) A challenge to the trial court\u2019s admission or rejection of expert testimony regarding the calculation of lost goodwill is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Clauser/Wells Partnership </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1073 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In the instant case, we agree with the Agency that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Sanli\u2019s testimony regarding the value of goodwill lost by virtue of the taking of the Gran Havana to be presented to the jury. The trial court was obligated to exclude the testimony under Evidence Code section 801 and pursuant to its role of \u201climiting the permissible arena in condemnation trials.\u201d <em>(Sacramento, etc. Drainage Dist. ex rel. State Reclamation Bd. v. Reed </em>(1963) 215 Cal.App.2d 60, 69 [29 Cal.Rptr. 847] <em>(Reed) </em>[\u201cTo say that all objections to [an expert\u2019s] reasons go to weight, not admissibility, is to minimize judicial responsibility for limiting the permissible arena in condemnation trials. The responsibility for defining the extent of compensable rights is that of the courts\u201d]; see <em>City of San Diego v. Sobke </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 379, 395 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 9] <em>(Sobke) </em>[same]; Evid.

(\u00a7 1263.510, subd. (b).) Under this definition, a legal methodology for valuing lost goodwill in the instant case would include any valid measurement of the future anticipated profits at the Gran Havana. <em>(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Muller </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 263, 271 [203 Cal.Rptr. 772, 681 P.2d 1340] <em>(Muller) </em>[\u201cgoodwill may be measured by the capitalized value of the net income or profits of a business or by some similar method of calculating the present value of anticipated profits\u201d]; cf. <em>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority v.

Mesdaq\u2019s expert, however, did not calculate the value of anticipated profits at the Gran Havana, but rather valued anticipated profits of a different business\u2014a hypothetical business that <em>could </em>have existed on the Gran Havana\u2019s site had the business owner better utilized the facility, or in Sanli\u2019s words, \u201c[w]hat [Mesdaq\u2019s] business would have done with a better use ... of its resources . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Sanli\u2019s valuation of an idealized version of what Mesdaq\u2019s business should have been turned the principles of section 1263.510\u2014a desire to compensate a business owner for the unique attributes of a condemned business\u2014on its head by valuing not the particular characteristics of Mesdaq\u2019s business, but those of a better, maximized business. As Sanli explained, his calculations of \u201crepresentative\u201d restaurant income for 2005 and 2006 (the basis for the future income stream that would then be discounted to determine present value of anticipated profits) were related to Mesdaq\u2019s <em>actual business </em>operation only by virtue of the classification of the business as a \u201crestaurant\u201d and by reference to the number of available seats. Sanli did not determine whether Mesdaq was actually filling all of his seats or how much <em>Gran Havana </em>earned per seat, but simply multiplied the per-seat sales of a hypothetical median California restaurant ($9,000 + per seat) by the number of seats Mesdaq had \u201cavailable.\u201d (Cf. <em>Muller, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 271, fn. 7 [\u201cGoodwill must, of course, be measured by a method which excludes the value of tangible assets or the normal return on those assets\u201d].) Compounding this methodological error was the fact that, as the trial court ruled and Sanli acknowledged, Mesdaq\u2019s business was not actually a \u201crestaurant,\u201d and did not have a liquor license, and thus calculating anticipated profits by reference to sales at restaurants generally, including those with liquor licenses, introduced further speculation into the calculations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Marriage of Foster </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 577, 584 [117 Cal.Rptr. 49] [\u201ca proper means of arriving at the value of . . . goodwill contemplates any legitimate method of evaluation that measures its present value by taking into account <em>some past </em>result\u2019 (italics added); cf. <em>Muller, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 271, fn. 7 [citing <em>Foster </em>as authority for valuation of goodwill in eminent domain context].)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">As the goodwill statute does not contemplate compensation for hypothetical or potential as opposed to <em>actual </em>goodwill lost, the trial court should <em>not </em>have permitted Sanli to testify to a goodwill value determined by creating a future income stream not tied to Mesdaq\u2019s actual business operations. The 2005 and 2006 restaurant sales used to determine the future income streams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>to be discounted were based not on expected growth in Mesdaq\u2019s historical earnings, but represented anticipated profits from an \u201cimaginative\u201d better use of Mesdaq\u2019s existing facility. <em>(Reed, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d at p. 69 [trial court should exclude \u201cimaginative claims\u201d of experts in eminent domain proceedings because \u201c[a] condemnation trial is a sober inquiry into values, designed to strike a just balance between the economic interests of the public and those of the landowner\u201d].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In sum, Sanli approached the valuation of Mesdaq\u2019s business \u201cas a laboratory exercise rather than as an empirical measure of what actually existed.\u201d <em>(Sobke, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 398; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 801; <em>Rancho Vista Del Mar, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1059 [\u201ca property owner may not value his property based upon its use for a projected special purpose or for a hypothetical business\u201d]; <em>San Diego Metropolitan Transit Development Bd. v.

Such testimony is improper, and the trial court abused its discretion by permitting it. (See <em>Sobke, </em>at p. 398 [\u201cBy attempting to predict [the business\u2019s] profitability without calculating and verifying its actual revenues, expenses and profits, [the expert] accomplished nothing toward the goal of determining the existence and true measure of any goodwill. Thus, since not based upon a quantified and verified comparison of patronage-related benefits accruing to the business . . . , [the expert\u2019s] testimony about the value of loss of goodwill did not meet the statutory requirements for admissibility as an expert opinion\u201d].) Consequently, the jury\u2019s award of lost goodwill, which adopted Sanli\u2019s erroneous calculation of value, must be reversed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">\n<em>We Reverse the Trial Court\u2019s Award of Litigation Expenses Without Regard to the Agency\u2019s Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The Agency argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding $1,230,714.14 in attorney fees to Mesdaq under section 1250.410, subdivision (b), which authorizes a trial court to award \u201clitigation expenses\u201d to the defendant in an eminent domain proceeding if it determines that the final pretrial \u201coffer of the plaintiff was unreasonable and that the demand of the defendant was reasonable viewed in the light of the evidence admitted and the compensation awarded in the proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1250.410, subd. (b); see also \u00a7 1250.410, subd. (a).) As the factors that the trial court was required to rely on, and did rely on, under section 1250.410 in making its determination were derived from a jury award that we now reverse, we accordingly reverse the trial court\u2019s award of litigation expenses, regardless of the merits of the Agency\u2019s contention on appeal.

The Agency contends that precondemnation liability cannot attach to its lawful exercise of its \u201cpolice power\u201d (the issuance of the Notice), and in any event, there was no showing that as a result of the Agency\u2019s action, Mesdaq\u2019s property suffered a requisite \u201cdiminution in market value.\u201d <em>(Klopping, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 52, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">1. <em>Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">(a) <em>Precondemnation Damages Under </em>Klopping</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">The California Constitution\u2019s mandate that \u201c[pjrivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only\u201d by payment of \u201cjust compensation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>(Cal.

Pursuant to these allegations, on August 8, 2005, the court held a bench trial on the issue of the Agency\u2019s precondemnation conduct. (See <em>City of Ripon v.

(See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33459 et seq.) Mesdaq testified that he spent \u201croughly 70 grand\u201d in response to the Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The trial court ruled that although it was a \u201cclose call,\u201d the Agency acted unreasonably in sending the Notice to Mesdaq because it did so \u201cin conjunction with the developer acquiring the property\u201d and \u201cas a negotiation tool.\u201d As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, Mesdaq presented evidence regarding the Agency\u2019s issuance of the Notice to the jury and was awarded $77,823.83 in precondemnation damages based on fees that Mesdaq incurred when, after receiving the Notice, he consulted with attorneys and an environmental study group.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">3. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling Is Erroneous Under </em>Klopping</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The trial court\u2019s ruling that the Agency could be liable under <em>Klopping </em>for unreasonably issuing the Notice as a negotiation tool cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">As <em>Klopping </em>itself makes clear, the availability of precondemnation damages is not akin to a court-created private right of action enabling property owners to collect damages whenever a redevelopment agency acts \u201cunreasonably.\u201d (Cf. <em>City of Fresno v.

Consequently, when a public entity issues a \u201cprecondemnation statement\u201d unreasonably, and thus decreases the value of property subsequently taken, an aggrieved property owner must be \u201cable to include in his eminent domain damages the decline in value attributable to this unreasonable precondemnation action by the city.\u201d <em>(HFH, </em>at p. 517, fn. 14; see <em>Klopping, </em>at p. 52 [property owner must demonstrate that \u201cthe property in question suffered a diminution in market value\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The trial court\u2019s ruling in the instant case falls outside of the narrow scope of the precondemnation remedy available under <em>Flopping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We have been unable to locate, and the parties fail to cite, any case that holds that issuance of the Notice or any analogous regulatory activity can constitute a compensable \u201cprecondemnation statement\u201d under <em>Flopping. </em>Rather, it appears that the trial court\u2019s ruling here constitutes a pronounced extension of <em>Klopping. </em>We think it significant that such an extension is not supported by any case decided in the <em>35 years </em>of case law that has developed since <em>Klopping.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, \u201cprecondemnation statements\u201d triggering <em>Klopping </em>damages generally constitute \u201can invasion or an appropriation of some valuable property right which the landowner possesses\u201d or at least an \u201cobstacle!] in the path of plaintiff in the use of its land.\u201d <em>(Selby Realty Co. v. City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 119, 120 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111].) These invasions can thus themselves be analogized to a constitutional taking or damaging of property for which \u201cjust compensation\u201d must be awarded. (See <em>Helix Land Co. v. City of San Diego </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 932, 945 [147 Cal.Rptr. 683] [no <em>Klopping </em>damages available because \u201c[b]efore a compensable taking results, there must be (1) a physical invasion, or (2) a direct legal restraint\u201d].) The issuance of the Notice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>instant case is difficult to characterize as an invasion of Mesdaq\u2019s property rights or a taking or damaging of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">We need not decide, however, whether there are any circumstances in which issuance of the Notice could constitute a compensable precondemnation statement because, in the instant case, issuance of the Notice did not result in legally cognizable damages. Under <em>Klopping, </em>\u201cdamages . . . must be measured in terms of increasing or decreasing market values to the property involved.\u201d <em>(City of Los Angeles v. Property Owners </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 114, 120 [187 Cal.Rptr. 667].) Here, there is no evidence that the Agency\u2019s (unsuccessful) use of the Notice as a negotiation tool diminished the fair market value of Mesdaq\u2019s property. Mesdaq did not assert or provide evidence that issuance of the Notice depressed the fair market value of his property, but argued only that he was \u201cdamaged\u201d by the Notice as a result of his having to consult with his attorneys and an environmental consultant, thus incurring fees. Such damages, while perhaps appropriate for a standard tort claim, cannot support precondemnation liability under <em>Klopping. (City and County of San Francisco v. Golden Gate Heights Investments </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1203, 1213 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 467] [precondemnation damages could not be awarded where \u201cthere is no evidence the property decreased in value as a result of City\u2019s conduct,\u201d and in fact, the property was \u201cpurchased ... for $200,000\u201d and later \u201cappraised for between $500,000 and $1,680,000\u201d]; <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>at p. 121 [reversing award of precondemnation damages where \u201crespondents did not demonstrate that the conduct of appellant defeated the highest and best use of their properties nor was there any proof that the acts of appellant substantially impaired their property rights thus affecting the properties\u2019 market value\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In sum, the trial court\u2019s ruling failed to recognize that any award of <em>Klopping </em>damages must be tethered, as in <em>Klopping, </em>to a decrease in market value of the affected property, and instead created what amounted to a private right of action for the unreasonable issuance of the Notice, with resulting tort damages. Any such private right of action must be created by the Legislature, not the courts, and thus the trial court\u2019s ruling was erroneous as a matter of law and must be reversed. <em>(Moradi-Shalal v.

Specifically, Mesdaq argues the court erred by (i) failing to apply the appropriate standard of review in evaluating whether the Agency\u2019s action in taking his property constituted a \u201cgross abuse\u201d of the Agency\u2019s discretion; (ii) concluding that the Agency\u2019s action did not constitute a gross abuse of discretion; and (iii) limiting the evidence that he was permitted to introduce in challenging the Agency\u2019s actions. We need not reach the merits of Mesdaq\u2019s various challenges to the underlying taking, however, because, by statute, he has waived them.,</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">As discussed in detail above, on April 30, 2004, the Agency filed a deposit of $3,091,000 with the court as probable compensation for the taking of Mesdaq\u2019s property and requested an order of possession, which was subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">During the litigation, Mesdaq entered into a stipulation that, in the event the Agency was successful in taking his property, Mesdaq\u2019s mortgage lender, First National Bank (FNB), would receive payment of the balance of its loan out of the proceeds of the compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">On August 4, 2005, seven months after the trial court rejected Mesdaq\u2019s challenges to the Agency\u2019s right to take his property, FNB filed an application for withdrawal of $1,194,555.60 of the Agency\u2019s probable compensation deposit, a sum which \u201crepresentad] the outstanding principal balance, interest balance, attorney\u2019s fees and costs due and owing by [Mesdaq] to FNB.\u201d The application noted the stipulation between Mesdaq and FNB, and that Mesdaq had defaulted on a recent loan payment. Mesdaq filed a response to FNB\u2019s request, stating that there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d for the request and that it violated the deed of trust on the property and the stipulation, which \u201cboth provide that [FNB] is not entitled to withdraw funds unless the case is settled or goes to judgment.\u201d (Cf. \u00a7 1255.230, subd. (d) [allowing \u201cany party\u201d to object to the withdrawal].) Nevertheless, Mesdaq asserted in his pleading that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>he was \u201cnot objecting to the withdrawal of the outstanding mortgage amount plus interest\u201d to pay off his loan.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Mesdaq did object to $19,590.76 of FNB\u2019s request\u2014the portion designated to pay FNB\u2019s attorney fees. In light of Mesdaq\u2019s consent to the bulk of FNB\u2019s request, the trial court subsequently authorized FNB to remove $1,174,964.90 from the Agency\u2019s deposit\u2014the amount of FNB\u2019s request minus the amount objected to by Mesdaq. FNB subsequently withdrew the authorized sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\n<em>By Consenting to the Withdrawal of the Funds Deposited for His Property to Pay Off His Indebtedness, Mesdaq Forfeited Any Further Right to Object to the Taking</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">By statute, \u201c[i]f any portion of the money deposited pursuant to\u201d an eminent domain action \u201cis withdrawn, the receipt of any such money shall constitute a waiver by operation of law of all claims and defenses in favor of the persons receiving such payment except a claim for greater compensation.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.260.) Under section 1255.260, which dates back to 1897 <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 659, fn. 6), \u201ca condemnee\u2019s withdrawal of deposited funds waives any challenge to the right to take\u201d and \u201cany claim as to lack of a public purpose.\u201d <em>(Clayton v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 28, 33 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 750] <em>(Clayton); </em>see <em>Mt.

San Jacinto, </em>our Supreme Court explained the policy rationale behind section 1255.260. \u201c[T]he Legislature reasonably could have found that it would be inconsistent for an owner to deny the condemner\u2019s right to take with one hand while it withdraws and uses the condemner\u2019s deposit with the other. An owner cannot have it both ways. It is reasonable to require the owner to choose one or the other: either to deny the condemner\u2019s right to take the property and litigate, or to take the deposit.\u201d <em>(Mt. San Jacinto, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Construing the statute, it is beyond dispute that a \u201cportion\u201d of the Agency\u2019s deposit for Mesdaq\u2019s property was \u201cwithdrawn,\u201d and thus any further challenge to the taking of the property is precluded as to \u201cthe persons receiving such payment.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.260.) Recognizing this, Mesdaq argues only that since FNB (i.e., not Mesdaq) actually received the deposit, any statutory waiver \u201cruns only to FNB.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We do not believe there is any legal distinction under section 1255.260 between FNB and Mesdaq with respect to the withdrawal of funds in this case. The money withdrawn was used to satisfy <em>Mesdaq\u2019s indebtedness </em>to FNB, resulting in a direct increase in the value of Mesdaq\u2019s ownership interest in the condemned property, and relieving him of his mortgage obligations and accrual of interest on those obligations. Such a transaction easily constitutes Mesdaq\u2019s \u201creceipt of\u2019 the money withdrawn from the deposit. (\u00a7 1255.260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Further, the payment of Mesdaq\u2019s indebtedness with the deposit funds was accomplished with Mesdaq\u2019s explicit consent. Mesdaq noted in his pleadings with the court that FNB did not have the legal authority to withdraw the Agency\u2019s deposit, but nonetheless informed the court that he (the rightful owner of the deposit) did not object to FNB\u2019s withdrawal of the funds for the purpose of satisfying <em>Mesdaq\u2019s </em>loan obligation. (See \u00a7 1255.230, subd. (d) [specifically authorizing parties to object to withdrawal requests].) Accordingly, the trial court, emphasizing Mesdaq\u2019s lack of objection, authorized FNB\u2019s withdrawal. (See \u00a7 1255.220 [requiring court to permit withdrawal if applicant is \u201centitled to receive\u201d funds from deposit].) We see no distinction between this scenario\u2014where Mesdaq consented to the withdrawal of the deposit by his bank to pay off his loan on the property\u2014and a scenario where Mesdaq himself withdrew the deposit and forwarded it to FNB for that purpose. In both situations, Mesdaq has received the funds from the Agency\u2019s deposit, and section 1255.260 consequently mandates a waiver of any future objections to the taking.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In light of the statutory waiver, Mesdaq has waived \u201call claims and defenses\u201d with respect to the eminent domain action \u201cexcept a claim for greater compensation.\u201d (\u00a7 1255.260.) As it is undisputed that a challenge to an agency\u2019s right to take property is not \u201ca claim for greater compensation,\u201d it necessarily follows that Mesdaq has waived the claims raised in his appeal. <em>(Ibid.; Mt.

Sanli thus further calculated projected future <em>profits </em>by subtracting projected future expenses from his sales projections.

(\u00a7 1263.510, subd. (b).) Consequently, Sanli was permitted to use (and did use) a growth rate to calculate the Gran Havana\u2019s anticipated revenues as those revenues increased in future years. The error in Sanli\u2019s calculations was not the use of a growth rate, but rather Sanli\u2019s application of that growth rate to the revenues of a <em>hypothetical </em>business rather than the revenues of the <em>actual </em>business being valued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\"> In an opinion issued after argument in the current appeal, our colleagues in the Second District affirmed a trial court\u2019s admission of expert goodwill testimony that disregarded the lack of profit at a condemned business in concluding that the business owner lost $410,271 in goodwill because of condemnation. <em>(Inglewood Redevelopment Agency v. Aklilu </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1104 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 684].) In supplemental briefing, Mesdaq contends that <em>Inglewood </em>supports the admission of Sanli\u2019s testimony. In <em>Inglewood, </em>the goodwill valuation expert utilized a \u201c \u2018cost to create\u2019 \u201d approach to establish an estimate of lost goodwill. Under this approach, the expert calculated the value of the <em>actual </em>\u201ccost [the business owner] had expended over the [life of the business] to place the business in the enviable position it enjoyed,\u201d and testified the resulting estimate of lost goodwill ($410,271) was an amount for which the business could have been sold \u201cwithin a matter of days.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here Sanli did not utilize a cost to create approach and, more significantly, his calculations, unlike those of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>expert in <em>Inglewood, </em>were not derived from the operations of, or investment in, the <em>actual </em>business being valued. Rather, Sanli testified to a goodwill valuation that relied primarily on estimates of sales at a <em>hypothetical </em>alternative restaurant operated at the Gran Havana\u2019s location\u2014a methodology that is not endorsed by the <em>Inglewood </em>opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\"> In 12 pages of briefing on this issue, Mesdaq fails to cite any case that awards <em>Klopping </em>damages for similar regulatory conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> Mesdaq references certain comments of the Agency\u2019s counsel in the trial court proceedings that he contends represent an implicit contention that <em>Klopping </em>damages were appropriate if the court found the Agency\u2019s conduct unreasonable. Mesdaq includes these references in a footnote in his respondent\u2019s brief regarding the appropriate standard of review, and again in supplemental briefing addressing the question of whether, assuming reversal of the <em>Klopping </em>ruling, the goodwill award would survive.
