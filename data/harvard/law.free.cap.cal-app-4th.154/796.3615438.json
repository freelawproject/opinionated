J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZQ\">In this insurance coverage dispute, R. A. Stuchbery &amp; Others Syndicate 1096, as Underwriters at Lloyds, London subscribing to Policy No. BA 98 01045LO145 (Stuchbery), insured M &amp; M Luxury Shuttle, Inc. (M &amp; M), a shuttle service operator, and Mostafa Tehrani (Tehrani), an officer and director of M &amp; M, under a general liability policy. Stuchbery defended and ultimately indemnified these insureds in a lawsuit filed by a passenger (the victim) who alleged she had been sexually assaulted by M &amp; M\u2019s driver. Redland Insurance Company (Redland) also insured M &amp; M and Tehrani under a business automobile policy and, following the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>of the passenger\u2019s lawsuit (the Underlying Action), Stuchbery filed an action against Redland, seeking reimbursement or equitable contribution for its defense costs and indemnification payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Stuchbery appeals a summary judgment entered in favor of Redland after the trial court determined that Redland had no duty to defend or indemnify M &amp; M or Tehrani in the Underlying Action, and therefore Stuchbery was not entitled to reimbursement or equitable contribution from Redland. We conclude that, as a matter of law, the victim\u2019s injuries did not result from the \u201cuse\u201d of the M &amp; M shuttle and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Stuchbery concedes that the material facts in this case are undisputed. The Underlying Action was filed against M &amp; M, Tehrani and one of M &amp; M\u2019s drivers, Collie George Downer (Downer). The plaintiff in that case (the victim), who was 16 years old at the time of the incident, alleged that at or about 1:00 a.m. on January 12, 2000, while at the Civic Center in San Francisco, she asked Downer to transport her to a teen shelter. He agreed, but instead of taking her there, Downer drove her to his apartment and raped her. The complaint alleged causes of action for (1) common carrier liability; (2) childhood sexual abuse; (3) assault; (4) battery; (5) sexual battery; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) negligent hiring and/or retention of an unfit employee; (8) negligent training and supervision; (9) false imprisonment; and (10) violation of Civil Code section 51.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The victim testified in a concurrent criminal action, and her testimony was submitted in the motion for summary judgment in this insurance dispute. She had run away from home because she \u201cneeded a break\u201d from her parents and did not want to go to school. After arriving at the Civic Center in San Francisco, she \u201ckept walking\u201d as she looked for a \u201cshelter for run-away people, homeless people,\u201d until she saw Downer in front of a diner with his shuttle. Downer asked the victim what she was doing out and how old she was, and suggested she call her mother. The victim became concerned that Downer would \u201ccall the cops\u201d and she would be sent home. She asked him to take her to a shelter, and he agreed. She testified she approached Downer in his capacity as a driver of a shuttle, and would not have entered the shuttle if she believed it was a private vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The victim testified that the shuttle stopped in front of Downer\u2019s apartment. Downer told her the shelters were closed until 6:00 a.m., and that she could sleep in his apartment while he returned to work. The victim responded, \u201cFine,\u201d because she \u201cfigured\u201d she would sleep at Downer\u2019s apartment for a few hours and have him take her to the shelter in the morning. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>two went through the entryway, went up at least one flight of stairs and walked inside. According to the complaint, Downer \u201ccaused [the victim] by threat of intimidation and physical violence to remain in his apartment for a period of approximately [five] hours. During this time . . . Downer sexually assaulted and battered [the victim] ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In June 2002, M &amp; M and Tehrani tendered their defense and indemnity in the Underlying Action to Stuchbery, which agreed to defend subject to a reservation of rights. In January 2004, M &amp; M and Tehrani tendered their defense and indemnity to Redland, which initially accepted the tender under a reservation of rights, but after conducting a coverage investigation declined to defend or indemnify. Stuchbery incurred $274,549.40 in attorney fees and costs in defending M &amp; M and Tehrani in the Underlying Action, $195,723.11 of which was incurred after M &amp; M and Tehrani tendered to Redland. Stuchbery also incurred $250,000 in settling the victim\u2019s claims against M &amp; M and Tehrani.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In April 2005, Stuchbery filed this action against Redland, asserting it was entitled to reimbursement from Redland because Redland alone was responsible for defending and indemnifying M &amp; M and Tehrani. In the alternative, Stuchbery claimed that both Stuchbery and Redland had a duty to defend and indemnify and Stuchbery was entitled to equitable contribution from Redland.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Redland filed the instant motion for summary judgment, asserting there was no potential for coverage under its policy. The trial court agreed and concluded that because Redland had no duty to defend or indemnify M &amp; M and Tehrani, Redland owed no reimbursement or equitable contribution to Stuchbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stuchbery filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\u201c[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.

Co. v. Aetna Ins.

It does not require that the injury be the direct and proximate result in any strict legal sense of the active movement of the motor vehicle covered by the policy.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d In contrast, <em>Truck Ins. Exch. v. Webb </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 140, 148 [63 Cal.Rptr. 791] requires that the use of the vehicle be a \u201c \u2018predominating cause\u2019 or a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in causing the injury.\u201d (See generally <em>American Nat. Property &amp; Casualty Co. v. Julie R. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 134, 139-140 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 119] <em>(Julie R.).) Partridge </em>found it unnecessary to resolve whether <em>Universal Underwriters </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 144, or <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 140, correctly interpreted the phrase \u201cuse of the vehicle\u201d because in <em>Partridge, </em>the insurance policy \u201cclearly\u201d covered the accident. <em>(Partridge, </em>at p. 100, fn. 7.) Subsequent to <em>Partridge, </em>however, the majority of California decisions considering the issue have applied the \u201cpredominating cause/substantial factor test.\u201d <em>(State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Grisham </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 563, 566-567 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 809] <em>(Grisham); Julie R., </em>at p. 140.) Under this test, a mere \u201cbut for\u201d connection between the use of the vehicle and the alleged injuries is insufficient to bring the claim within the scope of coverage. \u201cTo hold otherwise would convert auto liability policies into general liability policies. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Grisham, </em>at p. 567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In <em>Julie R., </em>the automobile policy at issue provided coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury . . . resulting] from the ownership, maintenance or use of the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Julie R., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 137.) There, the plaintiff was driven by the assailant in his car to a secluded location and raped. The assailant had parked the car next to a fence in such a way as to keep the door closed, and reclined the plaintiff\u2019s seat to prevent her from escaping. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that causation could not be proved simply by showing that a vehicle was a \u201c \u2018cause in fact\u2019 \u201d of the injury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 140.) Instead, <em>Julie R. </em>concluded use of the vehicle had to be a \u201cpredominating cause or substantial factor\u201d in the injury, and the mere use of the vehicle as transportation to the scene of the injury did \u201cnot establish a sufficient causal connection between the \u2018use\u2019 and the injury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Julie R. </em>relied on <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>where a truck was used to transport cardboard boxes to a location where the boxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>were ignited and caused buildings to bum. Though the track\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d played a part in the chain of events \u201c \u2018it [could not] be reasonably said that the destruction of the buildings arose out of the \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Julie R., </em>at p. 141, quoting <em>Truck Ins. Exch. </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\"><em>Julie R. </em>next noted that \u201cwhere the role of the vehicle in the injury is merely as a situs for the act causing injury, courts have found that the injury does not arise from the use of the vehicle and that the injury is not covered.\u201d <em>(Julie R., supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 139.) \u201cFor example, coverage was denied for an injury caused when a gun inside a car at rest discharged because the bolt of the gun was pulled back.\u201d (Ibid., citing <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 694 [163 Cal.Rptr. 219].) In <em>Aetna, </em>an occupant of the car pulled back the bolt of a rifle to chamber a round of ammunition and accidentally discharged the gun, causing injury. The court held the injury did not arise out of the \u201cuse\u201d of the car, but arose out of the \u201cconduct\u201d of the person who pulled back the bolt of the rifle. <em>(Aetna, </em>at p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"><em>Julie R. </em>acknowledged that the assailant\u2019s \u201cplacement of his vehicle against the fence increased the danger that he would be successful in carrying out his intent to rape Julie R.,\u201d but held that the rape \u201c \u2018originated from, grew out of [and] flowed from\u2019 [the assailant\u2019s] intent to rape Julie R. and his actions with his body to achieve that end,\u201d not from the use of the car. <em>(Julie R., supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) Thus, the car\u2019s \u201cuse was a circumstance accompanying the rape, not a predominant cause or substantial factor in Julie R.\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 142.) In reaching this conclusion, <em>Julie R. </em>relied on <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Hansel </em>(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 570 [90 Cal.Rptr. 654] where \u201cthe court held that an automobile insurance policy did not provide coverage even though physical aspects of the car were used in perpetrating an attack.\u201d <em>(Julie R., </em>at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\"><em>Julie R. </em>supports the trial court\u2019s determination in the present case. As in <em>Julie R., </em>the M &amp; M shuttle was merely used to transport the victim to the locale of the rape. Her injury resulted from Downer\u2019s conduct and his intent to rape the victim in his apartment, not from the \u201cuse\u201d of the shuttle. The connection between the shuttle and the victim\u2019s injuries was even more attenuated than in <em>Julie R., </em>as the victim\u2019s rape did not take place inside the shuttle and there was also no allegation that Downer used the shuttle to trap his victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The use of the shuttle merely to drive the victim to Downer\u2019s apartment \u201cd[id] not establish a sufficient causal connection between the \u2018use\u2019 and the injury.\u201d <em>(Julie R., supra, 76 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Stuchbery does not dispute <em>Julie R.\u2019s </em>analysis or its conclusion that coverage exists only when the use of the covered automobile is a substantial factor or predominate cause of the injury. Stuchbery contends, however, we should distinguish <em>Julie R., </em>and the cases on which it relies, because they involved <em>private </em>vehicles, not <em>common carriers. </em>Stuchbery argues, in effect, that with a common carrier, the use of the vehicle is always a substantial factor in a case where a passenger is injured by the driver\u2019s physical assault. Stuchbery contends the relationship between a common carrier driver and passenger is defined by the common carrier vehicle; there would be no relationship, and hence no opportunity to assault and injure the victim, but for the vehicle. This, Stuchbery contends, distinguishes our case from the typical private vehicle case, like <em>Julie R., </em>where the parties have a private relationship outside and apart from the vehicle, and the assault could have occurred elsewhere and under circumstances not involving a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Stuchbery principally relies on <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 941 [200 P.2d 26] <em>(Connell). </em>In Connell, directly following a dispute regarding the cab fare, the taxi driver dragged his passenger from the vehicle and assaulted and battered him. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 946.) The passenger sued the taxicab operators and the insurance company that provided liability insurance to the operator. A municipal ordinance required taxicab operators to be adequately insured and provided that \u201cthe taxicab operator shall pay all damages to person or property, for the payment of which he may become liable arising <em>out of the conduct of the business of taxicab operator.\u201d (Connell, </em>at p. 945, italics added.) <em>Connell </em>did not quote the insurance policy language, but read the provisions of the ordinance into the policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 950.) The court concluded it was \u201ctoo patent to be susceptible to argument\u201d that the damages resulted from the operation of a taxicab. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\"><em>Connell </em>is inapposite. First, the assault was apparently triggered by a dispute directly related to the business operation of the cab. Second, <em>Connell </em>never states that its definition of the term \u201coperation\u201d hinged on the common carrier status of the vehicle or that for common carriers the use of the vehicle is always a substantial factor for injuries to a passenger resulting from a driver assault. In fact, <em>Connell </em>is a <em>pre-Partridge </em>case, and the court may have been applying the lesser \u201ccause in fact\u201d standard more widely used at that time, even for passengers of private vehicles. (See <em>Julie R., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) As discussed, <em>ante, </em>the \u201cpredominating cause/substantial factor test\u201d has prevailed since <em>Partridge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The factual distinction between <em>Connell </em>and this case highlights the flaw in Stuchbery\u2019s position. Even if the interpretation of the phrase in the subject insurance policy \u201cinjury . . . resulting from the . . . use of a covered auto\u201d should take into account whether the vehicle at issue is a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>carrier, the assault in this case is simply too attenuated from the use of the shuttle. As noted, the passenger in <em>Connell </em>was attacked while sitting inside the taxicab. The attack appears to have been triggered by a fare dispute, and the passenger was \u201cdragged out of the cab by the driver\u201d at the beginning of the attack. <em>(Connell, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.2d at p. 950.) In contrast, the victim in the Underlying Action was not injured while a passenger inside the shuttle. Her testimony reveals that she exited the shuttle on her own and, without being subject to either physical or verbal coercion from Downer, went into his apartment, \u201cfigur[ing]\u201d she would sleep there for a few hours until the shelters reopened in the morning. Thus, even if <em>Connell </em>is correctly decided and <em>Julie R. </em>would have been decided differently had the rapist\u2019s vehicle been a common carrier, here, the relationship between the \u201cuse\u201d of the M &amp; M shuttle and the rape inside the apartment was too attenuated to trigger Redland\u2019s duty to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Stuchbery\u2019s reliance on several out-of-state cases, principally <em>Mironov </em>v. <em>New York Mutual Underwriters </em>(N.Y.App.Div. 1989) 147 A.D.2d 761, 762 [537 N.Y.S.2d 345] <em>(Mironov), </em>is similarly misplaced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Mironov, </em>the policy language was quite similar to the language in this case, and the court found the insurance company had a duty to defend or indemnify a passenger injured in an assault by a driver of a common carrier. \u201cWhile cases generally hold that there would be no coverage under an automobile policy where one occupant of a vehicle intentionally inflicts violence on another occupant . . . [citations], where the policy of insurance is issued to cover a common carrier, coverage has been found [citations].\u201d (147 A.D.2d at p. 762.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But <em>Mironov </em>and the other out-of-state cases on which Stuchbery relies are factually distinguishable; as in <em>Connell, </em>the alleged assaults in those cases occurred <em>inside </em>the vehicles. Thus, even if we were to find that the subject phrase in Redland\u2019s policy should be interpreted more broadly when the insured is a common carrier, we would still conclude there was no potential for coverage in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The judgment is affirmed.

Redland also states in a summary fashion that there was no potential for coverage under its policy because the victim\u2019s injuries were not caused by an <em>accident. </em>We will not address these contentions, for \u201c[wjhen an issue is unsupported by pertinent or cognizable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>legal argument it may be deemed abandoned and discussion by the reviewing court is unnecessary.

Further, we need not address Redland\u2019s claim that even if there was a potential for coverage under its policy, it should be required to reimburse Stuchbery only for its portion of the costs incurred after M &amp; M and Tehrani notified Redland of the Underlying Action and tendered its defense and indemnity to Redland. We also need not address Stuchbery\u2019s arguments that M &amp; M was liable for the victim\u2019s injuries because of the doctrine of respondeat superior and because, as a common carrier, its duty to the victim did not end until it safely transported the victim to the teen shelter, as these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>contentions relate to M &amp; M\u2019s potential for <em>liability </em>and are immaterial to whether there was a potential for <em>coverage </em>under Redland\u2019s business automobile insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
