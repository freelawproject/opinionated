J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apq\">A jury convicted defendant Emanueal Duane Crittle of carjacking and robbery, and found he personally used a fireann in committing his crimes. Sentenced to an aggregate term of 13 years in state prison, he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">In the published portions of this opinion, we conclude that (1) a $20 court security fee (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1465.8) must be imposed based on a conviction for which punishment has been stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654, and (2) a $10 crime prevention fine (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.5, subd. (a)) can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>imposed only once in a case, rather than for each conviction in a case. Defendant\u2019s other contentions are addressed in the unpublished parts of the opinion. We shall modify the judgment and affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"APF\">I, II*</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Penal Code section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1) provides for the imposition of a $20 court security fee \u201con every conviction for a criminal offense.\u201d (Further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Because defendant was convicted of two offenses, the trial court imposed $40 in court security fees. However, pursuant to section 654, the court stayed the punishment for the robbery conviction. According to defendant, the stay precluded the court from imposing a $20 court security fee for that conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Section 654, which prohibits multiple punishment for the same act or course of conduct and generally bars the use of a conviction for \u201cany punitive purpose\u201d if the sentence on that conviction is stayed <em>(People v. Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 361 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595]), does not apply to a court security fee because that fee is not punishment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 867, 874-878 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 152] [the court security fee is part of an extensive statutory scheme applicable to both criminal and specified civil cases, has the nonpunitive objective of funding and coordinating court security, and is not so punitive in effect as to negate the Legislature\u2019s intention that the fee constitutes a civil disability].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Accordingly, even though the trial court stayed the punishment for defendant\u2019s robbery conviction, it was required to impose a $20 court security fee based upon that conviction. (See <em>People v. Schoeb </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 861, 865 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 889] [\u00a7 1465.8 \u201cunambiguously requires a fee to be imposed for each of defendant\u2019s convictions. Under this statute, a court security fee attaches to \u2018every conviction for a criminal offense\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The trial court imposed two $10 crime prevention fines based on section 1202.5, subdivision (a), which states; \u201cIn any case in which a defendant is convicted of any of the offenses enumerated in Section 211 . . . , the court shall order the defendant to pay a fine of ten dollars ($10) in addition to any other penalty or fine imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Since defendant did not raise the issue in the trial court, we reject his contention that the fines must be reversed because the court did not make a finding of defendant\u2019s ability to pay them, and nothing in the record shows he had the ability to pay. (See <em>People v. Gibson </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1468-1469 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 217].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Nevertheless, we agree with defendant that one of the fines was unauthorized because the crime prevention fine can be imposed only once \u201c[i]n any case.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.5, subd. (a).) Although defendant was accused and convicted of committing multiple offenses, this was still a single case. (See \u00a7 954.) Thus, only one $10 fee could be imposed. (Cf. \u00a7 1465.8, subd. (a)(1) [requiring a court security fee for \u201cevery conviction for a criminal offense\u201d]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11372.7, subd. (a)(2) [requiring a drug program fee \u201cfor each separate offense\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Because the second fine was unauthorized, defendant\u2019s failure to object does not forfeit the claim on appeal. <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 849, 852 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 14 P.3d 942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The judgment is modified by striking one of the $10 crime prevention fines (\u00a7 1202.5, subd. (a)) and awarding 272 days of custody credit for a total of 312 days of presentence credit. As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to amend the abstract of judgment accordingly and to send a certified copy of the amended abstract to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Sims, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 14, 2007, S156522.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
