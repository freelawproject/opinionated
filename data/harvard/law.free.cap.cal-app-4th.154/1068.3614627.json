Pursuant to an agreement entered into between Townsend and McDonald, McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim asserts an ownership interest in a portion of Townsend\u2019s royalties and other business income. She also claims Townsend owed her $201,108 in royalties earnings pursuant to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">McDonald contends the trial court erred in denying her creditor\u2019s claim because it was not timely filed. She asserts her creditor\u2019s claim was timely filed on February 24, 2004, within the four-month statute of limitations for filing a creditor\u2019s claim. McDonald argues that, even though her initial claim did not state the amount of her claim, her supplemental creditor\u2019s claim, filed on September 6, 2005, did so. McDonald further argues that her claim was properly filed as a creditor\u2019s claim because it was based on a contract. Therefore she was not required to assert her creditor\u2019s claim by bringing a petition under Probate Code section 850.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Respondent Structured Asset Sales, LLC (SAS), argues McDonald is appealing a nonappealable order and therefore this court must dismiss her appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">1. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Townsend was an exceedingly successful songwriter, who earned royalties on his songs amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. Townsend died intestate in August 2003. At the time, he had three grown children and no spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Townsend\u2019s son, Clef Michael Townsend (Michael), sold and assigned his interest in Townsend\u2019s estate to SAS in June 2004. In addition, Michael granted David Pullman, corporate executive officer of SAS, power of attorney to act on Michael\u2019s behalf for the purpose of insuring that SAS received all the benefits of Michael\u2019s inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">According to McDonald\u2019s declaration supporting her creditor\u2019s claim, McDonald, who was very close to Townsend, agreed to give him $10,000 in exchange for a 10 percent interest in Townsend\u2019s business income, including copyrighted material and royalties. Townsend memorialized the agreement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>a notarized letter dated January 11, 1995 (Royalties Agreement). Townsend also requested in his letter that McDonald serve as representative of his estate upon his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">McDonald did not receive any of the proceeds promised, which accrued during Townsend\u2019s life, because, after agreeing to give McDonald a share of his royalties, Townsend went into substantial debt. He borrowed large sums of money against his future royalties from various music companies that were collecting the royalties on Townsend\u2019s behalf. McDonald told Townsend he need not pay her any of the proceeds owed until he was financially able to do so. As of Townsend\u2019s death, McDonald was owed $201,108 pursuant to the Royalties Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">On December 8, 2003, McDonald filed a petition for letters of administration. On January 29, 2004, the court issued letters of administration appointing McDonald administrator and personal representative of Townsend\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On February 24, 2004, McDonald filed a creditor\u2019s claim, asserting her rights under the Royalties Agreement, including recovery of unpaid royalties Townsend owed her during his life. The total amount claimed was stated in her claim as: \u201c$AMOUNT NOT YET ASCERTAINED. SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT \u2018A\u2019.\u201d Exhibit A was a copy of the Royalties Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">On September 6, 2005, McDonald filed a supplement to her creditor\u2019s claim, stating that the total amount owed her for the period preceding Townsend\u2019s death amounted to $201,108, which consisted of 10 percent of the royalties earned from January 2003 until Townsend\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">On March 14, 2006, pursuant to section 9252, the probate court ordered McDonald to file a petition to approve her claim. Accordingly, McDonald filed a petition, along with her supporting declaration, claiming she was entitled to 10 percent interest in Townsend\u2019s business income, including copyrighted material and royalties, from the date of the Royalties Agreement until his death, plus the right to 10 percent of all income from Townsend\u2019s estate earned after Townsend\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">On April 6, 2005, SAS, as a beneficiary to the Townsend Estate and as assignee of Michael\u2019s interest in the estate, filed an objection and supplement to McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim. SAS alleged the Royalties Agreement was highly suspect as to its terms and content, was vague and ambiguous, lacked adequate consideration, and did not qualify as a will; Townsend was misconstruing the true meaning of the agreement terms; the agreement in actuality was a $10,000 loan; the agreement was over 11 years old and therefore any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>contract claim was barred by the statute of limitations; and McDonald\u2019s separate request for extraordinary fees was excessive. SAS requested the court to reject McDonald\u2019s entire creditor\u2019s claim or alternatively that McDonald be reimbursed from the estate for the $10,000 she lent Townsend, plus legal statutory interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">On May 11, 2006, SAS filed a supplemental objection to McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim, in which SAS argued that McDonald should have retained separate counsel to assert her creditor\u2019s claim because there was a conflict of interest, and McDonald should not receive any extraordinary fees related to her creditor\u2019s claim. SAS further objected to McDonald\u2019s attorney filing in Los Angeles a petition to establish a conservatorship for Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">On June 7, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on the petition for preliminary distribution. Other issues raised included approval of McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The court took the matter under submission, and on August 16, 2006, issued a written decision denying McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim. In doing so, the court explained that a creditor\u2019s claim must be filed within four months after issuance of the letters of administration or 60 days after notice of administration is given to the creditor. The supplemental creditor\u2019s claim was filed on March 22, 2006, approximately two and a half years after the estate was opened. McDonald knew of the estate proceedings and of the Royalties Agreement, upon which McDonald\u2019s claim was based. The court concluded McDonald\u2019s claim was untimely and McDonald should have filed a petition under section 850 because the agreement involved a \u201cpresent transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">2. Appealability of Order Denying McDonald\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">SAS maintains this court must dismiss McDonald\u2019s appeal because an appeal may not be taken from the order rejecting her claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Generally, a ruling in a probate proceeding is not appealable unless expressly made appealable by statute. <em>(Estate of Martin </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1438, 1441-1442 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 37].) Citing <em>Estate of Moore </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 334 [117 Cal.Rptr. 571] <em>(Moore), </em>SAS argues the order in the instant case is not appealable because it is not one of the orders enumerated as appealable under section 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">In <em>Moore, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 334, the trial court ruled the creditor had waived her probate creditor\u2019s claim by failing to bring it within the limitation period. On appeal, the court in <em>Moore </em>dismissed the appeal on the ground there was no statutory provision allowing the creditor to appeal the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>ruling. The court in <em>Moore </em>stated: \u201cIt has long been settled that there is no right to appeal from any orders in probate except those specified by section 1240 [predecessor statute to section 1300]. The statute is exclusive [citations], and much narrower in its scope than Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1. [Citation.] Neither an order overruling objections to an account nor an order rejecting a claim are specifically mentioned in the statute. . . . <em>Estate of Middleton </em>[(1963)] 215 Cal.App.2d 324 [30 Cal.Rptr. 155], and <em>Orth </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 474 [53 Cal.Rptr. 156]], most recently held that there is no right to appeal from an order rejecting a probate claim. Thus, there is no need to discuss the contention that the order of the court below was appealable as one directing or allowing the payment of a debt. The relief sought, in fact, was an order approving Anne\u2019s claim which had already been rejected [citation].\u201d <em>(Moore, supra, </em>at pp. 341-342, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">McDonald argues the order denying her creditor\u2019s claim is appealable under section 1300, subdivision (d). That provision states: \u201cIn all proceedings governed by this code, an appeal may be taken from the making of, or the refusal to make, any of the following orders: ... [][].. . [1] (d) Directing or allowing payment of a debt, claim, or cost.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As indicated in <em>Moore, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 334, that provision is inapplicable because the relief McDonald sought was an order approving her probate claim, not an order directing or allowing payment of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><em>Moore </em>relied on <em>Orth v. Superior Court, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.2d 474 <em>(Orth), </em>which stated: \u201cthere is no right to appeal from the rejection of a probate claim. [Citations.] Therefore, the appeal which was taken from the denial by the probate court of petitioner\u2019s motion for permission to file an amendment of die claim, pursuant to section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is unauthorized and should be dismissed.\u201d <em>(Orth, supra, </em>at pp. 475-476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\"><em>Orth </em>relied on <em>Miller v. California Trust Co. </em>(1936) 15 Cal.App.2d 612 [59 P.2d 1035] <em>(Miller), </em>in which the <em>Miller </em>court addressed the same argument McDonald raises in this court; that an order rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim is appealable under language in section 1240 (currently section 1300), which allows an appeal of an order \u201c \u2018directing or allowing the payment of a debt, claim, legacy or attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 616; see also <em>Orth, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.2d at pp. 475-476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In <em>Miller, </em>the probate court made an order allowing the appellant\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim in part and rejecting it in part. The appellant subsequently filed a separate action, challenging rejection of his creditor\u2019s claim in part and requesting that the rejected portion of his claim be allowed. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.2d at pp. 614-615.) The respondent argued that the order rejecting in part the appellant\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim had res judicata effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>The <em>Miller </em>court disagreed, concluding it was not a final order as to the rejected portion of the claim: \u201cAs appellant points out, section 1240 of the Probate Code [now section 1300], treating of \u2018Appealable Orders\u2019 includes, as such, an order \u2018directing or allowing the payment of a debt, claim, legacy or attorney\u2019s fee.\u2019 [Now \u00a7 1300, subd. (d).] But we note a distinction between an order <em>directing payment or allowing payment of </em>a claim and an order of the court merely <em>approving </em>or \u2018allowing\u2019 the claim. We believe that the order which is appealable under this section is an order directing or allowing <em>payment </em>of a claim which has already been \u2018allowed.\u2019 . . . There is no provision in section 1240 of the Probate Code permitting an appeal from an order rejecting a claim in whole or in part, and the Supreme Court has said: \u2018Where, as here, there has been a partial rejection of the claim, the only recourse of the dissatisfied creditor is a suit. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.2d at p. 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">An order in which the trial court approves or rejects a probate creditor\u2019s claim brought by a personal representative is entirely different from the court ordering or refusing to order payment of a debt, claim, or cost. For this reason, the courts have consistently concluded that an order approving or rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim is not encompassed by section 1300 or its predecessor statutes. <em>(Moore, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d at p. 341; <em>Orth, supra, </em>244 Cal.App.2d at p. 475; <em>Estate of Middleton, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.2d at p. 328; and <em>Miller, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.2d at p. 616.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">All of the statutes preceding section 1300,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including section 1240, contained similar language listing appealable orders and have all included as appealable the making or refusal to make an order directing or allowing payment of a debt, claim, or cost. Yet the courts have consistently distinguished such an order from that of an order approving or rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim. The courts have consequently held that an order approving or rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim is not appealable because it is not one of the statutorily enumerated probate orders that may be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The appropriate course of action when a creditor\u2019s claim is rejected is for the creditor to commence a separate action on the rejected claim challenging rejection of the creditor\u2019s claim. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.2d at pp. 614-615; \u00a7\u00a7 9250, 9252.) This is the exclusive method of enforcing a claim which has been rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>Section 9252 provides that if the personal representative of the estate, such as McDonald, is a creditor, her creditor\u2019s claim shall be submitted to the court for approval or rejection. McDonald did so. Section 9252, subdivision (a) further provides, \u201c. . . The court or judge may in its discretion require the creditor to file a petition and give notice of hearing.\u201d In accordance with the court\u2019s request, McDonald filed such a petition. After hearing the matter, the court rejected McDonald\u2019s petition. Section 9252 states in part that \u201c(c) If the court or judge rejects the claim, the personal representative or attorney may bring an action against the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Under section 9252, subdivision (c), if McDonald wished to challenge the court\u2019s ruling rejecting her creditor\u2019s claim, she was required to bring a separate action against the estate. She could not simply appeal the order rejecting her creditor\u2019s claim because there was no authority allowing her to appeal an order rejecting her creditor\u2019s claim. Despite numerous amendments to section 1300 and its predecessor statutes, and despite case law consistently holding that an order rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim is not appealable, the Legislature has chosen not to add statutory language providing that an order rejecting a probate creditor\u2019s claim is an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Because the order rejecting McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim is not appealable under section 1300, subdivision (d), this court does not have jurisdiction and must dismiss McDonald\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">McDonald alternatively argues the trial court did not \u201creject\u201d her creditor\u2019s claim within the meaning of section 9252, subdivision (c), because the court did not follow the very specific procedure required for rejecting a creditor\u2019s claim set forth in section 9250, subdivision (c). McDonald complains that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s one sentence \u2018denial\u2019 did not come even remotely close to containing all of the required elements\u201d of section 9250, subdivision (c). In addition, McDonald complains the court did not use the mandatory Judicial Council form DE-174, entitled, \u201cAllowance or Rejection of Creditor\u2019s Claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The trial court\u2019s order rejecting McDonald\u2019s claim consisted of a relatively detailed written order addressing the issue raised at the hearing on June 7, 2006. As to McDonald\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim, the court not only stated McDonald\u2019s claim was \u201cdenied,\u201d but also explained its reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>Section 9250 states in relevant part: \u201c(a) When a claim is filed, the personal representative shall allow or reject the claim in whole or in part. [j[] (b) The allowance or rejection shall be in writing. The personal representative shall file the allowance or rejection with the court clerk and give notice to the creditor as provided in Part 2 (commencing with Section 1200) of Division 3, together with a copy of the allowance or rejection. PH] (c) The allowance or rejection shall contain the following information: [][] (1) The name of the creditor. PH] (2) The total amount of the claim. PJ[] (3) The date of issuance of letters, [f] (4) The date of the decedent\u2019s death. PH] (5) The estimated value of the decedent\u2019s estate, [f] (6) The amount allowed or rejected by the personal representative, [f] (7) Whether the personal representative is authorized to act under the Independent Administration of Estates Act (Part 6 (commencing with Section 10400)). [f] (8) A statement that the creditor has three months in which to act on a rejected claim. [|] (d) The Judicial Council may prescribe an allowance or rejection form, which may be part of the claim form. Use of a form prescribed by the Judicial Council is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">This provision is inapplicable here because it concerns notice of rejection by the estate representative, whereas in the instant case, notice of rejection was by the court under section 9252. Furthermore, Judicial Council form DE-174 is used when an estate representative allows or rejects a creditor\u2019s claim, as stated on the form: \u201cPERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE\u2019S ALLOWANCE OR REJECTION.\u201d In the instant case, the probate court, rather than the estate representative, considered and rejected McDonald\u2019s claim. We further note that McDonald filed a proposed form DE-174 order approving her claim. This indicates that even if section 9250 and form DE-174 were applicable, McDonald was already on notice of all of the information required pursuant to section 9250.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Also, McDonald did not raise in the trial court any objection to the form of the court\u2019s rejection of her claim in the trial court and therefore cannot now raise such objections for the first time on appeal, particularly since, had McDonald objected, any deficiencies under section 9250, subdivision (c) could have been cured in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">More importantly, even assuming the order rejecting McDonald\u2019s claim was a \u201cdenial,\u201d not a \u201crejection,\u201d which is clearly a semantical distinction without a difference under the facts in this case, the order is not one of the enumerated appealable orders under section 1300, and therefore this court must dismiss McDonald\u2019s appeal. <em>(Efron v. Kalmanovitz </em>(1960) 185 Cal.App.2d 149, 152 [8 Cal.Rptr. 107].)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>3.
