A.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"A62\">This appeal from a judgment for declaratory relief concerns whether respondent, a former city attorney for the City of Sanger, is entitled to funds which he claims are his share of a contingency fee for litigation services. Appellant, the City of Sanger, claims whatever interest respondent may have in the funds was obtained in violation of Government Code section 1090<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Political Reform Act, which prohibit public officials from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity. Appellant claims respondent must forfeit his interest because he violated the law. The trial court declared section 1090 and the Political Reform Act have no application in these circumstances and respondent is entitled to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">In 1977, appellant entered into a contract with the law firm of Richard H. Hargrove to provide legal services as city attorney for a retainer fee of $1,000 per month. These services included attending meetings, being available one morning or afternoon a week to give advice and counsel to the council and city staff, providing advice and opinions by phone regarding city business, and drafting routine ordinances, rules, resolutions, and regulations. Expressly excluded from the services covered by the retainer agreement were, inter alia, \u201c[a]ny proceedings requiring litigation.\u201d For litigation-related services, appellant agreed to compensate the firm \u201con a reasonable legal fee basis, depending upon the type of service rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Respondent was an associate and later a partner in the Hargrove firm and acted as deputy city attorney for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In 1980, a dispute arose between appellant and a number of chemical companies as a result of dibromochloropropane (DBCP) contamination of city wells. Acting upon the advice of respondent, appellant authorized respondent to investigate retaining the services of an outside law firm to represent appellant in prosecuting claims against the chemical companies. One of the requirements was that the matter would be handled on a contingency fee basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Respondent negotiated a contract for legal services which provided that his firm and the San Francisco firm of Hoberg, Finger, Brown, Cox &amp; Molligan would prosecute the claims on behalf of appellant against the chemical companies on a contingency fee basis. The contract was approved December 10, 1980, by appellant\u2019s city council on the advice of Hargrove. Four other cities also retained the services of the two firms under separate but identical contingency fee contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The contingency fee agreement explained how the total fee would be calculated based upon the amount of the total recovery, but did not explain how the two firms would split the fee. Respondent and the Hoberg firm had a separate oral agreement whereby respondent\u2019s firm would receive 35 percent of the total contingency fee. The Hoberg firm and respondent\u2019s firm later agreed that respondent\u2019s fee would be reduced to $420,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The DBCP litigation with the chemical companies lasted for 12 years. During that time, Hargrove and Campagna ceased acting as city attorney for Sanger. The firm dissolved in 1983 and the firm\u2019s interest in the outcome of the DBCP litigation was assigned to respondent. Respondent was appointed judge of the Kerman Justice Court in 1985. The Hoberg firm became Molligan, Cox &amp; Moyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In 1992, just prior to trial in the DBCP litigation, appellant declared the contingency fee agreement violated section 1090. According to appellant, it was unlawful for respondent to have an interest in the contract which he negotiated on behalf of appellant in his official capacity as city attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The DBCP litigation settled in 1993 for a total value of $16,250,000. The contingency fee for the attorneys under the fee agreement was $2,915,000. Despite its assertion that the contingency fee contract was void under section 1090, appellant agreed to pay the Molligan firm its share of the fees, but insisted Molligan not pay respondent his share of the fee, which had been reduced from 35 percent to $420,000. A special interest-bearing bank account was established pending resolution of the dispute over respondent\u2019s entitlement to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Respondent filed a complaint for declaratory relief in June 1993 to determine the rights of the parties, specifically, whether section 1090 rendered the contingency fee agreement void insofar as it provided for respondent to receive a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Appellant filed a general denial and alleged several affirmative defenses. It proceeded on the theory that, despite the language in the DBCP contingency fee agreement which provided respondent\u2019s firm was to be compensated for litigation services related to the DBCP cases, appellant was never told nor did it anticipate respondent\u2019s firm would provide such services. Appellant understood the agreement was with the Hoberg firm to handle the litigation exclusively. Whatever services respondent\u2019s firm provided were covered by the retainer agreement between respondent\u2019s firm and appellant. Pursuant to an oral agreement with the Hoberg firm, respondent\u2019s firm was to receive a share of Hoberg\u2019s legal fees as nothing more than a \u201creferral fee.\u201d Thus, respondent\u2019s financial interest was not in the nature of compensation for litigation services rendered on behalf of appellant, but as compensation for referring the DBCP cases to the Hoberg firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trial court found (1) respondent had a right, under the 1977 contract for legal services with appellant, to negotiate his legal fees for services relating to \u201cany proceedings requiring litigation\u201d; (2) respondent assisted Hoberg in negotiating the contingency fee agreement with appellant; (3) the contingency fee agreement also provided for a portion of the fee to compensate respondent for the work he would do on the DBCP litigation; (4) appellant knew respondent would receive a fee for services related to that litigation; and, finally, (5) \u201cthe activity of fee negotiation by [respondent] with [appellant] does not come within the ambit of Government Code section 1090, or the Political Reform Act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court entered judgment in favor of respondent for $420,000, plus interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">I.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Right to Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>Section 1090 and the Political Reform Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Section 1090 prohibits city officers\u2019 financial interest in any contract made in their official capacity: \u201cMembers of the Legislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members. Nor shall state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees be purchasers at any sale or vendors at any purchase made by them in their official capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">For the purpose of construing section 1090, a contract \u201cmade\u201d in an official capacity includes one in which a person governed by the section engages in \u201cpreliminary discussions, negotiations, compromises, [and] reasoning . . . .\u201d <em>(Millbrae Assn. for Residential Survival </em>v. <em>City of Millbrae </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 222, 237 [69 Cal.Rptr. 251].) A person who violates section 1090, regardless of whether the violation is intentional, forfeits any rights or interests flowing from the illegal contract. <em>(Thomson </em>v. <em>Call </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 633, 646-652 [214 Cal.Rptr. 139, 699 P.2d 316].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Section 87100 of the Political Reform Act (\u00a7 81000 et seq.) prohibits public officials from participating in or using their position to influence a governmental decision in which they have a financial interest: \u201cNo public official at any level of state or local government shall make, participate in making or in any way attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\"><em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Call, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 633, the leading case dealing with conflict of interest statutes, particularly section 1090, concerned a corporation\u2019s purchase of land from a city councilman as part of a development project. As a condition of project approval, the city required that land be set aside for a park. After purchasing the property, the corporation conveyed it to the city. Even though the councilman\u2019s interest in the transaction had been disclosed and he had followed the advice of the city attorney, the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>violated section 1090. The court found the contract void and required the councilman to forfeit the purchase price of the property, plus interest, to the city. \u201cThe case law supports strict enforcement of conflict-of-interest statutes. Mitigating factors\u2014such as Call\u2019s disclosure of his interest in the transaction, and the absence of fraud\u2014cannot shield Call from liability. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s remedy\u2014allowing the city to keep the land and imposing a money judgment against the Calls\u2014is consistent with California law and with the primary policy concern that every public officer be guided solely by the public interest, rather than by personal interest, when dealing with contracts in an official capacity. Resulting in a substantial forfeiture, this remedy provides public officials with a strong incentive to avoid conflict-of-interest situations scrupulously.\u201d <em>(Thomson </em>v. <em>Call, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 650, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Appellant claims both sources of respondent\u2019s financial interest in the $420,000 are contracts which were made in violation of conflict of interest laws: the contingency fee agreement violated section 1090 and section 87100 because respondent negotiated for the fee while serving as appellant\u2019s city attorney, and his financial interest in the contingency fee flows from his agreement with the Hoberg firm which he also negotiated in his official capacity in violation of section 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We begin our analysis by referring again to the trial court\u2019s findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">1. Respondent was a party to the contingency fee agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">2. Appellant knew respondent was a party to the agreement and respondent was to share in the contingency fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">3. Respondent had a right pursuant to the basic contract for legal services with appellant to negotiate his legal fees for services not covered by the basic contract, including litigation-related services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">4. Respondent assisted the Hoberg firm in negotiating the contingency fee agreement with appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">5. Respondent\u2019s negotiations with appellant were not covered by sections 1090 and 87100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">A. <em>The Contingency Fee Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The prohibition found in section 87100 does not apply to actions by public officials relating to the making of their own compensation or employment contracts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 18700, subd. (d)(3).) Nor is it unlawful for a public official to negotiate his or her own compensation. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 18700.1, subd. (b)(3).) Appellant concedes public officials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>such as city attorneys, are not prohibited from entering into contracts with their public agencies to be paid additional compensation for services beyond their regular duties. But according to appellant, that is not what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Appellant claims respondent did not enter into an agreement <em>with </em>the City of Sanger to be compensated on a contingency fee basis for services beyond his basic retainer agreement. Rather, he negotiated the contingency fee contract <em>for </em>Sanger as its city attorney, and his partner advised appellant to approve the contract when he had an interest in the contract. Appellant\u2019s argument is contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding that respondent negotiated <em>with </em>appellant\u2014not <em>for </em>appellant. Yet in its opening brief, appellant claims the facts are undisputed, the issues are purely legal and subject to de novo review. <em>(Rudd </em>v. <em>California Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 948, 951 [268 Cal.Rptr. 624]; <em>Cal-Air Conditioning, Inc. </em>v. <em>Auburn Union School Dist. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 655, 667 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 703].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">An ambiguity arises whenever an attorney and client enter into an agreement to render services beyond a basic retainer agreement. Whether or not an attorney-client relationship exists, the attorney necessarily negotiates the fee on his or her own behalf and not on behalf of the client. A conflict of interest for the attorney does not arise simply because there is a preexisting attorney-client relationship or the attorney represents the client on a related matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Insofar as the contingency fee agreement pertains to respondent\u2019s compensation for legal services on behalf of appellant in the DBCP litigation, we agree there is no conflict of interest and no violation of section 1090 or section 87100.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">However, the failure of the contingency fee agreement to set forth how respondent\u2019s compensation would be determined gives us pause. Section 41804 provides the city attorney shall receive such compensation as is set by the legislative body. Section 37103 permits the city to contract specially and set the compensation for legal services independent of those provided by the city attorney. In this case the amount respondent would receive as compensation for legal services beyond his basic contract was set by the agreement between the Hoberg firm and respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">B. <em>The Referral Fee Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">According to respondent\u2019s testimony, he approached the Hoberg firm in September of 1980 to discuss representation of several of respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>public entity clients in pursuing the DBCP litigation. Respondent told Hoberg his firm wanted a portion of the fee that might result from the litigation. Hoberg agreed and they negotiated the terms of a contingency fee agreement. Each public entity signed an identical, but separate agreement. Respondent admits he negotiated with Hoberg in his capacity as a city attorney. At the same time, Hoberg agreed respondent\u2019s firm would receive a referral fee of 35 percent of all legal fees received by the Hoberg firm. As we have noted, the fee was later reduced to $420,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">According to appellant, section 1090 was violated because respondent was acting in his official capacity as city attorney for appellant when he negotiated the agreement with Hoberg regarding the amount he would receive if appellant agreed to retain the services of the Hoberg firm. Thus, his \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the contingency fee agreement flows from a violation of section 1090 which forbids a city officer from having a financial interest in any contract made in his or her official capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The trial court made no findings with regard to whether this agreement violated section 1090 even though this agreement was an issue at trial. Indeed, appellant\u2019s position was that respondent\u2019s firm was to receive a share of Hoberg\u2019s legal fees as nothing more than a \u201creferral fee.\u201d Thus, respondent\u2019s financial interest was not in the nature of compensation for litigation services rendered on behalf of appellant, but as compensation for referring the DBCP cases to the Hoberg firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The trial court considered the \u201cactivity of the fee negotiation by [respondent] with [appellant]\u201d and concluded section 1090 did not apply. However, the court did not consider the legality of the agreement between the Hoberg firm and respondent. The contingency fee agreement cannot be viewed in isolation. Respondent violated section 1090 by entering into the agreement to divide the contingency fee with the Hoberg firm; his \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the contingency fee agreement rendered that agreement equally illegal. Stated another way, his \u201cfinancial interest\u201d under the terms of the contingency fee agreement cannot be determined without reference to his agreement with the Hoberg firm regarding division of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We can think of no circumstances under which the court could have found respondent was acting other than in his capacity as city attorney for appellant at the time he negotiated with Hoberg to receive a portion of the fee. Respondent suggests none. Respondent would not have been discussing the matter with the Hoberg firm had he not been retained by appellant and other public entities to find a litigation firm to handle the DBCP claims. Finding such a firm and negotiating with that firm to represent the city was unquestionably within the course and scope of his official business as city attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Respondent cannot \u201cchange hats\u201d in order to negotiate a referral fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u201c[T]he goals and policy concerns underlying section 1090 . . . [are] that \u2018no man can faithfully serve two masters whose interests are or may be in conflict\u2019: \u2018The law, therefore, will not permit one who acts in a fiduciary capacity to deal with himself in his individual capacity. . . . For even if the honesty of the agency is unquestioned ... yet the principal has in fact bargained for the exercise of all the skill, ability and industry of the agent, and he is entitled to demand the exertion of all of this in his own favor. \u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Thomson </em>v. <em>Call, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 647-648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Former rule 2-108 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provides an attorney shall not divide a fee for legal services with another attorney unless the client consents in writing to employment of the other attorney \u201cafter a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division.\u201d There is no evidence of disclosure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Although respondent was entitled to negotiate with appellant regarding compensation for litigation related services beyond his basic retainer agreement without violating section 1090 or the Political Reform Act, he negotiated his compensation with Hoberg\u2014not with appellant. Respondent violated section 1090 when he entered into the referral fee agreement. Because the $420,000 is the benefit of that agreement, he forfeits his right to the funds. <em>(Thomson </em>v. <em>Call, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 646-647.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Judgment reversed. Costs on appeal to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Ardaiz, P. J., and Vartabedian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied February 21, 1996, and the petition of appellant Robert R. Campagna for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 11, 1996. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\">All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The court\u2019s \u201cDecision After Trial\u201d concludes:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cIt is somewhat disingenuous of the defendant to now challenge the agreement they were more than happy to sign in 1980, when their only concern was that it cost them nothing up front regarding fees and costs to pursue their DBCP claim, ['ll] The defendant now wishes to dissect the fee agreement ratifying the Mulligan [\u00bf7c] firm\u2019s (formerly Hoberg firm) fee and to confiscate the plaintiff\u2019s fee. The defendant\u2019s use of the not so subtle threat of Government Code section 1090 to get the Mulligan [sic] firm to hand over to the defendant the plaintiff\u2019s portion of the legal fee is indefensible.
