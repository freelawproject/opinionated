He also asserts that a screwdriver can never be a deadly weapon for purposes of section 417.8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject defendant\u2019s assertions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\n<em>Statement of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">About 3 a.m. on March 21, 1993, East Palo Alto Police Officer Reich stopped defendant\u2019s car for an expired registration and failure to signal for a left turn. Defendant presented an expired driver\u2019s license. After the officer completed the traffic citation, defendant walked toward his car, as if.to drive away. The officer told defendant he would not be allowed to drive and the automobile would have to be towed. Defendant became angry and ran to his car. As defendant was trying to start the vehicle, the officer grabbed both defendant and the car door. Defendant drove forward with the officer still holding on. After approximately 30 feet, the officer fell free of the car, and defendant sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Officer Reich pursued defendant with lights and siren. Defendant ran a red light, briefly lost control of his car, and entered the southbound 101 freeway. Defendant briefly left the freeway by an exit ramp. He then tried to reenter the freeway but was traveling too fast. He lost control, coming to a stop facing the wrong direction on the on-ramp. Reich stopped and approached defendant\u2019s car on foot, ordering him out at gunpoint. Defendant instead restarted his car, which lurched forward striking the officer slightly. Defendant then began backing onto the freeway. After making contact with another police car, he spun around and headed back onto the freeway in the proper direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Officers pursued defendant into the City of Mountain View. There, defendant left the freeway at 70 to 80 miles per hour and led several officers on a chase through the city. Officer Peardon testified that, at one point, defendant backed into his squad car. Finally, defendant jumped out of his still-moving vehicle and fled on foot. His car continued until it crashed into a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>As defendant fled into an apartment complex, Officer Peardon pointed his gun at him and ordered him to the ground. Defendant turned, with a screwdriver in hand, and said, \u201c[F]uck you. Shoot me.\u201d Defendant then ran into the building and into his mother\u2019s apartment. His mother testified defendant entered the apartment saying, \u201cThey are trying to kill me, they tried to push my car off the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">After Peardon and Reich broke open the apartment door, defendant held them at bay with the screwdriver. Reich described defendant at this time: \u201cHe would flail his hands, show the screwdriver, if we were to approach he would bring the screwdriver forward toward us. He was pacing back and forth.\u201d When asked if he felt threatened by defendant, the officer testified: \u201cI would take the fact that we were telling him to drop the screwdriver and him waving it at us in this fashion, yelling, come on, kill me, go ahead, come on in; I would say that\u2019s threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Although several other officers arrived, defendant continued to hold the screwdriver in a threatening way and ordered the officers to stay back. A police dog was brought into the apartment, but defendant threatened to stab the dog. Finally, officers distracted defendant by throwing a chair at him. After a brief struggle, he was subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">A. <em>Can a Screwdriver Be a Deadly Weapon Under Section 417.8?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Defendant urges reversal of his convictions for exhibiting a deadly weapon to prevent arrest, alleging a screwdriver is not a deadly weapon for the purposes of that statute. We disagree and hold that, on these facts, the exhibition of a screwdriver to a peace officer with the intent to resist or prevent arrest is a violation of section 417.8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">Section 417.8 prohibits the drawing or exhibiting of a deadly weapon with the intent to resist or prevent the arrest or detention of oneself or another by a peace officer.  We recite the long-held distinction between weapons that are inherently deadly or dangerous and those that are deadly or dangerous based only on the facts of the particular occasion in question: \u201c \u2018There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>are, first, those instrumentalities which are weapons in the strict sense of the word, and, second, those instrumentalities which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word, but which may be used as such. The instrumentalities falling in the first class, such as guns, dirks and blackjacks, which are weapons in the strict sense of the word and are \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed, may be said as a matter of law to be \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons.\u201d This is true as the ordinary use for which they are designed establishes their character as such. The instrumentalities falling into the second class, such as ordinary razors, pocket-knives, hatpins, canes, hammers, hatchets and other sharp or heavy objects, which are not weapons in the strict sense of the word and are not \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d to others in the ordinary use for which they are designed, may not be said as a matter of law to be \u201cdangerous or deadly weapons.\u201d When it appears, however, that an instrumentality other than one falling within the first class is capable of being used in a \u201cdangerous or deadly\u201d manner, and it may be fairly inferred from the evidence that its possessor intended on a particular occasion to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require, we believe that its character as a \u201cdangerous or deadly weapon\u201d may be thus established, at least for the purposes of that occasion.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 327-328 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Raleigh </em>(1932) 128 Cal.App. 105, 108-109 [16 P.2d 752]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Brookins </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1297, 1305 [264 Cal.Rptr. 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Based upon the foregoing distinction, we can say without hesitation that the screwdriver exhibited by defendant here, while not an inherently deadly weapon, was a deadly weapon on this particular occasion. The evidence clearly demonstrated that the screwdriver was capable of being used as a deadly weapon and that defendant intended to use it as such if the circumstances required.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Defendant erroneously argues that section 417.8 can apply only to the exhibition of inherently dangerous or deadly weapons because ordinarily innocuous items require some dangerous or deadly use in order to transform them into dangerous or deadly weapons. Further, he reasons, any such use would constitute an assault with a dangerous or deadly weapon on a peace officer in violation of section 245, subdivision (c), thereby subsuming all violations of section 417.8. However, the circumstantial evidence required to transform an innocuous object into a deadly weapon is not necessarily as substantial as evidence that proves an <em>assault </em>with that weapon. The former requires only that the object be capable of deadly use and that the defendant intends to so use it if need be. Assault with a deadly weapon requires \u201can unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>on the person of another.\u201d (\u00a7 240.) Merely because this defendant\u2019s conduct might also be characterized as an assault with a deadly weapon upon an officer does not mean it cannot also constitute the exhibition of a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Both section 417.8 and section 245, subdivision (c) proscribe the use of a deadly weapon; the former to evade arrest, the latter to assault a peace officer. Defendant\u2019s analysis suggests the term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is defined differently for each section, such that the trier of fact may consider the circumstances of the incident to determine if an otherwise innocuous item, like a screwdriver, was a deadly weapon for the purposes of section 245, subdivision (c) but not section 417.8. We cannot agree. If the evidence supports a finding that the screwdriver was capable of being used as a deadly weapon and that defendant intended to use it as one if need be, it is a deadly weapon under either section. The record here supports such a finding. The distinction between the two sections rests not upon the nature of the weapon involved, but upon what is done with the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">B. <em>Is Section 148, Subdivision (a) a Lesser Offense of Section 417.8?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Defendant alleges error in the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury they could find defendant guilty of violating section 148, subdivision (a) as a lesser offense of section 417.8. The question of whether section 148, subdivision (a) is a lesser offense of section 417.8 is one of first impression. We conclude section 148, subdivision (a) is not a lesser included offense of section 417.8. Further, on the facts of this case, it was not a lesser related offense. Consequently, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Lesser offenses fall into two categories: included offenses and related ones. We first consider lesser included offenses. \u201c[A]n offense is necessarily included in the charged offense if under the statutory definition of the charged offense it cannot be committed without committing the lesser offense, or if the charging allegations of the accusatory pleading include language describing the offense in such a way that if committed as specified the lesser offense is necessarily committed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510, 517, fn. 4 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055].) The court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on necessarily included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all the elements of the charged offense have been proved and there is evidence of the lesser offense that would justify a conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramkeesoon </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 346, 351 [216 Cal.Rptr. 455, 702 P.2d 613].)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\"> The legal elements of a violation of section 148, subdivision (a) are as follows: (1) the defendant willfully resisted, delayed, or obstructed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>peace officer, (2) when the officer was engaged in the performance of his or her duties, and (3) the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the other person was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 592, 600, fn. 3 [233 Cal.Rptr. 207]; CALJIC No. 16.102 (5th ed. 1988 bound vol.).) Defendant cannot be convicted of an offense against an officer engaged in the performance of official duties unless the officer was acting lawfully at the time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1217 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159].) \u201cThe rule flows from the premise that because an officer has no duty to take illegal action, he or she is not engaged in \u2018duties,\u2019 for purposes of an offense defined in such terms, if the officer\u2019s conduct is unlawful. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> Here, defendant was charged in the statutory' language with violation of section 417.8, the elements of which are (1) the drawing or exhibiting of a firearm or a deadly weapon, (2) with the intent to resist or prevent arrest or detention of oneself or another by a peace officer. There is no requirement that the officer be engaged in the performance of his or her duties. Thus, a defendant violates section 417.8 when he exhibits a deadly weapon with the intent of preventing any arrest, lawful or unlawful. This result comports with section 834a, which sets forth the citizen\u2019s duty to refrain from using force or any weapon to resist either lawful or unlawful arrests. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 347, 352 [74 Cal.Rptr. 713, 450 P.2d 33], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The chief evil to be avoided by criminalizing exhibition of weapons is the potential for further violence, not only by the defendant, but also by others in response to the defendant\u2019s action. For example, section 417, subdivisions (a)(2) and (c) prohibit the brandishing of any firearm, loaded or unloaded. Similarly, when a firearm is used, there is no requirement in section 417.8 that it be loaded. The mere act of exhibiting a weapon, while harmless per se, is dangerous by virtue of the violence it may engender. When a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>violates section 417.8, the potential for violence is the same whether the initiating arrest was lawful or unlawful. In this context, the Legislature has chosen to shift the controversy over the legality of the arrest from the streets to a civil courtroom. A defendant may pursue a civil remedy for unlawful arrest, but he may not exhibit a deadly weapon to avoid that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Section 417.8 was added to the Penal Code by the Legislature in 1982, long after the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at pages 354-355, discussed the significance of the \u201cengaged in duty\u201d requirement and section 834a. (Stats. 1982, ch. 142, \u00a7 2.5, p. 476.) We presume the Legislature was aware of that court\u2019s analysis. Additionally, the same legislative act also amended section 245. (Stats. 1982, ch. 142, \u00a7 1.2, p. 469.) That section contains the \u201cengaged in duty\u201d requirement for assaults on peace officers. (\u00a7 245, subds. (b) &amp; (c).) The Legislature could have quite easily included the same requirement in section 417.8. As noted above, a large number of similar statutes do contain the requirement. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>Consequently, the Legislature\u2019s failure to include in section 417.8 an element that the officer be engaged in the performance of official duties or that the arrest be lawful must be construed as an intentional election to forego that requirement. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 755 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">By virtue of this analysis, section 148, subdivision (a) is not a lesser included offense of section 417.8. One can violate section 417.8 without violating section 148, subdivision (a), by exhibiting a deadly weapon to evade an <em>unlawful </em>arrest. In other words, the lawfulness of the police conduct is an element of section 148, subdivision (a) not contained in section 417.8. Thus, the court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury as to section 148, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">We now consider whether, on the facts of this case, section 148, subdivision (a) is a lesser related offense to section 417.8.  An offense is a lesser related offense to that charged if three criteria are met. First, there must be \u201csome basis, other than an unexplainable rejection of prosecution evidence, on which the jury could find the offense to be less than that charged. [U Second, the offense must be one closely related to that charged and shown by the evidence. . . . Although some evidence offered by the People or the defendant may indicate that the defendant has committed a crime other than that charged, instructions regarding that crime need not be given unless the evidence is also relevant to and admitted for the purpose of establishing whether the defendant is guilty of the charged offense, [f] Finally, the instructions must be justified by the defendant\u2019s reliance on a theory of defense that would be consistent with a conviction for the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>offense. Thus, the instruction need not be given if the defense theory and evidence reflect a complete denial of culpability as when the defense is alibi, or the only issue is identity, unless the defendant argues that the evidence at most shows guilt only of the related offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 531-532, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument that section 148, subdivision (a) is a lesser related offense to section 417.8 fails to meet the first criterion. On these facts, there is no basis, other than an unexplainable rejection of prosecution evidence, on which the jury could find the offense to be less than that charged. Defendant never disputed that he used the screwdriver to fend off police. His counsel argued that defendant was never close enough to the officers to hurt them and that defendant was merely forestalling his inevitable arrest, not actually preventing it. Neither argument is a defense to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Thus, there was no doubt that defendant exhibited a weapon in the officers\u2019 presence and that he did so with the intent to resist arrest. Furthermore, the factual question of whether the weapon used here was deadly could rationally have been resolved only against defendant. On this record, the screwdriver was clearly capable of being used as a deadly weapon. Moreover, the evidence demonstrated that defendant not only intended to use the screwdriver as a weapon but actually did use it as a weapon. One can certainly use a weapon without inflicting injury with it, by pointing a gun, for example. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 666, 672-673 [102 Cal.Rptr. 776, 498 P.2d 1024].) Defendant\u2019s repeated gesturing with the screwdriver, coupled with his statements to police, constitute a use of the screwdriver as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The jury was free to find defendant not guilty of the charge. We inquire only whether they rationally could have found him guilty of something less than the charge. While one could postulate scenarios under which a jury\u2019s decision to ignore the law or to be sympathetic to a defendant might result in a verdict of guilt on a lesser offense, that is not the test for the giving of lesser offense instructions. Some rational basis in law and fact must exist upon which the jury could reasonably find that the greater offense had not been proven but that the lesser one had. No such basis exists here. The trial court properly refused to instruct on section 148, subdivision (a) as a lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">C.-E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Chin, P.
