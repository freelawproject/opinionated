Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 288, subd. (a), count I) and penetration with a foreign object of the genital opening of a child under the age of 14 and more than 10 years younger than the defendant (\u00a7 289, subd. (j), count II). As to each count, it was alleged appellant was a stranger to the victim within the meaning of section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3). Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Jury trial began on May 16, 1994. On May 18, appellant was convicted of both charges and the special allegation was found to be true. His subsequent motion for a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced to six years in prison. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Statement of Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">I, II.*</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">III. <em>Failure to Define \u201cStranger\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">In a novel argument, appellant contends the trial court erred by failing to give his requested instruction setting forth a definition of the word \u201cstranger\u201d in conjunction with the section 1203.066 allegation of count I.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant says \u201cstranger\u201d has numerous meanings, many of which are contradictory. Relying on settled principles of statutory construction, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>asserts the trial court was obligated to resolve the ambiguity in his favor. Since some of the dictionary definitions of \u201cstranger\u201d favor appellant\u2019s position that he was <em>not </em>a stranger to Cynthia T., the victim, he concludes that \u201cthe trial court should have instructed with a definition that was reasonably favorable to appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The definition in appellant\u2019s requested instruction read: \u201cA stranger is a person with whom one is unacquainted, such as an intruder into the house of another.\u201d During a discussion of this instruction, the trial court noted that the dictionary contained more than one definition of \u201cstranger\u201d and asked, \u201c[Wjhich definition are we going to get?\u201d This ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cMr. Smith [defense counsel]: I think it\u2019s a rule of statutory interpretation that you have to interpret as favorably for the defendant as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, no, you\u2019re asking for\u2014to pick a definition out of Webster\u2019s many definitions that\u2019s the most favorable to the defendant, the law doesn\u2019t say you have to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201cMr. Smith: I believe the law does say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cThe Court: I think you have to give a complete definition of the term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201cMr. Smith: Well, then, I think you have to give a complete definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\u201cThe Court: So how about saying that, \u2018Stranger, outsider or newcomer, other person not known or familiar to one\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">\u201cMr. Maner [prosecutor]: Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s\u2014fits both of you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">\u201cMr. Maner: Maybe we\u2019re creating a problem that we don\u2019t have to. Maybe a better solution is to wait \u2019til they ask and then do it. They may not ask. Also, Your Honor, I\u2019ve got case law that says that with words of generally common knowledge \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">\u201cThe Court: Yeah, I don\u2019t need\u2014why do we even need to define \u2018stranger\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">\u201cMr. Maner: We don\u2019t, that\u2019s my point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201cMr. Maner: If they ask, we\u2019ll tell them, let\u2019s not create a problem until it happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cMr. Smith: I\u2019m asking for the instruction, I believe it\u2019s called for in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201cThe Court: A stranger is a term, a common term, I mean, everyone knows what a stranger is. You can argue that he wasn\u2019t a stranger. And Mr. Maner can argue that he was a stranger. The, the\u2014I mean, based on the way the testimony goes, it could be found that he was a stranger. On the other hand, I suppose you could argue that because she had met him that night he wasn\u2019t a stranger. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to define the term to the jury in this case. I think it\u2019s just misleading, is what I think. So I\u2019m going to refuse that instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The prosecution presented evidence that Cynthia was introduced to appellant when Terry Long brought appellant to her house on the evening in question. She had not met appellant before and did not spend time with him then, because she was playing a video game in a different room.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During his cross-examination of appellant, the prosecutor asked whether appellant had seen Cynthia before that night. Appellant said he had never seen her before. When the prosecutor asked, \u201cWas she a stranger to you?\u201d appellant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor subsequently argued to the jury that appellant was a stranger to Cynthia, as they had not met beforehand. The prosecutor also told the jury, \u201cSo if you convict him of Count I, you ask yourselves, \u2018Was he a stranger?\u2019 Everybody agrees, he\u2019s a stranger. That\u2019s an easy determination to make. He says it, she says it, Long says it, why else would he introduce her to the guy.\u201d Defense counsel did not address the point in his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">After the jury was excused for deliberations, defense counsel again requested that the court give appellant\u2019s proposed instruction defining \u201cstranger.\u201d The court refused. It pointed out that \u201cstranger\u201d is a common word and that laypersons know what a stranger is. It also found appellant\u2019s definition to be too narrow. The court offered to \u201ctake a look at it\u201d if appellant were to propose a broader definition, but noted that appellant had not submitted anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">It is the policy of this state to construe a penal statute as favorably to the defendant as its language and the circumstances of its application may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>reasonably permit; just as in the case of a question of fact, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of language used in the statute.\u201d <em>(Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420].) However, \u201cthe rule does not \u2018require[] that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope\u2014nor does any rule require that the act be given the \u201cnarrowest meaning.\u201d It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of [the legislative body].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1146 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raynor </em>(1938) 302 U.S. 540, 552 [82 L.Ed. 413, 420, 58 S.Ct. 353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">In our estimation, the rule likewise does not mean that commonly understood terms must be defined for a jury. \u201cThe law is settled that when terms have no technical meaning peculiar to the law, but are commonly understood by those familiar with the English language, instructions as to their meaning are not required.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633, 639 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Myriad cases address whether certain terms and phrases must be defined for the jury. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Estrada </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 568, 578 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 904 P.2d 1197] [\u201c \u2018reckless indifference to human life,\u2019 \u201d as used in \u00a7 190.2, has no technical meaning peculiar to law, so trial court has no sua sponte duty to define]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 270-271 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897] [\u201cwhile engaged in\u201d need not be defined for purposes of felony-murder special circumstance as phrase is commonly understood and not used in technical sense]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1314-1315 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221] [where \u201cconspiracy\u201d is used in common and nontechnical sense, no definition is required]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 640 [\u201cforce and fear\u201d in robbery \u201chave no technical meaning peculiar to the law and must be presumed to be within the understanding of jurors\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 656, 668 [234 P.2d 632] [\u201cperpetrate\u201d has no technical meaning peculiar to law, so no definition required]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shoals </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 475, 489-490 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 296] [\u201copening\u201d and \u201cmaintaining\u201d a place for unlawful sale etc. of controlled substances for purposes of Health &amp; Saf.

(b) has no technical meaning and can be commonly understood, so no definition required; \u201cforce\u201d must be defined because it has a specialized meaning not readily known by average lay juror]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kimbrel </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 869, 872 [174 Cal.Rptr. 816] [\u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d is commonly understood phrase]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 992, 999 [153 Cal.Rptr. 242] [\u201camenable to treatment\u201d requires no definition in mentally disordered sex offender proceeding].) All of these cases turn not on whether the term or phrase at issue has more than one meaning, but on whether the term or phrase has a \u201ctechnical meaning peculiar to the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We are cited to no authority, nor are we aware of any, which holds that the word \u201cstranger\u201d has a technical meaning in law such that it must be expressly defined for the jury. We conclude that, at least when used in the context of a section 1203.066 allegation, \u201cstranger\u201d is a commonly understood term and the jury therefore need not be instructed on its definition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 871 [252 Cal.Rptr. 698] is helpful. In that case, the defendant was found to have made friends with the victim for the purpose of molesting her, within the meaning of section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(3). Among other things, the defendant claimed the trial court should have given the jury a definition of the words \u201cmaking friends.\u201d The Court of Appeal disagreed: \u201cThe trial court does not err in refusing to define words which are of common usage and have no special meaning. [Citation.] Ordinary words and phrases in statutes require no definition because they are presumed to be understood by jurors. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Thompson, supra, </em>at p. 883.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Appellant seeks to distinguish <em>Thompson </em>on the grounds that \u201cmaking friends\u201d is not an ambiguous term, and jurors would be expected to know its meaning. By contrast, he says, \u201cstranger\u201d has numerous definitions, some of which are favorable to him and some of which are not. However, an examination of Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) page 911 reveals that the word \u201cfriend\u201d has numerous meanings as well, not all of which would be particularly favorable to a defendant facing a section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>1203.066, subdivision (a)(3) allegation. As the court noted in <em>Thompson, </em>\u201c \u2018[fjriends\u2019 is a common term with a variety of connotations.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 877.) Thus, the fact that \u201cstranger\u201d can be defined in more than one manner (see Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 2256) does not, without more, require it to be explained to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In dealing with the contention that subdivision (a)(3) of section 1203.066 was unconstitutionally vague, the <em>Thompson </em>court stated, \u201cThe language of subdivision (a)(3) indicates that the Legislature intended to preclude probation to offenders whose only contact with the victim was for the purpose of committing a violation of section 288 (a stranger) or, who already acquainted with the child, ingratiated himself to the child to lower the child victim\u2019s defenses to his advances ....\u2019\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d at p. 878.) The court also noted: \u201c[T]he only nonrelativehousehold member probation-eligible offender is someone who engaged in nonsubstantial nonviolent sexual conduct with a child under the age of 11 years or substantial nonviolent sexual conduct with a child between the ages of 11 and 14, and knew the child victim at the time, but did not further ingratiate himself with the child or become friendly for the purpose of committing the sexual conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellant maintains he falls within the foregoing definition of probation-eligible offenders. However, but for a fortuitous, momentary introduction to Cynthia, he was a stranger to her and admitted as much on the witness stand. We do not believe the Legislature intended to make probation-eligible someone who, like appellant, is brought into the child\u2019s home, introduced in passing, and then has virtually no further contact with the victim except for the molestation, while barring from probation eligibility a person who is brought into the victim\u2019s home and presence but who is never formally introduced to the child. We will not strain the statute to reach such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The fact a word has more than one meaning, some of which are arguably contradictory, does not, without more, mean it is not a commonly understood term and therefore must be defined for the jury. We recognize that appellant is not arguing the trial court was under a sua sponte obligation to define \u201cstranger.\u201d As the California Supreme Court has held, however, a trial court is not required to instruct on the meaning of a commonly understood term and does not err in refusing a requested instruction which attempts to define such a word or phrase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 54-55 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>IV., V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Thaxter, J., and Buckley, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Appellant\u2019s true name is apparently Forbes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-14\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b427-15\">The section 1203.066 allegation was subsequently dismissed as to count II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-16\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 599.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b427-17\">Subdivision (a)(3) of section 1203.066 prohibits the granting of probation to \u201c[a] person who is convicted of a violation of Section 288 or 288.5 and who was a stranger to the child victim or befriended the child victim for the purpose of committing an act in violation of Section 288 or 288.5, unless the defendant honestly and reasonably believed the victim was 14 years of age or older.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">It is unclear how separate the rooms actually were.
