L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The employee sustained an injury to his back on November 6, 1989, and received total incapacity compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. On December 4, 1991, the insurer filed Form 108 of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department), a form entitled \u201cInsurer\u2019s Request for Reduction, Suspension or Discontinuance of Compensation.\u201d As the factual basis for its request, the insurer typed in, \u201cdisability ended based on the October 30, 1991 report of Dr. Robert Levine.\u201d After lengthy proceedings set out in the margin, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an administrative judge found that the employee was only partially disabled and had some earning capacity. Accordingly, the payments of the insurer were reduced. The administrative judge, however, ordered the payment of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Section 13A(5) of c. 152, note 1, supra, requires payment of such fees if the employee \u201cprevails,\u201d and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4), see note 2, <em>supra, </em>states that the employee shall be deemed to have prevailed \u201cwhen compensation is ordered or is not discontinued.\u201d Claiming that it was the prevailing party as it achieved a reduction in payments, the insurer appealed to the reviewing board. The reviewing board affirmed the award of the legal fee, and the insurer now appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">While recognizing that a strict reading of the regulation, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>would sustain the fee award because compensation was not \u201cdiscontinued\u201d but only reduced, the insurer argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>that the regulation cannot be upheld as it is inconsistent with the statute which provides for fees only if the employee prevails. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Although an agency\u2019s regulation is entitled to great weight, see <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 41 (1996), and cases cited, at first blush the insurer\u2019s position appears to have merit. In workers\u2019 compensation cases, however, the employee is considered the prevailer if he \u201csucceeds on any significant litigation issue, achieving \u2018some of the benefit\u2019 sought in the controversy.\u201d <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 38 (1996) (citation omitted). See <em>Bardon Trimount, Inc. </em>v. <em>Guyott, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 764, 779 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Here, although the insurer claims that all it sought was a reduction in payments and it succeeded in that endeavor, the record shows that more was at stake. The issues in controversy listed by the administrative judge were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201c1. The extent of the employee\u2019s present disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">2. The cause of the employee\u2019s present disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The insurer by its appeal was contesting not only the extent of the employee\u2019s disability but also its causal relationship to the accident. The employee\u2019s entire entitlement to compensation was thus placed in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Given the issues raised by the insurer\u2019s appeal from the conference order and the administrative judge\u2019s findings of partial disability and causal relationship, the employee prevailed within the meaning of \u00a7 13A(5). Compensation was not discontinued. See <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 37; Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 12.4, at 357 (Koziol Supp. 2000). Had the administrative judge found that the employee was not disabled at all \u2014 a finding that in theory was possible despite Dr. Levine\u2019s opinion \u2014 or, alternatively, had the administrative judge not found that the partial disability was caused by the employee\u2019s employment, the employee would have lost all his compensation payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">We conclude that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the regulation challenged by the insurer, at least in \u2022 the circumstances of this case, where the employee succeeded on significant litigation issues, is not inconsistent with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\n<em>Decision dated December 2, 1997, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-13\">In relevant part, \u00a7 13A(5) provides: \u201cWhenever an insurer files a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and . . . (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing the insurer shall pay a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">(Pursuant to \u00a7 13A[10], this fee is subject to change; its calculation is derived under c. 152, \u00a7 34B[a]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-15\">That regulation, effective on May 8, 1992, provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any proceeding before the division of dispute resolution, the claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed, for the purposes of M.G.L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(1)-(3), when compensation is ordered or is not discontinued at such proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>As pointed out in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 37 n.5 (1996), former \u00a7 13A(3) is now \u00a7 13A(5), so it appears that the regulation is still intended to apply to appeals of conference orders. This is also the view of the Department of Industrial Accidents. <em>Columbo\u2019s Case, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 459 (1997). The present regulation, effective January 10, 1997, refers to \u00a7 13A, without mention of any subparagraph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\">The insurer\u2019s request for reduction, suspension or discontinuance was denied pursuant to a conference order; the insurer appealed; a hearing was held before an administrative judge who authorized partial incapacity payments pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35; the employee appealed; the reviewing board ruled the findings concerning the assignment of earning capacity inadequate and recommitted the case for further findings. Since the matter was remanded, the reviewing board also asked the administrative judge to address the insurer\u2019s claims that the employee did not prevail and that the insurer should not have to pay the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the administrative judge in his first decision. On remand, the administrative judge reduced his previous finding of earning capacity, a reduction which resulted in a higher payment to the employee. He again awarded the employee attorney\u2019s fees without any discussion of the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\">The insurer, according to the administrative judge, also urged denial of the employee\u2019s entitlement to \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30 benefits. We need not reach the question whether, where no specific award was sought or ordered, the decision that generally ordered entitlement to such benefits is to be considered in determining whether the employee prevailed. See <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 42; Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 12.4, at 358 (Koziol Supp. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
