L. c. 152, to the allowance of his claim for temporary total incapacity benefits under \u00a7 34 of that statute. Section 51A provides that in \u201cany claim in which no compensation has been paid prior to the final decision on such claim, said final decision shall take into consideration the compensation provided by statute on the date of the decision, rather than the date of the injury.\u201d Because we find reasonable the board\u2019s interpretation that \u00a7 51A was not applicable to the circumstances of this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\"><em>The facts. </em>The essential facts are not in dispute. In 1989 Dar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ryl Conte, a resident of New Hampshire, entered into a contract with P.A.N. Construction Co. (PAN), a New Jersey employer, to paint a water tower located in New Jersey. While working in New Jersey, in August, 1989, Conte fell from the tower, suffered severe injuries, and became disabled. PAN\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), promptly accepted liability and began to pay weekly temporary total incapacity benefits in accordance with the provisions of New Jersey\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:15-12 (West 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Notwithstanding such payments, in May, 1990, Conte filed a claim with the Department of Industrial Accidents for the temporary total incapacity benefits provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, which were higher than the benefits provided under the New Jersey statute. Conte contended that he had been working in New Jersey pursuant to a contract for hire that had been entered into in Massachusetts and, hence, Massachusetts had concurrent jurisdiction over the matter. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. Conte\u2019s claim initially was denied by an administrative judge, but on August 28, 1995, the reviewing board reversed and ordered Aetna to pay weekly \u00a7 34 benefits. The reviewing board allowed Aetna credit for the payments it had previously made pursuant to the New Jersey statute, but did not consider the possible application of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Aetna thereafter paid Conte an additional $42,157.43, which it calculated by multiplying the Massachusetts rate in effect at the time of Conte\u2019s injury ($444.20) by the maximum number of weeks permitted under \u00a7 34, as in effect prior to St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 59 (260), and then subtracting from the total ($115,492) what had already been paid under the New Jersey statute ($73,334.57). On February 15, 1996, Conte filed an additional claim seeking, among other things, an upward adjustment of the applicable Massachusetts compensation rate (from $444.20 to $585.86 per week) pursuant to \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">An administrative judge rejected this claim and the reviewing board affirmed, reasoning that Aetna\u2019s payment of temporary total incapacity payments pursuant to the New Jersey statute from the date of Conte\u2019s injury rendered \u00a7 51A inapplicable. The board noted particularly that application of \u00a7 51A in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>circumstances would \u201cunjustifiably penalize the insurer,\u201d even though it had promptly provided for the employee, \u201calbeit under a workers\u2019 compensation system that is not quite so beneficent as our own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 51 A, inserted by St. 1969, c. 883, \u00a7 1, states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201cIn any claim in which no compensation has been paid prior to the final decision on such claim, said final decision shall take into consideration the compensation provided by statute on the date of the decision, rather than the date of the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The statute \u201creflects a legislative intent to avoid obsolescence of compensation rates by requiring benefits to be computed in accordance with the statutory rate in effect at the time of the final decision, when no payments have been made during the period the claim has been contested.\u201d <em>McLeod\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 431, 435 (1983). The statute may also have been enacted to \u201cencourage insurers to make a prompt determination and payment of undisputed compensation to claimants likely to be facing fiscal problems.\u201d <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 482 n.7 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Conte acknowledges that payments were made to him during the period his claim for \u00a7 34 benefits was being contested, but contends that these payments must be disregarded for purposes of \u00a7 51A since they were paid pursuant to the New Jersey rather than the Massachusetts statute. Specifically, Conte contends that the word \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in \u00a7 51A must refer to compensation paid under the Massachusetts statute, rather than the statute of some other State. He concludes that, because no compensation was paid to him under the Massachusetts statute until the board rendered its decision allowing such claim, he is entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">There is nothing in \u00a7 51A which compels such a result. The statute refers unqualifiedly to \u201ccompensation\u201d and does not exclude or disqualify compensation paid pursuant to the statute of another State, rather than pursuant to G. L. c. 152. Indeed, as the reviewing board implicitly recognized in allowing Aetna to have credit for its payments under the New Jersey statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>where, as here, the same injury is involved, compensation paid under the statute of another State is the equivalent of compensation paid under G. L. c. 152. See <em>McLaughlin\u2019s </em>Case, 274 Mass. 217, 222 (1931) (requiring deduction of New Hampshire worker\u2019s compensation benefits from subsequent award under G. L. c. 152 to avoid \u201cdouble compensation\u201d of employee). Contrast <em>Gould\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 66, 72 (1968) (payments under employer\u2019s private disability plan not deductible from award under G. L. c. 152); <em>Gordon\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 926 n.3 (1988) (employer\u2019s payments under private wage continuation and medical plans not \u201ccompensation\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 51A).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Because, under well-settled principles, compensation paid under the statute of another State is the equivalent of compensation paid under G. L. c. 152, we think it would exalt form over substance to construe \u00a7 51A in the manner Conte suggests. See <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Ogorzalek, </em>372 Mass. 271, 274 (1977) (\u201cthe purpose and not the letter of a statute controls\u201d). The statute on its face applies only in cases where \u201cno compensation\u201d has been paid prior to the final decision on a claim. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Conte\u2019s reliance on <em>Mugford\u2019s Case, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 928 (1998), is misplaced. In that case, unlike here, the claimant presented a claim for permanent total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, while an insurer was paying him temporary total disabihty benefits under \u00a7 34. Since the insurer contested the separate claim under \u00a7 34A, and made none of the payments called for by that section while the claim was pending, we held that the board had properly applied \u00a7 51A when it ultimately allowed the claim. Here, in contrast, by the time Conte\u2019s claim for \u00a7 34 benefits was allowed, he had already received substantial payments made under the similar provision of the New Jersey statute. We think the reviewing board could reasonably find that this was enough to render \u00a7 51A inapplicable to the \u00a7 34 benefits Conte received. See <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 482 (\u00a7 51A not applicable to claim by decedent\u2019s widow for special death benefits provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A, where insurer had been paying widow weekly death benefits provided by \u00a7 31 of the statute since date of her husband\u2019s death).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Mindful of our obligation to accord substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute committed to its charge so long as such interpretation is reasonable, <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Newton, </em>425 Mass. 468, 470 (1997), we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
