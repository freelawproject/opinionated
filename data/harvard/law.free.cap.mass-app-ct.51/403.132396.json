Volungis, Jr.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-15\">Cypher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIa\">On February 3, 1992, the night before John Volungis (John) was scheduled to leave town for active military duty, he was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant. No one has been charged in the crime. Bridget Diorio-Volungis (Bridget), John\u2019s widow and the sole beneficiary of John\u2019s $150,000 life insurance policy, attempted to collect the proceeds. Linda Marie Volungis (Linda), John\u2019s mother and administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of John\u2019s estate, contested the claim, alleging that Bridget was complicit in John\u2019s murder. Continental Assurance Company, the issuer of the policy, filed a complaint for interpleader in Superior Court to resolve the dispute. Linda filed a cross claim against Bridget incorporating her allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The cross claim went to a jury trial on the sole question, \u201cHas plaintiff, Linda Marie Volungis, proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant Bridget D[i]orio Volungis was an accessory before the fact of the murder of John E. Volungis, Jr.?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The judge allowed Bridget\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>concluding that \u201cthere was no basis in the evidence upon which the jury could have found that [Bridget] even knew that a crime was going to be committed, let alone hired or procured someone to commit murder.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal from the final judgment awarding the policy proceeds to Bridget, Linda challenges the judge\u2019s decision on Bridget\u2019s motion as well as certain other rulings to be described later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We first consider whether the evidence, in the light most favorable to Linda and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, reasonably could have supported a verdict for Linda. See <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. Boersner, 413 Mass. 432, 438 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">1. <em>The facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In the light most favorable to Linda, the evidence established the following facts. In February, 1992, Bridget, age 33, and John, age 21, had been married for fourteen months. They had been separated \u201coff and on\u201d during their marriage. During one of these separations, Bridget dated another man. In mid-September 1991, they were separated, although Bridget, who was called as a witness by Linda, testified that they \u201cwent together\u201d throughout the separation. Depending on his work schedule, John spent half of his time at his parents\u2019 home and half of his time at Bridget\u2019s home, until the separation ended in January, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">John worked two part-time jobs and received a monthly check from the army reserve. He contributed, although not significantly, to the financial well-being of Bridget and her children from a previous marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>On the morning of January 9, 1992, Bridget telephoned her insurance agent, Donald Dunnigan, and asked him to prepare some life insurance proposals. She told him that her husband would be leaving in a short period of time and so the sooner she and Dunnigan could meet, the better. Dunnigan prepared several whole life and term life proposals, ranging from $100,000 to $250,000 in coverage, as specified by Bridget.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Dunnigan presented the proposals to Bridget and John that evening. Bridget decided that they would each purchase a ten-year policy for term life insurance in the amount of $150,000. Bridget and John completed the applications and named each other as beneficiaries. Bridget gave Dunnigan the premium payments in cash and Dunnigan made separate receipts for them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On Friday, January 31, 1992, some three days before John\u2019s death, Nancy Zumpfe, a manager at Insurance Marketing Agencies, answered a telephone call for Dunnigan on a shared telephone system. According to Zumpfe, the caller wanted to know if the fife insurance policies for her and her husband were in effect. After determining that the caller was Bridget and gathering other information about the policy, Zumpfe advised her to call the insurance company directly and provided her with a telephone number. Bridget did not mention that she had received checks from the insurance company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Zumpfe had never received a telephone call like this one during her nine years of experience working at Insurance Marketing Agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">On February 3, 1992, the night before John was scheduled to leave for six months of active military duty, Bridget made three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>or four telephone calls to John at his parent\u2019s home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first and second time she called, John was not home so she spoke with his sister, April Volungis (April). The third or fourth time she called, she spoke with Linda. John walked into his mother\u2019s house during this call and Linda handed him the telephone. Bridget told John that she would be able to pick him up to bring him home that night. April had expected to drive John to Bridget\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">At 5:00 p.m., Bridget left work and went to her son\u2019s basketball game. Shortly after arriving at the game, Bridget went home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She did not notice anything amiss. While there she \u201cused the [telephone\u201d but did not make any outgoing calls. After eight to ten minutes, Bridget left through the garage and returned to the basketball game. She remembered watching the automated garage door close, but could not recall if she had locked the door leading from the garage into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">After the game, Bridget drove a relative home and then brought her children and one of their friends to the friend\u2019s house. Sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m., Bridget picked up John at his parents\u2019 house and drove him to her house, dropping him off in the driveway and opening the garage door for him with her remote device. At approximately 7:40 p.m., Bridget picked up her children from their friend\u2019s house and brought them to her sister\u2019s house, where Bridget h\u00e1d arranged for her nephew to babysit that night. There had been some discussion earlier in the day between Bridget and her sister concerning how late Bridget might be out and whether the children should spend the night. Bridget spoke with the people in her sister\u2019s house before she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Approximately forty-five minutes after dropping John off at her house, Bridget returned home to find John lying in a pool of blood. He had been stabbed multiple times. Bridget ran next door to her brother\u2019s house, but no one was home. She ran to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>second neighbor, but again, no one was home. She ran across the street to a third neighbor and told him to call \u201c9-1-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Bridget went to the police department that night and spoke with the police. She answered all of their questions, detailing her activities that day and providing information about John. Bridget left the police station at 4:00 a.m. the next morning and returned home. Bridget discovered that the telephones in her home were missing. Bridget never spoke to the police again and never called to inquire about the status of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">April testified that, on January 8, 1992, John told her that Bridget wanted him to take out a life insurance policy and that if anything happened to him, April should go to the police and tell them that his wife had him killed. April advised him not to sign the insurance application, but John replied that he would be safer if he signed it and just went away.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Linda testified that, on January 9, 1992, John told her that he had to go to Bridget\u2019s house to sign an insurance policy. He said that he had to do it or he could not go back to Bridget and that \u201cthere was going to be a contract put out on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">John had problems with a person at work. On Thursday, January, 30, 1992, five days before he was murdered, John had testified in court against this person in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">To sustain the finding that Bridget was an accessory before the fact to John\u2019s murder, Linda had to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (1) that someone other than Bridget murdered John<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (2) that Bridget aided, counseled, hired, or otherwise procured the murder to be committed; and. (3) that Bridget did so with the same intent the principal would have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>have had to have been found guilty of murder (i.e., malice).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[Wjhat is required to be convicted as an accessory before the fact is not only knowledge of the crime and a shared intent to bring it about, but also some sort of act that contributes to its happening.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>413 Mass. 182, 185 (1992). \u201c[M]ere knowledge that a crime is to be committed, even when coupled with subsequent concealment of the completed crime, does not make one guilty as an accessory before the fact. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>357 Mass. 149, 151 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As the trial judge noted, there was \u201cample evidence from which the jurors could have concluded that [Bridget] had a motive to have her husband killed, and took actions that contributed, even if unknowingly and unintentionally, to the killing.\u201d To determine whether Bridget took those actions with the knowledge and intent that John would be killed depends on the inferences that may be drawn from the evidence. Inferences \u201cmust be based on probabilities rather than possibilities and cannot be the result of mere speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Cambridgeport Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boersner, </em>413 Mass. at 438, quoting from <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 706-707 n.3 (1990). An inference may be based on another inference, provided the inference is not speculative. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dostie, </em>425 Mass. 372, 375-376 &amp; n.6 (1997), citing lAWigmore, Evidence \u00a7 41 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Linda urges us to consider the following \u201ccombination of circumstances\u201d when determining whether she proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Bridget aided the principal with the knowledge that John would be killed and that she shared the intent of the principal. The marriage was brief and troubled; Bridget dated another man while separated from John; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>John believed that Bridget would have him- killed<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>; Bridget recently purchased life insurance on John, despite the fact that he contributed little to her financial security; shortly before John\u2019s murder, Bridget was concerned whether the policy was in effect; Bridget\u2019s conduct in the hours before John\u2019s death, in leaving her son\u2019s basketball game and going home for eight to ten minutes, and in later driving John home but not going into the house with him, was suspicious.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">While it is appropriate to consider whether in the evidence any combination of circumstances could be found from which reasonable inferences could be drawn, <em>Anthony H. </em>v. <em>John G., </em>415 Mass. 196, 199 (1993), the plaintiff must establish the essential elements of the claim \u201ceither by direct evidence or rational inference of probabilities from established facts.\u201d <em>Zezuski </em>v. <em>Jenny Mfg. Co., </em>363 Mass. 324, 329 (1973), quoting from <em>Bigwood </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; N. St. Ry. Co., </em>209 Mass. 345, 348 (1911). If a necessary part of the case is left to pure speculation, or if a vital portion of proof is established by a mere scintilla of evidence, then the plaintiff has not met the burden of proof. See Hartmann v. Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., 323 Mass. 56, 59 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Linda\u2019s argument is seductive. Upon examination, however, it proves to be circular. The inference that Bridget\u2019s actions in going home for a short period of time and later driving John home constituted \u201caid\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2, is premised upon the evidence establishing that Bridget had a motive to have John killed and depends on Bridget knowing that John would be killed. In turn, the inference that Bridget knew John would be killed is predicated on the fact that she drove him home, coupled with her motive to have him killed. Thus, the trial judge correctly concluded that such evidence \u201cdoes not permit the jury to infer, other than by speculation, that [Bridget] had any knowledge, beforehand or at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the crime, that her husband would be murdered.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>356 Mass. 574, 578-579 (1970) (inference that defendant intended to sell heroin was probable based on amount of heroin found; but inference that defendant intended to sell morphine based on inference of intent to sell heroin, where only a small amount of morphine was found, was merely a possibility); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 664 n.4 (1981) (discussing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra, </em>as providing an example of difference between speculation and reasonable inference). Compare <em>Kontos </em>v. <em>Kontos, </em>968 F. Supp. 400, 403, 409 (S.D. Ind. 1997) (summary judgment granted in favor of wife of insured decedent where secondary beneficiary did not establish sufficient evidence of a genuine issue of material fact as to wife\u2019s complicity in husband\u2019s murder, even in light of evidence of motive and suspicious circumstances), with <em>Cora Pub, Inc. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>619 F.2d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 1980) (circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish that defendant committed arson where inferences were adequately established in evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The judge properly allowed Bridget\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">3. <em>Remaining issues, </em>a. Public record exemption for investigation materials. Before trial, the district attorney for the middle district moved to quash Linda\u2019s subpoena for testimony and records from the Worcester police department regarding the criminal investigation of John\u2019s death. The basis of the motion was that the information was protected from disclosure by the common law investigatory privilege<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the statutory exemption to the public records law for investigatory material, G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(f) </em>(exempting \u201cinvestigatory materials necessarily compiled out of the public view by law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>or other investigatory officials the disclosure of which materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest\u201d), inserted by St. 1973, c. 1050, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The judge proceeded as though Linda had sought a judicial remedy after following the administrative procedures specified in the public records law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge held a voir dire of the investigating detective whom Linda sought to call as a witness, using for guidance the analysis set forth in <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>419 Mass. 852 (1995), to determine whether the investigatory exemption applied.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The assistant district attorney questioned the detective and elicited sufficient detail to support the judge\u2019s conclusion that investigation, was ongoing,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that the police had not disclosed investigation information to the press, and that disclosure would prejudice the open investigation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There was no error, as the testimony of the detective met the burden of proving with specificity that the exemption applied. See <em>id. </em>at 857 (government agency refusing to comply with disclosure request has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>burden of proving \u201cwith specificity\u201d that information requested is within statutory exemption to disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Linda does not point to any error in the findings or rulings of the judge, but claims only that the assistant district attorney\u2019s affidavit in support of the motion to quash was inadequate to support the judge\u2019s ruling and, therefore, that the judge should have conducted an inspection of the file in camera. Linda ignores the voir dire testimony of the officer. Here, where the judge credited the officer\u2019s detailed testimony, an inspection in camera was not required. Contrast <em>id. </em>at 856 n.5 (judge declined to accept testimony of police officer as determinative on issue whether investigatory exemption applied, and conducted an inspection in camera). There was no error. See <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 61 (1976) (reviewing court will reverse determination that investigatory exemption applies only where findings are clearly erroneous or rulings are tainted with error of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">b. Exclusion of testimony by Bridget\u2019s attorney in the criminal investigation concerning whether he told the police not to contact her. Linda also claims that the judge erred in excluding, on the grounds of attorney-client privilege, the testimony of an attorney who had represented Bridget with regard to the investigation of John\u2019s murder. Linda does not appear to understand the basis for the judge\u2019s ruling. Although the attorney asserted attorney-client privilege during a voir dire and the judge carefully considered whether the attorney-client privilege applied, the judge found the proffer insufficient and instead excluded the evidence on the grounds that the testimony Linda sought to introduce was inadmissible hearsay and not sufficiently material. As Linda does not challenge the judge\u2019s ruling on these grounds, we do not address the issue any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The judge framed this special verdict question for the jury pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 13; G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 13; and Mass.R.Civ.P. 39, 365 Mass. 801 (1974). He arrived at the form of the question as follows. At a pretrial conference, Linda\u2019s counsel indicated that she sought a jury trial, in which she would prove not that Bridget was the principal or a joint venturer in the murder, but only that she was an accessory before the fact. Linda\u2019s theory was that a civil finding that Bridget was an accessory before the fact, standing alone, would bar Bridget from receiving the insurance proceeds under <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>245 Mass. 565, 567 (1923), which held that public policy prohibits \u201ca beneficiary who has feloniously taken the life of the insured\u201d from recovering on the insurance policy. (Citing <em>id. </em>at 568, Linda further contends the proceeds should pass to John\u2019s estate because the policy names no contingent beneficiary.) Linda\u2019s counsel assented to bearing the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Although the parties agreed to be characterized as plaintiff and defendant to simplify matters for the jury, Bridget disagreed in the main with Linda\u2019s approach. Bridget raised three major arguments: (1) that trial should be before a judge rather than a jury because the claim was equitable in nature; (2) that proof of the claim should be by clear and convincing evidence; and (3) that even if Linda proved Bridget an accessory before the fact in a civil trial, that would not satisfy the test set out in <em>Slocum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The judge ruled against Bridget on the first two issues, but reserved decision on Bridget\u2019s last point of law, preferring first to submit to the jury the factual question of Bridget\u2019s accessory status. In light of his later allowance of Bridget\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, he never ruled on the reserved point. Likewise, we express no opinion on that subject. Additionally, the propriety of the judge\u2019s rulings on standard of proof and the use of a jury trial is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Linda\u2019s claim that Bridget\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was procedurally defective under Mass.R.Civ.R 50, 365 Mass. 814 (1974), is without merit. At a sidebar conference, Linda stated that she intended to rest. Bridget indicated that she would immediately rest without presenting any evidence, and moved for a directed verdict. The judge denied the motion and then both parties rested in open court. Upon consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge deemed a motion for directed verdict to have been made after each party rested, and noted that he had, for convenience, handled the motion at sidebar just before the parties rested in open court. See <em>Wells Real Estate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, </em>850 F.2d 803, 810 n.7 (1st Cir. 1988) (failure to repeat motion for directed verdict not fatal where such motion would be superfluous). Cf. <em>King </em>v. <em>G &amp; M Realty Corp., </em>373 Mass. 658, 659 n.3 (1977). Contrast <em>Michnik-Zilberman </em>v. <em>Gordon\u2019s Liquor, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 6, 8-9 (1983); <em>Dalrymple </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 611, 618-619 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-12\">Linda was not limited under her accessory theory to proving that Bridget procured or hired the principal. Aiding or counseling the principal would also be sufficient, provided Bridget did so with the requisite knowledge and intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>413 Mass. 182, 185 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 779 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">A paramedical professional later examined Bridget and John in connection with their applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Although not relevant to our analysis under the applicable standard, we include some information for background understanding. Bridget testified that she had telephoned the insurance agency because both she and John received checks from the insurance company, one for approximately thirty dollars and one for approximately seven dollars and she was not sure what to do with them. She was told to call the home office and given a telephone number. She denied that she inquired whether the policy was in force. As a result of her conversation with customer service, Bridget deposited her check and left John\u2019s check for him. At trial, John\u2019s check and envelope were received as exhibits. On the back of the envelope, in Bridget\u2019s handwriting, was an \u201c800\u201d number for customer service in Tennessee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Bridget testified that she and John had discussed \u201ctwo different options of what would be going on that night\u201d and she wanted him to know she would be able to pick him up.

As of the date of the trial in June, 1997, the investigation was considered open and active.

After the assistant district attorney finished questioning the officer, both counsel declined the opportunity to cross-examine. The judge indicated his willingness to reconsider the issue if Linda could establish that the police had revealed information to the press about the investigation, but Linda did not further pursue the matter except to renew her original arguments in opposition to the motion to quash.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
