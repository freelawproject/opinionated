We vacate the order and allow the motion. There was a fatal error in the conduct of the colloquy between judge and defendant leading to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">On August 5, 1994, and October 26, 1994, respectively, the defendant was complained of in Waltham District Court, No. 9451 CR 2091, for larceny over $250, and in No. 9451 CR 3053, for writing a forged instrument, forgery, larceny over $250, and larceny under $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>On the date set for trial, January 30, 1995, the defendant appeared in Cambridge District Court with his appointed counsel present. The presiding judge, addressing herself to the defendant, went through several questions conventionally put to persons intending to plead, and the defendant made responses as expected. When the judge said the Commonwealth had facts it would present if the case went to trial, and she wanted the defendant to listen to those facts, the prosecutor interposed and said, \u201cCounsel will stipulate to the base of the complaints.\u201d The judge to the defendant: \u201cDo you understand what the complaints are, sir?\u201d She then recited the charges, \u201cOne complaint is larceny of property over $250; do you understand that?\u201d and so for the other complaint with the four additional charges. To each complaint, the defendant said, \u201cYes.\u201d The judge said, \u201cAll right, you\u2019re willing to stipulate to the facts?\u201d Defendant: \u201cYes, I am.\u201d Judge: \u201cAnd you understand, sir, by doing so, and by entering a plea of guilty, you are admitting that the facts so stated are true.\u201d Defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d After a further conventional question, the judge accepted the plea, which was followed by discussion and imposition of sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The judge began on the right line when she said she wanted the defendant to hear a statement of the facts the Commonwealth would present at trial if the defendant did not plead \u2014 i.e., the defendant\u2019s acts comprising each of the offenses charged. Upon the Commonwealth\u2019s interposition, the defendant heard only a recitation of the names or titles of those crimes, and was taken to have \u201cstipulated\u201d to unstated facts supposed to \u201cbase\u201d the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 714 (1997), controls. In that case the judge asked counsel \u201cif they would waive the reading of the facts into the record, to which they assented, agreeing to \u2018plead to the faces of the complaints as they exist and appear before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715. The procedure used in the present case differs only in inconsequential detail from that in <em>Correa, </em>and the vice in both was that the judge \u201cfailed to ascertain that [the defendant] had knowledge of the elements of the charges against him .... Nothing more need be shown to establish the inadequacy of the colloquy for constitutional purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, citing <em>Hender</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645-646 (1976), and other authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The Commonwealth notes that in <em>Correa </em>it was the judge, not the prosecutor, who initiated the faulty procedure, but this can hardly serve as a ground for \u201cdistinguishing\u201d <em>Correa. </em>The Commonwealth seems to suggest that, as defense counsel was present during the colloquy, it should be assumed he had fully apprised the defendant. Such an assumption is unwarranted. Cf. <em>Correa </em>at 717 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea is vacated, and an order shall enter allowing the motion. The judgments are reversed and the findings are set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Judgment of conviction was dated February 16, 1995. The defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea was filed on December 30, 1997, and denied by the same judge, without a hearing, on January 27, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We said in <em>Correa, supra, </em>\u201cThere must be an explanation by the judge or defense counsel of the elements of the crimes charged or an admission by the defendant to the facts constituting those crimes. . . . This requirement can be satisfied in one of several ways: (1) by the judge explaining to the defendant the elements of the crime; (2) by counsel\u2019s representation that she has explained to the defendant the elements he admits by his plea; or, (3) by the defendant\u2019s stated admission to facts recited during the colloquy which constitute the unexplained elements.\u201d 43 Mass. App. Ct. at 717. (Citations omitted.) See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>396 Mass. 234, 236 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>431 Mass. 442, 450-452 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">In contrast to <em>Correa, </em>it has been held that a judge\u2019s omission to advise under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, about the possible effect of pleading guilty upon the person\u2019s immigration status is not, without more, a ground for withdrawing the plea. See par. 2 of \u00a7 29D; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 659 n.2 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahadeo, </em>397 Mass. 314, 315 n.l (1986) (\u201cjudgment will only be vacated, pursuant to ... \u00a7 29D, \u2018[i]f the Court fails to . . . advise the defendant [regarding immigration consequences] <em>and </em>he later at any time shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences .. .\u2019 \u201d [emphasis supplied]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 49-50 (2000) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
