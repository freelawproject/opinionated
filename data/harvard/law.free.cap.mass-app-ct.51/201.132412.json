He had a little over six years of creditable State service. Thereafter, the plaintiff left his accumulated deductions in the retirement system for six additional years until, in April of 1996, he applied to the State Board of Retirement for a retirement allowance to take effect on his fifty-fifth birthday, in June of that year. His application was denied because he had less than the ten years of creditable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>service required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5(l)(m). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The denial was upheld by the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) and then by a judgment of the Superior Court. This appeal ensued, in which the plaintiff asserts that CRAB\u2019s decision was incorrect because he was eligible for an allowance under an earlier-enacted statutory provision, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(\u00bf&gt;), that requires only six years of service.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Put in terms of the applicable standard of review (which we draw from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7]), the question before us is whether CRAB made an error of law in concluding that \u00a7 <em>5(l)(m) </em>rather than \u00a7 10(2)(\u00bf&gt;) governed the plaintiff\u2019s application. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">None dispute that the plaintiff falls within the literal scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(h), inserted by St. 1951, c. 784, \u00a7 1, and as amended through St. 1973, c. 1041:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cAny member classified in Group 1, Group 2 or Group 4, who has completed six or more years of creditable service, and who, before attaining age fifty-five ... is removed or discharged from his office or position without moral turpitude on his part ... or any such member whose office or position is abolished, who leaves his accumulated total deductions in the [retirement system], shall have the right upon attaining age fifty-five, or at any time thereafter, to apply for a <em>termination retirement allowance </em>.... Such allowance shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of [\u00a7 5], or the provisions of any other section governing superannuation retirement applicable to such member ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">On the other hand, the more recently enacted G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5(l)(m), inserted by St. 1977, c. 744, and as amended through St. 1991, c. 138, \u00a7 385, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, any member classified in Group 1 or Group 2, except for elected officials subject to the provisions of [\u00a7 10(2)(h)], whose employment first commenced on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>after [January 1, 1978], and who has not completed ten or more years of creditable service before attaining the mandatory age requirements of this chapter . . . shall on the termination of his employment be entitled to a return of his accumulated deductions with interest. Such return of said accumulated deductions shall be in lieu of any <em>superannuation retirement allowance </em>provided under this chapter\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Because the plaintiff was classified in Group 1, was not an elected official, was first relevantly employed after 1978, and had not completed ten years of creditable service, the literal application of \u00a7 5(l)(m) has two direct consequences. First, the plaintiff on the termination of his employment was entitled to a return of his accumulated deductions with interest. Second, such return was to be in lieu of \u201cany superannuation retirement allowance\u201d under c. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The plaintiff posits that, because he did not seek a \u201csuperannuation retirement allowance,\u201d but a \u201ctermination retirement allowance\u201d under \u00a7 10(2)(h), he is unaffected by the plain language of \u00a7 5(l)(m). To support his view that CRAB ignored a statutory separateness in the two allowances, he points to enacted subject headings in sections 5 and 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The heading of \u00a7 5 is \u201cSuperannuation Retirement\u201d and under \u00a7 10 (the heading of which is \u201cResignation, Failure of Re-election or Reappointment, Removal or Discharge\u201d), the subheading of \u00a7 10(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is \u201cRight to a Superannuation Retirement Allowance\u201d while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>that of \u00a7 10(2) is \u201cRight to a Termination Retirement Allowance.\u201d St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, the plaintiff notes, the body of \u00a7 10(1) speaks of a \u201csuperannuation retirement allowance\u201d and that of \u00a7 10(2) refers only to a \u201ctermination retirement allowance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Nevertheless, it is far from plain that the \u00a7 5(l)(m) reference to \u201cany superannuation retirement allowance\u201d under c. 32 cannot include a \u00a7 10(2)(6) \u201ctermination retirement allowance\u201d under the circumstances: where neither phrase is defined in the statute; where \u00a7 5(1 <em>)(m) </em>was enacted later than, not contemporaneously with, \u00a7 10; where the minimum age of fifty-five to receive a \u00a7 <em>10(2)(b) </em>allowance is also generally the age of earliest superannuation retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5(l)(a); and where the \u00a7 <em>10(2)(b) </em>allowance is to be \u201cdetermined in accordance with the provisions of [\u00a7 5], or the provisions of any other [applicable] section governing superannuation retirement.\u201d \u00a7 10(2)(6). Additionally, much as the title of an act cannot limit its operation to a field more narrow than that established by the act itself, see <em>Perlera </em>v. <em>Vining Disposal Serv., Inc., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498 (1999), the various headings cited cannot control the specifics of the statutory provisions, although they may shed light on ambiguous language, see <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 474, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>cert, denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think some ambiguity inheres in the legislative phraseology, and therefore also explore other sources of statutory insight. Cf. <em>Bay Colony Mktg. Co. </em>v. <em>Fruit Salad, Inc., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 666 n.5 (1996) (title \u201cnot conclusive as to [act\u2019s] ambiguities\u201d). For several reasons we think a reasonable interpretation is that the \u201ctermination\u201d retirement allowance set out in \u00a7 10(2)(b) counts as a subspecies of \u201cany superannuation retirement allowance\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 5(l)(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">First, that \u00a7 <em>10(2){b) </em>stands affected by \u00a7 5(l)(m) is suggested by the latter\u2019s applicability \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of [c. 32] to the contrary,\u201d cf. <em>Police Dept. of Boston </em>v. <em>Fedorchuk, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546-547 (2000), and confirmed by the explicit invocation of \u00a7 5 in \u00a7 10(2)(\u00bf&gt;). The plaintiff argues the latter reference incorporates only the retirement allowance calculation method in \u00a7 5(2). If that were so, the Legislature could have restricted its language to that particular subsection, much as it did in referring specifically to \u00a7 5(2) in \u00a7 10(1). See note 5, supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s proposal to focus on \u00a7 5(2) rather than on all relevant provisions of \u00a7 5 would require us to overlook plain statutory language, contrary to settled principle. See <em>Retirement Bd. of Concord </em>v. <em>Colleran, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 488-489 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Second, and looming large in our analysis, \u00a7 5(l)(m) contains an exception for \u201celected officials subject to the provisions of [\u00a7 10(2)(\u00bf)].\u201d If, as the plaintiff suggests, \u00a7 5(l)(m) were not applicable to members qualifying for the \u201ctermination\u201d allowance of \u00a7 10(2)(6), the exception would be superfluous. \u201cIf a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions . . . .\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Finally, in construing the retirement statute, we habitually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>refrain from substituting our judgment for that of CRAB where its interpretation is reasonable. See <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., supra </em>at 375; <em>Hosking </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 712 (2000). We find nothing unreasonable in reading the subsequently enacted language of \u00a7 5(l)(m), \u201cany[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] superannuation retirement allowance provided under this chapter,\u201d to encompass the \u201ctermination\u201d retirement allowance of \u00a7 10(2)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">. Ultimately, the plaintiff received a return of his accumulated deductions and interest thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s alternate claim, of reasonable reliance on the advice of his superior that he was eligible for a retirement allowance, was unsuccessful below and has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Though not cited by the plaintiff, the disjunctive references to these allowances in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(6)(e), (/), also may lend a measure of support to his view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 10(1), as amended through St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7 18, states in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201cAny member [of Group 1, 2, or 4 who meets criteria generally involving resignation, failure of re-election or reappointment, or removal or discharge], shall, upon his written application . . . receive a <em>superannuation retirement allowance </em>....

The retirement allowance of any member [of] Group 4, who is eligible to receive a <em>superannuation retirement allowance </em>under . . . this subdivision shall be determined and computed in accordance with [\u00a7 5(2)(\u00bfz), (6)] and [limited by \u00a7 5(2)(c), (d)] shall [sic] be based on such member\u2019s age and number of years and full months of creditable service on the date the retirement allowance becomes effective, provided that if such member, classified in Group 4, has not attained age forty-five on the date of his termination of service the normal yearly amount of such allowance shall be equal to that prescribed for a member classified in Group 1, and if such retirement allowance becomes effective before such member has attained age forty-five the per cent to be used in computing such allowance shall be the per cent for age forty-five as appearing in [\u00a7 5(2)(a)] with one tenth of one per cent subtracted for each year the age at last birthday preceding retirement is under age forty-five\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">We note that the jurisprudence concerning the interpretive significance of section headings seems to parallel that for the over-all titles of acts. See, e.g., <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>337 Mass. 495, 501 (1958); <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Control Commn., </em>340 Mass. 672, 678 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The Legislature\u2019s \u00a7 10(1) references to \u00a7 5(2) also are directed explicitly to how the allowance is \u201ccomputed.\u201d Section 10(2)(\u00bf&gt;), by contrast, does not use such specific language of computation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">CRAB\u2019s reading is also consistent with the Legislature\u2019s choice of the broad word \u201cany,\u201d as opposed to the mere article \u201ca,\u201d in describing the types of allowances that the return of accumulated deductions stands in lieu of.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
