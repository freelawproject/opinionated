Rawstron Rosenthal (mother), who had been adjudicated the primary custodial parent in an earlier divorce judgment, to relocate with the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>minor child from the Commonwealth. In the same proceeding, the judge changed physical custody from the mother to the defendant, Paul S. Maney (father), pursuant to his request for modification of custody. From these judgments the mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The mother claims that the change in custody was not, as is required by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, supported by a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties. She argues that neither a custodial parent\u2019s relocation, nor a temporary change in custody that was judicially imposed on the parties during the pendency of the proceedings, constitute changes warranting modification of a previously adjudicated custody arrangement. We agree. We also decide that the mother has established a \u201cgood, sincere\u201d reason for moving to Rhode Island (to join her new husband, who is employed there), evidencing a \u201creal advantage\u201d for the move. <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985) <em>(Yannas). </em>This, in combination with the judge\u2019s failure to assess or give appropriate weight to other relevant factors, requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>Background and proceedings. </em>We summarize the proceedings, setting forth \u201crelevant background facts as determined by the probate judge . . . supplemented by the record where necessary,\u201d <em>A.Z. </em>v. <em>B.Z., </em>431 Mass. 150, 151 (2000), reserving other facts for our discussion of the issues. The parties were married in Worcester on November 22, 1987, and resided during the marriage in Northborough, where their extended families, including both sets of parents, also live. Their only child, Caleb Page Maney (Caleb), was bom June 16, 1991. During the marriage, both parties provided for Caleb\u2019s care, but the mother was his \u201cprimary caretaker and [saw] to the child\u2019s daily needs.\u201d Since 1990, the mother has been employed as principal second violinist for the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, commuting to Providence from Northborough during the concert season. The father is, and was throughout the marriage, employed as a service manager for a business owned by his family. In October, 1995, the parties separated. The father moved into an apartment in his parents\u2019 home in Northborough. The mother moved with Caleb into an apartment in Shrewsbury, where Caleb attended preschool, then kindergarten. During the parties\u2019 separation, the mother began to date Perry Rosenthal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The parties were divorced by a judgment of divorce nisi entered on January 16, 1997. The divorce judgment incorporated and, with respect to child-related issues, merged the parties\u2019 agreement, which was found to be fair and reasonable by a probate judge. Under this agreement, the mother had sole physical custody of Caleb. The father was entitled to visits on alternating weekends from Friday at 5:30 p.m. until Sunday at 7:30 p.m., overnight every Monday and Wednesday, and on specified holidays and observances.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On June 23, 1997, the mother filed a complaint for modification of the divorce judgment in which she sought leave to remove Caleb from Shrewsbury, to Providence, Rhode Island. On July 4, 1997, she married Rosenthal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The father filed an answer and counterclaim to the complaint for modification on July 8, 1997, alleging that removal would limit visitation with his son, \u201cdisrupt the warm and close personal relationship between the [father] and his son and is not in his son\u2019s best interests.\u201d On this basis he requested physical custody of Caleb. On July 28, 1997, the court appointed a guardian ad litem \u201cto investigate \u2014 evaluate \u2014 and report in writing\u201d on the issues of removal and custody; \u201cto act as . . . next friend to represent [Caleb\u2019s] interests\u201d; and to act as an \u201cinvestigator to review the matter and report to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">On August 15, 1997, the mother and Rosenthal moved into the house they had purchased in Providence. On August 25, 1997, pursuant to a \u201cMotion For Further Temporary Order\u201d filed by the father requesting that the mother be prohibited from removing Caleb from the Commonwealth until the completion of the guardian ad litem\u2019s report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a hearing on the merits, the motion judge (who was also the trial judge) modified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>existing divorce judgment that gave physical custody of Caleb to the mother, and ordered that the child \u201creside with the father from Monday after school through Friday delivery to school,\u201d and with the mother on weekends. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This was a change in custody during the pendency of a complaint for modification of a prior custody order, and must therefore have been based on \u201cspecific findings of fact . . . which clearly demonstrate the injury, harm or damage that might reasonably be expected to occur if relief pending a judgment of modification is not granted.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reflects no reason for the order changing custody other than the mother\u2019s motion to remove the child to Rhode Island. The order should not have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In the mother\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the August 25 order, filed September 18, 1997, she sought reinstatement of the original custody arrangement on the basis that she would be able to reside with her parents in Northborough until a hearing on the merits, and that Caleb\u2019s schooling would therefore not be interrupted. The motion was denied without explanation by endorsement on September 26, 1997. The mother\u2019s motion requesting that Caleb temporarily be allowed to relocate to Providence was denied on October 9, 1997. Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>subsequent temporary orders, the parties established a schedule for holiday and vacation visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"AUx\">Trial on the parties\u2019 claims took place on October 2, October 5, and November 12, 1998, well over a year following the entry of the temporary order modifying custody. On January 20, 1999, the court entered a judgment denying the mother\u2019s request to relocate and modifying custody in conformity with the temporary orders already in place.</p>\n<p id=\"Aho\"><em>Modification of custody. </em>Efforts by a custodial parent to relocate a child out of the Commonwealth often give rise to a claim for custody by the parent not seeking the move. See, e.g., <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, 271 </em>Mass. 545 (1930); <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. 453 (1971); <em>Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Pitney, </em>409 Mass. 449 (1991); <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 555 (1980); <em>Signorelli </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 939 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our decision today, that a- request for modification of custody is distinct from a request to relocate and must be based on a material and substantial change in circumstances other than the move, is consistent with these decisions and with G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28 (\u201cthe court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment as to the care and custody of the minor children of the parties provided that the court finds that a material and substantial change in circumstances of the. parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children\u201d). The custody claim must be considered in light of established principles governing custody determinations. See, e.g., <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, supra </em>at 554; <em>Grandell </em>v. <em>Short, </em>317 Mass. 605, 607 (1945); <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711-712; <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, supra </em>at 557; <em>Delmolino </em>v. <em>Nance, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 211 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae-U\">The original judgment awarded sole physical custody to the mother, and \u201cmust be presumed to have been right.\u201d <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, supra </em>at 554. See <em>Delmolino </em>v. <em>Nance, supra </em>at 211. The probate judge\u2019s finding that the mother was the child\u2019s primary caretaker during the marriage is consistent with the original award of physical custody to the mother. A judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>modifying custody must be based on findings grounded in the evidence that, since the date of the prior custody order, there has been a change in circumstances \u201cof sufficient magnitude to satisfy the governing principle by which the court must be guided in these cases, namely, whether the transfer of custody will be conducive to the welfare of the [child].\u201d <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 376 (1974). \u201cThe uprooting of a child . . . should be done only for compelling reasons.\u201d <em>Tolos </em>v. <em>Tolos, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 710-711 (1981) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We have reviewed the extensive findings (entitled \u201cFindings of Fact on the Issue of Removal\u201d) and summarize below those that arguably could be said to support the judgment. Although it is nowhere stated in her findings that a material change in circumstances had occurred,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that conclusion may be inferred from the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe minor child\u2019s best interests dictate that ... the Judgment [of divorce] be modified to include shared physical and legal custody,\u201d and her passing reference to the relevant changed circumstances standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The probate judge found that, following the divorce, \u201c[b]ecause both parties were working full-time ... the minor child was in need of and received daycare.\u201d She also found that \u201c[t]he Mother\u2019s work schedule was quite hectic. . . . [Her] schedule is a combination of odd hours and concert schedules. The Father has some flexibility in his work schedule . . . [as] he is employed by a family-owned business and works in the same town where he lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Detailed findings set forth the mother\u2019s work history. During the marriage as well as following the parties\u2019 separation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>divorce, the mother\u2019s employment as a professional musician<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and private violin teacher (and, we assume, the father\u2019s full-time employment) required the assistance of child-care providers other than the parents. Other than in Caleb\u2019s first year, when childcare was provided by the father\u2019s sister, childcare was provided primarily by the maternal grandmother, in addition to other family members and nonfamily caregivers. The maternal grandmother continued to provide childcare two to three days a week after the parties separated and for a time following the divorce. After the separation, the mother, compelled by financial need, took on additional students until the number reached twenty to twenty-five a week. However, in May of 1997, when her imminent remarriage to Rosenthal made it financially feasible, she stopped teaching and accepting extra performance commitments in order to spend more time with Caleb.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We note, first, that a parent who works outside the home, even one with a \u201chectic\u201d schedule, may still be the appropriate primary caretaker and that, standing alone, such employment would not warrant a custody modification. Second, by the time of trial, the probate judge found that positive changes in the mother\u2019s work schedule \u201callowed her to spend more time with the minor child. For example, she began to drive Caleb to school in the mornings and became a volunteer classroom parent.\u201d Thus, to the extent that changes in the mother\u2019s work schedule did occur, they were not changes warranting a modification in the custody arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The trial judge found that both sets of grandparents \u201clive in Northboro . . . and are very involved in Caleb\u2019s fife and care. Caleb has a close and loving relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents, [whom] he sees on almost a daily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> [He] also has a close relationship with all of his aunts, uncles, and cousins who live in\u201d the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Caleb\u2019s close relationship and frequent contact with his extended family predates the divorce. That he remains close to his grandparents and other family members since the divorce reflects a concerted effort on the part of both parents to foster and maintain familial relationships that had existed during the marriage. The findings fail to support the conclusion that it is in Caleb\u2019s best interests to change custody to his father in order that he be able to spend portions of his weekdays with his extended family members instead of with his primary caretaker.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The probate judge found, \u201c[bjecause Caleb spends the majority of his week in Northboro . . . most of his activities take place there.\u201d This was a change in Caleb\u2019s living arrangments brought about solely as a consequence of the mother\u2019s compliance with the August 25 order. That order, entered in the absence of any finding of a substantial and material change in circumstances, let alone the requisite findings of \u201cinjury, harm or damage,\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28A, cannot form the basis upon which a final judgment modifying custody is granted. Were we to decide otherwise, tactical delays or overcrowded court dockets could come to dictate the result in every custody modification proceeding, and render meaningless any eventual hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>There is nothing in the findings or the record before us to indicate that anything occurred after the divorce that so altered the circumstances of the parties as to warrant a change in custodial arrangements which, on all of the uncontested evidence, had been in place with no ill effect on the child since the parties\u2019 separation in October, 1995. To the contrary, the findings reflect that the mother is a loving and appropriate caretaker.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The probate judge took note of the fact that both parents love the child, and that \u201cboth parents have safe and secure homes. . . . The child is happy in each party\u2019s home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Although great deference is accorded a probate judge\u2019s custody determination, \u201c[tjhere are limits to appellate deference,\u201d as when the judge\u2019s action is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence, as here. <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 521 (2000). The judgment modifying custody must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\"><em>Removal from the Commonwealth. </em>A request for removal is governed by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as that statute has been interpreted by <em>Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 710, and <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 815 (1981).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A parent\u2019s request to relocate with a child from the Commonwealth must be \u201cgrounded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the \u2018realization that after a divorce a child\u2019s subsequent relationship with both parents can never be the same as before the divorce . . . [and] that the child\u2019s quality of life and style of life are provided by the custodial parent.\u2019 Although the best interests of the children always remain the paramount concern, \u2018[b]ecause the best interests of a child are so interwoven with the well-being of the custodial parent, the determination of the child\u2019s best interest requires that the custodial parent be taken into account.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 710, quoting from <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>99 N.J. 42, 53-54 (1984). See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, supra </em>at 815-818, quoting from <em>D\u2019Onofrio </em>v. <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>144 N.J. Super. 200, 204-206, aff\u2019d per curiam, 144 N.J. Super. 352 (1976) (a court must consider the advantages of the move in terms of whether the move is likely to improve the general quality of life for both the custodial parent and the child, the \u201cnew family unit\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>). These considerations lie at the roof of the specific factors described in <em>Yannas, </em>collectively referred to as the \u201creal advantage\u201d standard. We proceed to discuss the extent to which the probate judge\u2019s findings and conclusions reflect appropriate consideration of each of the requisite elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>Real advantage/good and sincere reason for the move. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>weighing the factors to be considered, \u201cthe first consideration is whether there is a good reason for the move, a \u2018real advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. This is determined by assessing \u201cthe soundness for the reason for moving and the presence or absence of a motive to deprive the noncustodial parent of reasonable visitation . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The mother\u2019s reasons for relocating to Providence \u2014 which include the fact that she has remarried; that her new husband is a long-time Rhode Island resident employed in Providence<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; and that the mother\u2019s primary employment is in Providence \u2014 establish a \u201cgood reason\u201d for the move. See <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 712 (move to Greece where mother found new job and would be geographically close to her relatives \u201cwould be to [her] advantage\u201d); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Pitney, </em>409 Mass. at 455 (that mother found employment and would live near her relatives in California were \u201cgood and sincere reasons\u201d); <em>Signorelli </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 940 (that mother had remarried, given birth to a child of the new marriage, and new husband obtained higher paying job in New Jersey were \u201cgood and sincere reasons\u201d for move); <em>Vertrees </em>v. <em>Vertrees, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 919 (1987) (that mother wanted to move to Illinois because her relatives there would provide emotional support and social interaction was \u201cgood and sincere reason\u201d). There was no finding, nor is there evidence in the record to support a finding, that the mother was motivated to deprive the father of reasonable visitation. The probate judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe Mother\u2019s request to remove the minor child from the Commonwealth . .\u25a0 . is not founded on a good, sincere advantage,\u201d was clearly erroneous, meaning it was not supported by the evidence. See <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 709-710.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We turn now to the judge\u2019s consideration of the interests of the child, the mother, and the father, in light of factors established by <em>Yannas. </em>\u201cIf the custodial parent establishes a good, sincere reason for wanting to remove to another jurisdiction, none of the relevant factors becomes controlling in decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ing the best interests of the child, but rather they must be considered collectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">1. <em>Interests of the child, </em>(a) <em>Improvement in child\u2019s quality of life. </em>The probate judge was bound to consider \u201cwhether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change (including any improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life) . . . <em>Id. </em>at 711. The probate judge concluded that \u201c[t]he Mother has not provided any evidence which is tantamount to finding such a removal would be an improvement upon this child\u2019s life. The evidence indicates that such removal would be disruptive to this child\u2019s life.\u201d We first note that it was not the mother\u2019s burden to provide evidence of improvement, but that the factors must be considered collectively. \u201cThe judicial safeguard of [all parties\u2019] interests lies in careful and clear fact-finding and not in imposing heightened burdens of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The probate judge\u2019s subsidiary findings supporting her conclusion focus on Caleb\u2019s relationship with his father and adjustment to the court-imposed change in physical custody.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There were no findings reflecting consideration of \u201cthe relationship of the mother to the [child],\u201d <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 815, or \u201cany improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">That there were improvements in the mother\u2019s quality of life is evident from the findings. They reflect that, upon her remarriage, \u201cthe Mother\u2019s financial situation greatly improved.\u201d She was able to discontinue the private music lessons that had resulted in a schedule the mother \u201cfound stressful and impacted her time with the child.\u201d The mother\u2019s one-hour commute to and from work was reduced to five minutes. She enjoyed access to the city\u2019s cultural offerings. These facts incontrovertibly establish the positive improvements resulting from the mother\u2019s move to Providence. That, as the judge found, \u201c[h]cr decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>to move was her lifestyle choice,\u201d does not dictate the conclusion that the benefits of the move to the mother would not also be experienced by the child, particularly where, as here, the mother had been the child\u2019s primary custodian.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">(b) <em>Effect of move on child\u2019s association with noncustodial parent. </em>No findings were made that specifically address the effect on Caleb of a possible \u201ccurtailment of the child\u2019s association with the noncustodial parent,\u201d in the event of relocation. <em>Id. </em>at 711. In light of the fact that the distance between North-borough and Providence is but fifty-five miles and has not precluded significant access to both parents, it is likely that by living in Providence the effect on Caleb\u2019s association with the father would be no greater than the effect on the child\u2019s association with the mother if he were to remain in Northborough.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">(c) <em>Effect of move on child\u2019s emotional, physical, or developmental needs. </em>The probate judge\u2019s findings reflect some consideration of \u201cthe extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, supra </em>at 817-820. Caleb was found to be a \u201cphysically and emotionally healthy\u201d boy whose \u201cfrequent, continuing and equal interaction . . . with each parent is most beneficial to him.\u201d \u201cBoth parents serve as equally important guides for this child\u2019s continued healthy development.\u201d \u201cThe Court finds the minor child\u2019s life is enriched by each parent\u2019s equal participation in his upbringing.\u201d These findings would not support a decision denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>removal. However, the probate judge\u2019s findings reflect consideration of other circumstances affecting Caleb\u2019s development and emotional well-being that, in the judge\u2019s view, tipped the balance in favor of Caleb remaining in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The first was that, since the entry of the August 25 order, \u201cthe joint legal and physical custody arrangement has been carried out successfully by each parent,\u201d and the judge announced herself satisfied with Caleb\u2019s adjustment to it. Caleb was found to be doing well in school, where he had made friends and excelled academically. However, there are no findings, and no evidence suggesting, that Caleb would not continue to do well emotionally, physically, and developmentally if the removal were allowed. There are, to the contrary, findings that the order denying removal and changing custody from the mother was disruptive to the child.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">A second factor that appears important to the judge\u2019s conclusion that removal is not in Caleb\u2019s best interest is his close relationship with his grandparents and other members of his extended family living in or near Northborough. While we recognize that a child may have important relationships extending beyond those of his immediate family members that deserve protection, <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, 782-784 (1999); <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.L.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 828-829 (1999), there is nothing in the record to indicate that, here, those relationships are so important to Caleb\u2019s emotional well-being that they deserve primacy over his relationship with his mother, who had been the primary custodial parent throughout Caleb\u2019s life. In any case, the evidence is clear that the mother has continued, even after the change in custody, to assure Caleb\u2019s ongoing contact with extended family members, that she is close to her family, and would continue to foster contact with them and with members of the father\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">2. <em>Interests of custodial parent. </em>There are no findings that indicate consideration of the interests of the mother in maintaining both her close relationship with Caleb, and in living with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>her new husband in the city in which he and the mother both work. The denial of the mother\u2019s request to relocate, and the order changing custody because she made that request, left the mother with the choice of living with her husband and suffering separation from her child, or living with Caleb and suffering separation from her husband. The probate judge \u201cdid not appear to give much weight to the quality of life of the custodial parent by reason of the separations enforced on her,\u201d <em>Signorelli </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 940, as a consequence of her decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">3. <em>Interests of noncustodial parent. </em>The court must consider \u201cthe possible adverse effect of the elimination or curtailment of the child\u2019s association with the noncustodial parent.\u201d <em>Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 711. In this context, \u201c[t]he reasonableness of alternative visitation arrangements should be assessed. The fact that visitation by the noncustodial parent will be changed to his or her disadvantage cannot be controlling.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that a relocation to Providence, fifty-five miles from Northborough, would preclude the father (whose work schedule was found to be \u201cflexible\u201d) from having contact with Caleb in a manner significantly different from that provided by the original divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">That there would be some impact we infer from the fact that the father generally picks Caleb up from his after-school day care program and the fact that Caleb is involved in \u201ca variety of programs,\u201d including gymnastics and swimming lessons and soccer. By all accounts he is an attentive and loving father, and we assume that he participates in these activities by his' attendance. But the test is not whether there is no impact on the father\u2019s association, but whether reasonable \u201calternative visitation arrangements\u201d might achieve ongoing and meaningful contact appropriate to the circumstances. There were no findings that such visits could not be arranged. Transporting Caleb on a weekly basis pursuant to the current visitation schedule was found by the judge to be accomplished \u201cwith ease,\u201d and with little burden on the mother.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That it might work a somewhat greater burden on the father, who works full-time, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>not dispositive. The fact that both the mother and her husband perform with the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra on many Saturdays and some Sundays during the October through May season suggests a weekend visitation schedule that is eminently workable. \u201cFrom what we can ascertain, the judge recognized the importance of the \u2018frequent and continuing contact\u2019 of the child with both its parents . . . and entered [her] judgment prohibiting removal on the basis that the move would make visitation more difficult. We consider that factor not in itself conclusive.\u201d <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 815 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Based on this record, \u201c[a] remand for findings of fact to support the judge\u2019s order is unnecessary, because the evidence, weighed under the relevant factors . . . convincingly establishes that the plaintiff\u2019s request should have been allowed.\u201d <em>Gridley </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1006-1007 (1983). The judgment denying removal and awarding custody to the father is reversed. We remand for the entry of a judgment that the custody of the parties\u2019 minor child remain with the mother, that she may relocate with the child to Rhode Island, \u201cand for such further proceedings consistent with this opinion relative to time and conditions of visitation.\u201d <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Puchalski, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 558. In the absence of agreement, the Probate Court may consider whether it is in Caleb\u2019s best interest to conclude the current school term in Northborough and to begin the next school term in Providence, or transfer to a new school in Providence forthwith.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The guardian ad litem filed her first report on September 30, 1997, and an updated report on September 11, 1998, shortly before the first day of trial.

General Laws c. 215, \u00a7 56A, which authorizes the appointment of. a guardian ad litem to undertake the kind of investigation here ordered, requires that, \u201c[sjaid guardian ad litem shall, before final judgment or decree in such proceeding [relating to the care, custody, or maintenance of minor children], report in writing to the court the results of the investigation. . . .\u201d Over a year had passed since the guardian ad litem was first appointed on July 28, 1997, to report to the court on the removal and custody issues. There is nothing in the order of appointment to suggest that the role of the guardian ad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>litem was limited to a single report, or limited to providing information to the probate judge in connection with any request for a temporary change in custody. Since both reports were filed subsequent to the judge\u2019s August 25, 1997, temporary order changing custody, neither was considered in connection with that order. Both reports of the guardian ad litem were correctly admitted in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">On September 23, 1998, the court granted leave to the father to file an amended counterclaim, in which he alleges as changed circumstances that the child (1) resides with him from \u201cMonday after school through Friday delivery to school and with the mother from Friday after school through Monday delivery to school\u201d; and (2) is enrolled in the Northborough school system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Unless the parties agree to the temporary change in physical custody, a judicially imposed change in custody is governed by G.

The appropriate course would have been to conduct a hearing on the father\u2019s request for temporary order and, absent a demonstration of the requisite \u201cinjury, harm or damage,\u201d to make no change in custody. An evidentiary hearing on the merits of the claims for custody and removal should then have been scheduled on an expedited basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AlU\">See also Richards, Children\u2019s Rights v.

That the mother has remarried and moved to Providence, Rhode Island with her new husband would implicitly seem to be a change of circumstances that would be natural, especially with its impact on the child.\u201d There is nothing in the findings to support the contention that the mother\u2019s remarriage had a detrimental impact on Caleb. <em>Delmolino </em>v. <em>Nance, supra </em>at 211. The only direct reference touching on Rosenthal\u2019s relationship with Caleb is the finding that he gives Caleb cello lessons. The findings that \u201c[b]oth parents have safe and secure homes. . . . The minor child is comfortable and has his own bedroom in each party\u2019s house,\u201d indirectly support the conclusion that the mother\u2019s remarriage has had no detrimental impact on Caleb.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The mother\u2019s rehearsal and .performance schedule during the October through May performance season of the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra remains as it was during the marriage. The mother gives a total of sixteen to seventeen performances during the season, all in Providence. This includes seven subscription concerts, most performed on Saturday evenings, for which she rehearses four times during the week preceding the performance, from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.; three Pops concerts, also performed on Saturdays, requiring only two rehearsals prior to each performance; and four family concerts on Sunday afternoons, for which rehearsal takes place earlier on the day of the performance. Occasional early morning concerts at local schools make up the total.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Based on the evidence, Caleb started seeing his paternal grandmother on a daily basis when he began to reside primarily with his father, who since the separation has lived in an apartment attached to his parents\u2019 home. Caleb saw his maternal grandmother on a regular basis both during the marriage and after the divorce while the mother still had custody. Since the change in custody, the father\u2019s relationship with the maternal grandparents has grown cool. The mother and Caleb visit the mother\u2019s family in Northborough every Friday, when she picks Caleb up for her weekend visits. The mother brings Caleb either to her parents\u2019 home, or to visit her siblings (she has seven siblings, most of whom live in or near Northborough; one lives with his wife in Rhode Island). She has also brought Caleb to visit members of the father\u2019s family. The father (and Caleb) have dinner with the father\u2019s girlfriend once a week, his sister\u2019s family twice during the week, and his parents once during the week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We note that, under the original custody arrangement, the father could continue to spend time with his parents and siblings during scheduled weekend and vacation visits with Caleb. Further, in light of the fact that \u201cthe mother has a good relationship with her parents and siblings who live in Massachusetts,\u201d and her practice of weekly contact with them, it is likely that she would continue to maintain these relationships.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The uncontested evidence also indicates that the mother has maintained her close relationship with the child, driving from Providence to Northborough every Friday to pick Caleb up for the weekend, and on Monday morning to return him to school, as well as at the beginning and end of vacation periods when Caleb is with her one-half the time. She has continued, as she did during the marriage, to communicate with Caleb\u2019s teachers, and to volunteer regularly in his classroom. Caleb enjoys living in Providence, has a good relationship with his stepfather, and has friends in the neighborhood. In addition, we note that Caleb expressed to the guardian ad litem at the outset of the investigation his preference to reside primarily with his mother, and he reiterated this preference at the conclusion of the investigation, shortly before trial. Although not dispositive of the custody issue, <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738-739 (1996), these factors, at the very least, suggest that Caleb might quickly readjust to living with his mother during the week, and visiting his father on weekends and during part of each school vacation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\">A minor child of divorced parents \u201cshall not, if of suitable age to signify his consent, be removed out of this commonwealth without such consent, or, if under that age, without the consent of both parents, unless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u201d G.

While living in Shrewsbury the mother worked at several part-time jobs to make ends meet, in addition to commuting one hour each way to Rhode Island. This impaired the amount of time she had to spend with Caleb. Caleb lived with his mother in a small basement apartment in an apartment complex in Shrewsbury that had no playground and few children of Caleb\u2019s age. Caleb had no friends in the complex. The judge found that on April 20, 1997, the apartment was broken into, causing the mother to feel unsafe and frightened of staying there.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">By contrast, the move to Rhode Island reduced the mother\u2019s commute to five minutes and she was able to quit most of her part-time jobs, giving her more time to spend with Caleb. The mother\u2019s three-story duplex in Rhode Island is in a well-to-do neighborhood of primarily owner-occupied residences.
