MacLean (plaintiff) in an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">The material facts are not in dispute. During the early evening of April 11, 1993, the plaintiff was injured when the three-wheeled ATV on which she was a passenger hit a swing set. The ATV was owned by Edward Burrill and was being operated by his friend, Jeffrey MacLean, at the time of the accident. The accident occurred on the lawn of a school yard that was adjacent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>to the property owned by John and Janice MacLean, Jeffrey\u2019s parents. Jeffrey lived with his parents and was covered as an unnamed insured under a homeowners\u2019 insurance policy (policy) issued by Hingham Mutual. When the plaintiff presented a claim for her injuries, Hingham Mutual denied coverage based upon its interpretation that the policy excluded coverage for accidents involving vehicles subject to motor vehicle registration, which would include ATVs.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in which she sought, inter alla, a determination that the policy provided coverage for the injuries she sustained in the accident. Subsequently, a judge of the Superior Court granted partial summary judgment declaring Hingham Mutual hable under the policy. She concluded that because the ATV was not required to be registered with the Registry of Motor Vehicles under G. L. c. 90, it fell within a policy exception to the motor vehicle exclusion. Final judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, and Hingham Mutual now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The sole issue on appeal is the applicability of the exception to the motor vehicle exclusion set forth in the policy. We hold that, upon a proper interpretation, the exception to the motor vehicle exclusion applies and the policy provides coverage for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Pursuant to section i.e.(l) of the \u201cExclusions\u201d portion of the policy, coverage for personal liability and medical payments to others does <em>not </em>apply to bodily injury arising out of \u201cthe ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of <em>motor vehicles or all other motorized land conveyances, </em>including trailers, owned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured\u201d (emphasis added). The plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose from the use of an ATV, a motorized land conveyance, that was both loaned to and operated by an insured, namely Jeffrey MacLean. Were the <em>exclusion </em>the only policy provision speaking to the issue, the plaintiff\u2019s injuries would not be covered. However, the policy also contains an <em>exception </em>to the exclusion, which states: \u201cThis exclusion does not apply to: . . . (2) a motorized land conveyance designed for recreational use off public roads, not subject to motor vehicle registration and: (a) not owned by an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Neither the plaintiff nor Hingham Mutual takes issue with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>fact that the ATV was a \u201cmotorized land conveyance designed for recreational use off public roads\u201d for purposes of the exception. Nor do they dispute that the ATV was not owned by the insured. Their disagreement is over whether an ATV is \u201csubject to motor vehicle registration\u201d within the meaning of the policy exception. Hingham Mutual\u2019s position is that an ATV is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the language of the exception relating to \u201cmotor vehicle registration\u201d and that such language covers <em>all </em>registrations of motor vehicles, both those under G. L. c. 90 and those under G. L. c. 90B, a separate statutory provision dealing with motor boats and recreational vehicles. The plaintiff\u2019s position is that the exclusion was intended to apply only to those motor vehicles subject to registration under c. 90, and that the exception carves out from the exclusion those off-road vehicles, such as ATVs, that are not registered under c. 90, but that are governed instead by c. 90B. Resolution of the dispute thus boils down to the interpretation and applicability of the policy term \u201cnot subject to motor vehicle registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">We determine that the Superior Court judge was correct in concluding, on the facts of this case, that because the ATV in question is not subject to motor vehicle registration under G. L. c. 90, but instead is subject only to environmental registration under G. L. c. 90B, the exception to the exclusion applies. We find support for this conclusion in the language of the exclusion and the exception, considered in the context of the respective statutes, common understanding and usage, and the risks contemplated by homeowners\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">We begin by considering whether an ATV is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d that is subject to motor vehicle registration under G. L. c. 90. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 1, defines \u201c[mjotor vehicles,\u201d with certain specified exceptions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as \u201call vehicles constructed and designed for propulsion by power other than muscular power.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>While we recognize that an ATV does not appear to fall within any of the recognized exceptions, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nevertheless, we conclude that an ATV is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d subject to motor vehicle registration under c. 90. In <em>Hein-Werner Corp. </em>v. <em>Jackson Indus., Inc., </em>364 Mass. 523, 529 (1974), the court, although in a different context, stated that \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d used in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, \u201cincludes only the vehicles which are designed for regular use in the transportation of persons and property on the traveled part of public highways. Just as clearly, many kinds of special vehicles . . . are excluded.\u201d Compare <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vynorious, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 124-125 (1993). Recently, in <em>Deere &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>434 Mass. 223 (2001), the court reiterated that \u201c[n]o motor vehicles are required by the terms of c. 90 to be registered simply by virtue of their status as such. Instead, c. 90 prohibits certain uses unless the motor vehicle is registered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, quoting from <em>Hein-Wemer Corp. </em>v. <em>Jackson Indus., Inc., supra </em>at 526-527. Accordingly, an ATV, not being a vehicle designed for regular use on public highways, would not be subject to motor vehicle registration under G. L. c. 90 simply by virtue of its status as such.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">An ATV, as an off-road recreational vehicle, is subject only to environmental registration under a separate statutory provision, G. L. c. 90B, dealing with motor boats and recreational vehicles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ATVs are required to be registered, see G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 21, but with the director of the division of law enforcement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement, see G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7\u00a7 22 &amp; 1, not with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. A motor vehicle operator\u2019s license and insurance are not required. See G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 26. Moreover, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 25, prohibits the use of a recreational vehicle on any public way in Massachusetts, except in limited emergency circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We recognize that the definition of \u201crecreational vehicle\u201d in G. L. c. 90B states that it is a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d However, we do not believe that the use of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in the definition of a \u201crecreational vehicle\u201d brings ATVs within the category of vehicles that are subject to \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d registration within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">We find further support for our conclusion that an ATV is \u201cnot subject to motor vehicle registration\u201d within the meaning of the policy by considering how motor vehicles are commonly understood and used and what risks are typically excluded from coverage under a homeowners\u2019 policy. In common understanding and usage, certain motorized products, even those capable of speeds exceeding twelve miles per hour, such as tractors or riding lawnmowers, are not motor vehicles because they are not designed for regular use in the transportation of persons and property on the traveled part of public highways. See <em>Deere &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>434 Mass. at 229. ATVs are like tractors and riding lawnmowers in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Moreover, motor vehicles, being designed for use on the traveled part of ways, are more commonplace, and typically involve more catastrophic losses, than ATVs. Therefore, speaking broadly, risks associated with the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 90, are specifically covered by a motor vehicle liability policy. In contrast, ATVs and other specialized recreational \u201cvehicles\u201d that are used off-road and pose correspondingly lower risks, are not subject to motor vehicle insurance requirements, compare <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vynorious, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 124-125, and would fall within the purview of a homeowners\u2019 policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such is the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>interpretation of the exception to the policy exclusion at issue here. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the exception to the policy exclusion is applicable in the present case, and that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries are covered under the homeowners\u2019 insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The exceptions are \u201crailroad and railway cars, vehicles operated by the system known as trolley motor or trackless trolley under chapter one hundred and sixty-three or section ten of chapter five hundred and forty-four of the acts of nineteen hundred and forty-seven, vehicles running only upon rails or tracks, vehicles used for other purposes than the transportation of property and <em>incapable of being driven at a speed exceeding twelve miles per hour </em>and which are used exclusively for the building, repair and maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>highways or designed especially for use elsewhere than on the travelled part of ways, wheelchairs owned and operated by invalids and vehicles which are operated or guided by a person on foot; provided, however, that the exception for trackless trolleys provided herein shall not apply to sections seventeen, twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-four I, twenty-five and twenty-six.
