L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A), indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B), and the like crime on a person over fourteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H). Trial by jury in Superior Court occurred in March, 1992, and the defendant was convicted on all counts. The case is here for decision on direct appeal after an unfortunate delay described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After setting out the evidence, we deal with the o defendant\u2019s claims, in essence, though variously stated and argued, that the alleged offences were committed, if at all, outside the Commonwealth and were thus not subject to prosecution here.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The jury could have found the following.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Amy (a pseudonym) was bom on February 9, 1974. She first encountered the defendant after his marriage to her mother when the family \u2014 Amy, her mother, the defendant, and two younger brothers \u2014 moved into the defendant\u2019s house in Tiverton, Rhode Island. Amy was then seven years old. The family remained there through 1984. Amy recalled an incident at age seven when the defendant asked her to kiss his stomach, then pulled down his pants and asked her to go down lower. She refused. A few days later he \u201ccornered\u201d her, as she said, in the kitchen, pulled down his pants and asked her to kiss his penis; when she would not do it, he held his penis to her mouth and tried to enter it. She held her mouth shut and tried to push him away.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Amy, eight to ten years old, in her parents\u2019 bed in the Rhode Island home, found the defendant on top of her trying to put his penis in her vagina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He told her \u201cto be a big girl\u201d and let him do it, and he kept on trying, saying he would give her money if she yielded. He got his way because he was stronger. Incidents like this began to take place weekly, when Amy\u2019s mother was out; when the brothers were at home, the defendant ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>them to their room. Such abuse continued after the family moved about 1984 to Florida and lived in a trailer for perhaps a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In June, 1985, the family settled in Swansea, Massachusetts, living first, until January, 1986, in a trailer in the front yard of the maternal grandparents\u2019 house, later in the basement of the house, and finally, in April, 1986, in a separate cottage nearby. Amy recalled with particular clarity an incident in the trailer when the defendant had vaginal intercourse with her. It was in the daytime. She remembered looking out a window \u201c[like she] was just in another world\u201d as if she had \u201cremoved\u201d herself from the situation. She was eleven or twelve years old. Similar things happened a couple of times a month. By then she \u201cwas so used to it happening\u201d that she did not fight it anymore, \u201cthere really wasn\u2019t anything [she] could do\u201d to stop it. The defendant told her no one would believe her story; she would lose her mother if she told; he would treat her mother and brothers better (he was regularly mistreating them4) if she \u201cwent along\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">There were occasions \u2014 when she was brushing her hair, or just passing by him \u2014 when the defendant quite casually fondled her breasts and buttocks or put his fingers in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">When, at rare times, she tried to resist, her attempts were futile. Once, in the home at 12 Promenade Street, Swansea, she refused the defendant oral sex and tried to keep her legs shut, but the defendant held her legs, \u201chad them apart,\u201d and performed oral sex on her. In that home, sometime in 1989 or 1990, when her mother and brothers were away at a family reunion, the defendant displayed two pornographic movies to her, fondled her, touched her breasts, fingered her vagina, and finally had intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Sometimes in 1989, when Amy was fifteen, she accompanied the defendant to the dog track in Raynham. (A few times, indeed, she asked to go with him to the track so that she could \u201ctalk him into letting [her] off\u201d from being grounded at home.) On trips back home from Raynham, the defendant more than once stopped the car in a rest area off Route 44 and had intercourse with her on a car seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">At intervals until about a month after her sixteenth birthday (February 9, 1990), the defendant had intercourse with her in</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">4Amy\u2019s maternal grandmother testified to this point. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the Swansea home. The last encounter \u201chappened really close to [her] birthday,\u201d and she recalled thinking at the time, \u201cWow, what a great birthday present.\u201d Soon afterward she moved in with her grandparents in Swansea, seeing this as a chance to get away from the abuse at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Amy did not tell her mother; she thought her mother would not believe her. She first spoke of her situation one evening during the summer of 1988<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to her best friend in the presence of James Knight and another boy (three high school friends). Knight testified at trial to the particulars of the disclosure: upset and crying, she said her father had been having sex with her for years, she feared it would not stop, she did not know what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In July, 1990, Fred Barbosa, a social worker with the Department of Social Service (DSS), received a report calling for an investigation. Initially Amy denied her stepfather had abused her. But within a few days, she reversed course because she \u201cjust decided that [she] should tell\u201d and thought Barbosa in any case would find out. She told her story to him in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In August, 1990, the family, short of Amy, and without mention to her, abandoned their Swansea home and moved to Florida. She did not see any of them for a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Responding to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, consisting in substance of the foregoing account, the defense offered the testimony of Amy\u2019s mother, the defendant\u2019s wife. She said Amy at fifteen or sixteen fell in with a wrong set of friends, including a boyfriend of older age, and there were intrafamily arguments about curfew restrictions. Amy often asked the defendant to take her to the dog track, her mother testified, and never said anything about misconduct by the defendant until DSS made inquiries. Her story, said her mother, was a fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">1. <em>Motion to dismiss indictments. </em>As amended, the under-sixteen rape indictment charged the acts occurred at Swansea at divers times from February 9, 1984, to March 21, 1990. But it is agreed the family did not move to Massachusetts until after February 9, 1984 \u2014 in June, 1985 \u2014 and the victim attained the age of sixteen on February 9, 1990. So the beginning date precedes the family\u2019s arrival in the State; and the end date is a month and one-half after Amy turned sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>As amended, the under-fourteen indecent assault indictment charged acts at Swansea at divers times from February 9, 1984, to February 9, 1988. Again, the beginning date precedes the family\u2019s arrival in the State. (Amy became fourteen on February 9, 1988, the terminal date charged.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The over-fourteen indecent assault indictment (not amended) charged acts in Swansea from February 9, 1988, to March 21, 1990. No difficulty here.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It was quite in order for the judge to allow amendments prior to trial that revised the dates of the alleged offenses. These amounted to no more than changes of form. Also innocuous were the imprecisions in the amended indictments: the defendant does not indicate his defense would have been helped or different had the indictments been more exact in the particulars mentioned. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>423 Mass. 436, 439-444, cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1015 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 737-738 (2000). There was argument that the indictments might be taken to have charged acts beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court, but in the end, it was for the Commonwealth to establish that the defendant in fact committed the three crimes within the Commonwealth. There was no error in denying the motion to dismiss the indictments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">2. <em>\u201cBad Acts.\u201d </em>The defendant claims the judge abused his discretion in admitting evidence of out-of-State acts of sexual abuse. How could this be squared with the limits of our criminal jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">A portion of the evidence did indeed deal with the defendant\u2019s misbehavings toward Amy in Rhode Island and Florida before the family moved to Swansea. It was made clear this material could be received as bad acts \u2014 not in proof of the substantive offenses, but instead for the conventional collateral purposes, namely: to show a common scheme<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; to describe the entire relationship between actor and victim, in particular how it started and developed<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; to elucidate motive<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; to describe a pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tern of conduct, negating accident or mistake;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to demonstrate sexual desire for the victim; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or to furnish corroboration of the material proof.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Bad acts, although occurring outside the State, may come in as ancillary to the proof of the commission of crimes within the State. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>389 Mass. 686, 696-697 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, </em>411 Mass. 218, 235-236 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The defendant protests that it would be easy for a jury to slip over the line and convict a defendant relying on the extraterritorial bad acts, while ignoring or even disbelieving the distinctly relevant local evidence. The protest has merit and emphasizes the importance of schooling the jury in the distinction they must make. (The same problem and solution occur in humbler cases of bad acts not involving State jurisdictional boundaries. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 504-507 [1999].) In the present case, the trial judge dealt carefully with the matter in his remarks after the Commonwealth\u2019s opening statement, and again in the formal instructions. He said the defendant was not charged with any acts that occurred in Rhode Island or Florida; the jury were not to use evidence of any out-of-State conduct \u201cas a substitute for proof that the defendant committed the crimes charged\u201d in Massachusetts; they could accept such evidence on \u201cthe limited issue of the relationship between the defendant and Amy\u201d and the question whether there was \u201cany pattern\u201d of conduct, but not \u201cas proof that the defendant has a criminal personality or bad character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">3. <em>Evidence. </em>In aid of his motions for required findings of not guilty, the defendant argues, first, there was no evidence of force to support the rape charge. The argument fails. The charge was amply sustained by Amy\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Recall that on one occasion in Swansea the defendant, after being denied oral sex, forced the victim\u2019s legs apart and performed cunnilingus upon her. So also the evidence shows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>victim was coerced into submitting to natural and unnatural intercourse by the defendant\u2019s threats she would otherwise lose her place in the family and cause harm to her mother and brothers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracciola, </em>409 Mass. 648, 650-653 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, supra </em>at 444; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 201 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 246 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Second, the defendant now draws attention \u2014 although he made no point of it at trial \u2014 to the possibility of duplicative convictions, with the jury basing both the rape and assault convictions on the same act. See the recent discussion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 478-479 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The possibility of duplication appears insubstantial in the present case. Amy in her particularized testimony identified and distinguished the defendant\u2019s acts of indecent touching from those of intercourse with their component of penetration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1001, 1003 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 449 n.3 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 479. And the judge instructed distinctly and clearly on the elements of each crime charged and laid emphasis on the point that the jury could find guilt as to each crime \u201conly if you are all unanimously agreed that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime on at least one specific occasion.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>420 Mass. 508, 513-514 (1995). The judge also instructed carefully and forcefully that the jury could not convict of the rape on the basis of any act postdating February 9, 1990, when the victim reached her sixteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We note, finally, it was the defendant\u2019s central contention, pursued by cross-examining the victim and offering the mother as a witness, that the defendant was free of any unlawful conduct and the victim\u2019s testimony was the invention of a vindictive mind. It was for the jury to speak on this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">On June 24, 1994, this court dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment of conviction because he had failed to file a brief. On September 11, 1995, the defendant, acting pro se, filed a motion for a new trial; this was denied by the trial judge without a hearing. This court affirmed the ruling in an unpublished decision, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (1996). The Supreme Judicial Court granted further appellate review and, on the ground of inefficiency of counsel in prosecuting an appeal, remanded the case to the Superior Court for the appointment of new counsel. The Supreme Judicial Court declared the defendant would be at liberty to pursue a direct appeal or move for a new trial or do both, and the standard of review would not be \u201cthe more stringent one that applies \u2018once the process has run its course.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>425 Mass. 182, 185 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 637, 652 n.24 (1997). Hence the direct appeal before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Witnesses on the part of the Commonwealth were Amy, James Knight (regarding fresh complaint), the victim\u2019s maternal grandmother, and Fred Barbosa (of the Department of Social Services).
