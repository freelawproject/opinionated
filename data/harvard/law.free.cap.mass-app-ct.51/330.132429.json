L. c. 265, \u00a7 23) and indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen (c. 265, \u00a7 13B). The defendant appeals from the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">The complaining witness, Kristin (a pseudonym), was bom on July 30, 1987. Her mother died some eighteen months later. Kristin and her twin brother remained with their father, the defendant herein, in a house in Billerica. There were many others who, over the years, from time to time, lived in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">Kristin was twelve years old when she testified at the trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>October, 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The period of abuse, according to Kristin, was from her third to her sixth year, 1990 to 1993. She said the defendant repeatedly, usually in afternoons, called her into his bedroom, shut the door, and had her take her clothes off. The defendant removed his clothes and lay on his bed next to her. Straddling her, he \u201cwould put his penis in my mouth and his penis on my vagina,\u201d in either case moving his penis up and down. During these incidents Kristin was \u201cunhappy,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d \u201cmad\u201d; the defendant was \u201csmiling,\u201d \u201chappy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Sometime in 1993, Eileen Scholl, the defendant\u2019s friend, came to stay in the Billerica house with her two grandsons, Patrick and James, then teenagers. Kristin said the defendant\u2019s abuse ceased with Scholl\u2019s arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Kristin, however, began \u201cacting out\u201d in sexual ways, touching herself, her brother, and others, and speaking in sexually explicit words. Eventually, Scholl was led on June 21, 1995, to consult Harriet Otis, a licensed mental health counselor and family therapist practicing in Lowell. Otis met with Kristin on July 5, 1995. According to Otis, Kristin acknowledged she had been touching her brother and the Scholl grandsons. Then Otis asked whether someone had been touching her; Kristin said yes. The questioning continued: When had this happened? \u201c[A] long time ago,\u201d and \u201cmore than once.\u201d Was it \u201cstill ongoing\u201d? She said yes. Could she tell who it was? \u201cNo she couldn\u2019t.\u201d Did she feel safe at home? \u201cNo.\u201d Was she protecting \u201csomebody\u201d and was that the reason \u201cshe couldn\u2019t name them\u201d? She answered \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Otis promptly telephoned the Department of Social Services (DSS) and filed a \u201c51A\u201d report of suspected abuse. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A. DSS started an investigation. On July 11 a DSS social worker, Nancy Assemza, had a meeting with the defendant. He denied knowledge of any abuse; to the worker\u2019s mention of reports that Kristin had been acting out, he said he was not troubled by her behavior and was not aware of any misconduct. DSS later filed a care and protection petition in Juvenile Court which resulted in the placement of Kristin in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>foster care with Koshana DiTucci in the town of Byfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This occurred just before Kristin\u2019s eighth birthday in July, 1995. Kristin remained with DiTucci through the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">DiTucci testified. She observed at first hand Kristin\u2019s continuing acting out. At one point Kristin told DiTucci in general terms about having been abused, but she did not say who was responsible; talking about this came hard. Kristin used to communicate with DiTucci by handwritten notes. In August, 1996, Kristin handed DiTucci a note, but with the caution that it was not to be read until Kristin was back in her own room. The note said, \u201cIt was Daddy,\u201d and was signed \u201cSweetie Pie\u201d (her nickname). Kristin would not speak of this note, but later, in August or September, she made two drawings of stick figures, depicting the \u201cthings that my Dad did to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">DiTucci acquainted Eileen Hiatt, a psychotherapist who was seeing Kristin at the time, with these drawings. In a therapy session with Hiatt, Kristin made two new drawings showing \u201cwhat the touchings were.\u201d Below the two figures in one drawing, Kristin had written \u201cmy private part and daddy private part are together.\u201d On the other drawing, also of two figures, Kristin wrote, \u201cHas [\u00bf7c] private part is in my mouth and I do not like it.\u201d And during a session on September 9, 1996, after Hiatt asked if anyone had touched her private parts, Kristin wrote \u201cyes,\u201d and when further asked who it was, she wrote \u201cdaddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnX\">The Middlesex County district attorney\u2019s office took hold. On November 26, 1996, in an interview with Detective Sergeant Daniel Rosa of the Billerica police, Kristin named the defendant as the one who had abused her. On February 13, 1997, Sergeant Rosa spoke with the defendant. After Miranda warnings, the defendant denied abusing his daughter and said DSS workers had been \u201ccoaching\u201d her. About a week before the trial Rosa tried to speak with Scholl but she declined to meet him.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The foregoing in substance was the Commonwealth\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">The defendant testified, denying the charges and pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the improbability of his being at home in afternoons: his schedule as a truck driver in the asphalt paving business would interfere.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Through cross-examination of Commonwealth witnesses, the defense had tried to show Kristin was progressively led into believing what she now asserted. Dr. Wilfred Derby, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified for the defense as an expert about children\u2019s memories, research into suggestiveness of interview techniques, and susceptibility of young children to suggestion by adults. DSS had referred Kristin to a therapist, Vicky Glatt, for sexual abuse evaluation. Glatt interviewed Kristin in March, 1999, and testified the girl was weak in recollecting details of the abuse but had confirmed it occurred up to the time of Scholl\u2019s arrival and, Kristin said, more than once a week.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The defendant does not dispute there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdicts, for he does not claim the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">1. The defendant objected at trial to the admission of Otis\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony on the ground that, as a matter of law, it was unduly prejudicial and cumulative of Kristin\u2019s testimony, and it was not fresh enough, not close enough in time to the supposed criminal behavior (a distance of perhaps two years). The objection was properly overruled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On appeal, the defendant changes stance and fixes on those words in Otis\u2019s testimony in which she reported that Kristin affirmed in response to questions that the \u201ctouching\u201d (of Kristin as object) was \u201cstill ongoing\u201d (at the time of the interview). There is argument that this particular hearsay could not be justified as fresh complaint material because it went beyond (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>could be read as contradictory to) Kristin\u2019s direct percipient testimony about the duration of the criminal events; thus it could not serve in a corroborative role, and so should be excluded as unemancipated hearsay. We need not debate whether the nominal excess in Otis\u2019s narrative of her interviews with Kristin was so broad as to require exclusion. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 351-353 (1994) (error to admit excess); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 507-508 (1994) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 585-589 (1994) (same), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>423 Mass. 436, 444-445 (no error), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1015 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martins, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 636, 638-639 (1995) (same). The defendant lodged no objection on that basis and \u2014 if there was error \u2014 the question is the residual one how the testimony probably sat with the jury and could bear on the verdicts: could its admission have worked to create \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d within the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). It would be hard to trace any probable effect adverse to the defendant. The defendant was not mentioned or pointed to as one who engaged in these later \u201ctouchings.\u201d Indeed, the defense seized upon the very testimony and in cross-examining Otis, and again in the closing speech to the jury, suggested that it was the grandchildren (according to Otis, Kristin said they \u201ctorture me\u201d) or others living or bivouacking in the Billerica house who might in fact have been responsible for the touchings or other abuse, not only in the later years, but in the critical three years. By thus using the supposed hearsay the defendant forfeits any right to protest its admission. \u201cHaving made that decision at trial, he cannot change tactics on appeal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 539 (1989). Finally, the direct evidence, verbal and pictorial, about the defendant\u2019s criminal behavior up to Kristin\u2019s sixth year appears solid and convincing no matter what plausible view is taken of the particular questioned testimony by Otis.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">2. The defendant complains that the prosecutor entered \u201con a number of areas calculated to appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABe\"><em>a. </em>The prosecutor asked Kristin (over objection) how she felt about what had happened with her father. This was part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s legitimate purpose to show Kristin\u2019s ragged and reluctant state of mind,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which helped to explain her difficulty and delay in confiding to outsiders, and to rebut criticism that her testimony was a manufactured product of suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">So also the defendant objected to the prosecution\u2019s questions to Eileen Hiatt about Kristin\u2019s body language or demeanor and her manifestations of shame during a therapy session. The inquiry was, again, directed to meeting the defendant\u2019s suggestion that Kristin was \u201ccoached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>b. </em>The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening or closing speech to the jury, but now complains about some lush prose in each. The prosecutor said in his opening Kristin \u201clost her father and her brother,\u201d \u201clost her innocence,\u201d \u201clost her ability to [trust] anybody,\u201d and she would tell the jury \u201cincredibly embarrassing\u201d and \u201chumiliating\u201d details of the abuse and her own behavior. In the closing, the prosecutor said the latter forecast came true in Kristin\u2019s actual testimony. He called her drawings \u201c[disturbing, disgusting, despicable\u201d and characterized the crimes charged as, next to murder, \u201cthe most serious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The rhetorical embellishments were superfluous and unsuitable, but it must be owned they did not much depart from or aggravate the sordid realities. We may suppose that sober jurors would not lose their common sense, seduced by this veneer, especially when they were reminded on several occasions by the judge what attitude they should take toward the exhortatory speeches of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We conclude, on the whole record, that the prosecutor\u2019s indiscretions, such as they were, do not call for reversal under the <em>Freeman </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Upon voir dire the judge decided Kristin was competent to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The judge instructed the jury to give no weight to any decision by DSS and said the start of care and protection proceedings is based on \u201csuspicion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Besides Kristin, testifying for the Commonwealth were Harriet Otis, Nancy Assemza, Cindy Preston (another DSS social worker), Koshana DiTucci, Eileen Hiatt, and Daniel Rosa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Lawrence Quinn, the defendant\u2019s employer, said the defendant worked normally from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 4:30 p.m. at the earliest, and had not missed a day. The defendant said the work was seasonal and typically he would be laid off at Christmas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Witnesses for the defense besides those already noted were George Johansen and Judith Binette, both of whom lived at the Billerica house within the period of the alleged abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In prosecutions for sexual abuse of children \u201cthe tolerance of what is fresh complaint has become quite extended in recognition of the child\u2019s fear, repression, threats of coercion, psychological control by the abuser, or lack of understanding of what happened.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nurse, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 39 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The prosecutor also put questions to Kristin about her state of mind (\u201ctired of answering questions\u201d) both on the stand and when she was interviewed by the therapist, Vicki Glatt. The questions provided context for Kristin\u2019s performance in the interviews \u00e1nd in cross-examination by defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
