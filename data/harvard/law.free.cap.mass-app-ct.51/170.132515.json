The arson was actually committed by another son, Michael O\u2019Neil, and his best friend, Charles Rosinski. Steven O\u2019Neil here challenges the denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment against him, asserting that the grand jury heard insufficient evidence to establish probable cause to arrest him for the crime charged. Deborah O\u2019Neil contends primarily that her counsel was ineffective in cross-examining Rosinski, the Commonwealth\u2019s only percipient witness against her. She also accuses the prosecutor of knowingly presenting false evidence through Rosinski and of failing to disclose, until midtrial, inculpatory statements attributed to her by another witness, Steven Windle; she attacks the trial judge\u2019s admission of those statements over her objection; and she argues that the cumulative effect of the assigned errors denied her a fair trial. We affirm Steven\u2019s conviction but reverse Deborah\u2019s. Her receipt of prejudicially ineffective assistance of counsel is manifest on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The arson was the irrational culmination of an effort to exact vengeance for the beating of Michael O\u2019Neil by one Joe Spinney. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, two days after the beating, Michael, Rosinski, Steven, and several others (including Deborah, according to Rosinski\u2019s testimony) inflamed by alcohol and drugs, drove to a triple-decker apartment building occupied in part by Spinney\u2019s family. Members of the group first issued physical challenges to the occupants, then threw stones at the windows. When no one emerged, unspecified members of the group proceeded to obtain a milk jug full of gasoline, which Michael and Rosinski used to set fire to the building\u2019s porch and stairs. Everyone involved then fled. Less than two months later, Michael and Rosinski were indicted for the arson as youthful offenders. The same grand jury also indicted Steven and Deborah.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">1. <em>As to Steven. </em>The Commonwealth had the burden to present to the grand jury evidence sufficient to establish probable cause that Steven (1) was present at the scene of the crime, (2) with intent to commit a crime or with knowledge that another intended to commit a crime, and (3) by express or implicit agreement was willing and available to assist that other in effecting his criminal purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Mass. 358, 366 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988). The required mental state that the prosecution had to show Steven possessed was a wilful and malicious intent. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>403 Mass. 93, 100 (1988). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 569, 573, <em>S.C., </em>411 Mass. 345 (1991). Such intent is rarely shown by direct evidence, but can be drawn from reasonable and possible inferences deduced from the circumstances. <em>Longo, supra </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Steven argues that the evidence before the grand jury revealed his mere presence in the car seen leaving the scene of the arson. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s finding, however, that the grand jury heard sufficient evidence from witnesses Rosinski and Windle regarding Steven\u2019s enthusiastic participation in all phases of the criminal enterprise to sustain a probable cause showing that he had the necessary knowledge and intent to commit or assist in the arson under a joint venture theory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Steven\u2019s reiterated reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982), does him no good, because in that case, unlike this one, there was <em>no </em>evidence of participatory criminality on the defendant\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">2. <em>As to Deborah, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>Six months prior to trial, Deborah moved for disclosure of any and all information regarding \u201cpromises, inducements, or rewards of any kind or nature made directly or indirectly to any Commonwealth witness.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Two weeks before trial, on March 9, 1998, the Commonwealth responded with a document entitled \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s Notice of Promises Rewards [or] Inducements\u201d (Notice), signed for the Commonwealth by Assistant District Attorney Milton E. Cranney, Jr., who was the prosecutor at Deborah\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Notice stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\"><em>\u201cCo-defendant Chuck Rosinski is expected to testify in the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief </em>that Steven O\u2019Neil and Debbie O\u2019Neil were joint venturers along with Mike O\u2019Neil, Chuck Rosinski and John Luciano in the burning of [Spinney\u2019s house] .... The substance of Mr. Rosin-ski\u2019s testimony is . . . [t]hat he along with his coventurers were at Debbie O\u2019Neil\u2019s house . . . drinking beer provided to them by Ms. O\u2019Neil. The group decided to go and beat the boys who had fought with Mike O\u2019Neil earlier. They went to the [boys\u2019] house, (Debbie drove) and threw rocks at the windows. When no one inside would come out, . . . Debbie O\u2019Neil drove to a gas station and bought some gasoline. She put the gas in a milk jug. Debbie drove back to the house [and] . . . told Mikey to hurry up and do it. Mike O\u2019Neil and Chuck Rosinski [then] . . . poured the gasoline and lit the building on fire. They ran back to the car and Debbie took off. They went back to Debbie\u2019s and she told them not to say anything to anyone about what had happened. <em>It is anticipated that this defendant will offer a change of plea on an indictment before the Essex County Juvenile Court on this matter and receive a sentence of probation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Presumably relying on this Notice, Deborah\u2019s trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>began her opening by alerting the jury to the critical nature of Rosinski\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">\u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s entire case rests on the credibility of two people, Charles Rosinski and John Luciano[,] . . . the only two people who have personal knowledge \u2014 [and] [w]ho the Commonwealth is going to call to testify \u2014 about what happened that night in that house. They are also the only two witnesses who were charged, with respect to this arson themselves, and are presently defendants with arson charges pending, and who the Commonwealth has given a deal to in exchange for their testimony. And you will hear both of them tell you that . . . after they are done testifying here, they expect that the charges against them will result in them being free, in one way or another, either by probation or some other situation such as that.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Counsel did not, however, direct the jury\u2019s attention to the Notice and its apparent corroboration of her assertion in her opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Rosinski testified for the prosecution, incriminating Deborah as indicated in note 3, <em>supra. </em>Deborah\u2019s counsel then brought out on cross-examination that Rosinski had been drinking heavily (and illegally) the night of the fire, as well as smoking a large amount of marijuana; that he was \u201cunder the influence\u201d of those substances that night; that his memory of the event was \u201csomewhat shaky\u201d; that he was \u201csomewhat confused that night\u201d; that he had \u201cblacked out\u201d a few times that evening; that he had provided two false and inconsistent statements to the authorities not mentioning any involvement by Deborah before making a third statement implicating her; that he had been on probation at the time of the incident and was aware of the consequences of being found in violation of probation; that he had a \u201ccomplete memory\u201d of his own actions on the night in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>question but not of anybody else\u2019s; and that he did not know where the gasoline used in the arson came from or who procured it. Counsel then moved on to what she must have contemplated would be the decisive blow to Rosinski credibility, the Commonwealth\u2019s Notice, but proceeded to flounder badly.</p>\n<p id=\"AYW\">When she asked Rosinski if he had seen the document before, he responded, \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d Her request that he read it was met by a prosecution objection, which was sustained by the judge with the observation that Rosinski did not \u201cclaim a lack of memory, so there is nothing to refresh.\u201d The prosecutor at side bar then told the judge \u2014 questionably, in our view \u2014 that he himself had sent the document (which he described as a \u201cletter\u201d) to the defendants\u2019 counsel but that it \u201cis not even [Rosinski\u2019s] statement . . . [but rather] a representation of the substance [of his expected testimony] made by his attorney, who was present at this subsequent interview that took place.\u201d Defense counsel did not ask the judge to examine the Notice and made no protestation against the prosecutor\u2019s description of it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXW\">The judge reiterated her refusal to let Rosinski read the document \u201cuntil [counsel had demonstrated] ... an exhaustion of [the witness\u2019s] memory.\u201d In response to Deborah\u2019s counsel denying she was trying to refresh Rosinski\u2019s memory with the document, the judge asked, \u201c[w]hat were you trying to do?\u201d Counsel again made no effort to apprise the judge of the material nature of the Notice but rather replied obscurely that she wanted Rosinski \u201cto read his purported statements . . . [and] to tell whether he had said things, or not said things.\u201d The judge thrice told counsel to \u201cmove on\u201d in light of Rosinski\u2019s claim never to have seen the document before.</p>\n<p id=\"A7_\">Deborah\u2019s counsel then asked Rosinski if he knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>potential penalty should he be convicted in his scheduled trial of committing the arson. After Rosinski acknowledged that his lawyer told him it could be five to eight years in State prison, the following exchange (in relevant part) occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Counsel: \u201cAnd is it fair to say that you don\u2019t expect to have a trial in this case. Is that right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Rosinski: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Counsel: \u201cWell, don\u2019t you have an agreement with the government to get probation in this case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Rosinski: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Counsel: \u201cWhen you met with the district attorney and your lawyer . . . you discussed what was going to happen to you, as a result of these charges. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Rosinski: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Counsel: \u201cSo you don\u2019t know what is going to happen in your case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Rosinski: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">On that negative and inconclusive note, Deborah\u2019s counsel ended her cross-examination of Rosinski, never again mentioning the Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">On redirect examination of Rosinski, the prosecutor immediately revisited the subject of Rosinski\u2019s expectations:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-18\">Prosecutor: \u201cNow, [Deborah\u2019s counsel] asked you what is going to happen in your case. What do you think is going to happen in your case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Rosinski: \u201cThat I\u2019m going to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-22\">This brief exchange \u2014 which can fairly be described as disingenuous, in view of the prosecutor\u2019s undeniable knowledge of the contents of the Notice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 provoked no response (much less indignant objection) from Deborah\u2019s counsel, who engaged in only a cursory recross of Rosinski that did not touch upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the Notice or Rosinski\u2019s knowledge or understanding of the likely outcome of the charges pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Shortly thereafter, at a sidebar dealing with procedural matters, the prosecutor marked for identification a report about the arson prepared by a firefighter witness, which the court had the previous day ordered produced to the defense for examination. The prosecutor then casually \u201cmarked for identification purposes\u201d the March 9 Notice (describing it as a \u201cletter\u201d). Deborah\u2019s counsel said nothing in response to this curious <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> action by the Commonwealth, and the record does not indicate whether the judge ever looked at the document. So far as it appears, the marking of the Notice did nothing to rectify the misleading impression that had been left with the jury (and quite possibly with the judge as well) as to the existence of some sort of understanding concerning the disposition of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Rosinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In her closing, Deborah\u2019s counsel repeatedly stressed that the case against Deborah rested entirely on Rosinski\u2019s testimony and recalled the several facts brought out in cross-examination (see <em>supra </em>at 174-175) which cast doubt on Rosinski\u2019s credibility. She did not, however, refer either to the Notice or to her opening statement prediction that Rosinski would be revealed to be testifying and receiving probation pursuant to \u201ca deal\u201d with the Commonwealth. Instead, she weakly \u201csuggested\u201d that Rosinski\u2019s testimony about not expecting probation or any kind of prosecution favor as a result of his implicating Deborah in the arson was \u201cnot honest and believable.\u201d Steven\u2019s lawyer followed, stressing Rosinski\u2019s shifting stories, admitted lies, and \u201cself-serving\u201d final version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s summation opened by immediately focusing the jury\u2019s attention on Rosinski\u2019s credibility and the attacks made on it by the defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cHow is it self-serving for Chuck Rosinski to come in here and do what [Deborah] told him not to do? Tell the cops; rat them out. How is it self-serving for Chuck Rosinski to stand here and tell you, and be cross-examined by those lawyers, to tell you that he lit a house on fire?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Deborah\u2019s attorney made no response to the prosecutor\u2019s implicit (and arguably guileful, in light of the Notice) portrayal of Rosinski as selfless and inherently credible in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">b. <em>Ineffectiveness of counsel. </em>We agree with Deborah\u2019s main argument, that she was prejudicially deprived of effective assistance at trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Her trial counsel was provided with an invaluable means to subvert the testimony of the sole eyewitness against her \u2014 the \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s Notice of Promises Rewards [or] Inducements\u201d \u2014 but only vaguely alluded to it in her opening and then permitted herself to be stymied in her effort to utilize it as evidence or in cross-examination. Nor did she use it in summation, even though it had finally surfaced for record purposes, if only as a chalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">It is long and well established that evidence tending to show a; witness\u2019s bias, prejudice, or motive to he is so significant that it is not considered a mere collateral matter but is deemed exculpatory evidence that may be established by extrinsic proof as well as by impeachment through cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. DeBrosky, 363 Mass. 718, 727 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 760 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 394, 397 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 792-793 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>426 Mass. 67, 72 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>17 Mass.

A defendant has the <em>right </em>to bring to the jury\u2019s attention any \u2018circumstance which may materially affect\u2019 the testimony of an adverse witness which might lead the jury to find that the witness is under an \u2018influence to prevaricate\u2019 \u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. at 760 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s implausible assertion \u2014 that the Notice did not even reflect any plea agreement or \u201cdeal\u201d to exchange testimony for leniency, but was a mere hearsay statement of Rosinski\u2019s anticipated testimony as reported by his counsel, so that defense counsel\u2019s handling of it was not inadequate \u2014 the Notice fell squarely within the language just quoted from <em>Haywood. </em>That broad principle does not require an explicit contractual plea agreement for its application; rather, it entitles a defendant as of right to probe into any circumstance that could give rise to \u201cany inference of prosecutorial favoritism [that might affect] ... a jury\u2019s estimation of a witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. 1, 10 (1982); \u201cto pursue the possibility that [the witness] believed, or had been led to believe, that. . . some governmental conduct in his favor . . . was contingent on the nature and quality of his testimony,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeBrosky, </em>363 Mass. at 727; and to explore the issue of pending criminal charges against a witness because such \u201cpendency . . . might have inspired hope of lenity [from the government] and fear of punishment if such lenity were not obtained.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 841 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In short, \u201cany statement which \u2018reasonably implies that the government ... is likely to confer or withhold future advantages . . . depending on [the] witness\u2019[s] cooperation,\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. at 792, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buendo, </em>701 F. Supp. 937, 942 (D. Mass. 1998), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>923 F.2d 839 (1st Cir. 1990), or \u201cany communication that suggests preferential treatment to a key government witness in return for that witness\u2019s testimony\u201d is a crucial weapon in defense counsel\u2019s armamentarium, even if it is \u201cvague as to the consideration given . . . [and] even without precise terms.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 716-717 (2000). Cf. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. at 153 n.4 (a document containing even \u201can implication that the Government would reward the cooperation of the witness . . . tends to confirm . . . the existence of some understanding for leniency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Notice, stating Rosinski\u2019s anticipation of pleading guilty and receiving leniency (probation), despite being the actual arsonist, immediately after setting forth his expected testimony implicating Deborah O\u2019Neil as the instigator and facilitator of the arson,, provided defense counsel with the capstone of any impeachment of Rosinski. If there might be any tactical or strategic reason why defense counsel would have failed to make every effort to bring the Notice to the attention of the jury, so that they, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could draw from it appropriately adverse inferences about the reliability of Rosinski as a witness, we are unable to discern it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Since the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Deborah depended entirely on Rosinski\u2019s testimony, his credibility was essential to the prosecution. Rosinski\u2019s concessions regarding his intoxication and blackouts during the evening in question and his admittedly incomplete and confused memory of events had already eroded that credibility. Exposure of the substantial inducement impliedly offered Rosinski in the Notice for testifying favorably for the Commonwealth might well have tipped the balance in Deborah\u2019s favor on the outcome-determinative issue whether the Commonwealth\u2019s case satisfied the stringent test of proving her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 23 (1978) (the failure to disclose an inducement is evaluated in the context of the entire record, and when the evidence of guilt is not overwhelming, \u201cadditional evidence [of an exculpatory nature, even] of relatively minor importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. at 10 (\u201cWe are aware of the effect that any inference of prosecutorial favoritism might have on a jury\u2019s estimation of a witness\u2019s credibility. . . . Such information was capable of creating a reasonable doubt which did not otherwise exist as to guilt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Instead, Deborah\u2019s counsel failed to bring the Notice to the jury\u2019s attention at any stage of the proceeding, despite the fact that she was entitled to do so independently of her cross-examination of Rosinski and of any denials of a deal by Rosinski. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 531; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 213 n.7.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Confronted by Rosinski\u2019s denials of ever having seen the Notice and of ever discussing with either his lawyer or the prosecutor what would happen to him as a result of being tried for arson \u2014 which, counsel could argue and the judge would invariably instruct, the jury were free to disbelieve \u2014 Deborah\u2019s counsel failed to exploit her most potent means of undermining Rosin-ski\u2019s unlikely claim of ignorance. Rosinski\u2019s counsel had in fact appeared on the first day of trial to assure the judge that she had \u201cspoken at great length with . . . Rosinski\u201d about the charges against him and the implications of his testimony and had \u201cthoroughly advised [him] of [his] rights.\u201d Deborah\u2019s counsel could easily have summonsed Rosinski\u2019s attorney to testify to the circumstances attending her presumed receipt and understanding of and communications about the Notice, as could the assistant district attorney who had authored and distributed it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>367 Mass. 454, 460-461 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daughtry, </em>417 Mass. 136, 144 (1994); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. at 319-320.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Deborah\u2019s counsel\u2019s subsequent performance exacerbated the effect of her failure to produce this potentially vital exculpatory evidence for the jury. She first failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s misleading redirect examination questioning of Rosinski to draw from him his expectation of going to jail. She then did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>take advantage of the renewed opportunity in recross examination of Rosinski to bring the Notice to the fore. Counsel\u2019s submergence of the Notice also impaired the effectiveness of her summation regarding Rosinski\u2019s lack of credibility by limiting it to his inconsistencies and ability to perceive and remember, rather than underscoring and validating her most telling contention (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. at 10), that Rosinski had a strong motivation to he to curry favor with the prosecution. It additionally prevented her from objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s deceptive closing rhetoric <em>(supra </em>at 178) as a factually baseless and impermissible bolstering of, if not vouching for, Rosinski\u2019s truthfulness. Compare <em>id. </em>at 14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. at 842. Finally, it foreclosed any hope of being able to argue to the judge that the Notice amounted to an implicit promise of leniency contingent on Rosinski\u2019s testimony that merited a special instruction to the jury to scrutinize the witness\u2019s statement with particular care. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 260 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meuse, </em>423 Mass. 831, 832 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">Here, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. at 10-14, the jury were deprived of \u201ca clearer perception of the possibility of [a key prosecution witness\u2019s] bias\u201d by not being made aware of evidence of an arrangement suggesting a Commonwealth offer of leniency to the witness; the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was not overwhelming; the key witness\u2019s testimony was already \u201cparticularly vulnerable to even slight blows to its credibility\u201d; and the prosecutor had given the jury the false impression that the witness was testifying even though he was going to jail, thereby \u201ccloak[ing him] in an aura of credibility.\u201d In those circumstances, as in <em>Collins, </em>a reversal of a conviction dependent on such testimony is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQ4\">The prosecutor\u2019s apparent misconduct in describing the Notice to the judge, in questioning Rosinski, and in closing argument might well be deemed \u201can independent ground for reversal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, beyond the fact that it compounded the prejudicial impact of defense counsel\u2019s omissions. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, ante </em>159, 165 (2001) (majority opinion); <em>id. </em>at 167 (dissent). It was defense counsel\u2019s \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d mishandling of the Notice, <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978), that warrants a new trial.

The transcript amply supports the judge\u2019s finding that there was sufficient evidence presented to the grand jury that \u201cSteven O\u2019Neil and others went to . . . [Spinney\u2019s home] to help extract revenge for his brother[] [Michael] being beaten; that when the intended victim was not [at home] the group went to obtain gasoline for the purpose of returning to [Spinney\u2019s home] and setting fire to the dwelling; and that the group did return to the scene and Michael and another did set fire to the dwelling, while others in the group[, including Steven O\u2019Neil,] remained in the getaway vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">This Notice also set forth the \u201cexpected\u201d testimony of one John Luciano, another charged participant in the arson, to roughly the same effect as Rosin-ski\u2019s and similarly \u201canticipated\u201d that Luciano would admit to sufficient facts \u201cand receive a sentence of probation for his involvement in this crime.\u201d Luciano did not testify. At the trial, neither Rosinski nor anyone else testified that Deborah O\u2019Neil obtained or provided the gasoline used in the arson, and Rosinski\u2019s testimony regarding the identity of the persons who \u201cwent to get gas\u201d is unspecific and ambiguous. Rosinski did testify that Deborah expressed a desire to \u201cfuck . . . up\u201d the person who beat Michael, obtained that person\u2019s address, provided beer to the group on the night of the arson, encouraged the group to go to the address to \u201cfuck him up,\u201d drove the group there, parked, waited for Michael and Rosinski to set the fire (telling them to \u201churry up\u201d), sped away from the scene thereafter, and told the group \u201cthere is not going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>be any rats,\u201d i.e., not to tell anyone about what happened. Rosinski was the sole witness to place Deborah at the scene of the arson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-16\">As noted in note 3, <em>supra, </em>Luciano did not appear as a witness at the trial, and only Rosinski inculpated Deborah as a participant in the arson. The record is silent regarding the actual disposition of the charges against Luciano and Rosinski, whose trial was scheduled to take place a month after Rosinski testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AQd\">If the prosecutor was taking the position that the Notice no longer fell within the category of \u201cpromises rewards [or] inducements,\u201d he was under a continuing duty to disclose that fact to the defense.

His failure to have done so implied the continuing existence of the document as a \u201cpromise reward [or] inducement,\u201d and his less than candid description of it to the judge could be construed as an effort at \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>432 Mass. 704, 715 (2000), quoting from <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-27\">Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. 1, 9 (1982) (\u201c[W]here, either through misfeasance or nonfeasance by the prosecutor, false testimony is introduced concerning an arrangement between the witness and the prosecutor . . .

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polydores, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1987), and cases cited; Flannery, Massachusetts Evidence: A Courtroom Reference \u00a7 1.2.4 (MCLE 1999). We do not speculate on the prosecutor\u2019s motive here, in a situation in which there appeared to be no procedural reason for his marking the Notice for identification, except to note that documents marked for identification are not in evidence and cannot be shown to the jury. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Although a motion for a new trial is the recommended means of raising the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mc</em>Cormick, 48 Mass. 106, 107 (1999), such a claim may be resolved on direct appeal when, as here, the factual basis for the claim appears indisputably on the trial record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adamides, </em>37 Mass.

It fails, in any event, because the judge rejected her contention that it constituted a violation of the prosecution\u2019s discovery obligation. Moreover, the record does not support her charge that the prosecutor knew about the statement before the witness blurted it out on the stand. The witness in fact admitted in cross-examination that he had not told the prosecutor about the statement, which appeared in none of the witness\u2019s own written statements or in the investigating officer\u2019s notes of interviews with the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
