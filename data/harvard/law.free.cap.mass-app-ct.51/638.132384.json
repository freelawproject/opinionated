App. Ct. 48, 49 (2000), mindful that assessment of witness credibility is the province of the motion judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 42, 47 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At about 10:50 p.m. on June 20, 1996, Officer Michael O\u2019Connell of the Wakefield police department was traveling westbound on Lowell Street in a marked cruiser. Nearing the intersection of Lowell and Main Streets, he observed a Mercury Marquis making an unusual, although not illegal, right turn onto Lowell Street (vehicles normally turned left from that position) heading in the direction of Officer O\u2019Connell\u2019s cruiser. It appeared to Officer O\u2019Connell that, in making the turn, the operator had driven very close to, or over, the curb. The vehicle pulled quickly to the right, stopped at the curb, and then resumed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Officer O\u2019Connell pulled into a parking lot and positioned his cruiser perpendicular to vehicles passing on Lowell Street. He saw the Mercury stop briefly at the curb a second time. Another vehicle approached the Mercury from the rear, and both vehicles passed in front of the cruiser. Officer O\u2019Connell saw that the Mercury contained a lone male, later identified as the defendant. Officer O\u2019Connell pulled his cruiser behind the second vehicle and followed as the third car in line. At the intersection of Lowell and Main Streets, for no reason apparent to Officer O\u2019Connell, the Mercury stopped briefly for a third time in the \u201cright turn only\u201d lane, causing the vehicle immediately behind, and the cruiser, to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The Mercury then made a sudden, and illegal, left turn across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Lowell Street into an Exxon gas station. Officer O\u2019Connell followed and parked his cruiser a short distance behind. He did not activate the cruiser\u2019s blue lights, but his headlights were on.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">As Officer O\u2019Connell was calling the Wakefield police station to report the vehicle\u2019s plate number and his location, the defendant got out of the Mercury and approached the cruiser. Officer O\u2019Connell left his cruiser and met the defendant halfway. The defendant began speaking in a heavy Italian accent that Officer O\u2019Connell had difficulty understanding. Although the defendant\u2019s command of English was reasonable, he was not making coherent statements. He also appeared nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Eventually, Officer O\u2019Connell understood the defendant to be suggesting that he was lost. This struck Officer O\u2019Connell as peculiar because the defendant said he lived in Wakefield. Officer O\u2019Connell requested, and the defendant produced, his driver\u2019s license. Officer O\u2019Connell was concerned enough about the defendant\u2019s behavior that he did not ask the defendant to return to his car for the registration. Officer O\u2019Connell instructed the defendant to return to his car and remain there.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Officer O\u2019Connell returned to the cruiser to check on the defendant\u2019s license status and any outstanding warrants. As Officer O\u2019Connell reached for his radio, the defendant again got out of his vehicle. Once again, Officer O\u2019Connell left his cruiser to intercept the defendant. This time, the defendant gave him the vehicle registration. After instructing the defendant to return to his vehicle and remain there, Officer O\u2019Connell returned to his cruiser to radio the information to the station. As he did so, . Officer O\u2019Connell observed the defendant moving in the driver\u2019s seat, twisting and rotating his shoulders, and leaning side to side. He could not see the defendant\u2019s hands. These actions were not continuous, but they went on for a minute or two. In addition, the brake lights of the Mercury flashed on and off two or three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Shortly thereafter, Inspectors Austin and Moccia, dressed in civilian clothes, arrived in an unmarked backup unit, having been dispatched per the practice of the Wakefield police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer O\u2019Connell briefed them on the erratic operation of the defendant\u2019s vehicle<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and his furtive movements. As the three officers talked, the defendant left his vehicle a third time and asked what was going on. Inspector Moccia told the defendant that they were running a registry check of his license. The information had not been received back at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">During this conversation, the defendant reached into the pocket of his leather jacket and began fumbling with an object. Officer O\u2019Connell asked the defendant to take his hand out of his pocket. Inspector Moccia<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Officer O\u2019Connell performed a pat frisk of the defendant\u2019s coat in the area where his hand had been. Inspector Moccia felt a small hard object; he reached in and retrieved a digital scale. Inspector Moccia asked what the scale was for, to which the defendant replied that he used it in his jewelry business.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">After the pat frisk, Officer O\u2019Connell remained with the defendant and continued to converse about his driving, while Inspectors Austin and Moccia walked over to the Mercury. From a position outside the passenger side of the vehicle, Inspector Moccia illuminated the interior with the aid of a flashlight. In the open glove compartment, Inspector Moccia observed a dirk knife, which he knew to be a dangerous weapon prohibited by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. Inspector Moccia opened the passenger door, reached in, and retrieved the knife. He showed it to Inspector Austin, who had approached the driver\u2019s side. From outside the open driver\u2019s door, Inspector Austin used his flashlight to examine the floor of the vehicle. He noticed a wooden-handled object protruding from under the driver\u2019s seat; he recognized it to be a prohibited switch knife. Inspector Austin reached into the vehicle, confiscated the weapon, and showed it to Inspector Moccia.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">After Inspector Austin discovered the second weapon, Inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tor Moccia focused his flashlight on the interior of the vehicle. From outside the driver\u2019s side door he observed the comer of a glossine plastic bag sticking out of the \u201czippered portion\u201d of the center arm rest which was in the \u201cup\u201d position. Inspector Moccia entered the vehicle and, on closer inspection, determined that the glossine bag contained a white powder that appeared to be cocaine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He seized the bag and placed the defendant under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">This case illustrates that analysis of events in motor vehicle stops is not only fact intensive and time dependent, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 163 n.8 (1997), but also interconnected and dynamic: observations made, and events occurring, during the stop often lead to heightened suspicion (justifying further inquiry), or to probable cause, or to plain-view seizures. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kitchings, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 591 (1996). Here, a motor vehicle infraction, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 207 (1995), and other observations creating reasonable suspicion that the operator might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, All </em>Mass. 490, 492 (1998), justified a proportional detention, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laaman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 364 (1988). Prolonged by the defendant\u2019s conduct, the detention led to a plain-view observation of contraband weapons,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doulette, </em>414 Mass. 653, 655 (1993), which, in turn, provided probable cause to arrest the defendant and to search his motor vehicle for additional weapons, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 145 (1990). In the course of that weapons search, a plain- view seizure of a significant quantity of a controlled substance occurred. In light of all these circumstances, there was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">1. <em>Constitutionality of the stop. </em>Analysis begins with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>familiar principle that \u201c[w]here the police have observed a traffic violation, they are warranted in stopping a vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. at 207, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 644 (1980). Here, Officer O\u2019Connell observed the defendant make an illegal left turn into the Exxon station.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Observed indicia of erratic operation (pulling onto the roadway out or over the curb, pulling to the curb three times for short periods, stopping in the roadway for no apparent reason, and making a sudden illegal turn) also raised a reasonable suspicion that the defendant may have been operating under the influence of alcohol or drugs. That Officer O\u2019Connell (or later Inspectors Moccia or Austin) may have harbored other unarticulated suspicions does not alter the analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. at 207-209 (Massachusetts follows the \u201cauthorization\u201d rather than the \u201cpretext\u201d approach). Neither does it matter that the defendant was never cited for the civil motor vehicle infraction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moscat, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 624 (2000) (\u201cpolice may handle [a] situation without making an arrest if they so choose\u201d). See also <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>415 Mass. 126, 129 n.3 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">2. <em>Permissible scope of the stop. </em>The nature of the stop defines the scope of the initial inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 468, 470-471 (1996). The investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laaman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 364. Here, there were two distinct, but interrelated, bases of reasonable suspicion: a civil motor vehicle infraction and possible operation under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The observed motor vehicle infraction entitled Officer O\u2019Connell to inquire about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>defendant\u2019s license status and vehicle registration, and to confirm their validity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 470-471. This basis for the defendant\u2019s detention would end with confirmation that the defendant\u2019s license was valid and the registration was in order. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laaman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 363-364.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Here, however, the defendant\u2019s behavior enhanced Officer O\u2019Connell\u2019s reasonable suspicion. Besides speaking excitedly and unintelligibly, the defendant did not follow directions, repeatedly getting out of his vehicle. This conduct prolonged Officer O\u2019Connell\u2019s efforts to confirm the validity of the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration and lengthened the defendant\u2019s detention.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 493-494 &amp; n.2 (2000). The results of the license and registration query had not been determined in the few minutes prior to the plain view observation of the illegal weapons. <em>Ibid. </em>As such, continued detention of the defendant was permissible. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 163 (1997) (continued detention of an operator and passenger after the operator had satisfied the purpose of the stop by producing his license and registration was impermissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The police actions were reasonable in time, space, and the degree of force employed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814., 819-820 (1993). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 794 (1985) (principal of proportionality considers the degree of intrusion upon the defendant and the level of suspicion prompting the intrusion). No pat frisk occurred until the defendant fumbled in his jacket pocket and furtive movements had been noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">3. <em>Plain-view observation of illegal weapons and search of the motor vehicle. </em>An officer making a stop for a traffic violation is not required to ignore what he sees, smells or hears. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 471. Neither Inspector Moccia\u2019s nor Austin\u2019s observations of illegal weapons was a search in the constitutional sense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 649. Their respective observa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>tians, from a vantage outside the vehicle in a gas station open to the public, intruded on no reasonable expectation of privacy of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doulette, </em>414 Mass. at 655. These plain-view observations provided probable cause to arrest the defendant for illegal possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 119 n.11 (1996),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and probable cause to search the entire motor vehicle, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>424 Mass. 117, 122-124 (1997), as well as its compartments (including the center console), for weapons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 906-908 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wunder, </em>407 Mass. 909, 913-915 (1990) (concluding that if there is probable cause to search a vehicle, then authority under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights extends to all containers, open or closed, found within). See also <em>California </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 579-580 (1991) (under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a lawful warrantless search of a motor vehicle extends to all containers, open or closed, found within). Thus, Officer O\u2019Connell\u2019s discovery and plain-view seizure of the cocaine in the course of searching for weapons was justified. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. at 145 &amp; n.8; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Having decided that the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was justified as a motor vehicle search based upon probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>cause, we need not consider, as the motion judge did, whether such search also might have been justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the defendant does not argue in his brief that the search violated G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, he has waived any issue as to the applicability of the statute in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brillante, </em>399 Mass. 152, 155 n.6 (1987).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">4. <em>The pat frisk. </em>We comment briefly on the pat frisk leading to discovery of a digital scale. The defendant\u2019s actions justified a protective frisk. The frisk was not investigatory, but protective, allowing the police to pursue their investigation without fear of possible violence. The defendant\u2019s furtive gestures, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 106 (1997), in conjunction with his other behavior, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 314-315 (1992), created the requisite reasonable apprehension that the officers might be in danger, justifying the pat frisk of the defendant\u2019s person.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 600-601 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>We conclude that the motion judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-14\">The cocaine had a net weight of between fourteen and twenty-eight grams.

Because the pat frisk was justified, as discussed <em>infra, </em>we need not consider whether the doctrine of inevitable discovery would provide an independent basis for denying suppression of the scale. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>406 Mass. 112, 117 n.4 (1989). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>42 Mass.

The \u201cstop\u201d in the constitutional sense occurred when Officer O\u2019Connell requested that the defendant produce his driver\u2019s license. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 764 (1999) (\u201c[t]he point at which a constitutional question first arose . . . was when the defendant was told to get out of his vehicle\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eckert, </em>431 Mass. 591, 595-596 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The defendant\u2019s furtive movements in the vehicle also heightened Officer O\u2019Connell\u2019s suspicions, leading to a permissible pat frisk for safety as discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A plain-view <em>observation </em>is not a search in the constitutional sense; it requires neither a warrant, nor an exception to the warrant requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 649. In contrast, a plain-view <em>seizure, </em>which involves a seizure but not a search, is an exception to the warrant requirement requiring justification. \u201cUnder [the plain view] doctrine, if police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. at 211, quoting from <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Because neither Inspector Moccia nor Inspector Austin was entitled to be inside the vehicle when the weapons were first observed, there was no lawful right of access justifying a plain- view seizure. However, seizure of the weapons was justified under the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>424 Mass. 117, 124 (1997) (warrantless search of an automobile based upon probable cause without exigent circumstances is permitted under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Under a search incident to a lawful arrest analysis, once the police possessed probable cause to arrest the defendant for illegal weapons, they were entitled to search the immediate area, including his motor vehicle, for other evidence of the crime, such as other weapons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 351 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>402 Mass. 156, 160 (1988) (art. 14 permits search incident to arrest of a closed container if police have reason to believe it might hold a weapon or evidence of a crime). See also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 462 &amp; n.6 (1982) (expressly disclaiming reliance on the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment). The search may precede the formal arrest provided that probable cause to arrest exists at the time the search is made, independent of the results of the search. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>413 Mass. 598, 602 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clermy, </em>421 Mass. 325, 330 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 1, 2d par., as inserted by St. 1974, c. 508, provides, \u201cA search conducted incident to an arrest may be made only for the purposes of seizing fruits, instrumentalities, contraband and other evidence of the crime for which the arrest has been made, in order to prevent its destruction and concealment; and removing any weapons that the arrestee might use to resist arrest or effect his escape.

I concur with the majority, but would reach the result on a slightly different basis. At the outset, I am compelled to say that the testimony of the officers strains credulity; their visual acuity compares favorably to that of Superman. From their testimony, the fact finder is asked to believe that, although the defendant had abundant time to secrete the contraband, he instead left the drugs and two weapons in \u201cplain view\u201d in three different locations within his automobile.
