First, Sayre alleged that she was a \u201csurrogate grandmother\u201d and therefore was entitled to the same visitation rights as would be allowed a grandparent under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, she claimed that visitation between her and Adam was in his best interest and, therefore, the court had the authority to order visitation pursuant to its broad equity powers under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6.\u00ae Third, she contended that she had \u201cconstitutionally guaranteed visitation privileges\u201d pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">On May 23, 1997, Aisner filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure (1975), or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). He claimed in regard to his motion to dismiss that the Probate Court could not consider Sayre\u2019s claim as matter of law because Sayre was not a grandparent and, therefore, lacked standing to claim visitation rights under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, or under the general equity powers granted to the probate court under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. A judge ruled that, because Sayre was not Adam\u2019s biological grandparent, she lacked standing to bring a claim for visitation pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, and that the statute also precluded the court from exercising its general equity powers to grant Sayre visitation rights. The judge also ruled that he could not order visitation over the father\u2019s objection because Sayre\u2019s complaint did not allege that the father was an unfit parent. Sayre filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">On appeal, Sayre contends that the judge committed error (1) in ruling that he would not exercise the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction to allow visitation because the plaintiff was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>entitled to relief under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, (2) in ruling that he would not consider the plaintiff\u2019s claim because she had not alleged in her complaint that the defendant was an unfit parent, and (3) in not holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether it would be in Adam\u2019s best interest to have visitation with Sayre.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the dismissal of Sayre\u2019s amended complaint, but on different grounds than those cited by the Probate Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We summarize the contents of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint. Because we are reviewing the allowance of a motion to dismiss a complaint, we consider \u201cthe allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, [which] are to be taken as true.\u201d <em>Warner-Lambert Co. </em>v. <em>Execuquest Corp., </em>427 Mass. 46, 47 (1998), quoting from <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 407 (1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Adam, born on July 5, 1988, is the son of Aisner and his former wife, the late Anne Rogers Maurer-Shields. The couple were married on April 25, 1987, and divorced on April 21, 1989. Adam\u2019s mother was granted sole custody, and the defendant, in December of 1989, signed a waiver relinquishing all parental rights. The defendant subsequently remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Adam\u2019s mother married Randy Shields in May of 1989. On July 19, 1991, when Adam was three years old, his mother was shot to death by her husband in Louisville, Kentucky. Immediately thereafter, Adam was made a ward of the State in Kentucky. Approximately one month later, Aisner withdrew his waiver of parental rights and was awarded custody of Adam. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Adam then left Kentucky to reside in California with Aisner, his wife, and their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Sayre has known Adam since his birth. She had been a close, life-long friend of Adam\u2019s mother and had occasionally visited Adam\u2019s parents while they were married, including at the time of Adam\u2019s birth. Adam\u2019s mother referred to Sayre as Adam\u2019s \u201cGrandMarie.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In her last will and testament, Adam\u2019s mother left her entire estate to be held in trust for Adam and named Sayre as trustee. Under the trust, Sayre, in her sole discretion, is to distribute the funds for Adam\u2019s care, maintenance, and education until Adam reaches age forty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">By May of 1993, after having lived with his father for almost two years, Adam began displaying serious emotional and psychological difficulties. His condition deteriorated such that he was placed in a psychiatric hospital for forty days. After the hospitalization, and after consulting with Adam\u2019s attending psychologist, Aisner requested that Sayre authorize the expenditure of monies from Adam\u2019s trust fund to pay for Adam\u2019s admission to a full-time, round-the-clock, therapeutic boarding school. To evaluate Aisner\u2019s request, Sayre requested that Adam stay with her at her home in Arkansas for thirty days. Aisner agreed, and Adam lived with Sayre and her husband for about three months, from August of 1993 until October of 1993. Adam\u2019s behavior and emotional condition improved during his stay, and he returned to California a more normal, loving five year old boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Shortly after Adam\u2019s return to his father\u2019s home in California, the father moved with Adam and his family to Texas. Over the next year and one-half, Sayre visited Adam on more than twenty occasions. With the father\u2019s consent and encouragement, Sayre visited Adam at his father\u2019s home, spent numerous day outings with Adam and his stepbrother, and provided regular personal counseling and support to Adam\u2019s stepmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">During this period, Sayre was actively involved in Adam\u2019s counseling and treatment, as well as the choice of his schooling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>From November 1993 until May 1995, Sayre, with the permission of the father and his wife, participated in joint counseling sessions with the father, his wife, and Adam\u2019s psychologists. In that regard, the father provided Sayre with written releases for Adam\u2019s medical and educational records and gave her permis- ' sion to consult with Adam\u2019s psychologists. Sayre, at various times, upon the father\u2019s request, released funds from the trust to pay for Adam\u2019s care and other expenses, including his forty-day stay at a psychiatric hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In April of 1995, shortly before the father moved his family to Massachusetts, he informed Sayre by letter that there would be no future contact or visitation between her and Adam. Cards and letters sent by Sayre to Adam were returned, marked \u201cRefused.\u201d The father has consistently denied all of Sayre\u2019s requests for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">1. <em>Probate Court equity jurisdiction and visitation. </em>At the time that the judge made his decision, it was not entirely clear whether G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, limited the scope of the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. After this appeal was docketed, the Supreme Judicial Court issued two decisions which decided the issue in regard to requests for visitation by a person other than the biological grandparents of a child. In both decisions, the court stated, inter alla, that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D, did not \u201cpreclude in all other circumstances an order of visitation between a child and an adult other than a legal parent. That statute does not limit the scope of the equity jurisdiction of the Probate Court.\u201d <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. <em>11 A, </em>783 n.18 (1999). <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, 828 n.4 (1999). Accordingly, it is now clear that the Probate Court has the authority to exercise its equity jurisdiction and order visitation by a person who does not have standing under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">2. <em>Lack of allegation of parental unfitness. </em>As an alternative ground for ruling in favor of the defendant, the judge held that, because the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant was an unfit parent, he would not exercise the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. However, in both <em>Youmans </em>and <em>E.N.O., </em>the court ordered visitation where there was no allegation by the party seeking visitation that the parent was unfit. Both decisions specifically addressed this issue and rejected any claim that parental unfitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>must be shown before visitation can be ordered. <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. at 781 n.16. <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. at 832-833. Therefore, it is not necessary for a party seeking visitation to allege and prove that a parent is unfit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the complaint. </em>The plaintiff claims that her amended complaint was sufficient to require the judge to, at minimum, hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if visitation would be in Adam\u2019s best interests. Because the judge ruled that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the complaint, he did not rule on the sufficiency of the complaint. Rather than remanding the case to the Probate Court, in the interest of judicial economy we will decide the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In support of her argument, the plaintiff cites <em>Youmans </em>and <em>E.N.O. </em>However, neither case controls this matter. <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. 774, involved a father who was seeking custody of his child from the child\u2019s aunt, who had been appointed the child\u2019s guardian. A trial judge granted the father custody, but also awarded the aunt certain visitation rights. <em>Id. </em>at 779. The father appealed, and the court ruled that the trial judge acted properly. The court noted that the aunt had raised the eleven year old child from infancy and had served as her guardian for six years, and had developed a de facto parent relationship with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The <em>Youmans </em>decision is not relevant, because that decision involved a custody matter in which the best interests of the child was the \u201ccontrolling consideration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 781, and because the court specifically stated that \u201c[t]he right (or standing) of an adult who is not a legal parent to seek visitation privileges with a minor child is not at issue in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">In <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, the court was faced with a unique fact pattern. The parties were two women who had shared a committed, monogamous relationship for thirteen years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 825. They decided to have a family, and the defendant successfully bore a child through artificial insemination. <em>Ibid. </em>Before the child was bom and again after the birth, the parties executed an agreement in which they expressly stated their intentions to coparent the child. <em>Ibid. </em>The agreement also expressed the parties\u2019 intent that the plaintiff retain her parental status even if the defendant and the plaintiff separated. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">After the child was bom, the plaintiff assumed most of the financial responsibility for the child. <em>Id. </em>at 826. For one seven-month period, the plaintiff also assumed primary care for the child because the defendant was experiencing medical problems. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">After the parties moved to Massachusetts, their relationship began to deteriorate, and they separated. The defendant then denied the plaintiff any access to the child. <em>Ibid. </em>Thereupon, the plaintiff filed a complaint seeking specific performance of the parties\u2019 agreement to allow the plaintiff to adopt the child and assume joint custody. <em>Ibid. </em>She also sought visitation and, after a hearing, a judge ordered temporary visitation. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court held that the judge properly exercised his discretion in ordering such visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. at 829, the court expressly adopted and defined the concept of a \u201cde facto parent.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[a] de facto parent is one who has no biological relation to the child, but has participated in the child\u2019s fife as a member of the child\u2019s family. The de facto parent resides with the child and, with the consent and encouragement of the legal parent, performs a share of caretaking functions at least as great as the legal parent.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The court ruled that the plaintiff was a \u201cde facto parent\u201d because she had participated in the child\u2019s life as a member of the child\u2019s family; the parties\u2019 coparenting agreement revealed their wish that the child continue the relationship with the plaintiff in the event that the parties\u2019 relationship ended; and the plaintiff had resided with the child and the defendant as a family. <em>Id. </em>at 830-831.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">We now examine Sayre\u2019s complaint to see if it sets forth a claim for Sayre as to whether visitation should be ordered. We do so in light of our \u201ccardinal rule . . . that the custody, care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>and nature of [children] reside first in the parents.\u201d <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 562 (2000), quoting from <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">While the complaint shows that Sayre undoubtedly cares about Adam\u2019s welfare, she has never functioned as a de facto parent in the manner recognized in <em>Youmans </em>and <em>E.N.O. </em>Sayre\u2019s complaint certainly details much involvement in Adam\u2019s life, but such involvement did not convert her role to that of a de facto parent. For example, Sayre never resided with Adam, except for a brief three-month period when she was evaluating his need for full-time, residential treatment. Sayre, except for that three-month period, did not perform a share of the caretaking functions for Adam, but mainly discussed such issues with Adam\u2019s mother before she died, and, subsequently, with his stepmother via telephone. Sayre did not allege that she shaped Adam\u2019s daily routine or served as his moral guide. Further, in the limited manner that she provided for Adam\u2019s education and medical care, she did so, according to her complaint, in her capacity as trustee. Based upon these alleged facts, the Probate Court properly dismissed Sayre\u2019s complaint for visitation without further factual inquiry into the child\u2019s best interests. Sayre\u2019s \u201cdevotion to the child does not, without more, permit an adjudication of . . . visitation privileges.\u201d <em>C.M. </em>v. <em>P.R., </em>420 Mass. 220, 223 (1995).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to dismiss affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 39D, grants the grandparents of an unmarried minor child reasonable visitation rights under certain circumstances when the parents are living apart under a temporary order or judgment of separate support, following the divorce of the parents, or after the death of either or both of the parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">General Laws c. 215, \u00a7 6, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">\u201cThe probate and family court department shall have original and concurrent jurisdiction with the supreme judicial court and the superior court department of all cases and matters of equity cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisdiction and, with reference thereto, shall be courts of general equity jurisdiction . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Sayre does not challenge the judge\u2019s ruling that, because she is not Adam\u2019s biological grandparent, she does not have standing to bring a claim under G.L. c. 119, \u00a7 39D.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">We note further that the plaintiff\u2019s one-line argument that the judge\u2019s resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim was \u201cwrong\u201d does not rise to the level of appellate argument. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Therefore, we decline to address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Sayre\u2019s amended complaint was verified and was accompanied by her affidavit, which mirrored her complaint. The father also filed an affidavit. Although it is apparent that the judge in his memorandum of decision extracted some materials from both affidavits, it is clear that his decision was based only on the facts alleged in the amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Both of Adam\u2019s maternal grandparents died before he was bom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Sayre successfully defended the trust in a will contest brought by the sister of Adam\u2019s mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The absence of an allegation by the party seeking visitation that the parent is unfit, however, is, in certain circumstances, an important factor for a judge to consider when deciding the question whether to order visitation because \u201cthere is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 68 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We also reject Sayre\u2019s argument that she needs visitation with Adam to fulfill her duties as trustee. Under the terms of the will, the trustee is prohibited from providing funds for Adam\u2019s care, support, maintenance, and education if Adam\u2019s father was appointed as his guardian. While Sayre has distributed funds to the father for Adam\u2019s care in the past, she does not allege that the father now seeks such funds. Thus, Sayre\u2019s duties as trustee consist only of managing the trust assets until Adam reaches the designated distribution age, duties that can be fulfilled without visitation with Adam.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
