At the crime scene, near the body, police found bullets and spent shell casings from both a nine millimeter and a .380 caliber weapon. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the crime was that the defendant and one Kenneth Mattox were the culprits. Both men were charged with murder, armed assault with intent to murder, and possession of a firearm without a license. After a joint trial, Mattox was acquitted on all charges, but the defendant was convicted of second degree murder as a joint venturer, of armed assault with intent to murder as a principal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and illegal possession of a firearm. In his appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant raises numerous claims, including: (1) it was error to admit the grand jury testimony of a witness, Sakoya Willis, as substantive evidence without meeting the requirements for such admission as set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 74-75 (1984); (2) the defendant\u2019s conviction of second degree murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>as a joint venturer cannot stand in view of Mattox\u2019s acquittal of that charge; and (3) the judge committed several errors in regard to the jury\u2019s deliberations. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">1. <em>Admissibility of grand jury testimony and sufficiency of identification evidence. </em>Since the sufficiency of the evidence identifying the defendant as one of the assailants depends on the admissibility of the grand jury evidence of Sakoya Willis, the only known eyewitness to the shooting, we will first focus on that issue leaving other relevant facts to the discussion of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">At trial, Willis, a friend of Gregory Tillery, testified as follows. In January, 1995, Willis \u201chung out\u201d and sold drugs with Tillery on Harvard Street. Other persons also sold drugs in the same area, including the defendant and Mattox, who were often together. Willis had known the defendant since childhood, but at the time of the incident some problems had arisen between him and the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the afternoon of the fatal shooting, Willis, Tillery, the defendant, and Mattox spent considerable time on Harvard Street. At one point the defendant and Willis exchanged certain \u201clooks,\u201d and the defendant left the scene. Soon thereafter, Mattox walked by Willis and Tillery singing a portion of \u201cScar Face,\u201d a song which Willis knew was about a \u201cguy\u2019s best friend dying.\u201d After hearing the verse, Willis and Tillery moved away from Mattox along Harvard Street in the direction of Greenwood Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Later that evening, at about six o\u2019clock, while Willis was standing near the corner of Harvard Street and Greenwood Street with Tillery next to him on a bike, somebody started shooting at them from Harvard Street at a distance of about ten feet. Willis did not recognize the attacker, a male whom he described as being about six feet tall, wearing a \u201choodie,\u201d and holding what looked like a silver .380 caliber automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Upon hearing the shots \u2014 approximately four in number \u2014 Willis ducked behind a car but was pursued by the attacker. When the shooting stopped, he turned around and saw the attacker about ten feet behind him on Harvard Street. He appeared to be cocking his gun trying to unjam it. A \u201ccouple of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>seconds\u201d after Willis saw his pursuer, he heard four or five more gunshots. He then ran home via Standish Street,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> crossing a railroad bridge. From the top of the bridge he saw two people running but could not identify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">When pressed by the prosecutor, Willis acknowledged that prior to trial, at a police station on March 9, 1995, he had, at the behest of Tillery\u2019s family, identified the defendant as the assailant from an array of eight photographs, and had dated and signed his name on the back of the photograph. He also acknowledged that he had given a taped statement to the police and that he had identified the defendant as the shooter when he testified before the grand jury in November, 1996. Willis admitted that his memory was better at the time he had spoken to the police and made the identification. At that time he thought it was the defendant who started shooting at him and the victim. He thought he was telling the truth both when he went to the police in March and when he subsequently testified to the same effect before the grand jury in November, 1996. He stated, \u201cOriginally, I thought it was Mr. Clements; but I\u2019m not absolutely sure. It was dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Although Willis testified that he did not see anyone with the defendant, when confronted with his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged that he had testified before the grand jury that Mattox had been with the defendant at the time of the shooting, and that from the railroad bridge he had seen the defendant and Mattox running down Standish and taking a right on a street parallel to Harvard Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The photograph of the defendant, acknowledged by Willis as having been identified by him as the assailant, was admitted as an exhibit at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. at 61 &amp; n.9. See also Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">At the conclusion of Willis\u2019s testimony, over objection, the judge permitted the Commonwealth to read to the jury excerpts of Willis\u2019s grand jury testimony that were inconsistent with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>testimony at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury were instructed that they could treat the grand jury testimony as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We turn to the pivotal case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Mass. 55 (1984). Before that decision, \u201cprior inconsistent state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ments [including grand jury testimony under oath], though admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness\u2019s testimony at trial, [were] inadmissible hearsay when offered to establish the truth of the matters asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. In <em>Daye, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court altered the traditional rule but imposed certain limitations. It summarized its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201c[W]e hold that a prior inconsistent statement is admissible as probative if made under oath before a grand jury, provided the witness can be effectively cross-examined as to the accuracy of the statement, the statement was not coerced and was more than a mere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator, and other evidence tending to prove the issue is presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Daye </em>also recognized that, apart from the issue of admissibility, there is a separate question whether the evidence, viewed as a whole, is sufficient for the Commonwealth to meet its burden of proof. In <em>Daye, </em>where, as here, the grand jury testimony related to the central issue of identification, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201c[W]e will not permit convictions based exclusively on inconsistent extrajudicial testimony to stand. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>[399 U.S. 149,] 170 &amp; n.19 [1970]. In this case the Commonwealth must produce identification evidence in addition to a prior inconsistent statement in order to meet its burden of proof.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>More recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735 (2000), the court, after reiterating the conditions for admission set by <em>Daye, </em>explained that when the grand jury testimony concerns a central issue of the case, corroboration relates not only to the question of admissibility but also to that of sufficiency. This is implicit in the following excerpt from <em>Sineiro </em>at 741-742:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIn <em>Daye, </em>we held that prior inconsistent testimony by a witness before a grand jury, under certain conditions, could be admitted as substantive evidence. [393 Mass.] at 75. In so holding, we adopted the principles of Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 801 (d)(1)(A). We set forth three general requirements for the use of such grand jury testimony: (1) there must exist an opportunity for effective cross-examination of the witness at trial; (2) the witness\u2019s statement must clearly be that of the witness, rather than the interrogator, and be free from coercion; and (3) some corroborative evidence must be presented. See <em>id. </em>at 73-75. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass. 37, 45 (1990). With reference to corroboration, we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. 341 (1994), that, <em>when the prior inconsistent grand jury testimony concerns an essential element of the crime, the Commonwealth must offer at least some additional evidence on that element in order to support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. </em>at 345 (adopting test set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orrico, </em>599 F.2d 113, 119 [6th Cir. 1979]).[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] <em>The additional evidence, however, need not be sufficient in itself to establish a factual basis for each element of the crime. Id. </em>at 345 n.3.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We consider that the requirements of <em>Daye </em>both as to admissibility and sufficiency have here been met. The first two requirements of admissibility need not detain us. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>defendant argues that Willis was unavailable for cross-examination as to the accuracy of his grand jury statements because portions were read to the jury after Willis left the stand, the claim is without merit. Not only did the defendant fail to object on this ground until the next trial day, he also did not move to have Willis recalled. More important, prior to the reading, Willis had been thoroughly examined on the subject matter of the grand jury statements that were read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendant also claims that, since Willis testified at trial that he was influenced by Tillery\u2019s family (he admitted he had not been coerced) and had made his pretrial identifications because of rumors and secondhand information, the pretrial identifications were not those of Willis, but of unnamed third persons and should not have been admitted. See <em>Daye, supra </em>at 73 n.18. Willis, however, asserted to the grand jury that he saw the defendant shoot at him and Tillery. Only at trial did he claim that the identification was based on secondhand reports. Whether to give credence to the pretrial identifications or to his later disavowal was a determination for the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In discussing the third <em>Daye </em>requirement in terms of admissibility, leaving aside for the moment the question of sufficiency, it may be helpful to note that here, as in <em>Daye, supra, </em>two discrete sections of Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 801(d), are involved. Rule 801(d) in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201c(d) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201c(1) Prior statement by witness. The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">(A) inconsistent with his testimony and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">(C) one of identification of a person after perceiving him ... .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Section 801(d)(1)(A), as discussed earlier, was first adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>Daye, </em>while 801(d)(1)(C) is of longer standing and is \u201ca rule consistent with our cases governing probative use of extrajudicial identifications.\u201d <em>Daye, supra </em>at 61 n.9. Admitted under the latter section, Willis\u2019s out-of-court photographic identification was an exhibit at trial and constituted substantive evidence, having probative value, even though Willis was unable or unwilling to make an in-court identification. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, 367 </em>Mass. 737, 739 &amp; n.2 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, 376 </em>Mass. 402, 408-409 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, 376 </em>Mass. 426, 458-459 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 71-72 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Willis\u2019s photographic identification serves in this case as the additional evidence needed for purposes of permitting the admission of Willis\u2019s grand jury testimony and, when considered together with the grand jury testimony, was sufficient to warrant submission of the issue of identification to the jury. The reliability of the photographic identification must, of course, be the criterion for both purposes. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Cuevas, </em>12 Cal. 4th 252, 268-269 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The circumstances of the identification suggest reliability. The defendant was known to Willis, who had grown up in the neighborhood with him. The shooter was, according to Willis\u2019s trial testimony, only approximately ten feet away when Willis first saw him, and Willis could see the gun sufficiently clearly to believe that it was a .380 automatic. Bullets and a discharged casing from a .380 semiautomatic<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were found near the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The reliability of the photographic identification evidence must also be considered in the context of Willis\u2019s unwillingness or inability to identify the defendant at trial. Willis was a most reluctant witness and, it could be concluded, a fearful one.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His fears may have been exacerbated by the bad blood between him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and the defendant and the recognition that, at trial, he would have to face the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Additional support for the reliability of Willis\u2019s identification came from Detective John McCarthy of the homicide unit of the Boston police department who had interviewed Willis at the police station on March 9, 1995. McCarthy testified that Willis had picked out the defendant from an array of eight pictures as the man who tried to shoot him and had, at McCarthy\u2019s direction, signed his name on the back of the photo. The testimony of Detective McCarthy concerning Willis\u2019s extrajudicial identification to which there was no objection was also substantive evidence admissible for its probative value. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. at 60 n.8. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>387 Mass. 179, 186 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The reliability of a pretrial identification has been repeatedly emphasized by the Supreme Judicial Court and is \u201cregarded as having equal or greater testimonial value than one made in court . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>367 Mass. at 739. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. at 71. Not only is such an identification closer in time to the criminal incident when the witness\u2019s memory is fresher, but it is also made before intervening events may have influenced the witness to testify falsely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Daye, supra </em>at 71. See also the dissent of Justice Liacos in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, supra </em>at 87, where he states: \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>extrajudicial identification is as probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt as an in-court identification, in both practical and legal effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">There is even strong indication in our cases that an extrajudicial identification, such as the photographic one in this case, would alone be enough to withstand a due process violation claim that there was insufficient evidence of identification. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979). Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>367 Mass. at 738 n.l, the court stated, \u201cAlthough it is <em>not essential </em>to our decision [that is, the voice identification alone would be enough] we note that there was strong circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. at 461, the court, noting that there was authority to the contrary <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>54 Cal. 2d 621, 631 [1960], which as indicated in note 13, <em>infra, </em>was subsequently overruled), stated: \u201c[W]e think that an extrajudicial identification may in an appropriate case provide a jury with a sufficient basis upon which to find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. at 410 n.5, which left open the question whether such an identification would in itself be sufficient; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. at 72 n.8, where the court pointed out: \u201cAlthough sufficient evidence of reliability exists to permit the introduction of the composite [drawing] in this case, we would not, at this time, sustain a conviction where such a composite constituted the only evidence of identification, absent a more general acceptance of such evidence or a greater demonstration of its reliability.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald </em>and <em>Weichell </em>suggest at least the possibility that an extrajudicial identification based on photographic identifications alone would suffice. <em>Torres </em>indicates that voice identification alone would be enough.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 400-402 (1985) (spontaneous utterance sole evidence of identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Numerous cases elsewhere, cited in the margin, permit extra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>judicial identification evidence, if deemed reliable, to be the sole identification evidence against the defendant when the recanting or nonrecollecting witness testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As Judge Learned Hand observed in <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>6 F.2d 364, 368 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 268 U.S. 706 (1925), (and noted by Justice Greaney in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. at 744):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cThe possibility that the jury may accept as the truth the earlier statements in preference to those made upon the stand is indeed real, but we find no difficulty in it. If, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court. There is no mythical necessity that file case must be decided only in accordance with the truth of words uttered under oath in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">In sum, we hold that (1) the prior photographic identification evidence meets the <em>Daye </em>requirement of admissibility \u2014 \u201cother evidence tending to prove the issue,\u201d see <em>Daye, supra </em>at 75; and (2) together with the grand jury testimony which strongly implicated the defendant, the prior identification provided sufficient evidence to sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof on the issue of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">2. <em>Sufficiency of evidence of joint venture. </em>The verdict slip, at the instance of the trial judge, asked the jury to determine, if they found the defendant guilty of murder, whether such guilt was as principal or by reason of joint venture. As indicated earlier, they found the defendant guilty of second degree murder as a joint venturer and found Mattox not guilty. Before we reach the defendant\u2019s claim that Mattox\u2019s acquittal precludes the defendant\u2019s conviction as a joint venturer, we must consider the dissent\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict the defendant as a joint venturer. Although the issue was not specifically raised by the defendant on appeal,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a conviction based on insufficient evidence is inherently serious enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867-868 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we consider the evidence sufficient for a jury to find a joint venture under the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. at 343 n.l. Two guns were involved in the incident; spent bullets and casings from both a nine millimeter and a .380 caliber gun were found at the crime scene. Tillery was shot by the nine millimeter gun. Three bullets entered his chest, two of which had an upward movement. Since the exit wounds from those bullets had abrasions, the medical examiner found they were consistent with his being shot while lying on the ground. The only witness who testified to the location of the body immediately after the shooting said that Tillery was facing Glenway Street (that is his feet were toward Glenway),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and that Greenwood Street was behind him.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The direction Tillery was facing is important because, if he had been shot from the direction of Greenwood Street, the bullets to his chest would not have had an upward direction. The witness also testified that there were two series of shots, some forty-five seconds apart. This is significant because the short span of time between the two series of shots, which came from two separate guns, warrants the inference that they were fired by two different people.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Willis\u2019s grand jury testimony, indeed, placed two people at the scene and stated that Mattox and the defendant were together at the time of the shooting and ran away together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>We conclude there was sufficient evidence for the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a participant in a joint venture. See <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. at 343 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the verdict of acquittal of Mattox and the verdict of guilty as to the defendant on the theory of joint venture are inconsistent verdicts which require reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction of second degree murder. Each defendant was tried both on the theory of individual liability and joint venture. As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 341 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201c \u2018[M]ere inconsistency of verdicts does not render a guilty verdict erroneous.\u2019 <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 235 (1991).] Further, where the evidence against one defendant \u2018appears to be more substantial and persuasive\u2019 than the evidence against the other defendants, the joinder of several defendants at trial for the same crime does not require that either all or none of the defendants be found guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connearney, </em>359 Mass. 200, 202-203 (1971). Here, the evidence against the defendant was considerably stronger and more persuasive than it was with regard to [Mattox].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 380-381 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 254 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">3. <em>Other claims of the defendant, </em>(a) Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence indicating he sold drugs on the comer of Harvard and Greenwood streets was inadmissible, this testimony, which was not objected to by the defendant, was relevant to show hostility between the defendant (and Mattox) and Tillery (and Willis), all four of whom were selling drugs and may have been fighting over turf. Even if the admission of such evidence were deemed error, it is highly unlikely that such evidence would have affected the jury in determining whether a far more serious crime \u2014 murder \u2014 had been committed by the defendant, particularly where, as here, the principal witness for the Commonwealth was also selling drugs. Since the defendant failed to object to the evidence, our standard of review is whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. There was no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(b) The defendant\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 34,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was violated is incorrect as there was not a second jury deadlock. In view of the complexity of the case, the multiple charges against the two defendants, and the sixteen witnesses and over fifty exhibits, the judge could well have determined that six hours of deliberations were not \u201cdue and thorough.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>366 Mass. 479, 496 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">(c) Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the trial judge did not invade the autonomy of the jurors\u2019 deliberations. After the judge received a note from the jury indicating that one of the jurors allegedly had made a biased statement, the judge properly conducted an individual voir dire with each juror. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>410 Mass. 89, 97 (1991). After finding no bias, she ordered the jury to continue with their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">During the course of the voir dire, the judge learned that eleven jurors favored conviction while one juror favored acquittal. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s directive to the jury to continue deliberations may have been interpreted by the jury as an implicit endorsement of the majority position over the one juror who favored acquittal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 14-15 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The record shows no impropriety by the judge. The transcript indicates that she was not coercive, did not attempt to influence their judgment, and in no way intimated to the jurors that she agreed or disagreed with their positions. She merely informed the jurors that she had found no evidence of juror bias and that they should continue to deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">(d) The absence of the defendant during the judge\u2019s questioning of the jury on the claim of bias \u2014 his counsel was present \u2014 does not in this case constitute reversible error. Although the defendant had a constitutional right to be present, no objection was raised by defendant\u2019s counsel. The review is, therefore, under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>45 Mass.

Even if the Commonwealth is required to meet the highest standard, that is, to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the record shows the Commonwealth met that burden. The transcript indicates that the defendant was represented zealously by counsel, and nothing suggests that there would have been any difference in counsel\u2019s actions or the judge\u2019s rulings had the defendant been present.

Daye, 393 Mass. 55 (1984), the court set forth criteria pursuant to which a statement of identification made to the grand jury could be admitted as substantive evidence, and established the requirement that \u201cidentification evidence in addition to a prior inconsistent statement\u201d must be produced or the evidence will not be sufficient to convict. <em>Id. </em>at 74. The court in <em>Daye </em>specifically left \u201copen what other evidence would be required where the issue to which the prior inconsistent statements relates is not identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. That issue was first addressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. 341, 345-347 (1994). The court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 741-742 (2000), addressed whether statements made at a probable cause hearing concerning \u201can essential element of the crime,\u201d not identification, are admissible as substantive evidence in the absence of \u201csome corroborative evidence.\u201d I do not agree with the majority that this standard, arguably less stringent than that set forth in <em>Daye, </em>applies to identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The basis for the requirement of additional evidence, when the extrajudicial statement was one made to the grand jury, is that \u201c[gjrand jury testimony, while given under oath, is given in secret, may contain hearsay, is often done by way of leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>questions, and is not subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. at 743-744. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orrico, 599 </em>F.2d 113, 117 (6th Cir. 1979), on which both <em>Noble </em>and <em>Sineiro </em>rely (\u201cOur concern in this case focusses on the fact that the central element of the crime with which the defendant was charged was established entirely through the use of out-of-court statements, made at a time when the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses as to the accuracy of their accusations\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ). Addressing this concern, the court in <em>Daye </em>imposed the requirement of additional evidence, stating: \u201c[W]e will not permit convictions based exclusively on <em>inconsistent extrajudicial testimony </em>to stand\u201d (emphasis added). 393 Mass. at 74. Consistent with this proscription, Willis\u2019s recanted photographic identification of the defendant cannot constitute that additional evidence necessary to render the inconsistent grand jury statement of identification sufficient to convict.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">I reiterate certain facts in order to inform my discussion of the requirement of additional evidence set forth in <em>Daye. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>defense was mistaken identity. The prosecution presented no witness other than Willis who could identify the defendant as the shooter, and there was no circumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the crime \u2014 no guns were recovered, no identifiable fingerprints lifted from the bullets or casings found at the scene, and no behavior evoking consciousness of guilt. At trial, Willis did not identify the defendant as the shooter. Asked whether he recognized the person who approached him and Tillery, Willis said \u201cNo.\u201d He testified that on the evening of January 30, 1995, he was not able to see the face of the shooter, and could not therefore identify him; the person was wearing either two \u201choodies,\u201d or one hoodie and something covering his face, when he walked down the middle of Harvard Street and started shooting a gun (it \u201clooked like a .380 or something\u201d). He also said that it was dark and he was drunk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the sole evidence implicating the defendant was Willis\u2019s recanted extrajudicial identification. Willis acknowledged at trial that he had identified the defendant as the shooter to the police some six weeks after the shooting, and again during his grand jury statement nearly two years after the event,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but stated that he had done so at that time on the basis of rumors in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>neighborhood and pressure from friends and the victim\u2019s family to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>387 Mass. 179, 186 (1982) (witness testified at trial that defendant was not the killer, and that witness\u2019s pretrial photo identification was made because face \u201clooked familiar\u201d; latter statement viewed by court as \u201cin effect. . . den[ying] making <em>any </em>pretrial identification\u201d) (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">As noted by the majority, extrajudicial identifications and prior inconsistent statements have been treated as distinct by our courts, a distinction tracked by the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence (similarly identified as rules 801[d][l][A] and [C]). That both types of inconsistent extrajudicial statements of identification are admissible does not lead to the conclusion that when such statements comprise the sole evidence of guilt, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>are sufficient to sustain a conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Daye </em>specifically addressed the concerns expressed by members of Congress debating the proposed changes to the Federal rules of evidence, that \u201ca person might be convicted solely upon such evidence,\u201d see note 8, <em>supra, </em>by requiring that evidence in addition to the inconsistent extrajudicial statements be presented in order to convict. 393 Mass. at 74.

Thus, to sustain the denial of a directed verdict, it is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979) (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>420 Mass. 810, 814 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Here, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 779 (1995),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he Commonwealth needed to present evidence that a principal other than the defendant committed the [shooting].\u201d <em>Berry, supra </em>at 332.

Also in the direction of that comer, ten feet north of the bicycle where Tillery fell to the ground after being shot, a nine millimeter casing was found. Willis testified that he heard a second series of gunshots soon after he observed the shooter attempt to unjam his gun at the comer.

In the circumstances of this case, the gun that shot and killed Tillery must be placed (inferentially if not directly, but in either case beyond a reasonable doubt) in Mattox\u2019s hand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. at 779; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. at 332. Then, in order to establish the requisite shared intent, the Commonwealth needed to establish \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] knew that [Mattox] was armed with a [gun].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennessey, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163 (1983). This is not a situation, like a group melee, \u201cin which the participants act together with a similar mental set toward a common end and where it may be unfeasible, and in any event needless, to decide who was a principal and who a helper \u2014 for each is guilty whether acting in one or the other role or successively in both.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418-419 (1996). Nor is this a joint venture in which felony-murder was also charged, thus implicating broader concepts of criminal complicity not operative here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 307 (1973) (\u201cA broad conception of complicity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is indeed at work in the special field of so called felony-murder, but there is no basis for importing it into the present case,\u201d where the charge is joint venture).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Here the evidence permits the reasonable inference that the defendant was the sole gunman, thus: Walking down Harvard Street from the bridge, the defendant shot at and hit Tillery in the neck with a .380, resulting in Tillery\u2019s immediate paralysis so that he could not flee but fell where he had been standing, near the bicycle. At some point, the .380 jammed, as evidenced by two live .380 rounds found in the vicinity of the body. The defendant, it may be inferred, stopped to check whether Tillery was dead; finding him alive but disabled, he turned his attention to Willis, who had in the meantime ducked behind a van. By the time Willis got up to run, the defendant was behind him, and chased him back up the street to the comer of Harvard and Standish. There, the defendant attempted to fire a second gun, a nine millimeter, but this, too, jammed. This is evidenced by the live nine millimeter round found at that same location. The defendant then ran a few feet back down Harvard, shooting Tillery as he lay on the ground in front of the laundromat, four storefronts from the comer. This is evidenced by the nine millimeter casing found ten feet north of the bicycle, the four nine millimeter casings found closer to the bicycle, and the three spent nine millimeter bullets retrieved from underneath Tillery.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">A majority of the panel think the evidence supports the necessary inferences that Mattox fired the gun that shot and killed Tillery and that the defendant shared with Mattox the intent to kill Tillery. To reach the requisite inferences requires the following train of inferential thought: that two weapons were fired at Tillery; that Mattox had in his possession one of the guns; that Mattox\u2019s gun killed Tillery; and that the defendant was aware that Mattox had a gun and that he intended to use it to kill Tillery.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These are inferences too tenuous to constitute more than impermissible speculation. \u201cThe question of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>must not be left to conjecture or surmise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 221 (2000). On the basis of this evidence, \u201c[a] rational jury would not be warranted in inferring that the defendant was at the scene as a joint venturer. \u2018Such an inference would be speculative and highly unreasonable . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. at 333, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. at 780.

Thus, in <em>Torres, </em>where there was no attempt at in-court identification, a witness\u2019s prior identification made at a probable cause hearing seventeen days after the crime was properly admitted; in <em>Weichell, </em>where the witness also identified the defendant at trial, a composite drawing based on the witness\u2019s description made hours after observing him was admissible as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The timing of Willis\u2019s earlier identification fails to support the assumption that it was less subject to coercion or suggestibility when made.

He was unable to make an in-court identification of the defendant, who had lost considerable weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Absent such acknowledgment, the identification is not admissible as probative evidence because the witness is not subject to cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, supra </em>at 73-74 &amp; n.17, and our discussion, <em>infra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rater, </em>409 Mass. 433, 447 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">At the close of the Commonwealth's evidence the defendant made a motion for a required finding of not guilty on the grounds that there was a failure of proof both as to identification (see discussion in part 1, <em>supra), </em>and as to his participation as a joint venturer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. at 327-328, a group of people, including the defendant, approached the place where the victim was standing. One of the members of the approaching group was \u201clooking\u201d at the victim; the defendant and the victim exchanged words; then the defendant and the victim began to fight. Police officers saw three or four separate groups fighting. The victim was stabbed and died as a result. A knife was found at the scene. During the altercation, the defendant was seen with a \u201cshiny object.\u201d This was enough to convict the defendant as a principal, but not as a joint venturer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. at 772-773, the victim and witness had engaged in a drug transaction with the defendant pursuant to which the victim withheld some money and the defendant issued threats. Several nights later, a car drove by the victim and witness and a shot was fired from the passenger side. After four more shots were fired, the witness looked up and saw the defendant pointing a gun at them. This was not evidence sufficient to establish \u201cthat there was a principal other than the defendant who committed the shooting . . .[, or] that the defendant was, by agreement, willing and able to assist this principal in the shooting, and knew that the principal had a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">A related theory of joint venture culpability, not requiring presence, but not applicable on the facts of this case, is accessorial liability. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2. \u201c[I]n order to be punished as an accessory before the fact, the defendant must have actually aided in the commission of the felony or counseled, hired, or otherwise procured someone to commit it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>413 Mass. 182, 188 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 857 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In several cases, including most recently <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 330, a portion of this summary has been stated as requiring that the defendant have \u201cknowledge that another intended to commit the crime or with intent to commit <em>a </em>crime\u201d (emphasis added). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 846 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. at 856; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sim, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 215 (1995). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 689 (2001). The apparently inadvertent use of the indefinite article in this location in the sentence could, out of context, be viewed as suggesting that the intent to commit \u201cany\u201d crime, but not necessarily \u201cthe\u201d crime that the principal intended to commit, will confer joint venture liability. The iteration \u201cknowledge that another intends to commit a crime,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 214 (1994), \u201cor with intent to commit the crime,\u201d would be correct, as is \u201cknowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit the crime.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 164, 167 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Willis, testifying at trial, denied that the co-defendant, Mattox, was present at the time of the shooting and stated that no one was near the shooter when he walked down the middle of the street and began to shoot. Willis saw no one he recognized running from the scene of the shooting. At the police station, Willis did not identify anyone other than the defendant as present at the shooting, nor did he identify the defendant or Mattox as either of the two people he saw running; he stated that he could not see who the two people running were, or what they were wearing, or whether they were carrying anything. He did not select a photograph of Mattox until the grand jury proceedings. Thus, the only evidence that Mattox was present at the scene was contained in the inconsistent grand jury statements. To be admissible substantively, these statements would have to be corroborated by additional in-court evidence identifying Mattox. It might be argued that, as testimony concerning an element of the crime, only \u201csome additional evidence on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>element\u201d would be needed. See <em>Sineiro, supra </em>at 742. In my view, that modicum of evidence is also absent. This was not, however, an issue raised on appeal. In any event, the admission of the grand jury statements does not change the outcome in light of my view that the statements as they relate to Mattox\u2019s role as principal do not provide evidence sufficient to convict the defendant as a joint venturer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Q.: \u201cWhat happened after Gregory Tillery was done speaking with the person he knew?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">A.: \u201cSomeone came walking in the middle of the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cWhen you say \u2018someone came walking in the middle of the street,\u2019 who came walking in the middle of the street?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">A.: \u201cJay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cJason Clements?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">A.: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\"><em>Q.\\ </em>\u201cDid you see which direction Jason Clements came from?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">.

One nine millimeter spent shell casing was found ten feet north of the bicycle, toward Standish Street. Three of the nine millimeter spent bullets were located beneath Tillery. Some distance away, at the comer of Harvard and Standish streets, a single nine millimeter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>live round was also retrieved. Ballistics experts testified at trial that when a semiautomatic is fired, the case ejects either to the left or right of the gun. When the gun jams, efforts to cock or unjam the gun may result in a live round ejecting from the gun. Once the bullet is ejected, the gun can be fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The evidence indicates that Tillery was shot first from a distance by a bullet entering the side of his neck hitting his spine and resulting in immediate paralysis. Tillery was also shot from the front, not at close range, most probably after falling to the ground, once in the middle of the forehead and three times in the chest. The gun shot wounds to the chest indicate they were fired in rapid succession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The majority\u2019s inference is based in part on testimony of a lay witness that placed Tillery\u2019s body in the street \u201cfacing Glenway,\u201d with his feet toward the bicycle. If positioned in this fashion, the defendant would have had to run from the comer of Harvard and Standish and past the body before shooting, as two of the bullet wounds had an upwards trajectory (a third, however, traveled in a downward direction). The only evidence regarding the location of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>defendant and Mattox would place the defendant in the middle of Harvard Street, walking from the direction of the bridge, and Mattox \u201c[djirectly across the street on the next comer.\u201d The comer that could be seen when facing the defendant is that of Harvard and Greenwood. It must be assumed that Willis was looking in that direction in order to see the shooter when he made the observation as to where Mattox was standing. This unassailable fact coupled with the ballistics evidence, all of which was found in a northerly direction toward the Harvard street bridge, more readily supports the inference that all of the shots were made with the shooter\u2019s back toward the bridge, facing in the direction of Glenway Street.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b566-5\">Porada, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASy\">(dissenting in part).
