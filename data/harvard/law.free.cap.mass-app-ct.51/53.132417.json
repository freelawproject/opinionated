L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. The only question he raises in his appeal is whether his sentence, thirty days to be served in a house of correction, was precluded by the third paragraph of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. We hold that the sentence was properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">It may be helpful to set forth the statutory scheme of \u00a7 34 before examining the proceedings involving the defendant. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>first paragraph of \u00a7 34 sets forth the penalties for unlawful possession of certain drugs, one of which is marijuana. The penalty for that offense is \u201cimprisonment in a house of correction for not more than six months or a fine of five hundred dollars, or both.\u201d The third paragraph, however, reflects \u201cthe manifest intent of the Legislature to treat first offenders less harshly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lupo, </em>394 Mass. 644, 649 (1985). It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other penalty provision of this section, any person who is convicted for the first time under this section for the possession of marijuana . . . and who has not previously been convicted of any offense pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or any provision of prior law relating to narcotic drugs as defined in said prior law shall be placed on probation unless such person does not consent thereto, or unless the court files a written memorandum stating the reasons for not so doing. Upon successful completion of said probation, the case shall be dismissed and records shall be sealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The docket and the judge\u2019s findings explain the circumstances leading to the defendant\u2019s sentencing. After a complaint issued on September 1, 1998, the defendant admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 838-839 (1982). See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1202 (1983). A judge of the District Court continued the matter without a finding until March 19, 1999, on condition that the defendant be screened and found free of drugs and be counseled as required by the probation department. The probationary period proved unsuccessful; docket entries show that the defendant stipulated to a violation of probation based upon a new offense in Worcester and that, despite being sent to two treatment facilities, he continued to have positive screens for drugs. Finally, on March 5, 1999, a judge of the District Court (not the judge who had continued the matter without a finding) entered a guilty finding and sentenced the defendant to thirty days in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The docket indicates that, concurrent with his decision, the judge wrote a memorandum entitled \u201cWritten Memorandum for Not Placing Defendant on Probation Pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, sec. 34.\u201d The memorandum summarizes the defendant\u2019s failures to comply with the conditions of his probation. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>was arrested on a new charge for possession of marijuana in Worcester. The defendant \u201csubmitted to a violation\u201d of his probation, and the matter was continued to December 18, 1998. On that date, the defendant appeared in court having had numerous positive screens for marijuana and cocaine. After completing one drug treatment program, he was placed in an assessment plan of the Franklin substance abuse intervention program, which required him to remain alcohol and substance free and to appear weekly at court. On numerous occasions during the assessment phase of the program, the defendant had positive screens for marijuana and cocaine. Because of the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontinuous use of marijuana and cocaine,\u201d the judge determined that \u201ctreatment could not be effective at this time,\u201d and stopped the defendant from participating further in the program. Concluding that the defendant was not suitable for further probation, the judge terminated the continuation without a finding, ordered entry of a guilty finding, and sentenced the defendant to thirty days in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">We first dispose of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument based on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>429 Mass. 1022, 1023 (1999), that the appeal is not properly before this court because the defendant should have raised the illegality of his sentence in a motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). Although in some circumstances that course is appropriate, the rule appears to be available only when a defendant seeks relief from a sentence \u201cwhich he is then serving.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lupo, </em>394 Mass. at 646. <em>Rodwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>432 Mass. 1016, 1018 (2000). An appeal may properly challenge an illegal sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 379 n.7 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molino, </em>411 Mass. 149, 155 (1991). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lupo, </em>394 Mass. at 646-648. Since the defendant has already served his sentence, rule 30(a) is not an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The defendant argues that the statute must be construed to mean that if a sentence other than probation is imposed, the memorandum must be filed at the original time of disposition. The judge could not sentence him to the house of correction at a later time by filing a memorandum. The difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that the third paragraph of \u00a7 34 sets forth the penalty for \u201cany person who is <em>convicted </em>for the first time\u201d (emphasis supplied). Our cases, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. at 843; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 666, 670 (1998); cf. <em>Fire Chief of E. Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Plymouth County Retirement Bd., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 66, 71 (1999), as well as analogous statutory provisions, e.g., G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, and statutes cited in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, </em>423 Mass. 717, 723 (1996), and even the statute at bar in its second paragraph, recognize that a continuation without a finding differs from a conviction. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1522. Until such time as a finding of guilty is entered on the docket, there is no conviction. If the defendant had complied with the conditions imposed, the complaint would have been dismissed and he would have avoided the consequences of a criminal conviction on his record. The fact that \u00a7 34, third par., provides that even after conviction, upon a successful completion of probation, the case is to be dismissed and the records sealed does not ehminate the distinction between a continuance without a finding and a conviction. Since there was no conviction until the judge entered the guilty finding, the statutory requirement was met by the issuance of a memorandum at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The defendant also suggests that the requirement of a written memorandum in \u00a7 34 should be construed as only allowing a judge to forgo imposition of probation rather than justifying a period of incarceration. Not only does such a reading seem implausible, but we also consider this interpretation disposed of by implication in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lupo, </em>394 Mass. at 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
