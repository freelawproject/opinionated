On appeal, he claims that the trial judge erred (1) in admitting statements made by one co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>venturer to another that inculpated the defendant; (2) in denying his motion in limine to exclude evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, including the sale and use of narcotics; and (3) in denying a motion for a required finding of not guilty on so much of the indictment as alleged assault by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also claims error in the prosecutor\u2019s eliciting, during direct examination, testimony from a coventurer about his plea agreement with the government to provide \u201ctruthful\u201d testimony and in the trial judge\u2019s admission of the plea agreement in evidence. There being no error, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">From the evidence introduced at trial, the jury could have found the following facts. The Commonwealth\u2019s cooperating witness, Mark Delano, an admitted drug abuser, was dismissed from his job as an engineer at the Holiday Inn in Mansfield a few days before the Memorial Day weekend in 1994. Delano had not been able to sustain his drug habit, which cost him as much as $200 per day, from his earnings at the hotel. He had, therefore, stolen from the hotel, taking items such as food and bedding, and engaging in fraud using hotel checks. Delano\u2019s drug of choice was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Following his dismissal, Delano contacted the defendant, from whom he had purchased drugs in the past. Within a short time, he began living in the defendant\u2019s apartment. Delano and the defendant used cocaine together regularly. When Delano could no longer pay for the cocaine, the defendant continued to provide it to him, sometimes in exchange for Delano\u2019s assisting the defendant in selling cocaine. Delano would help the defendant by answering the door and delivering packages in exchange for paying off his drug debt. Soon, Delano had run up a debt to the defendant both for day-to-day living expenses and for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">By August of 1994, the defendant had become concerned about the money Delano owed him and began pressing for payment. The defendant told Delano that he was shut off; the defendant would not supply him with any more cocaine until he had settled his drug debt. Desperate for cocaine, Delano began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to look for a way to pay off his debt and reopen his drug supply. Thus, Delano conceived a plan to rob his former employer, the Holiday Inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Based on his past employment, Delano knew that the hotel\u2019s receipts often were large, consisting of a good deal of cash. Delano also knew that each weekday morning a designated individual made a deposit of the previous day\u2019s receipts. He determined that the robbery itself would not be difficult, but there was a risk that he or his distinctive car, a blue Pontiac Grand Prix, would likely be recognized. Thus, disguise and some accomplices would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Delano discussed his plan with the defendant, telling him that he had found a way to settle his debts. The two discussed the idea for the next several days, spending considerable time working out the details. As the plan progressed, the defendant, who was also in need of cash, took more control of the planning. In particular, the defendant determined that a gun should be used to motivate the employee to part with the receipts more readily.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant obtained another car, color red, to use in the robbery, and recruited his girlfriend, Michelle DiNicola, and another of his drug customers, David Reed, to participate in the crime. On the night of August 14, 1994, Reed, Delano, DiNicola, and the defendant met at the defendant\u2019s apartment to finalize plans for the robbery. Over the course of the night, they rehearsed that Reed would drive the red car to the hotel with Delano and wait for the employee to leave with the deposits. Then Delano would jump from the car, commit the robbery, and escape with Reed. The defendant and DiNicola would wait in Delano\u2019s blue Grand Prix a short distance away. When Reed and Delano arrived, they would switch cars, putting the money in the blue Grand Prix to ensure that if the red car were stopped, the money would not be found. The defendant also agreed to switch license plates on the red car prior to driving off in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">One sticking point remained in the plan. Delano did not wish to use a weapon in the robbery, believing this unnecessary. The defendant disagreed and urged Delano to carry a gun. Delano was adamant. After lengthy discussion, a compromise was reached. Delano agreed to carry a tire iron, not a gun, and communicated this to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The robbery began as planned. The defendant and DiNicola parked Delano\u2019s blue Grand Prix at the predetermined location, while Delano and Reed drove the red car to the hotel to await . the victim. Delano disguised himself with a long-sleeved shirt (to cover his tattoos), a hat, sunglasses, and something to cover his neck and face below the eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">While Delano and Reed waited for the employee to appear, Reed got cold feet, deciding that he no longer wished to participate in the venture. He left Delano in the red car and walked in the direction where the defendant and DiNicola were parked. Delano remained, intending to carry through with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">About thirty minutes later, Delano saw Reed and the defendant drive up in Delano\u2019s blue Grand Prix. Reed got out of the passenger side and got back into the red car with Delano. The defendant waited until Reed got into the driver\u2019s seat before driving off.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Reed told Delano that the defendant had convinced him to continue with the original plan. In Reed\u2019s words, the defendant had told him it would be stupid for Reed to abandon Delano at the scene before the robbery. Reed related that the defendant had told him it was crucial that they finish what they had started.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The robbery then proceeded essentially as planned. Delano jumped out of the car, ran up behind the employee, and demanded that she give him the money. She dropped one of the moneybags and began running, with Delano in pursuit. He ran after her, brandishing the tire iron. She dropped the remaining two money bags and ran away. After retrieving all the bags, Delano jumped into the red car and drove off with Reed for the prearranged rendezvous with the defendant and DiNicola. The participants divided the approximately $20,000 taken. DiNicola received $1,000 and Reed $2,000, with Delano and the defendant splitting the rest. However, the defendant demanded that Delano give him $4,000 of Delano\u2019s share in settlement of his debt for rent and drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The denouement did not occur until July of 1995, when the defendant was arrested. He initially denied knowledge of the robbery, only gradually beginning to discuss certain aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the crime as it became clear that Reed and Delano had implicated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">1. <em>A coventurer\u2019s statements. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in admitting, over objection, Delano\u2019s testimony at trial concerning his conversation with Reed on the morning of the robbery. In particular, he complains that the judge should have precluded Delano from testifying as to Reed\u2019s statement that the defendant had encouraged him to return to the robbery scene and see the crime through to the end. The defendant contends that Reed\u2019s statement was inadmissible hearsay that violated his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine Reed, who was unavailable at trial having invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is well settled in Massachusetts that the extrajudicial statements of joint venturers may be admissible against the others involved if the existence of the joint venture has been proven by other evidence independent- of the questioned statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 339-340 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 (1983). \u201cAn extrajudicial statement of a joint venturer may be admitted against a criminal defendant if (a) the statement was made during the course of and in furtherance of a common criminal enterprise and (b) there is sufficient nonhearsay evidence to establish an adequate probability that the declarant and the defendant were engaged in the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nascimento, </em>421 Mass. 677, 680-681 (1996). \u201cThe joint venture provides a commonality of interests because of which the statements bear indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collado, </em>426 Mass. 675, 681 (1998). \u201cThe admission of statements by a joint venturer also does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Bourjaily </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 182-183 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant argues, variously, that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the challenged statement, to support the existence of a joint venture; that the challenged statement by the defendant to Reed was not in furtherance of the joint venture; and that Reed\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s statement to him contained inadmissible totem pole hearsay. None of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201cWhere the issue is the <em>admissibility </em>of a [joint venturer\u2019s] statement the Commonwealth need only establish by a preponderance of the independent evidence that the defendant was involved in the [joint venture]\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 246 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 844 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, there was abundant evidence of the existence of a joint venture between and among Delano, Reed, and the defendant. The defendant participated extensively in developing and refining the original robbery plan formulated by Delano. He recruited DiNicola and Reed to participate; he arranged for the red car to serve as the switch car; he agreed to participate in driving the switch car and changing the license plates; he insisted that a gun be used; he drove Reed back to the scene of the robbery; and he participated in the post-robbery escape, concealment, and division of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">That the contested statement was made \u201cduring the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990) (citation omitted), is also beyond dispute. Reed had left the red car expressing his intention to abandon the venture. Appearing a short time later with the defendant, Reed announced to Delano that he had decided to rejoin the venture at the defendant\u2019s urging and took a place in the driver\u2019s seat. This signaled to Delano that the original robbery plan was back in effect. Moreover, by ascertaining that Reed remained involved in the plan, the defendant increased the likelihood of Delano\u2019s completion of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The defendant maintains that Reed\u2019s statement to Delano about what the defendant, said constituted totem pole hearsay requiring an exception for each statement: the defendant\u2019s to Reed and Reed\u2019s to Delano. It is not manifest that Reed\u2019s statement to Delano of what the defendant had told him (that it would be stupid to abandon the venture before its completion) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>is hearsay. The statement may be viewed as being offered not for its truth, but as an \u201coperative\u201d statement, signifying Reed\u2019s rejoining the enterprise<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and affirming the continued existence of a joint venture among Reed, Delano, the defendant, and DiNicola, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. at 246, or as a \u201cverbal act\u201d explaining the defendant\u2019s act of driving Reed back to the robbery scene. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.2.5. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>346 Mass. 9, 13-14 (1963)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Even if we were to hold that the judge erred in admitting the statements, given the abundance of evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the joint venture, we would affirm the convictions because any such error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>411 Mass. 249, 260 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 511 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Apart from Delano\u2019s challenged testimony, there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt: the testimony was cumulative of other evidence detailing the defendant\u2019s participation in the joint venture, and the defendant\u2019s statement to Reed \u201csupplied no missing element in the proof of the crime.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lenahan, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 185 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>The defendant next contends that the trial judge erred in denying his motion in limine to exclude from evidence any testimony that the defendant either sold or used drugs. He argues that such testimony lacked probative value and served only to prejudice the jury. He also contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s failure to make a timely objection when this evidence was introduced at trial created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts is not admissible to show that the defendant has a criminal propensity or is of a bad character. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. 682, 695 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 262 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 466 (1983). However, the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts may be admitted to show knowledge, intent, motive, opportunity, or absence of mistake or accident. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, supra </em>at 695; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 793-794 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, supra </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Here, the trial judge properly admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement with drugs, both as seller and user, because it depicted the relationship between the defendant and Delano and established motive for both Delano and the defendant to commit the robbery. Delano had amassed a debt to the defendant for rent and drugs. Until he settled his debt, the defendant would not supply him with any more cocaine. Likewise, the defendant was under financial strain due to his own considerable drug use and his having allowed Delano to buy drugs on credit and live with him. The defendant needed money to supply his own habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Evidence of the defendant\u2019s drug dealing was also admissible as being \u201cinextricably intertwined with the description of events on the [day] of the [robbery].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. at 263, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269 (1982). The trial judge was within her discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial impact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, supra </em>at 270. Moreover, she gave appropriate limiting instructions as to the use which could be made of this testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 479 (1998). Having failed in his motion in limine to exclude this evidence, defense counsel should have objected to its introduction at trial to preserve the issue for appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 25 (1998). The admission of the prior bad acts evidence was proper and, a fortiori, did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>3. <em>Denial of motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on the indictment charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Because there was no evidence of a touching of the victim, the trial judge allowed the motion in part, leaving the lesser included offense of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain this indictment because Delano never communicated to the defendant that he planned to use a tire iron in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The trial judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on so much of the indictment as alleged assault by means of a dangerous weapon. We review the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion under the familiar standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). A defendant can be convicted as a joint venturer if he was \u201c(1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 856 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988). Joint venture liability is also established when the defendant aids in the commission of a felony or is an accessory before the fact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sim, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 216 (1995). Here, there was sufficient evidence to find the defendant guilty of assault by means of a dangerous weapon as a joint venturer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A jury could have found that the defendant had remonstrated that a weapon was necessary to the success of the undertaking. There was also evidence from which the jury could have concluded that while Delano refused to carry a gun as suggested, he opted to carry a tire iron and communicated this decision directly to the defendant. That Delano chose to use a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tire iron rather than a gun does not detract from the defendant\u2019s possession of the requisite mental state and knowledge that Delano would be armed in the course of the robbery. An agreement between joint venturers need not be express. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) (\u201cThe jury may infer the requisite mental state from the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances and subsequent participation in the offense\u201d). It is sufficient that the defendant knew that his coventurers were armed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>427 Mass. 214, 215-216 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">4. <em>Witness testimony pursuant to a plea agreement. </em>On direct examination and without objection, the Commonwealth questioned Delano generally about his plea agreement with the government, including his agreement to give \u201ctruthful, complete and accurate testimony.\u201d The Commonwealth also introduced a redacted transcript of Delano\u2019s plea colloquy. The defendant now complains that eliciting this testimony and introducing the plea agreement during Delano\u2019s direct examination, rather than upon redirect, violated the holdings of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 261-266 (1989), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 95-98 (1999). The trial judge did not err in admitting Delano\u2019s testimony or the redacted plea colloquy, and in any event, there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>408 Mass. 419, 443-444 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. at 261, sets forth the general proposition that \u201ctestimony pursuant to a plea agreement, founded on a promise of truthful cooperation, and the plea agreement itself are admissible.\u201d The court in that case also recognized that when the government has entered into an agreement with a witness that requires truthful testimony, there is risk that a jury might erroneously conclude that the government has a special ability to determine whether or not the witness is in fact telling the truth when he testifies. <em>Id. </em>at 260-261. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 233 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. at 95-96. To avoid the appearance of vouching by the prosecutor, <em>Ciampa </em>counsels steering the course between Scylla and Charybdis by deferring efforts to bolster the witness with questions concerning his obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tell the truth until redirect examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, supra </em>at 264. Deferring such questions is said to be obligatory, not merely advisory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In the circumstances confronting the prosecutor at the time of Delano\u2019s testimony, there was no premature bolstering or vouching for Delano\u2019s credibility. Opening statements had made clear that the credibility of Delano would be central to the prosecution and defense cases. Defense counsel\u2019s opening had emphasized that the defense would challenge Delano\u2019s credibility on cross-examination and emphasize his motive for fabrication based upon his plea agreement with the Commonwealth. Moreover, prior to any testimony from Delano, the trial judge admonished the jury in the strongest terms to examine the testimony given pursuant to the plea agreement with \u201cextra care and caution,\u201d and that \u201cany reference to . . . truthfulness in a plea agreement does not mean that the government or the Office of the District Attorney has any way of knowing whether the witness is telling the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The prosecutor did not dwell on Delano\u2019s obligation to testify truthfully as part of the plea agreement. He merely brought out the fact that Delano had entered into a plea agreement and generally understood his obligations under it, touching only cursorily on Delano\u2019s obligation to testify truthfully. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. at 264. As both the defendant\u2019s opening statement and the judge\u2019s cautionary instructions placed Delano\u2019s credibility and the plea agreement in stark relief, to have required the prosecutor to await redirect examination to first address the issue would have likely confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The trial judge was also careful in admitting the plea agreement itself, redacting prejudicial and irrelevant provisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. at 261. Admission of the redacted agreement during direct examination was permissible in the judge\u2019s discretion, as it was clear from opening state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ments that the defendant would challenge Delano\u2019s credibility on cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The judge allowed the motion for a required finding of not guilty as to so much of the indictment as alleged battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The Commonwealth must first show \u201can adequate probability of the existence of the common venture, including participation by the given defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 709 n.7 (1976). \u201cAdequate probability\u201d means that the Commonwealth must satisfy the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. at 844.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Matters surrounding the history of the enterprise, including statements of joint venturers, may be admissible even if they predate the joint venture.
