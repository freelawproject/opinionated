(taxpayer), appeals from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) determining that it is entitled only to a partial abatement of corporate excise taxes for tax years 1981 and 1983. The taxpayer asserts that the board incorrectly concluded that its abatement application was untimely as to certain of its assessments for those years. As a result of this claimed error, the taxpayer argues that it should receive a larger abatement, pursuant to the allocation formula specified in <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 523 (1988). We affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We take our facts as found by the board. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. During the relevant time period, the taxpayer\u2019s predecessor in interest was a Wisconsin corporation engaged, with two other affiliated corporations, in business in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 15, 1982, and July 7, 1984, the taxpayer filed consolidated returns for tax years 1981 and 1983, respectively, showing substantial self-assessed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> tax due for both years. Because the taxpayer\u2019s principal reporting company was a non-Massachusetts corporation, the taxpayer utilized for its self-assessment the income allocation method specified in the Commissioner of Revenue\u2019s Letter Ruling 79-42, 3 Official MassTax Guide at 706 (West 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">On March 26, 1986, after auditing the taxpayer\u2019s returns, the commissioner notified the taxpayer of deficiency assessments for tax years 1981 and 1983, indicating that the taxpayer owed additional taxes and associated interest for those years. On March 25, 1988, the taxpayer filed an application for abate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the years 1981 and 1983. As originally filed, the taxpayer indicated that the reason it had filed was to request an \u201cadjustment of an additional assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In April, 1988, the Supreme Judicial Court released its opinion in <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 523 (1988). There, the court held that the commissioner\u2019s prescribed method for apportioning combined net income of multistate entities as set forth in letter ruling 79-42 was inconsistent with G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32B, and that a different method should have been employed. <em>Id. </em>at 530. In 1992, the taxpayer notified the commissioner that it wished to amend its 1988 application for abatement so as to recompute its combined net income using the method approved in <em>General Electric.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In December, 1992, the commissioner, after a hearing, issued a letter of proposed determination. In that letter the commissioner agreed that, although recalculating pursuant to <em>General Electric </em>would reduce the taxpayer\u2019s taxes by substantial amounts, such recalculation was required only as to the 1986 deficiency assessments, because the taxpayer\u2019s 1988 application for abatement was untimely as to the 1981 and 1983 self-assessments. In December, 1993, the taxpayer filed its petition with the board seeking review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The board ultimately concluded, in its formal opinion and order issued in April, 1998, that \u201ceven though [the taxpayer] was allowed to amend its abatement application to include issues beyond the scope of the [1986] deficiency assessment, the [taxpayer\u2019s] refund entitlement [properly] was limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>amount of the [1986] deficiency assessment.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">n. Preliminary Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The taxpayer\u2019s fail-back assertion that the board should have compelled the commissioner to use his \u201cinherent power\u201d to \u201cabate\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cillegally assessed\u201d tax pursuant to G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 36, is without merit. The board had no jurisdiction to compel the commissioner to exercise his discretion, if any, under \u00a7 36 to \u201cabate\u201d or \u201crefund\u201d an \u201cillegally assessed\u201d tax. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 41 (the abatement process under \u00a7\u00a7 37-40 \u201cshall be exclusive, whether or not the tax is wholly illegal\u201d); <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>A.W. Chesterton Co., </em>406 Mass. 466, 467-469 (1990) (the board has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for relief only as prescribed by statute; assuming without deciding that the commissioner has the inherent power to refund or abate an illegally assessed tax pursuant to \u00a7 36, the board is without jurisdiction to compel the commissioner to exercise that power if the commissioner has chosen not to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We also reject the taxpayer\u2019s alternative contention that this court can and should order the commissioner to refund the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cillegally assessed\u201d tax under \u00a7 36. We are a reviewing court, not a court of original jurisdiction, and do not consider claims not previously considered by the board. See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13; G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 10. See also <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 751-752 (1975) (even constitutional claim not presented to board may not be considered); <em>Minchin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>393 Mass. 1004, 1004-1005 (1984) (same). Although the taxpayer arguably identified the substance of this claim in its petition to the board, it concedes that the board was jurisdictionally incapable of considering it, see <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>A.W Chesterton Co., supra </em>at 467-469, and that it in fact made no attempt to argue the claim before the board. We conclude, therefore, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>like the board, we may not consider the taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 36 \u201cinherent authority\u201d claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">in. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As to the taxpayer\u2019s core contention \u2014 that the board erred in concluding that its March, 1988, abatement application, as subsequently amended, was timely as to the commissioner\u2019s 1986 deficiency assessments but untimely as to the 1981 and 1983 self-assessments \u2014 we begin by acknowledging relevant basic principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\u201cA decision of the board will not be reversed or modified if it is based on substantial evidence and a correct application of the law. In reviewing mixed questions of fact and law, the board\u2019s expertise in tax matters must be recognized, and its decisions are due some deference.\u201d <em>Erving Paper Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 17 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cThe board is an agency charged with the administration of tax law to whose interpretation of tax statutes we may give weight.\u201d <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 702, 710 (1998). See, e.g., <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>391 Mass. 630, 632 (1984). Further, \u201c[w]herever possible, we give meaning to each word in the legislation [at issue]; no word in a statute should be considered superfluous.\u201d <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). See <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972) (every word in a legislative enactment, including a tax statute, is to be given force and effect). Also, however, it \u201cis a familiar principle that tax laws are to be strictly construed,\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., supra </em>at 632; and to \u201cwhatever extent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>statute is ambiguous, we construe it in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 672, 675 (1988). The application of these principles to this case does not avail the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">When the taxpayer filed its application for abatement, G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cAny person aggrieved by the assessment of a tax . . . may apply in writing to the commissioner ... for an abatement thereof at any time within three years from the last day for filing the return for such tax, . . . within two years from the date the tax was assessed or deemed to be assessed, or within one year from the date that the tax was paid, whichever is later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, as amended by St. 1980, c. 403, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case the taxpayer concedes that its application for abatement was timely only if considered under the two-year limitations provision of \u00a7 37. In this regard the taxpayer was \u201cdeemed to be assessed\u201d on or about the date it filed its returns on July 15, 1982, and July 7, 1984, respectively. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26(a); <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. 679, 683 (1988); AP 611.1, 5 Official MassTax Guide at 678 (West 2001). The commissioner also notified the taxpayer of an additional assessment on March 26, 1986. Because the taxpayer did not file its original application for abatement until March 25, 1988, the board correctly determined that the taxpayer\u2019s application, filed nearly four years after the most recent \u201cdeemed assessment\u201d but within two years of the 1986 assessments, was untimely as to the earlier \u201cdeemed assessments,\u201d though timely as to the later 1986 assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The taxpayer argues that, because it filed its original 1988 application for abatement within two years of the 1986 deficiency assessments, its application in effect relates back to the earlier \u201cdeemed assessments\u201d and therefore remains timely as to those assessments. The basis for this assertion is the taxpayer\u2019s contention that \u201cassessment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 37 neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>sarily means \u201cthe full amount of any tax due, including any tax deemed to be assessed on the return plus any subsequent additional tax due on audit.\u201d We agree with the commissioner that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Section 37 does not represent an interpretative terra incognito shrouded in a fog of ambiguity. On the contrary, the Supreme Judicial Court has at least twice considered the limitations provisions of \u00a7 37. On those occasions the court, after considering the statute as a whole, generally concluded that \u00a7 37 provides three separate limitations periods running from a variety of triggering events: (1) a three-year period running from the date of filing; (2) a two-year period running from any subsequent assessment or deemed assessment; and (3) a one-year period running from the date of payment. Each triggering event is distinct, and each gives rise to a distinct limitations period. The taxpayer may take advantage of any of the limitations periods applicable to the taxpayer\u2019s circumstances. <em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. at 674-677; <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. at 683-684.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Most interestingly for instant purposes, in <em>Electronics Corp. </em>the commissioner argued that interpreting \u00a7 37 as creating discrete triggering events having different limitations periods effectively would allow any taxpayer to challenge any tax at any time provided only that the taxpayer filed its application within an applicable limitations period. The Supreme Judicial Court, however, noted that this is not so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cSection 37 permits applications for abatement of \u2018a tax\u2019 to be filed within one year from the date that \u2018the tax was paid.\u2019 In this case, the taxpayer admits that the only tax that was paid within one year of the abatement applications was a portion of the total tax that had been due. It is neither unreasonable nor contrary to the language of the statute for the commissioner to limit any abatement to that amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\"><em>Electronics Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>677.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., supra </em>at 683 (section 37 \u201cclearly contemplates that the dates of <em>actual assessment </em>and <em>deemed assessment </em>need not be identical, and that a taxpayer may benefit from whatever is the later date\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">This interpretation, that the limitations periods provided by \u00a7 37 are limited to the discrete events that trigger those periods, is entirely consistent with the commissioner\u2019s long-standing regulation. 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.37.1(3) (1988). During the time period relevant to this case, that regulation provided that if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cmore than three years have expired from the due date of the return and an application for abatement is filed within two years of an assessment the Commissioner will grant an abatement <em>only to the extent </em>that it relates to <em>that </em>assessment. If the time for filing an abatement application has otherwise expired and an application for abatement is filed within one year of a payment of a portion of an assessment, the Commissioner will not grant an abatement in excess of the payment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The taxpayer asserts that this interpretation is inconsistent with various other statutory provisions. It points particularly to the word \u201cassessment\u201d as used in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 31, as necessarily encompassing the total tax paid for any given tax year. We do not agree. Initially, we note that \u00a7 31 is concerned with notice rather than with assessments per se. It is not obvious, therefore, that \u00a7 31 is a valid source from which to draw useful parallels.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Moreover, the language of \u00a7 31 is not inconsistent with the thrust of the commissioner\u2019s interpretative regulation. Section 31 specifies that if the commissioner determines that an \u201cassessment of any tax is in excess of the amount shown on the return as the tax due,\u201d the commissioner shall notify the taxpayer of the additional tax due under the assessment. In other words, \u00a7 31, like \u00a7 37, draws a distinction between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201cdeemed assessment\u201d \u2014 that is, a determination of a tax \u201cat the time when the return is filed or required to be filed,\u201d G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26(a) \u2014 and a subsequent assessment determining that additional tax is owed. Such language supports the commissioner\u2019s interpretation insofar as it draws substantive distinctions between, and consequences flowing from, discretely identified events.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Unlike the commissioner\u2019s interpretation, the taxpayer\u2019s proposed construction would render much of the language of \u00a7 37 meaningless or surplusage. If, for example, an \u201cassessment\u201d necessarily includes within it a \u201cdeemed assessment,\u201d a \u201cfiling,\u201d and a \u201ctax,\u201d as the taxpayer contends, there would appear to be little reason for the Legislature to have created the three distinct limitations periods at issue or to have chosen the various triggering events listed in \u00a7 37. We reject such a construction in favor of the more rational, textually based, and established interpretation we affirm here. See <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. at 219; <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>392 Mass. at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The taxpayer further argues that the result reached by the board leads to inequitable consequences. Permitting the commissioner to assess additional taxes after returns have been filed without at the same time relating the taxpayer\u2019s abatement application back to that original filing will, the taxpayer submits, allow the commissioner to assess taxes that the taxpayer cannot challenge. We do not agree. Under \u00a7 37 the taxpayer may, if it timely files an abatement application, challenge each assessment. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37; <em>Electronics Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. at 674-677; <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>402 Mass. at 683-684. We see nothing unfair or inequitable in this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The taxpayer\u2019s underlying concern is that the statute\u2019s opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tian is unfair because it imposes a time limit within which a taxpayer may challenge an assessment. Unfortunately, \u201c[t]he central purpose of a statute of limitations is to bar all claims asserted after a certain period of time has elapsed from the date the right accrued. . . . Statutes of limitation operate mechanically, in a manner completely unrelated to the merits of a case.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 407 (1992) (citations omitted). A statute of limitations, though necessarily arbitrary, reflects a legislatively considered policy determination \u201cconcerning the point at which the interests in favor of protecting valid claims are outweighed by the interests in prohibiting the prosecution of stale ones.\u201d <em>J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan </em>v. <em>Smith Barney Inc., </em>76 F.3d 1245, 1254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 823 (1996), quoting from <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 463-464 (1975). See <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Barron, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 132 (1999) (there are \u201clong-standing important policy considerations underlying enforcement of statutes of limitations\u201d). While we recognize that a statute of limitations may operate \u201cinequitably\u201d in a particular situation, we cannot second-guess the Legislature\u2019s considered policy decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">These persons will be referenced collectively herein as the taxpayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">\u201cAn assessment of a tax liability may come about in two ways: by self-assessment or by a deficiency assessment made by DOR [Department of Revenue], A self-assessment occurs when a taxpayer files a return.

See <em>Farrell Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 567 n.6, 569-570 (1999).
