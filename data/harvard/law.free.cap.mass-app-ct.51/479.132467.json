There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>On August 8, 1997, the defendant was in the Nashua Street jail awaiting trial. At approximately 9:20 p.m., he was watching television in the multi-purpose room with six or seven other inmates when Massucco entered the room during a routine patrol of the jail. Massucco smelled smoke and asked the inmates who was smoking. The defendant sarcastically responded, \u201cYes, we\u2019re smoking dope.\u201d After some further discussion, Massucco ordered the defendant to turn off the television and approach him. Massucco intended to lock the defendant in his cell for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The defendant struck Massucco in the left side of his jaw with a closed fist. Massucco tried to \u201ctake him to the ground.\u201d As they struggled, the men fell to the floor and Massucco injured his shoulder, rendering his arm useless. The defendant punched Massucco in the face and head between ten and twenty times. Deputy Sheriff Mark Lowre witnessed the end of the altercation, and saw the defendant punch Massucco six to ten times while Massucco was incapacitated and bleeding from his nose and mouth. Lowre pulled the defendant from Massucco and attempted to restrain him. The defendant was kicking and flailing. The jail\u2019s emergency response team arrived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was so combative that it took two teams to restrain him. Deputy Sheriff Anthony Nuzzo accompanied Massucco to the clinic and observed that Massucco was bleeding heavily from his mouth, that he was bleeding from his head, face, and shoulder, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>eyes were swollen, and that his left arm was extended, rigid, and shaking. Massucco was out of work for three months following the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The defendant denied punching Massucco. He testified that he did not assault Massucco, but rather, that Massucco assaulted him and wrestled him to the ground, and that he tried to get away.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">1. <em>Evidentiary ruling. </em>During direct examination, defense counsel asked the defendant whether something had happened at the defendant\u2019s cell on the day of the altercation. The prosecutor objected, and the judge requested a sidebar conference. The prosecutor explained that his objection was based on the relevance of the expected testimony. Counsel for the defendant responded, \u201cLet me make my proffer fast. I expect my client to testify that the, that he had had problems with them prior to this incident,\u201d and explained that the testimony was relevant to Massucco\u2019s state of mind and to \u201cwhat transpired between them.\u201d The judge did not permit the testimony. Counsel did not pursue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The judge did not abuse his discretion by excluding the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding unspecified problems with the guards. A defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present evidence does not \u201cdetracts from a judge\u2019s authority to assess the relevance of proffered evidence and to exclude evidence that is of marginal relevance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 540 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">On proper offer of proof, testimony concerning events immediately preceding the assault generally would be admissible. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 90 &amp; 94 (1977) (where defendant was sole witness to any part of event, evidence that victim was mean and violent, proved by specific acts, supported the probability that victim was the aggressor); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Noble, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 422 (1987) (in assault and battery case, evidence of the victim\u2019s hostile statements toward defendant could be probative of the victim\u2019s state of mind and, therefore, admissible to show victim was aggressor).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Here, however, defense counsel\u2019s question was not particularized to the time immediately preceding the assault, and the offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>of proof failed to supply detail or clarity to the expected testimony or to its purpose and theory of admissibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735-736 &amp; 738 (1986) (vague and generalized offer of proof which does not clearly show the purpose and the theory under which the evidence was offered is inadequate); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 35 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 680 (1988). This is not a case where the judge did not need an offer of proof to make the correct ruling because counsel\u2019s wide open question may also have elicited inadmissible, irrelevant evidence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 578, 582 (1988). The relevance of such testimony was not readily apparent in light of the evidence of the severe and excessive beating delivered by the defendant, particularly since the defendant denied striking even a single blow. In the circumstances, the judge reasonably could have excluded the testimony. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zitano, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 405-406 (1987) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that trial judge improperly excluded testimony of specific incidents of the victim\u2019s violent behavior where there was not a \u201chint in the transcript . . . that defense counsel wished to inquire of the witnesses about . . . specific incidents\u201d relied upon in the defendant\u2019s brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The defendant also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the testimony of previous \u201cproblems\u201d should have been admitted to shed light on the defendant\u2019s state of mind. This would have permitted the defendant to demonstrate the reasonableness of his apprehension of violent behavior by Massucco and, therefore, would justify his actions on a theory of self-defense. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 588 (1945) (evidence of threats by victim to defendant and of victim\u2019s violent character, if known by defendant, may be admitted to show defendant\u2019s apprehension for his own safety and reasonableness of that apprehension). Although defense counsel requested a self-defense instruction, the case was not tried on a theory of self-defense. The theory at trial, as shown by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>defendant\u2019s testimony and counsel\u2019s closing argument, was that the defendant did not assault Massucco at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A party \u201cis not permitted to raise an issue before the trial court on a specific ground, and then to present that issue to [the reviewing] court on a different ground.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>387 Mass. 191, 213 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1175 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>362 Mass. 455, 472 (1972). Self-defense would have been an implausible defense in any case given the requirement that the force used be \u201cno greater than required in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 248 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">2. <em>Juror dismissal. </em>Prior to deliberations, one of the jurors verbalized frustration to the judge about the inefficiency of the judicial process and the length of the proceedings. The defendant moved to strike the juror. The judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to strike the juror or to conduct a voir dire of the other jurors. Nor was he required to offer a curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The decision to discharge a juror is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge. See G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 39 (\u201cThe court shall have the discretionary authority to dismiss a juror at any time in the best interests of justice\u201d). When there is an indication that a juror is unable to perform his or her duties, a judge may properly discharge that juror. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 613-614 (1999) (juror properly dismissed after he said that he had to smoke marijuana in order to stay awake at trial). When a juror makes statements that indicate bias, failure to discharge the juror generally is reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 804 &amp; n.5 (1995) (juror\u2019s statements that he \u201cwould hope\u201d he could be fair to the Cambodian defendant were indications of ethnic bias and judge\u2019s failure to excuse the juror for cause was reversible error). A juror\u2019s complaints about the length of the proceedings, or expressions of frustration about having to serve as a juror, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>not necessarily reflect the juror\u2019s inability to perform his or her function as an impartial trier of fact and, therefore, it is properly within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to refuse to discharge such a juror. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mabey, </em>299 Mass. 96, 99-100 (1937) (no indication that jury was unable or unwilling to give full and careful consideration to the evidence in spite of foreman\u2019s statements that jury was beginning to \u201cget kind of jumpy\u201d and that \u201c[w]e [the jury] are just dying to get out\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Moreover, a judge who refuses to discharge a complaining juror also has the discretion to refuse to conduct a voir dire of the remaining jurors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 96 (1986) (trial judge did not abuse discretion by refusing to discharge juror who told judge, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be, but I\u2019m here,\u201d and by refusing to question the jurors individually about complaining juror\u2019s influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Expressions of run-of-the-mill frustrations by an exasperated juror about the judicial process are to be expected and should not ordinarily provide a basis to overturn a decision on appeal. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mutina, </em>366 Mass. 810, 819 (1975) (\u201cDespite his good will, maturity, acumen and sense of civic responsibility and despite his willingness to accept and his efforts to apply judicial instructions, the juror comes to the court room complete with that knowledge and those experiences, expectations, fears and frustrations which have shaped his character and attitudes. Quite apart from questions of obvious bias or admitted prejudice, no juror enters into his temporary judicial service stripped of his background and emotions. To hold otherwise would be to defy human experience\u201d). The complaining juror merely expressed frustration with the inefficiency of the judicial process when he stated that \u201c[i]t seemed that maybe [the proceedings] could, with all due respect please, . . . be a little more efficient. . . .\u201d We concur with the judge\u2019s observation that \u201cfrustration does not equal bias.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mabey, </em>299 Mass. at 99-100; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">There was no indication that the juror\u2019s complaints indicated impermissible bias or reflected an inability to perform .his function as an impartial trier of fact. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. at 804 &amp; n.5. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to remove the complaining juror was a proper exercise of his discretion. G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Finally, the juror\u2019s remarks did not constitute an extraneous influence upon the jury, because the remarks did not contain \u201cspecific facts not mentioned at trial concerning one of the parties or the matter in litigation [that] were brought to the attention of the deliberating jury by [the] juror.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 200 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The defendant was charged with simple assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, rather than assault and battery on a correction officer, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 38B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">When Massucco fell, his \u201cman down\u201d alarm summoned an emergency response team.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">There is no indication in the record, and no claim by the defendant, that the judge in any way inhibited counsel from making a competent offer of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The trial judge instructed the jury on self-defense, presumably out of an abundance of caution. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 575-576 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 63, 68 n.5 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In fact, had such testimony been admitted, it would likely not have assisted the defendant, as it could have provided the motive for the defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
