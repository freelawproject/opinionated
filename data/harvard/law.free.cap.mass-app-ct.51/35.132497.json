The judge\u2019s findings of fact, summarized below, were supported by the evidence adduced at the bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The customers (the Govonis) are small, family-owned companies, of which Henry Govoni was president and Donald Govoni, Sr., and Donald Govoni, Jr., were the treasurers. For more than twenty years, the Govonis employed James A. Maddalena as their accountant. The Govonis placed their trust in Maddalena, allowing him to keep their financial records, reconcile their checkbooks, and prepare their taxes. When Maddalena requested tax checks from the treasurers, they simply signed checks in the requested amounts and gave them back to Maddalena for routing. They did not supervise, question or audit him, nor did they request receipts or review bank statements or tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">During the period at issue in this litigation, that is, between February, 1988, and December, 1990, the Govonis, guided by falsely inflated tax returns prepared by Maddalena, drew numerous checks to the order of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the Division of Employment Security (DES) to pay State taxes (the Commonwealth/DES checks, totaling $147,422.89), and to the order of the defendant Mechanics Bank to pay Federal taxes (the Mechanics Bank checks, totaling $503,352.08).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These checks were drawn on various Govoni accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>maintained at the Mechanics Bank. Instead of using them to pay taxes, Maddalena deposited the checks into the account of his own accounting company, A.R. Davis Associates, Inc. (A.R. Davis), which account was also maintained at the Mechanics Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Maddalena accomplished his fraud by making deposits to his A.R. Davis account at the bank\u2019s branch office in Holden, where he was a known and regular customer, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> during times when the branch was busy. He would bury the Govonis\u2019 unindorsed checks in multiple item deposits of checks payable to A.R. Davis. Many deposits had at least eight items, and some had as many as sixty-one. The bank\u2019s practice on multi-item deposits was for its tellers to quickly \u201cfan\u201d (i.e., flip through) the checks, scanning the back sides for missing indorsements and returning unindorsed checks to the presenter. However, the tellers were not required to inspect the face of a check to ensure it was indorsed by the named payee. Moreover, depending on the level of activity at the branch, the number of customers waiting in line, and familiarity with the depositor, a teller could entirely dispense with fanning. The judge inferred that in Maddalena\u2019s case, because he was a regular customer presenting multi-item deposits during busy times, the tellers did not fan for indorsements and were thus unaware that he had inserted the Govonis\u2019 unindorsed checks into the multi-item stacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">After Maddalena presented a stack of checks, the tellers then entered a provisional credit to the A.R. Davis account for the total amount written by Maddalena on the deposit slip. The checks were next sent to a central processing center for \u201cproofing,\u201d a process of checking the amount indicated on each deposit slip against a manual totaling of the individual checks accompanying each deposit slip. Proofing did not include the verification of signatures or indorsements. After proofing, each check was stamped with a Mechanics Bank processing stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The checks were next sent through an automated sorter. For checks such as these, drawn on one account at the bank and deposited to another account at the bank, the sorting process resulted in the drawer\u2019s account being debited and the depositor\u2019s account receiving final credit, both as of day\u2019s end. The sorting machine diverted individual checks of $7,500 or more for manual review; checks below this amount were stored without further review. Manual review included verifying that the checks were indorsed by the payee. Of the 132 checks fraudulently deposited, twenty-nine Mechanics Bank checks and six Commonwealth/DES checks met the $7,500 threshold and were manually reviewed. The twenty-nine Mechanics Bank checks raised no questions during manual review because the processing stamp administered during proofing was treated as a valid indorsement of the bank, the named payee. Following a bank policy of processing State tax checks despite a lack of indorsement, the six unindorsed Commonwealth/DES checks were also not questioned. The bank\u2019s policy was intended to prevent the Commonwealth from assessing interest and penalties for late tax payments against customer/taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">As a result of these procedures, which testimony showed to be identical to those of comparable banks in the area (including, at the time of trial, BayBank, Shawmut, and Bank of Boston), Maddalena was able to deposit into his A.R. Davis account 132 checks payable to the bank, the Commonwealth or the DES, which collectively represented $650,774.97 of the Govonis\u2019 funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In December, 1990, the Govonis discovered Maddalena\u2019s fraud and in February, 1991, instituted this action against the bank, asserting claims they styled as common law negligence, money had and received, and conversion under the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. The bank brought third-party claims against Maddalena and A.R. Davis for breach of transfer warranties, conversion, fraud, and common law indemnification, and against the two individual Govoni treasurers for indemnification. After a bench trial, with respect to the Mechanics Bank checks the judge rejected the Govonis\u2019 conversion and money had and received claims, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>found the bank negligent, adopting the negligence standard articulated in <em>Sun \u2019n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Cal. Bank, </em>21 Cal. 3d 671, 692-696 (1978). He also found the Govonis twenty-five percent negligent and accordingly reduced the award on the Mechanics Bank checks under the comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85. The judge found for the bank on all counts as to the Commonwealth/DES checks. Finally, he rejected the bank\u2019s claims against the two Govoni treasurers and the Govonis\u2019 claims against the bank under G. L. c. 93A. Both the Govonis and the bank appealed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AUK\"><em>1. Checks payable to the order of Mechanics Bank. </em>Although the Govonis characterized their action as sounding in conversion under the Uniform Commercial Code (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-419, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or in money had and received or negligence under the common law, the allegations of their complaint<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are properly characterized as setting out a claim of wrongful debit because the checks were not properly payable to Maddalena under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-401(1), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This is a common law claim that was retained under the Uniform Commercial Code. See <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>345 Mass. 1, 9-11 (1962); <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>New England Merchs. Natl. Bank, </em>386 Mass. 672, 675 (1982).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">As the phrase \u201cproperly payable\u201d was left effectively undefined by the original code,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is appropriate to ascertain its meaning by reference to the common law. See White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 18-3, at 878 (3d ed. 1988). While the parties have not cited, and we have not found, a Massachusetts case in which a bank has made payment to an unauthorized bearer on an unindorsed check made payable to the bank itself, there appears to be a general (and perhaps universal) rule in other jurisdictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cWhere a check is drawn to the order of a bank to which the drawer is not indebted, the bank is authorized to pay the proceeds only to persons specified by the drawer; it takes the risk in treating such a check as payable to bearer and is placed on inquiry as to the authority of the drawer\u2019s agent to receive payment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, </em>39 Md. App. 707, 715 (Ct. Spec. App. 1978), quoting from 9 C.J.S. Banks &amp; Banking \u00a7 340, at 683 (1938).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Dalton &amp; Marberry, P.C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>v. <em>NationsBank, N.A., </em>982 S.W.2d 231, 234 &amp; n.2 (Mo. 1998), and cases cited. This rule is consistent with the code, and we have found no jurisdiction rejecting it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The results reached in somewhat comparable Massachusetts cases convince us that the rule expresses the law of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Based on this rule, the Mechanics Bank checks were not properly payable from the Govoni accounts absent inquiry by the bank into Maddalena\u2019s authority to receive the proceeds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Master Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Inkrott, </em>55 Ohio St. 3d 23, 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>(1990); <em>id. </em>at 29-30 (Holmes, J., concurring). Compare <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 715, 721 (1980) (check paid over unauthorized signature not properly payable).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the bank made no such inquiry, we need not decide what depth of inquiry might have been required to discharge the bank\u2019s duty before it made any payment on the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The bank raises several defenses to avoid liability for paying these checks, which were not properly payable, to the A.R. Davis account. We discuss these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">A. <em>The \u201cfictitious payee\u201d (or \u201cpadded payroll\u201d) rule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The fictitious payee rule, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-405(l)(c), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c[a]n indorsement by any person in the name of a named payee is effective if . . . (c) an agent or employee of the maker or drawer has supplied [the maker or drawer] with the name of the payee intending the latter to have no such interest.\u201d \u201cThis section places the loss on the drawer when an employee supplies him with the name of the payee intending that the named payee have no interest in the check and <em>an indorsement is forged in the name of the named </em>payee\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>McCarthy, Kenney &amp; Reidy, RC. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston, </em>402 Mass. 630, 634 (1988). The effect of the rule is to treat certain fraudulent indorsements as genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The bank argues that the rule applies because Maddalena never intended the bank to have an interest in the checks and because the bank, the named payee, subsequently indorsed the checks. The checks, however, were never fraudulently indorsed. Maddalena presented the checks designating the bank as payee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>to the bank without any indorsement. The bank accepted these unindorsed checks and provisionally credited the proceeds to Maddalena\u2019s account. The bank subsequently stamped each check with a Mechanics Bank processing stamp. The parties dispute whether the stamp constituted an indorsement. The dispute is immaterial because the stamp, if regarded as an indorsement, was genuine, the bank being the named payee. \u201c[T]he benefit of [the fictitious payee rule] runs to those who acquire an interest subsequent to the forgery of the indorsement; it does not improve the status of the named payee or of the person who actually executes the indorsement.\u201d <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Groveland State Bank, </em>44 A.D.2d 182, 185-186 (N.Y. 1974), modified on other grounds, 37 N.Y.2d 252 (1975) (citing <em>Pacific Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Security First Natl. Bank, </em>248 Cal. App. 2d 75 [1967]). Because the Mechanics Bank checks contained no forged indorsements, the fictitious payee rule does not apply.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Groveland State Bank, supra </em>(fictitious payee rule not applicable where improperly paid checks contained only the genuine indorsement of the named payee). See also <em>State of Qatar </em>v. <em>First Am. Bank of Va., </em>880 F. Supp. 463, 468 (E.D. Va. 1995) (rule does not apply to checks containing no indorsement); <em>Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Security First Natl. Bank, supra </em>at 92-94 (rule inapplicable where unindorsed check was in fact delivered to named payee bank, which paid check to depositor without verifying his authority to receive funds); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Bank of Cal., </em>276 Cal. App. 2d 485, 489-490 (1969) (rule inapplicable where bank paid check without any indorsement).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>B. <em>Estoppel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The bank argues that the Govonis\u2019 negligence in failing to supervise their accountant estops them from asserting the bank\u2019s wrongdoing in the first instance. Even if the Govonis were negligent, the bank\u2019s contention lacks merit under both the code\u2019s provisions and the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We consider first the estoppel-like affirmative defense provided by G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-406, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, which precluded a party whose \u201cnegligence substantially contributes to a material alteration of the instrument or to the making of an unauthorized signature . . . from asserting the alteration or lack of authority\u201d against the bank if the bank paid the check \u201cin good faith and in accordance with . . . reasonable commercial standards.\u201d This preclusion is unavailable to the bank for two reasons. First, the provision is irrelevant because, as noted earlier, the Govonis do not assert an alteration or unauthorized signature, but an improper disbursal of the check proceeds. See <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, </em>39 Md. App. at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Second, we conclude that the payment of the checks violated \u201creasonable commercial standards,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which strips the bank of</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the ability to invoke the provision even if it were relevant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 723-724. There is ample authority finding a failure to comply with \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d in these circumstances. Although adherence to such norms is often a question of fact, see <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra </em>at 721-724; <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, supra </em>at 714, certain conduct has been considered so unjustified as to be commercially unreasonable as a matter of law. For example, the following situations, quite similar to the case at bar, \u201chave involved clearly unreasonable conduct on the part of the bank: payment of checks with missing indorsements, failure to respect restrictive indorsements, failure to inquire into the authority to sign of one purporting to be an agent, and allowing deposit of a check indorsed by a corporate payee into a personal account\u201d (footnotes omitted). White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 15-5, at 761-762 (3d ed. 1988) (collecting cases). \u201cTwo other examples of obviously negligent conduct include payment of checks bearing irregular or incorrect indorsements and honoring a check on which the name of the payee has been visibly altered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-7, at 807 n.l (citations omitted). Likewise, other courts have specifically found that the payment of a check by a payee bank to an unauthorized third party without inquiry by the bank is commercially unreasonable as a matter of law. See, e.g., <em>Bullitt County Bank </em>v. <em>Publishers Printing Co., </em>684 S.W.2d 289, 291-293 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984); <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, supra </em>at 722; <em>Master Chem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Inkrott, </em>55 Ohio St. 3d at 25. See also <em>Olean Area Camp Fire Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olean Dresser Clark Fed. Credit Union, </em>142 Misc. 2d 1049, 1062 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1989) (\u201cIn charity we will withhold characterizing such conduct as \u2018abject stupidity\u2019 and call it merely negligence of the grossest kind\u201d). The bank\u2019s showing that other area banks, following identical procedures, would also have allowed payment of these checks cannot alone make those procedures reasonable in contemplation of law. An entire industry may behave unreasonably. \u201c[Ajlthough the bank ha[s] established that the procedures it ha[s] followed in paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the check[s] were common among banks, it ha[s] failed to show that such procedures were reasonable.\u201d <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra </em>at 723, citing <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Glastonbury Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>170 Conn. 691 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The bank argues that the vast number of checks a modern bank must rapidly process<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> makes it practically impossible for it to examine all presented checks for such information as the identity of the named payee. While forcefully made, the substance of this argument is called into question by a recent report of the Federal government\u2019s Check Fraud Working Group.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The report instructs banks to confirm the identity of customers presenting checks,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to record identification information on the back of each check,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and to train tellers to look for telltale signs of check fraud, including attempts to deposit checks payable to corporations into the accounts of individuals.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If for the sake of efficiency banks feel that they must forgo these prudent safeguards, they should also appreciate that they must bear the losses that result as a cost of doing business. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We next consider common law estoppel. Without deciding whether the code has displaced common law estoppel, we conclude that even if not displaced it would not assist the bank. In the context of bank-customer relations, the test for estoppel by negligence was stated in <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>v. <em>National Shawmut Bank, </em>201 Mass. 397, 408 (1909): \u201c[N]egligence of the maker is immaterial unless it is of a kind that directly and proximately affects the conduct of the banker in the performance of his duties.\u201d The Govonis\u2019 failure to oversee Maddaiena did not directly cause the bank\u2019s failure of inquiry, and it has no common law estoppel defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>C. <em>Holder in due course status.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><em>A </em>holder in due course takes an instrument free from all claims and from all defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has not dealt, except certain so-called \u201creal\u201d defenses. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-305, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. The bank asserts that it qualifies as a holder in due course and is therefore protected from liability to the Govonis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">A holder in due course under the original code was a holder who took an instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice that it was overdue, had been dishonored, or was subject to any defense or claim to it on the part of another. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-302(1), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. Generally under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201c[a] person has \u2018notice\u2019 of a fact when (a) he has actual knowledge of it; or <em>(b) </em>he has received a notice or notification of it; or (c) from all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(25), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Specific to the holder in due course context, under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-304(l)(a), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, a party was regarded as having notice if \u201cthe instrument is ... so irregular as to call into question its validity, terms or ownership or to create an ambiguity as to the party to pay.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Here, the bank had reason to know that the checks it received designated it as payee, and it failed to discharge its duty to inquire into the presenter\u2019s authority to receive the proceeds. See <em>Bank of S. Md. </em>v. <em>Robertson\u2019s Crab House, </em>39 Md. App. at 722. The checks on their face left unanswered the critical question whom to pay and thus put the bank on notice of the Govonis\u2019 claim against the checks. Cf. <em>Medeiros </em>v. <em>Fellsway Motors, Inc., </em>326 Mass. 656, 658 (1951) (holder charged with notice of what appears on face of instrument); <em>First Natl. Bank of Cape Cod </em>v. <em>North Adams Hoosac Sav. Bank, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 790, 795-796 (1979). The bank therefore does not qualify as a holder in due course, and in so deciding, we join a number of other courts reaching the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>result on similar facts. See, e.g., <em>Sun \u2019n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Cal. Bank, </em>21 Cal. 3d at 689-690; <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Wanes, </em>120 Ill. App. 3d 36, 45-46 (1983); <em>Allis Chalmers Leasing Servs. Corp. </em>v. <em>Byron Center State Bank, </em>129 Mich. App. 602, 607-609 (1983); <em>Dalton &amp; Marberry, P.C. </em>v. <em>NationsBank, N.A., </em>982 S.W.2d at 235.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">D. <em>Comparative negligence and indemnification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">After finding the bank liable in negligence on the Mechanics Bank checks, the trial judge also found the Govonis to have been twenty-five percent negligent in failing to oversee their accountant, and applied the comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, to reduce the defendant\u2019s liability to seventy-five percent of the total. The bank argues that this allocation was clear error, and that the Govonis were over fifty percent negligent, which under the statute places aU of the loss on the Govonis. However, we agree with the Govonis that the statute is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">First, a claim for wrongful debit of items not properly payable under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-401, is one of strict liability. See <em>Ambassador Financial Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Indiana Natl.

See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 353 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Second, the comparative negligence statute is \u201cdisplaced by the particular provisions\u201d of the code. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-103. Cf. <em>Arkwright Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>428 Mass. 600, 604-606 (1998). Against the strict liability of the wrongful debit action retained by \u00a7 4-401, the code provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>affirmative defenses that incorporated concepts of negligence. See <em>McCarthy, Kenney &amp; Reidy, P.C. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston, </em>402 Mass. at 633. For example, as discussed above, \u00a7 3-406 allowed a bank that followed \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d to preclude a plaintiff whose negligence substantially contributed to the making of a material alteration or unauthorized signature from asserting the alteration or lack of authority against the bank. Similarly, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 4-406(3), inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, denied a bank that failed to use ordinary care the defense that the plaintiff customer failed to exercise reasonable care in examining periodic statements of account. These provisions expressed a form of contributory negligence whereby the bank, if at all negligent, may have been liable regardless of the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence. See <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 723; White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 16-7, at 806-807 (3d ed. 1988). The original code\u2019s dual reliance on notions of strict liability and contributory negligence in allocating liability between drawer and drawee left no room for a comparative negligence standard. See <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>NCNB Natl. Bank of N.C., </em>958 F.2d 1544, 1550-1552 (11th Cir. 1992) (applying Florida law); <em>Putnam Rolling Ladder Co. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., supra </em>at 348 (\u201c[t]he importation of comparative negligence into the UCC \u2014 which was drafted before widespread acceptance of comparative fault \u2014 is not without' its advocates . . . but has generally been rejected by both courts and commentators\u201d), citing White &amp; Summers, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 16-7, at 809 n.6.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">For similar reasons, the bank is not entitled to common law indemnification from the Govoni treasurers. The code\u2019s carefully devised allocation of liability must be seen to displace common law indemnification just as it displaces comparative negligence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>2. <em>Checks payable to the Commonwealth or the DES. </em>The defendant for similar reasons is also liable for its improper disbursal of the proceeds of the Commonwealth/DES checks. Maddalena was not entitled to payment on those checks because they were not \u201cdrawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201(20), as amended by St. 1983, c. 522, \u00a7 3. See generally 9 C.J.S. Banks &amp; Banking \u00a7 342 (1996) (\u201cWhere a check designates a payee, the bank generally may charge the customer\u2019s account only if payment is made to such payee or the payee\u2019s indorsee\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 343 (\u201c[t]he payment of such a check to one other than the payee, without a valid indorsement of the payee, is at the risk of the bank\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">At trial the bank successfully invoked the defense of commercial reasonableness under \u00a7 3-406. The judge found that the Govonis* negligence in dealing with their accountant substantially contributed to the fraudulent scheme, and that the bank followed \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d in paying the checks. The latter finding was based on the policy of the bank, identical to that of comparable local banks, of paying out tax checks made to the order of the Commonwealth or the DES, even without payee indorsements, to protect customers from late tax payment penalties. Were the checks in fact presented by the named payees, this practice would not expose the bank to liability. See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>361 Mass. 258, 260-261 (1972) (payment over forged indorsement not basis for recovery by drawer where intended payee received payment). But here the bank failed to conduct even the most basic of inquiries into whether the checks were in fact presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>by an agent of the Commonwealth or deposited to an account of the Commonwealth. This failure invites fraud against both the Commonwealth and the bank\u2019s depositors, and is commercially unreasonable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">3. <em>The Govonis\u2019 chapter 93A claims. </em>The Govonis\u2019 claims under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, that the bank engaged in unfair or deceptive acts were properly rejected by the judge. Even if the bank is characterized as negligent, this by itself does not amount to a chapter 93A violation. See <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 234 (1985). The bank was merely following procedures that, although resulting in improper payment, were widely utilized by similar banks in the area. No act of the bank fits within a common law conception of unfairness or was \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous.\u201d <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979), quoting from 29 Fed. Reg. 8325, 8355 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">4. <em>Summary. </em>We conclude that the bank wrongfully debited plaintiffs\u2019 account when, without any inquiry into Maddalena\u2019s authority, it paid to him the proceeds of the Mechanics Bank checks. The bank\u2019s defenses based on the \u201cfictitious payee\u201d rule, estoppel, holder in due course status, and common law indemnification are all without merit. Moreover, the trial court erroneously applied the comparative negligence statute to reduce the Govonis\u2019 recovery. The bank is fully liable to the Govonis for the Mechanics Bank checks, which totaled $503,352.08. The bank is also hable to the Govonis for improperly debiting their account for the Commonwealth/DES checks, which totaled $147,422.89. The Govonis\u2019 chapter 93A claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s amended judgment is to be modified by eliminating the prefatory paragraph that includes the reference to the reduction for the plaintiffs\u2019 comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>negligence, by striking the figure $384,514.06 and inserting in its place the figure $650,774.97, and by making appropriate adjustments in interest. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-12\">A corporation can pay Federal taxes at the bank by depositing funds into a tax account there.

See <em>McCarthy, Kenney &amp; Reidy, P.C. </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston, </em>402 Mass, at 634. Contrary to the bank\u2019s argument, we consider the bank\u2019s position superior to that of the Govonis as far as preventing the diversion of the check proceeds. In this regard, the words of the California Supreme Court are persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201c[The comments to \u00a7 3-405] contemplate that losses resulting from certain fraudulent employee behavior \u2014 i.e., causing the issuance of checks to payees intended to have no interest therein \u2014 should be risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of the employer\u2019s business and not of the banking community. This conclusion derives from the premise that the employer/drawer is better able to prevent the success of such frauds than the bank; the former may exercise care in selecting and supervising its employees, while the latter is typically presented with checks bearing indorsements forged in a manner that may be difficult if not practically impossible to detect. The comments assume, however, that such checks will never be delivered to the named payees, whether or not such payees are real persons or entities. We perceive this supposition to be critical to the loss allocative function of [\u00a7 3-405]. While it may be less difficult for the employer to prevent the issuance of such checks than for the bank to detect that an indorsement is forged, this is not the relevant comparison when the bank is presented with checks naming it as payee. In the latter circumstance the bank is confronted with an obvious irregularity when the drawer\u2019s dishonest employee attempts to\u2019 negotiate such checks for his own benefit. The bank does not have to be especially vigilant; its agent need only read what appears on the face of the check to be warned that a fraud may be in progress. It is clear therefore that the balance struck under [\u00a7 3-405] has no application in the present context. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0q\"><em>Sun \u2019n Sand, Inc. </em>v. <em>United Cal.

Co. </em>v. <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>428 Mass. at 602-604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">There is widespread authority that \u201cpayment of checks with missing indorsements\u201d involves \u201cclearly unreasonable conduct on the part of the bank.\u201d White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 15-5, at 761 &amp; n.12 (3d ed. 1988) (collecting cases).
