Champagne, individually and in his capacity as the chief of police of the city of Peabody, John A. McCorry, individually and in his capacity as a lieutenant in the Peabody police department, and Milton Cottrell, individually and in his capacity as a captain in the Peabody police department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b598-11\">Gillerman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV5z\">The plaintiff Frederick Howcroft, formerly a police officer employed by the city of Peabody, brought this action against the city of Peabody and several Peabody police officers, claiming principally that his First Amendment right to speak out on a matter of public interest had been infringed by the retaliatory acts of the defendants. See <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968); <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Tangipahoa Parish Library Bd. of Control, </em>224 F.3d 359, 365-366 (5th Cir. 2000). Howcroft\u2019s concern was smoking in public buildings, in this case, the Peabody police station. On January 14, 1988, the Governor approved a comprehensive statute devoted to this subject, which, in part, prohibited smoking in public places including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">\u201cany public elevator, supermarket or retail food outlet, in or upon any public mass transit conveyances or indoor platform or enclosed outdoor platform, at any open meeting of a governmental body . . . [or] in any courthouse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>school, college, university, museum, library, train, airplane, waiting area of an airport, waiting area of a health care facility . . . group child care center, school-aged day care center, or family day care center <em>... or in any public building, </em>except in an area which has specifically been designated as a smoking area. An area shall be designated as a smoking area only if nonsmoking areas of sufficient size and capacity are available to accommodate nonsmokers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, inserted by St. 1987, c. 759, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Two days earlier, the Governor had approved a statute providing that after January 1, 1988,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cno person who smokes any tobacco product shall be eligible for appointment as a police officer or firefighter in a city or town and no person so appointed after said date shall continue in such office or position if such person thereafter smokes any tobacco products. The personnel administrator shall promulgate regulations for the implementation of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 101A, inserted by St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Regulations promulgated by the personnel administrator on October 6, 1988, interpreted the prohibition to include \u201call time off the job as well as all time on the job.\u201d <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>426 Mass. 1, 3 (1997). We discuss this latter statute in more detail at note 19, and related text, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">In his verified amended complaint, Howcroft alleged that the defendants violated his Federal and State civil rights and, in addition, that they intentionally inflicted emotional distress and intentionally interfered with his contractual and/or advantageous relations. The Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>for summary judgment on all counts and Howcroft appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The relevant facts appearing in the summary judgment materials<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> extend over a period of more than five years. We summarize these materials, which we view in the light most favorable to Howcroft, and we draw therefrom all reasonable inferences in his favor. See <em>Douillard </em>v. <em>LMR, Inc., </em>433 Mass. 162, 163 (2001). The dominant (but not exclusive) issue is whether, as the defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> argue, Howcroft was expressing only his personal grievances about the presence of tobacco smoke in the police station, or whether, as Howcroft insists, he exercised his First Amendment right to speak out on a subject of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Howcroft was hired by the city as a police officer in 1969. Beginning in about 1977, Howcroft had sinus problems. Regular treatment and a number of operations were required. Howcroft had been a heavy smoker, but his new sensitivity to smoke led him to quit smoking altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">By 1985, Howcroft commonly experienced headaches, sinus blockages, nose bleeds, watery and itching eyes, difficulty in breathing, and elevated blood pressure levels as well as serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>respiratory tract discomfort caused by inhaling the tobacco smoke of others while at work in the police station. Concerned about his health, he brought the issue of tobacco smoke to his superiors on several occasions beginning in 1987, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On June 22, 1988, defendant Robert Champagne, the chief of the Peabody police department, issued a \u201cGeneral Order, Rules for Control Room,\u201d dated June 22, 1988, prohibiting smoking in the control room at the station, a large open space shared by the officers. At the same time Champagne designated the front lobby as the police station\u2019s smoking area. These orders were consistent with G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22 (quoted above), but ignored the fact that G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 101A (quoted above), passed six months earlier and applicable to all officers appointed after January 1, 1988, prohibited smoking by such police officers both on the job and off the job.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In 1989, Howcroft, then a patrol sergeant, worked primarily outside the station, although periodically he was required to work in the control room where, as noted above, smoking was prohibited. In early 1989, Howcroft, after becoming aware of the provisions of c. 270, \u00a7 22 \u2014 but apparently unaware of the provisions of c. 41, \u00a7 101A \u2014 told his immediate supervisor, Lieutenant John McCorry, of his sensitivity to smoking and requested that smoking be prohibited at roll call.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, McCorry began to smoke cigars at roll call and distributed cigars to at least one other officer during roll call. McCorry and other officers, including Champagne, also continued to smoke regularly in areas not designated for smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the fall of 1989, Howcroft confronted McCorry about his smoking in off-limits areas. In response, McCorry blew smoke in Howcroft\u2019s face and told him to \u201cshut up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">On December 6, 1989, following Howcroft\u2019s complaints that there was a State law banning smoking in public buildings outside designated areas, McCorry ordered Howcroft to stand in a comer of the room during roll call, with at least three officers present. Shortly thereafter, McCorry reassigned Howcroft to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>position of operations sergeant, with duties <em>inside </em>the station.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Howcroft immediately asked McCorry to reconsider, noting the possible \u201cserious health risk\u201d of the reassignment. McCorry did not respond, and the following day Howcroft requested of the defendant Captain Milton Cottrell, McCorry\u2019s superior, that Howcroft be permitted to announce at roll call that the front lobby was the only designated smoking area, and also asked that McCorry\u2019s reassignment order be rescinded. Cottrell refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">By letter dated December 7, 1989, Howcroft brought to Champagne\u2019s attention that the provisions of G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, were being disregarded and asked Champagne, as expressly permitted by \u00a7 22, to investigate the situation and inform Howcroft of his findings. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In response, Champagne told Howcroft that \u201c[t]his is my building and as far as I am concerned, it is a smoking building and I know the law better than you do.\u201d Champagne did not respond in writing, as required by \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The parties did agree that Howcroft would be allowed to close the connecting door between the lobby, where smoking was permitted, and the control room, where smoking was not permitted and where Howcroft worked. The following day, however, McCorry ordered that the connecting door be kept open. Howcroft\u2019s nose soon began to bleed and he left work early to seek medical attention. Despite repeated requests by Howcroft, neither Champagne nor Cottrell enforced the agreement to keep the door shut. On several occasions between December of 1989 and January of 1990, Howcroft wrote his superiors, providing them with notes from two doctors recommending that he not be exposed to smoke because of his sinus condition. Champagne called one of the physicians a \u201cphony.\u201d Cottrell did not respond to these letters in writing and orally supported McCorry\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Howcroft\u2019s health continued to deteriorate. On December 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>1989, when Howcroft informed McCorry that he was going home sick because of the blockage of his sinuses and a severe sinus headache, McCorry\u2019s response was to relieve Howcroft from duty indefinitely, telling him not to return without a note from a doctor stating he is fit for duty. On January 3, Howcroft requested permission from Cottrell to return to work, asserting he was fit for duty. Cottrell denied the request and warned Howcroft not to \u201cbother the chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On January 24, 1990, Cottrell, acting on Champagne\u2019s order, told Howcroft to report to the station and asked him to write a report detailing his condition. The information requested in the report had been provided by Howcroft in the series of letters from the previous month. Howcroft, who attended the meeting with union representatives, requested that he be allowed to speak with an attorney before answering the questions. Cottrell dismissed him, claiming that Howcroft had failed to comply with his order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">On January 29, 1990, after calling Howcroft an \u201cabuser\u201d of sick time, Champagne ordered Howcroft back to work. Howcroft immediately complied with that order. On January 30, 1990, McCorry assigned a smoker to the desk at which Howcroft was working. McCorry subsequently entered the control room smoking a cigar and when Howcroft objected, McCorry told him to \u201cshut up.\u201d During that same shift, Howcroft requested in writing that the air quality of the station be tested by the Department of Labor and Industries, Division of Occupational Hygiene (DLI).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Over the following days, McCorry ordered officers to smoke right at the door leading into the control room. On January 31, 1990, after McCorry had positioned two smokers close to the control room door, Howcroft\u2019s sinuses became blocked and he developed a severe headache. When Howcroft requested permission to go home, McCorry, acting at Champagne\u2019s direction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ordered Howcroft to place himself <em>in the custody of the patrol sergeant </em>for transportation to a local hospital. The patrol sergeant was ordered to wait with Howcroft through the examination. A doctor examined Howcroft and diagnosed a sinus infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On February 8, 1990, three days after Howcroft gave the defendants a letter from a doctor stating he \u201ccannot be subjected to smoke or be in a poorly ventilated room,\u201d Champagne suspended Howcroft for five days without pay for \u201cabuse of sick leave.\u201d Howcroft appealed the suspension to the final appointing authority, the mayor of Peabody, who increased the suspension to ten days. Howcroft appealed the suspension to the Civil Service Commission (the commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">On appeal to the commission, an administrative magistrate found that the grounds for the discipline were \u201cpurely [a] pretext.\u201d The magistrate explained that both McCorry and Cottrell \u201cwere out to get [Howcroft] and were trying to come up with any reason at all to discipline him.\u201d Finding no just cause for the discipline, the magistrate recommended that the ten-day suspension be reversed, and that Howcroft be restored to his position without loss of pay. The magistrate also found that Cottrell had \u201cdemonstrate^] utter bad faith in his dealings with [Howcroft],\u201d and that Howcroft did not violate the department\u2019s rule 25 requiring officers out on sick leave to obtain permission from Champagne prior to leaving their homes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commission adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact but imposed a suspension of one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">On February 21, 1990, Howcroft filed this action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Difficulties among the parties continued. On two occasions in March of 1990, McCorry ordered Howcroft to work in the designated smoking area. Complaining letters and responses between the parties followed, but without resolution of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Particularly noteworthy was a letter from Chief Champagne to Howcroft dated April 3, 1990, rejecting entirely Howcroft\u2019s concerns and making it clear that minor infractions of \u00a7 22 were tolerable in order to give \u201can officer [who] wishes to smoke a cigarette\u201d the opportunity for a \u201cshort break.\u201d This letter was over two years after the enactment of \u00a7 22 and fifteen months after the Legislature imposed the ban on smoking by certain police officers. The defendants\u2019 brief offers no explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In late 1990, Howcroft injured his hand while on duty. Although Champagne granted some of Howcroft\u2019s requests pursuant to rule 25 to leave his home, he refused to allow Howcroft to attend family and holiday events. In October of 1991, Howcroft received a three-day suspension without pay from Champagne on the grounds of violation of sick leave rules. The suspension was rescinded by an arbitrator in the spring of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In early 1992, Howcroft suffered another hand injury while on duty. While on leave, Howcroft was again not permitted to leave his home pursuant to rule 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">By 1993, Howcroft\u2019s physical and mental health had substantially declined and on November 23, 1993, Howcroft worked his last shift. Around this time, for the first time in his life, Howcroft was diagnosed with depression. The city denied his application for disability benefits under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Howcroft, through his union, appealed the denial to an arbitrator, arguing that his disability was causally related to conditions of his employment, including his treatment while on leave for his hand injuries, respiratory ailments, and stress caused by his working conditions subsequent to his complaints concerning smoking in the workplace. Throughout the proceedings, the city argued that Howcroft\u2019s ailments were not causally related to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>There was an abundance of expert testimony before the arbitrator on the basis of which the arbitrator concluded, in an award dated February 20, 1998, that the city violated the collective bargaining agreement by denying Howcroft \u00a7 11 IF benefits. Howcroft was awarded \u00a7 111F benefits from November 23, 1993 to August 11, 1996, the date he had been granted an accidental disability retirement by the city\u2019s retirement board. In his award, the arbitrator concluded that \u201cthe employment circumstances experienced by [Howcroft] following his request that smoking be curtailed in the police station led to his anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia disorder, as well as physiological symptoms related thereto that caused his disability.\u201d The arbitrator further concluded that Howcroft\u2019s disability was \u201ccausally related to the employment experiences [he] encountered following his support of the non-smoking ban in 1989.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We have stated that the mayor\u2019s decision regarding Howcroft\u2019s suspension without pay was in response to the recommendation of Champagne, and we infer that the city\u2019s decision regarding Howcroft\u2019s disability benefits was also in response to the recommendation of Champagne. Both the mayor\u2019s decision and the city\u2019s decision were reversed by the arbitrator\u2019s decision, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">To this historical record we add the affidavit filed by Howcroft in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motions. The affidavit consists of two pages, the major features of which are (i) the affirmation of the allegations of the complaint, and (ii) statements to the effect that (A) by standing up for his own rights, others \u201cwho may be less assertive or otherwise less able to speak up\u201d are benefited; (B) he understood that other Peabody police officers are irritated by tobacco smoke; (C) upon becoming aware of the law regarding smoking in public buildings, he sought \u201cenforcement in the police station of the law against permitting smoking outside of designated areas,\u201d and that his \u201cefforts to secure compliance with the law were through what I thought were correct channels \u2014 through my immediate supervisor, Defendant McCorry, and through my union\u201d; and (D) because of Me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Corry\u2019s failure to respond, he petitioned Chief Champagne \u201cfor enforcement of the state law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">We turn to the legal issues presented, keeping in mind that we view all the summary judgment materials, and inferences therefrom, favorably to Howcroft, and that the defendants, as the moving parties, have assumed \u201cthe burden of affirmatively demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue, even if [they] would have no burden on an issue if the case were to go to trial,\u201d and demonstrating further that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Federal Civil Rights Claim </em>\u2014 <em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>1983<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(Count I).</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The fundamentals for this discussion are beyond dispute. \u201c[I]t has been settled that a State cannot condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983). See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 276 (1992). The foundational principle is that the \u201cState\u2019s interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees \u2018differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. at 140, quoting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. at 568. Further, \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political. \u2018Great secular causes, with smaller ones, are guarded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. at 147, quoting froto <em>Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Illinois Bar Assn., </em>389 U.S. 217, 223 (1967). The problem is to arrive \u201cat a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, <em>in commenting upon matters of public concern </em>and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We determine first, on the basis of our review of the \u201ccontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record,\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. at 147-148, whether Howcroft was speaking on a matter of public concern, or <em>only </em>regarding a matter of personal interest. See <em>id. </em>at 149 (\u201cthe First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs\u201d). If Howcroft\u2019s speech raises issues of public concern, his First Amendment right must be balanced against the governmental interest in promoting the efficient performance of public service of its employees. See <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. at 568.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See also <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Servs., </em>432 Mass. 251, 257 (2000); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d 905, 913 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Nahant </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>510 U.S. 1024 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Since these inquiries directly raise First Amendment issues, \u201can appellate court has an obligation to \u2018make an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Servs., </em>432 Mass. at 258, quoting from <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d at 912-913.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\n<em>Matter Of Public Concern.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As for the case before us, Howcroft argues that his complaints about the non-enforcement of \u00a7 22 by the defendants was speech that addressed a matter of public concern, and permits this action for damages and other relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for violations of his First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See <em>Piver </em>v. <em>Pender County Bd. of Educ., </em>835 F.2d 1076, 1078 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1206 (1988). \u201cThe inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law, not fact.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. at 148 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">There was at all times material hereto \u2014 and there still is \u2014 an intense public interest in the public health implications of so-called secondhand tobacco smoke. It was made particularly evident when, in 1987, the Legislature created G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, and, with regard to police officers, prospectively banned smoking by the police or firefighters in any city or town, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 101A, by the state police, see St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 5, now codified at G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 10, 2d par., and by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority police, see St. 1987, c. 697, \u00a7 11, codified at G.L. c. 31, \u00a7 64, because of the correlation between smoking and poor health, with the resulting drain on public funds.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is beyond dispute that secondhand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tobacco smoke, and its effect on the health of the public, is a matter of deep and abiding public interest. See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 275 (\u201cThere certainly has been considerable public debate about the dangers of smoking both to smokers and others in their immediate vicinity and the extent to which smoking should be tolerated in public places\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The defendants argue that what Howcroft said and wrote to the defendants expressed his concern for his own health and nothing else. The argument overlooks entirely that the decisive portion of what Howcroft said and wrote included expressions of his concern regarding the continuing failure of those in charge of the Peabody police department \u2014 the individual defendants \u2014 to see to the enforcement of \u00a7 22 in the station house. On December 7, 1989, Howcroft wrote Champagne bringing to his attention that the Peabody police station was not in compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 22, and requesting Chief Champagne, as expressly authorized by that section, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>to investigate the matter \u201cand inform [Howcroft] of his findings.\u201d The answer he received \u2014 \u201cThis is my building and as far as I am concerned, it is a smoking building and I know the law bet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ter than you do\u201d \u2014 had no justification. Further, Howcroft\u2019s affidavit states that by his actions \u2014 his speaking out \u2014 he sought \u201cenforcement in the police station of the law against permitting smoking outside of designated areas.\u201d Of course, Howcroft is not \u201cdisqualified from First Amendment protection merely because [he] had a personal stake in the controversy.\u201d <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 275. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Towse, 99 </em>F.3d 820, 827 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">So too McCorry, while in the control room where smoking was prohibited, blew tobacco smoke in the face of Howcroft and told him to \u201cshut up.\u201d These events illustrate the deliberate failure of the defendants to conform to and enforce the provisions of \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">To these facts we add the witting or unwitting failure of those in charge of the Peabody police force \u2014 the defendants \u2014 to inform the police force of the introduction of the complete ban on smoking as to officers appointed after January 1, 1988. The substantial public interest in a healthy police force appears to have been ignored entirely. See <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>described in note 19, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">It is in this context of comprehensive legislation designed to address the public\u2019s concern about the public health danger from tobacco smoke, and the alleged failure and refusal of the defendants to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 22, that Howcroft\u2019s words and conduct become speech that is protected by the First Amendment. Howcroft\u2019s expressions of his personal grievances do not nullify the deliberate failure of the defendants \u2014 law enforcement authorities \u2014 to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 22, and the alleged flaunting of that failure in their arbitrary and abusive conduct toward Howcroft.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"><em>Myers </em>v. <em>Hasara, </em>226 F.3d 821 (7th Cir. 2000), is instructive. There the plaintiff, a city health inspector, was disciplined for having told the manager of a mall that one of his tenants was in violation of its required permit and that the city had decided to take no action against the tenant. When the plaintiff brought suit, the city defended on the grounds that she was concerned with the dispute with her supervisors over the permit, not with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>matter of public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 827. The court dismissed the argument. \u201cIt is important to good government that public employees be free to expose misdeeds and illegality in their departments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826. <em>\u201cWhistleblowing does not need to be limited to systemic charges of corruption to qualify as a matter of public concern. A specific violation of a law that creates a risk to public health, safety or good governance likewise is a matter of public </em>concern\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">A matter of public concern does not <em>\u201close </em>its importance merely because it arises in an employee dispute\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>856 F.2d 255, 260 (D.C.

See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d at 913-915. See also <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>853 F.2d 789, 796 (10th Cir. 1988) (\u201cSpeech which discloses any evidence of corruption, impropriety, or other malfeasance on the part of city officials, in terms of content, clearly concerns matters of public import\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On the basis of the record before us, viewing all that Howcroft said and did favorably to him, we conclude \u2014 but only in the context of reviewing the allowance of summary judgments in favor of the defendants \u2014 that Howcroft\u2019s speech involved matters of public concern.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>The </em>Pickering <em>Balance Test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We turn to <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. at 568-575. \u201cUnder <em>Pickering, </em>we are required to balance the significance of the interests served by the public-employee speech \u2014 including the employee\u2019s interests in communicating, and the interests of the community in receiving, information \u2018on matters of public importance\u2019 \u2014 against the governmental employer\u2019s legitimate interests in preventing unnecessary disruptions and inefficiencies in carrying out its public service mission.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d at 915.

See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Wynnewood, </em>57 F.3d 924, 934 (10th Cir. 1995) (need for discipline, loyalty, and harmony among co-workers is heightened in police departments). Moreover, Howcroft\u2019s complaints, and the alleged retaliation by the defendants, may well have had an adverse impact on the working relationships at the Peabody police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Nonetheless, the defendants have failed to demonstrate a legitimate interest in suppressing Howcroft\u2019s speech. As evidence of the disruption of operations, the defendants note that Howcroft left work early on several occasions during December 1989 and January 1990 and remained out on sick or administrative leave. However, based on a reading of the facts most favorable to Howcroft, it was the defendants\u2019 arbitrary retaliations, and not Howcroft\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights, that caused the disruption in the operation of the department. See <em>Rankin </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>483 U.S. 378, 384 (1986) (\u201cVigilance is necessary to ensure that public employers do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>use authority over employees to silence discourse, not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees\u2019 speech.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Howcroft\u2019s speech concerning the abuse of power by public officials is given strong First Amendment protection. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, supra </em>at 916 (\u201cThe strong <em>public </em>interest in [the disclosure of unauthorized purchasing practices by a town official] supplements O\u2019Connor\u2019s relatively slight <em>personal </em>interest in speaking out, heavily weighting the <em>Pickering </em>scale in favor of First Amendment protection against retaliation for O\u2019Connor\u2019s speech\u201d [emphasis original]); <em>Azzaro </em>v. <em>County of Allegheny, </em>110 F.3d 968, 978 (3d Cir. 1997) (employee\u2019s reports of sexual harassment by executive assistant to county commissioner were of public concern and thus protected even if personal in motivation), <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 277-278. Contrast <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Mental Retardation, </em>409 Mass. 545, 551-552 (1991) (finding plaintiff\u2019s statements \u201cunprotected statements of an employee upon matters of only personal interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Further, there is nothing in the record before us suggesting that the time, manner, and place of Howcroft\u2019s complaints were disruptive to the workplace. See <em>Givhan </em>v. <em>Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 415 n.4 (1979) (\u201c[T]he employing agency\u2019s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\u2019s message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered\u201d). Howcroft, appropriately, first spoke with his superiors in private and properly sought assistance from public agencies and his union.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, Howcroft\u2019s expression directed to Champagne was more than a complaint from a subordinate to a superior; it was guided by G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>On this record, seen in a light most favorable to Howcroft, we cannot say that the defendants\u2019 interest in suppressing Howcroft\u2019s speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>outweighed the public interest in Howcroft\u2019s complaints and disclosures.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">To sum up the \u00a7 1983 summary judgment record favorable to Howcroft: The passage of \u00a7 22, a public health statute designed to protect all those for whom tobacco is or may be injurious, was flouted by police officers who were aware of the statute and whose duty it was to enforce its provisions \u2014 and certainly to enforce it within their own quarters. Howcroft\u2019s speech concerned the defendants\u2019 malfeasance in office and abuse of power. The defendants deliberately ignored \u00a7 22, choosing instead to retaliate by intimidation and penalties as part of a deliberate effort, without justification, to suppress Howcroft\u2019s speech and conduct, and in so doing failed in the performance of their duties as law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Because there remains a genuine issue of material fact whether the defendants responded to Howcroft\u2019s expression of his concerns on a matter of public concern by retaliatory employment decisions, and because the defendants were not entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, summary judgment for the defendants on Howcroft\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We emphasize that our conclusion, that Howcroft\u2019s speech touched on a subject of public interest and concern, is derived in part from the procedural necessity, arising out of the consideration of motions for summary judgment, of viewing the facts favorably to Howcroft, and drawing all reasonable inferences that are advantageous to him. Whether the same conclusion will be available at the trial on the merits must await that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>State Civil Rights Claim </em>\u2014 <em>MCRA (Count II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We affirm summary judgment in favor of the city on Howcroft\u2019s State civil rights claim because we conclude that a municipality is not a \u201cperson\u201d covered by the Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Civil Rights Act (MCRA), G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 111. In <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 821 (1985), the court compared the provisions of \u00a7 1983 with those of the MCRA; the MCRA, unlike \u00a7 1983, is available <em>\u201cwhether or not </em>[the person or persons are] acting under color of law\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, inserted by St. 1979, c. 801, \u00a7 1. Those observations regarding the absence of the need to show State action under the MCRA, however, did not dispose of the question whether a municipality is a \u201cperson\u201d under the MCRA. That issue was expressly left open in <em>Swanset Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>423 Mass. 390, 391 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">As stated in note 15, <em>supra, </em>a municipality may be hable as a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a7 1983, see <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 688, 694 (1978), but that result was reached only by tracing the Federal legislative history immediately preceding the passage by Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, a precursor to \u00a7 1983. See, in particular, <em>id. </em>at 688, citing Act of Feb. 25, 1871, \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431 (defining person to include \u201cbodies politic and corporate\u201d). That legislative history has no bearing on the MCRA. What is important is that G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third, only defines person to include \u201ccorporations, societies, associations and partnerships.\u201d By the terms of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, its definitions govern the construction of statutes unless a contrary intention clearly appears, and here there is no indication in the MCRA that the word \u201cperson\u201d includes either the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>ELM Med. Labs., Inc., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 74-80 (1992).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See also <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>344 Mass. 214, 219 (1962) (\u201cit is a widely accepted rule of statutory construction that general words in a statute such as \u2018persons\u2019 will not ordinarily be construed to include the State or political subdivisions thereof\u201d); <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 473 n.8 (\u201c[t]he Massachusetts Civil Rights Act was enacted in response to deprivations of secured rights by private individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>using violence or threats of violence\u201d), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 868 (1994); <em>Sarvis </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>47 Mass.

Contrast <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Roache, </em>803 F. Supp. 480, 484-485 (D.

Those claims rest on (i) the 1968 decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. at 568, establishing the right of public employees to speak out on matters of public concern without having to suffer retaliatory employment decisions, see <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. at 142; <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. at 276, and (ii) the enactment of G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, on January 14,1988. The alleged offending conduct of the defendants began <em>after </em>Champagne, on June 22, 1988, issued his order of compliance with \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">There is no basis at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>to defeat Howcroft\u2019s civil rights claim under Federal and State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count III).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In order to prevail on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Howcroft must show \u201c(1) that the defendant intended to cause, or should have known that his conduct would cause, emotional distress; (2) that the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) that the defendant\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiff\u2019s distress; and (4) that the plaintiff suffered severe distress.

Howcroft had adequate notice and opportunity to present the court with all relevant materials on every issue decided by the court. See <em>Baldwin Crane &amp; Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Riley &amp; Rielly Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 32 (1997). \u201cEven now, on appeal, the plaintiff suggests no unexplored factual issue that would have a bearing on the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. This is not a case where Howcroft was \u201csurprised by the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Langton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 576 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">We refer to the record appendix which appears to reflect an agreement among the parties. See Mass.R.App.P. 18(b), 378 Mass. 941 (1979). The appendix consists of over 400 pages. No motion to strike any document appearing in the appendix was made by any party, and we have drawn on the appendix to the extent necessary to present the facts consistently with the rules governing our review of a summary judgment decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The phrase \u201cthe defendants\u201d as used in the text always refers to the individual defendants unless the context requires that it refer to the city of Peabody as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The applicability of \u00a7 22 only to officers appointed after January 1, 1988, was made clear in <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv.

The Labor Relations Commission found that the reassignment was not improper under the collective bargaining agreement and dismissed the prohibited practice charge. However, the assignment represented a change from prior practice and by reassigning Howcroft to operations, McCorry placed a junior sergeant over Howcroft as the officer in charge of the shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Howcroft sent a letter of response to Cottrell the following day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Although the defendants contend otherwise, this allegation appears in both the original complaint and in the amended complaint, which Howcroft verified through his affidavit filed in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment. In May 1990, a DLI engineer concluded that the air quai-. ity conformed to all applicable regulations but recommended that the tobacco-contaminated air not be recirculated to nonsmoking areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Rule 25 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cAll officers disabled from work for sickness or injury and being carried on the time books of the department pursuant to Rule 25, shall remain at the residence officially listed in the Department\u2019s personnel records unless they receive prior permission from the Chief or Division Commander to be elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Section 111F provides, in part, that a police officer who is incapacitated for duty because of an injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own \u201cshall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity.\u201d G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, inserted by St. 1952, c. 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Presumably this refers to Howcroft\u2019s letter of December 7, 1989, directing Champagne\u2019s attention to the provisions of G. L. c. 270, \u00a7 22, as described in the text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Section 1983 provides in part that \u201c[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b607-12\">On this count we summarily affirm summary judgment for the city and the individual defendants in their official capacities. The individual defendants in their official capacities are not \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 1983. See <em>Laubinger </em>v. <em>Department of Rev., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 598, 602 (1996) (\u201cthe law treats the action as [one] against the official\u2019s office and hence against the State\u201d), quoting from <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Worcester County, </em>415 Mass. 132, 141 n.13 (1993). A municipality may be liable under \u00a7 1983, see <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 688, 694 (1978), but only if the injury is caused by \u201cofficials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the municipality,\u201d or if there is a municipal policy or custom that caused the injury. <em>County Commrs. of Bryan County </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 403-404 (1997). Neither condition is satisfied here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Howcroft must also show that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Servs., </em>432 Mass. 251, 257 n.15 (2000). See also <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Steeves, </em>994 F.2d 905, 913 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Nahant </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>510 U.S. 1024 (1993). The defendants do not dispute that Howcroft was subjected to an adverse employment action. See, e.g., <em>Piver </em>v. <em>Pender County Bd. of Educ., </em>835 F.2d 1076, 1078 (4th Cir. 1987) (retaliatory conduct need not consist of termination of employment), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1206 (1988); <em>Dahm </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>60 F.3d 253, 257 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that a qualitative reduction in job responsibilities may constitute adverse employment action). They argue that Howcroft\u2019s speech was not addressed to matters of public concern, and that employment decisions regarding Howcroft were a reasonable and necessary response to Howcroft\u2019s conduct. As to the defendants\u2019 motivation, see note 22, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">\u201cA claim under section 1983 has two essential elements. First, the challenged conduct must be attributable to a person acting under color of state law . . . second, the conduct must have worked a denial of rights secured by the Constitution or by [F]ederal law.\u201d <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 812 (1997), quoting from <em>Soto </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>103 F.3d 1056, 1061 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 819 (1997). The defendants do not dispute that as police officers of a public employer acting in the regular course of their duties, they acted under color of State law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Howcroft has not based any of his civil rights claims upon any right secured by the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Atterberry </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>392 Mass. 550, 555 (1984) (where the plaintiff raises \u201cno separate discussion of Massachusetts constitutional principles ... we review the plaintiff\u2019s claim solely on the basis of an alleged violation of Federal constitutional principles\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\">In <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>426 Mass. 1 (1997), the court reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a decision of the Civil Service Commission reinstating a police officer who had been terminated for violating the smoking prohibition of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 101A. The court discussed the purpose of the smoking ban for police and firefighters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201cThere is material in the record suggesting that <em>the purpose of \u00a7 101A is to prevent police officers and fire fighters from increasing their risk of hypertension and heart disease by smoking and, therefore, their eligibility for disability retirement benefits under G.L. c. 32, \u00a7 94. </em>[Section 101A applies] . . . only to police officers and fire fighters who, because of the nature of their jobs, are already at high risk for developing hypertension and heart disease. The Legislature appears to have made a policy decision, based on financial interests, that employment in these positions should no longer be open, after January 1, 1988, to persons who smoke tobacco products so that, over a period of time, police and fire departments will have a workforce free of a serious disease-causing addiction.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\"><em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>426 Mass. at 7. See also note 4 to the court\u2019s opinion, <em>id. </em>at 5 n.4, observing that \u00a7 101A was enacted apparently \u201cin an effort to reduce the number of police officers and fire fighters who obtain substantial disability benefits from public funds under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94 . . . as a result of heart disease due to smoking,\u201d and citing cases from other jurisdictions involving similar smoking bans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The defendants, as did the motion judge, rely principally on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fruin, </em>28 F.3d 646 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1083 (1995). In <em>Fruin, </em>the court, while acknowledging that \u201cthe issue of second-hand smoke was a matter of widespread public interest in July of 1991,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 651, ruled in favor of the defendants on their motion for summary judgment, having concluded that Smith\u2019s \u201ccomplaints were entirely personal in nature.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That conclusion was amply supported by Smith\u2019s admission in his deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>that at all times he was speaking only for himself and only about his own problems, thereby rejecting any concern or interest in the public health issue. <em>Id. </em>at 647-648. <em>Fruin </em>is inapposite to the facts in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">That Howcroft brought his concerns to the attention of his superior rather than the public at large does not preclude protection under the First Amendment. See <em>Givhan </em>v. <em>Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. at 415-416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">On the record before us, we also may infer, consistently with the decisions of the magistrate and the two arbitrators, that Howcroft\u2019s speech provided the motivating factor in the adverse employment decisions.
