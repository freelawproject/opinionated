The defendant failed to appear before the justice, and the plaintiff recovered a judgment from which the defendant appealed to \u00a1the county court of Livingston county, upon the ground that the summons issued by the justice was irregular and void by reason of being issued and served without a revenue stamp' being attached thereto, which was the only question in the cas\u00e9'; the county court affirmed the judgment and delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-13\">S. Hubbabd, County Judge. This action was commenced by summons issued by a justice of the peace, and which concludes as follows : \u201c To answer S. M.

On a careful consideration of the whole matter, I do not think such necessity exists in this case. I will assume the law to be constitutional. The question then remains\u2014does the law require a justice\u2019s summons to be stamped ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">It is clear that the only process from a justice\u2019s court requiring <em>to he </em>stamped by the terms of the law, is a writ, in which the amount claimed is $100 or over.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-10\">' The question in this case then is\u2014was this summons a writ claiming one hundred dollars or over ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-11\">But leaving out the latter clause was it a writ within the meaning of the law ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-12\">It is a little difficult to determine what is now in this state a true definition of a writ, but a common law definition, and which congress may well have had a view, requires a seal <em>(Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, writ). </em>This summons neither had, nor required a seal. Nor did a justice\u2019s warrant require a seal at common law (42 <em>Barb. </em>215); and was, therefore, not regarded as a writ. It might be under seal, and would then probably be a writ. If it requires a seal within the meaning of this law to constitute a unit, then of course this summons needed no stamp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-13\">In courts of record \u201cwrits or other original process\u201d require stamps. But in justice\u2019s court \u201c other original process\u201d do not require stamps. And \u201cno writ, summons, or other process issued by a justice of the peace,\u201d except \u201c a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>writ in which is claimed $100 or over,\u201d is subject to stamp duties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">This summons did not require any statement of claim, and the respondent insists that it should not be interpreted to state any, but whatever may be its true interpretation, or whatever may be h\u00e9ld to be a correct definition of writ, it can hardly be held that a justice\u2019s summons requires a stamp. Congress has clearly made a distinction between \u201c writs,\u201d \u201c summons and other original process,\u201d and in courts not of record has only taxed writs, while summons or other process issued by justices of the peace, except writs, are exempt. If we cannot tell precisely what they included in each class, we can yet see that they made the classes, and that they more probably included justice\u2019s summons in the class of \u201csummons and other original process,\u201d than in the class of writs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">In this view the judment should be affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">From this decision the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-8\">Bingham &amp; Brodhead, <em>attorneys, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARg\">A. M. Bingham, <em>counsel for appellant.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-9\"><em>First. </em>Section 151 of the act of congress, approved June 30th, 1864, called the national tax law, provided : \u201c That there should be levied and collected upon such instruments, written or printed, as were set forth in schedule B,\u2019 the several sums of money set down in figures, or otherwise specified in said schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-10\">Section 158 \u201c provided that any person who should make, sign or issue any such paper without having an adhesive stamp to denote the duty thereon, with intent to evade the provisions of this act, shall for every such offense forfeit the sum of two hundred dollars ; and such document or paper shall be deemed invalid and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-11\">Schedule \u201c B \u201d reads as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-12\">1. \u201c Writ or other original process by which any suit is commenced in any court of record, either of law or equity, 50 cents.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>2. \u201c \"Where the amount claimed in a writ, issued by a court not of record, is one hundred dollars or over, 50 cents.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">3. \u201cProvided that no writ, summons or other process issued by and returnable to a justice of the peace, except as hereinbefore provided, &amp;c., shall be subject to the payment of stamp duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">The county court decided the case entirely upon the ground that the word writ, in the second clause of schedule \u201cB,\u201d above quoted, must be construed to mean a process issued under the seal of the court, and did not apply to a summons which was not under seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\"><em>Second. </em>We do not understand the word writ in the section referred to, to possess any such limited meaning; because,</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">1. A process under the seal of the court is not the general definition of the word writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-9\">Bouvier defines the word writ to be, in its general meaning, \u201c a mandatory precept, issued by the authority and in the name of the <em>sovereign or </em>the state, for .the purpose of compelling the defendant to do something therein mentioned\u201d <em>(Bouvier's Law Dictionary, vol. </em>2, 663).</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-10\">A summons is defined to be \u201c the name of a writ, commanding the sheriff or other authorized officer to notify a party to appear in court to answer a complaint \u201d <em>(Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, vol. </em>2, 559).</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-11\">Worcester defines a .writ to be : \u201c In practice, a judicial instrument by which a court commands some act to be done by the person to whom it is directed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-12\">- The above definition of the word writ, is the modern understanding and the practical definition of the word, as used by law writers and law makers at the present day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-13\">2. There is no reason for supposing, from the act of congress or otherwise, that any difference was intended between original process under seal, or not under seal. We cannot presume, certainly, that <em>congress </em>intended to make any such useless distinctions, with no other object to accomplish except to complicate the law, and taking the three clauses together, above quoted from schedule \u201cB,\u201d it is very evident that congress intended to make the necessity for a stamp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>dependent upon the amount in litigation as it appeared from the writ, giving to justice courts the privilege of litigating claims below $100 without a stamp.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">3. Every act of the legislature must be so construed as to give it some meaning, if possible, but if the limited meaning of the word \u201cwrit,\u201d which the county court has attached to it, is to be applied, then the clause in schedule \u201cB,\u201d referring to justice courts, has no meaning whatever, because there are no justice courts which have seals, and they cannot issue \u201c writs \u201d under the definition of the word applied by the county court, and the result is, if we are to adopt this definition, that congress must have been ignorant of the true meaning of the word \u201c writ,\u201d when they solemnly enacted that \u201c no writ, summons or other process, issued by and returnable to a justice of the peace, except as hereinbefore provided, &amp;c., shall be subject to the payment of stamp duties.\u201d And congress must also have supposed that they had provided for the taxation of some kinds of process issued by justices of the peace, otherwise they would not have inserted \u201c except as hereinbefore provided.\u201d And there is no clause in schedule \u201c B \u201d which this language could refer to except that provision wherein a stamp duty is provided of fifty cents upon a \u201c writ \u201d issued by a court not of record, where the amount claimed in the \u201c writ \u201d is one hundred dollars or over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\"><em>Third. </em>The amount claimed in the writ issued by the justice was two hundred dollars or under. Judgment might have been entered for two hundred dollars under this writ, if the proof had been sufficient. It was, therefore, within the intention of the act affixing stamp duties, and also within the express language of the act which reads \u201cwhere the amount claimed in the writ.\u201d It is, therefore, the amount claimed in the writ which is to decide its liability to stamp duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>The act of congress clearly applied to the summons issued as the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-8\">1. It required an adhesive stamp denoting a duty of 50 cents to be attached, and it is unneceasary to decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the summons was void under section 158. If the legislature requires a stamp to be affixed, it in substance prohibits the issuing one without a stamp. The summons would, therefore, be irregular without it, and if the irregularity was not waived by an appearance, the court would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-5\">The affixing a penalty to an act renders it illegal without any prohibitory words in the statute <em>(Hallet </em>agt. <em>Novion, </em>14 <em>Johns. </em>273, 290).</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-6\">2. The provision of section 158, which provides that a paper issued without a stamp, with intent to evade the provisions of the act, applies only to the penalty for such omission, and by a subsequent clause of said section, such paper is made invalid whether a stamp is not affixed, with intent to evade the provisions of the act, or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-7\">3. Every person is ordinarily presumed to do what he does do intentionally, and if there was any excuse to offer for not having attached a stamp to the summons in this action, it devolved upon the party affected by the failure to comply with the law, to show the excuse for such failure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>The constitutionality of the act of congress was extensively discussed upon the argument before the county court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-9\">The case of <em>Warren </em>agt. <em>Paul, </em>supreme court of Indiana, was principally relied upon as authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-10\">In that case the principal argument seemed to be, that the right of- taxation of the process of state courts, necessarily implied the right of prohibiting the functions of the state tribunals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-11\">But this logic, by the decisions of our state courts, has been demonstrated to be unsound. In <em>Wynehamer </em>agt. <em>People </em>(13 <em>N. Y. R. </em>378), the court of appeals decided that a law which directly or indirectly occasioned the destruction of personal property or prohibited its enjoyment, was unconstitutional, while it is equally the well established law that the same property may be, and. its use and sale are regulated and taxed to any extent which does not substantially prohibit its enjoyment. There does not seem to be any essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>difference in regard to the power to tax the \u201c right to justice,\u201d as it is called in <em>Warren </em>agt. <em>Paul, </em>or the power to tax property directly. One is a taxation of the means by which property is acquired, held and enjoyed, and the other is a tax upon the property itself; and excessive taxation in either case would be equally destructive of a man\u2019s rights, for it matters not whether you take away the means by which a man holds and enjoys property, or allow him to hold property upon such burdensome conditions that its value is destroyed. The same argument, as is demonstrated by White, justice, in the German <em>Leiderkranz </em>agt. <em>Schiemann </em>(25 <em>How. </em>388), which would take away the power of congress to require a stamp upon legal process, would do away with the whole act relating to stamp duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">But it is perhaps sufficient for the argument upon this case that the law relating to stamp duties has been held valid all over this State, with the single exception of Judge Barnard. In <em>Watson </em>agt. <em>Morton </em>(27 <em>How. </em>294; 25 <em>How. </em>388), above cited, and in a large number of cases not reported, a summons has been held void for want of a revenue stamp.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\">Abbott &amp; Ward, <em>attorneys, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3i\">A. J. Abbott, <em>counsel for respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-7\">The only question in this case is, did the summons issued by the justice require a stamp, and was it void for not being stamped ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">The law of congress provides that a \u201c writ or other original process,\u201d &amp;c., in any \u201c court of record,\u201d &amp;c., shall be stamped. \u25a0 That \u201c where the amount claimed in the writ, issued by a court not of record, is one hundred dollars or over,\u201d the writ shall be stamped. It then provides that \u201c no writ, summons or other process issued by and returnable to a justice of the peace, except as hereinbefore provided,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c should be subject to stamp duty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">Section 158 of said law provides that \u201c any person or persons who shall make,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c any instrument,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c without the same being duly stamped,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c with intent to evade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the provisions of this act, shall for any such offense forfeit the sum of fifty dollars, and such instrument,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c shall be deemed invalid and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-5\"><em>First. Said </em>summons required no stamp.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">1. It is not a writ\u2014a writ at common law, must be in the name of the people, and must be under seal. <em>(Blackstone\u2019s Com.; Bouvier\u2019s Law </em>Dic.; <em>Burrill\u2019s Law Dic. and other </em>authorities.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">We believe the practice in the U. S. courts is the common law practice, and writs in those courts are in the name of the people and under seal. Congress must be assumed to have used the term writ in its common law sense, and as used in the federal courts at large, and not as used or defined in the local courts of any particular state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\">Formerly in this state, original process were called writs, and were in the name of the people and under seal. Wherever the legislature has changed the law, and dispensed with the seal as to a certain class of writs, it has changed the designation of that class of writs, from vmt to summons, indicating that the term writ as correctly defined, was no longer applicable to that class of process, but leaving the term writ still applicable to a large class of process, writs of error, or writs of commission, &amp;c., which must still be under seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">2. It was manifestly the intention of congress to discriminate between the terms writ and summons, the term writ being used in all three of the clauses, and the word summons only in the proviso, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-10\">3. In the summons, in this case, there is no \u201cclaim in the writ \u201d of \u201c one hundred dollars or over,\u201d the phrase \u201c to his damage of two hundred dollars or under \u201d is not such claim ; is no claim whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-11\">The law being in derogation of the common law, affecting as it does the right of property of the citizen, and the jurisdiction of the state courts, in the administration of justice must be strictly construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-12\">4. There is no evidence in the case that it was the \u201c intent (of the justice) to evade the provisions \u201d of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-13\"><em>Second. </em>So far as the act of congress assumes to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>invalid for want of a stamp the process of a state court, it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">Congress has no right, under the constitution of the United States, to interfere with the independent jurisdiction of states and state courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">No such power is granted to the general government in any of its departments, by any express or implied provision of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-7\">\u201c The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-8\">This is a very important question, and we bespeak for it the deliberate consideration of this court. <em>(American Law Register, vol. </em>4, <em>No. </em>3, <em>p. </em>157, <em>new </em>series; 24 <em>How. Prac. Rep. </em>357).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-9\"><em>By the court, </em>E. Darwin Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeU\">It was the intent, I think, of the 151st section, act of congress of 1864, entitled \u201c an act to provide internal revenue for the support of the government,\u201d to impose a stamp duty of 50 cents upon all writs, summons and other original process by which a suit was commenced in any court of record, and also of the same amount upon any writ, process or summons in a justices\u2019 court, or other court not of record, for the recovery of any sum exceeding $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Construing together' all the provisions in the schedule B annexed to said act and referred to in said section relating to the same subject, the imposition of stamp duties upon legal documents, I think such the fair meaning and intent of those provisions. But, however this may be, I do not think it necessary to decide this question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">If the summons by which this action was commenced should have had affixed to it a revenue stamp of 50 cents, I think it too late to raise that question in a court of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">Section 158 of said act as amended in chapter 78 of an act passed March 3,1865, declares what shall be the penalty for the omission to put the proper stamp upon the legal document as required in section 151, and it is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>whoever shall make, sign or issue such instrument, document or paper, \u201cwith intent to evade the provisions of the said act, shall for said offense forfeit the sum of $50; and such instrument, document or paper shall be deemed invalid and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The omission to put the proper stamp upon any legal document, should perhaps be deemed presumptive evidence of an intent to evade the statute, but nothing more. The paper is not void, but voidable for such omission, and I think the party who has omitted to put the proper stamp upon the document, may and must have an opportunity to repel such presumption before he is subject to the penalty of the act, and before the instrument or document shall be held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The objection to the summons in this case, if valid, should have been made before the justice on the return day of the summons. The plaintiff might then have obviated the objection and satisfied the justice that the omission to put a stamp upon the summons proceeded from mistake or ignorance of the fact that one was required, and not from intent to evade the statute. Upon such proof I think the justice might have allowed the proper stamp to be then affixed to the summons. If the same question had arisen in this court, I think it would or should have allowed the proper stamp to be affixed to the summons in such case <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">By omitting to make this objection before the justice, and before judgment, the plaintiff has lost the opportunity to rectify the mistake, and for this reason I think the defendant should be deemed to have waived the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">After judgment I think such an objection to the summons should not be listened to in any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The constitutionality of the internal revenue act it seems to me is too clear for discussion. The power of congress to impose taxes for the support of government is undoubted; and while taxes are imposed for revenue purposes only, the discretion of the national legislature on the subject of taxation, cannot be reviewed in the courts of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
