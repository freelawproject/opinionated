Parsons, <em>counsel for petitioner.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">I. The contractor Slattery, and Joseph S. Taylor, the. street commissioner, conspired, by the contract of Slattery with the coloration, and by the proposals on which it was based, to defraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">1. Before the proposals were issued Slattery had contracted for and was engaged in regulating and grading Seventy-ninth street\u2014also from Fifth avenue to the East river.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">The probable proportionate amount of rock and earth excavation was the same for Eightieth street as for Seventy-ninth street. <em>(Vide Daniel Ewen\u2019s report of December 7,1857, to the street commissioner; by him reported to the common council.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">Slattery knew this, for he had done the work, and Taylor knew it necessarily from Slattery\u2019s returns to him. This proportion, is sufficiently proved by Mr. Ewen\u2019s language: \u201c shows no rock, but is all earth.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">The parties knowing this, the proposals for Eightieth street state the estimated quantities which are intended to guide contractors in making their bids-at rock excavation, 20,000 yards; earth excavation, 8,000 yards. <em>(Vide the notice to contractors signed by Taylor, dated July </em>26, 1856.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-12\">Slattery, conforming his bid to the concerted arrangement, offers to do rock excavation for,'per cubic yard, 00! earth excavation for, per cubic yard, $1.00!</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-13\">It being worth about seventy cents a yard for rock, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>twenty cents for earth, excavation <em>(Vide Mr. Ewen\u2019s same report), </em>and Slattery and the street commissioner knowing this, knew that on these estimated quantities every honest proposal would make an aggregate price much beyond Slattery\u2019s, though on the true quantities as they afterwards tiumed out, and at the time were known to Slattery and Taylor, vastly below his: while on the other hand, Slattery, by making his proposal at one dollar a yard for earth and nothing for rock excavation on the estimated quantities, would, though on the true quantities vastly the highest, seem to be the lowest bidder, and so give Taylor an opportunity to award him a contract, which would result as shown below in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">The true quantities proved to be just as it was known they must be: rock 8,886 yards instead of 20,000; earth 33,663 yards instead of 8,000. <em>(Vide Mr. Dodge's certificate with the assessment, dated December </em>16,1859.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">To remove all doubt of Slattery\u2019s complicity with Taylor, for Seventy-ninth street his bid and contract were: for rock \u25a0excavation, per cubic yard, one dollar and fifty cents; for earth excavation, per cubic yard, forty cents; preserving a proper proportion, but in Mr. Ewen\u2019s language: <em>\u201c </em>I have no hesitation in saying that these prices were double the value of the work,\u201d and indicating Slattery\u2019s fraud in Seventy-ninth street assessment for which the corporation refused to recognize his claim in that case <em>(vide Mr. Ewen\u2019s last communication), </em>and he was subsequently made to disgorge $17,036.91. <em>(Vide paper marked </em>9, <em>and comptroller's letter of November </em>28,1862.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">2. It was therefore impossible that Slattery should honestly offer or Taylor honestly accept a proposal at one dollar for earth, and nothing for rock excavation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">When for the same character of work on the next street, Slattery was getting one dollar and fifty for rock and forty cents for earth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">II. While the charter-for 1853 only permitted a contract with the lowest bidder, Slattery was not only not\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">1. The lowest bidder; he was greatly the highest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The work done was of <em>(vide Mr. Dodge\u2019s certificate before referred to), </em>rock excavation, 8,886 yards; earth excavation, 33,633 yards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">On these actual quantities, calculating the various bids, and it will appear that while Slattery\u2019s bid reaches the enormous fig\u00fare of 833,801 00, the bids of the following were:</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">John Gallagher,.....................$10,866 57</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">Thomas Brady,..................... 11,617 59</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">John Pettigrew,..................... 12,148 89</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">As a contrast to this; on the fraudulent estimate, Slattery\u2019s bid was $8,300, instead of $33,801 00.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">And the honest bids of the above parties, (of course much larger on the estimated than on the true items by reason of the 20,000 of pretended rock excavation):</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">John Gallagher,........................$16,942</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-12\">Thomas Brady,......................... 19,300</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-13\">John Pettigrew,........................ 17,150</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-14\">2. Slattery and the street commissioner both well knew such would be the case: his bid and the proposals were framed to bring about just this result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-15\">3. A fair price to Slattery for the work done, would be at the rates above stated from Mr. Bwen\u2019s report for 8,886 yards of rock, at seventy cents, $6,220.20; 33,633 yards of earth, at twenty cents, $6,726.60. Total, $12,946.80, instead of the $33,801 Slattery claims.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-16\">The effect of the diminished quantity of actual rock excavation, as contrasted with the estimated quantity, was to make the actual expense to Slattery about one-third what it would have been, had the actual excavation corresponded with the estimate. He has, therefore, done about one-third what he proposed, but he claims for it four times as much.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-17\">Slattery\u2019s bid on the proposed quantities, was $8,300, embracing 20,000 yards of rock excavation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-18\">The rock excavation is reduced from 20,000 to 8,886 yards; less than half, and yet the price increases with greatly reduced work to $33,801, four times that proposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>III. All the above facts and others, and the deductions we claim, and our charges of fraud are stated at length, and so also further established by the corporation itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">And this too before Slattery was paid a cent, or had progressed considerably with his work. And the corporation at the same time notified Slattery that his contract was void and illegal, and directed him not to proceed. <em>(Vide the whole matter stated at length in the street commissioner\u2019s, report of Jammry, </em>1859, <em>to the- common council; returned with the other papers and printed with the proceedings of the common council.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">This operated as ample notice to the corporation and dispensed with the propriety of further notice from the objectors who relied upon the corporation\u2019s own formal notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">IY. It is' further evident that Slattery knew of the invalidity of his contract from the fact that he applied to the legislature and procured the passage of an act by the aid of which he hoped to be more successful in his raid upon the city treasury <em>(Laws of </em>1861, <em>p. </em>569).</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\">By the act, Slattery\u2019s contract by section one, \u201c is hereby confirmed, and declared to be valid and in full force and effect.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-9\">By section two the corporation are authorized to levy an assessment \u201c to the extent of reimbursing the mayor, aider-men and commonalty any amount of moneys paid under this act and (on) the said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-10\">1. The passage of the act shows that the contract was recognized as invalid without legislative aid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-11\">2. It surely can need no argument to demonstrate that the legislature had no power to impose upon the property holders a liability when none in fact existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-12\">Y. But the assessment does not even follow the act, and this leads to a further objection to the assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-13\">The \u201cmoneys paid\u201d on contract consisted of the sum of $13,477.38x$2,296.77=415,774.15. The amount of the assessment is $36,699.92, of which $17,036.91 was an amount of which Slattery had defrauded the corporation on Ids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Seventy-ninth street contract. <em>(Vide statement of payment, and letter from the comptroller's office.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">By the assessment, the corporation seeks to compel the innocent property holders who institute this proceeding to refund an amount of which this same Slattery had cheated it before his Eightieth street fraud; as Mr. Taylor must have well known, who yet gave the contract to Slattery, though in his proposal for bids he had published as a blind \u201c no estimate will- be received from any person who has previously violated any contract with this department.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">YI. Before stating our propositions of law, it is well to consider the position of the city, with respect to assessments for improvements, of the character of that in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">1. The work is done at the expense of the property benefited, and by the act of April 9,1813 <em>(Davies' Laws, p. </em>527), the expense is to be collected from such property, and then applied to pay for the work. No provision was made for the city paying the contractor, and reimbursing itself from the collections on the assessment. <em>(Lake </em>agt. <em>The Trustees of Williamsburgh, 4 Den., </em>520; <em>McCullough </em>agt. <em>The Mayor of Brooklyn, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>458). By subsequent provisions and acts, the corporation is permitted to anticipate to the contractor the collection from the assessment; becoming thereby substituted to the right of the contract, or if he have 'any, against the property benefited; but the right of the city is never an enlargement of the right of the contractor; is always limited to it. In this case the city occupies the position of Slatteiy, and with reference to any claim against the property holders, has no better or larger claim than had he. <em>(Davies' Laws, p. </em>567; <em>Laws of </em>1824, <em>p. </em>39.) The petitioners therefore say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\"><em>First. </em>The contract was in fraud of their rights. Property, holders are mere passive victims of corporation frauds. The most they can do, though not so required, is to give notice of the fraud; in this case, the city was apprised of it in 1857. The fraud therefore vitiates the assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\"><em>Second. </em>The contract, and all proceedings based upon it, were also void, under the charter of 1853, as having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>given to the highest instead of the lowest bidder. <em>(Brady </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, </em>2 <em>Bosworth, </em>173; <em>affirmed </em>20 <em>New York, </em>6 <em>Smith, </em>312.) All the bids were in the prescribed form, with adequate security; corresponding, in every respect, to the requirements of the ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-4\"><em>Third. </em>To save the expense to themselves and the-city of numerous suits or proceedings, in which the city would be unsuccessful, parties representing the larger part of the assessment unite in one proceeding applying for a <em>certiorari. .</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Different persons properly unite in the application. <em>(In the matter of the Third avenue assessment, </em>Ingraham, <em>J.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-6\"><em>Fourth. Certiorari </em>is the appropriate proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">1. No relief can be granted under the act of April 17, 1858. <em>(Laws of </em>1858, <em>p. 574; In the matter of Duane street, </em>Ingraham, <em>J.; In the matter of Second avenue, </em>Sutherland, <em>J.; Miller's case, </em>12 <em>Abbott, </em>121; <em>Horn's case, Id. </em>124.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">2. Nor under the act of May 7, 1841 <em>(Laws of </em>1841, <em>p. </em>143). The assessors have no power to,consider the validity of an assessment. Their only jurisdiction is to make a just and equitable assessment of the aggregate amount assessed, <em>\u201c </em>among the owners or occupants of all the houses and lots intended to be benefited thereby, in proportion, as nearly as may be, to the advantage which each shall bo deemed to acquire.\u201d <em>(Davies' Laws, p. </em>526; <em>Le Roy </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>20 <em>Johns. </em>430.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">3. Nor by action; the courts have uniformlyrefused relief by action, where the record shows the invalidity, on the very ground that the proper remedy was by <em>certiorari- (Heywood </em>agt. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>14 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>4 Kern. 534; Betts </em>agt. <em>City of Williamsburgh, </em>15 <em>Barb. </em>255; <em>Bouton </em>agt. <em>The city of Brooklyn, </em>15 <em>Barb. </em>375; <em>Van Doren </em>agt. <em>The Mayor of New York, </em>9 <em>Paige, </em>388; <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of Brooklyn </em>agt. <em>Messerole, </em>26 <em>Wend. </em>132; <em>Mace </em>agt. <em>The Trustees of Newburgh, </em>15 <em>How. Pr. </em>161.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>The confirmation of the assessment was a judicial act; in this case exercised without jurisdiction on the part of the city or its board of assessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-11\">The corporation has no power to impose upon property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>owners a charge which could not be legally enforced by the party in whose favor it is imposed. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">. The complainants being numerous, the court will not compel them to individual actions for the recovery of amounts illegally exacted, but having by a single proceeding the matter and all the parties before it, will prevent by its action, a multiplicity of suits. <em>(Bouton </em>agt. <em>The city of Brooklyn, </em>7 <em>How. </em>198; <em>The People </em>agt. <em>The city of Brooklyn, </em>9 <em>Barb. </em>535; <em>Betts </em>agt. <em>The city of Williamsburgh, </em>15 <em>Id. </em>255; <em>Le Roy </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>20 <em>John. </em>430; <em>Starr </em>agt. <em>The Trustees, &amp;c. of Rochester, </em>6 <em>Wend. </em>565; <em>Wilson </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>1 <em>Abbott, </em>15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">All the cases affirm the power of the court to review such proceedings by <em>certiorari, </em>though in some cases denying the writ on the ground of expediency; but it will be seen that this case .differs from all those in which the writ has been refused or quashed. Those cases proceed upon the ground that complete relief .may be had by action to recover the amount exacted; that the relator has been guilty of delay; that an action would confine the relief to the individual case of the relator, while the allowance of the writ would upset the whole assessment; that the proceeding can only remove the record,-and therefore confines the attention of tho court to matters spread upon its face; that in the special case before the court, there was doubt whether the act sought to be reviewed was judicial or ministerial. The answer in this case to such objections is complete:</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-7\">1. To drive the parties to action at law would be oppressive, entailing great expense, and making heavy costs against the city. They are numerous; this is one proceeding presenting conveniently what else would only \"be determined by many costly actions. The relief on this proceeding is summary\u2014by action only after protracted delay. \u2022 The court has full equitable jurisdiction, and the prevention of a multiplicity of suits is always a ground of equitable interference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-8\">2. There has been no delay. The parties proceed as soon as they are informed of the assessment, at a less interval from the information than in the Third avenue case..</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>3. The parties complaining, represent a large proportion .of the assessments; which, being fraudulent and void, should be set aside as to all affected by it.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">4. The matters complained of, are patent on the face of the record; require no explanation or evidence, and by all the authorities, the confirmation of the assessment, is a judicial act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">5. Vacating the confirmation, permits a new assessment for any amount, which might prove chargeable against the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">6. The court should facilitate proceedings of this kind calculated in a ready, simple way, without delay or expense, to upset such glaring frauds, now so prevalent: to drive parties to troublesome and expensive actions, would be so to embarrass relief from such frauds, as to make parties prefer to remain quiet under the infliction of them, and thus indirectly to encourage them. The amounts, in many cases being small, would not warrant the expense of separate actions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-8\"><em>Sixth. </em>An assessment proceeding is on the part of the corporation, the board of assessors being one of its bureau. The writ is, therefore, properly directed to the mayor, &amp;c. And the record consists, not merely of what the assessors may see fit to incorporate in the roll, but of all the proceedings essential to show a valid assessment; the ordinance estimate, proposals, bids, award, confirmation, contract, certificate of work done, action of the assessors, &amp;c., &amp;c., and all action of the common council in respect to the proceeding. The record thus made up, in this case, proves the illegality of tho assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-9\">1. By reason of Slattery not having been tho lowest bidder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">2. By reason of his fraudulent complicity with the street commissioner. The circumstances are inconsistent with honest intent, and lead irresistiblyto the inference of fraud. If, as was objected, Mr. Ewen\u2019s communications, and tho report embracing them, are no part of the record, they merely state the inference of fraud, which the court itself will. make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u25a0 <em>Seventh. </em>The motion to set aside should be granted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-5\">John E. DeveliN; <em>counsel to the corporation..</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-6\"><em>By the court, </em>Barnard J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQt\">Assuming that the case pre- , sented by the petitioner is one, which if true entitles the petitioner to the relief afforded by the act of 1858, it is not sustained by the evidence. The charge is that the contract was obtained by Slattery by a fraudulent conspiracy and. collusion -with the then street commissioner. That by agreement with Slattery the street commissioner estimated the earth excavation at a much less amount and the rock excavation at a much greater amount than it really was, so that Slattery by bidding a large price for earth excavation and nothing for rock would seem .to be the lowest bidder, while in fact he would be the highest bidder on the contract. The proof shows that the street commissioner took the initiatory steps according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The notice was duly published and estimated the probable amounts of rock and earth excavation, and invited bids for each kind of excavation and requiring that an affidavit from persons bidding should accompany these bids, that the bid was made without collusion or fraud, and that no member of the city government was directly or indirectly interested therein. Slattery\u2019s bid on this bidding was the lowest bid. according to the estimates of the street commissioner, and the contract was duly and legally awarded to him. There is no proof whatever showing any concert between the street commisioner and Slattery. The result shows more earth and less rock than the estimates. Slattery was the contractor of' Seventy-ninth street, which had been just completed, and that , work established that the earth largely exceeded the rock excavation upon Seventy-fifth street, and from this evidence alone the petitioner proves the fraud.. It is insufficient to prove fraud. The question is not whether we are inclined to believe or suspect, or whether it is probable a fraud has been committed or may have been committed, but <em>are these parties prov\u00e1bly guilty by the evir </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>dence? </em>Eightieth street showed nearly twice the amount of rock which Seventy-ninth street did. Doubtless no contractor bid without examination of the proposed work, and they could judge of the probable correctness of the estimates. Slattery may have been guided in his bid by the results of Seventy-ninth street.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The street commissioner is not shown to have had any concert with Slattery or any other contractor, nor is the contract shown to have been procured by fraud. If there were facts, which it is easy to believe there were, showing a guilty combination between the contractor and the street commissioner, the act of 1861 legalizes the assessment. The work cost the city the amount of money for which the assessment is made. The contract with Slattery is confirmed. An assessment is authorized and the city is required to pay Slattery the money due \u201cupon said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The power of the legislature to pass this act is undoubted <em>(Brewster </em>agt. <em>The City of Syracuse, </em>19 <em>N. Y. </em>116).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The act embraces but one subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b119-9\">Ingraham, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">I concur in this decision, on the ground that the legislature have passed a law making the assessment valid and directing an assessment to be levied, not because I consider such a law proper, but because the late decisions of the court of appeals in regard to the power of the legislature seem intended to carry that power much further than has heretofore been supposed to be the law in regard to municipal corporations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
