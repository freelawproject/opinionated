Before the message was \u2022written raider it, and signed and delivered to the. defendant, it was a general proposition to all persons desiring to send messages by the defendant\u2019s jieculiar- means of transmisi\u00f3n or conveyance of tho terms and conditions upon which such messages would bo sent, and the defendant become liable in case of error or accident in the transmission or conveyance. By writing the message, under it, and signing and delivering tho same for transmission, the party accepted tho proposition and it became an agreement, binding upon tho defendant only according to the terms and conditions specified in its proposition. That such is the legal effect of the agreement under which the message in this case was.received for transmission by the defendant, seems to me extremely clear. Under tho date of tho message, and the name of the place, from which it was sent, was printed in large clear typo: \u201c Sond the following message, subject to the above conditions and agreement.\u201d Directly under, this the message was. written and signed by tho plaintiffs\u2019 assignor. There is nopretence that tho \u201c conditions'and agreement\u201d thus referred to, were not plainly printed, or that there was tho least difficulty in reading and understanding the terms proposed by tho defendant. There they stood, in clear, plain print. First, a general statement, that \u201cin order to guard against errors or delays in tho transmission or delivery of messages, every message of importance ought to bo repeated by being sent back from the station to which-it is directed to tho station from which it was sent, and compared with the original message.\u201d Following this list is the tariff or rate charged for such repetition and comparison, as follows: \u201c Half the tariff prico will bo charged for thus repeating and comparing.\u201d Then follow tho terms and conditions in this language: \u201c And it is hereby agreed between tho signor or signors of this message and this company, that this company shall not bo held responsible for errors or delays in tho transmission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>or delivery of this message, if repeated, beyond the amount of fifty dollars, unless a special agreement for insurance be made and paid for at the time of sending- the message, and the amount of risk specified on this agreement, and that in case this message is not repeated, this company shall not be held responsible for any error or delay in the transmission or delivery of the same beyond the amount paid for transmission, unless specially insured, and the amount of risk paid for and specified on this agreement at the time.\u201d Hero is no ambiguity whatever, but on the contrary, the language is well chosen, and the meaning and import perfectly clear and obvious to the most indifferent or careless reader. The price for transmission only was paid. There was no request to have the message repeated, and nothing was paid or offered therefor, and no insurance. The defendant is therefore exempt from all liability for the mistake or error complained of, by the express terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It is stated, in the case made, that neither the person who signed the message nor the plaintiffs ever read the printed \u201cconditions and agreement\u201d thus subscribed. But it does not follow from this, by any means, that they are not bound by the conditions. They might and should have been read. It was very gross carelessness and negligence not to read them before signing and delivering the message. Ho notice was given to the agents of the defendant that the conditions and agreement to which the author and signor of the message had in terms agreed the same should be subject, he had in fact neglected to read, and inform himself as to their import. The presumption, in the absence of any notice, was that ho had read and understood the proposition ho had thus accepted; and the defendant\u2019s agents had the right to take it for granted that ho had, and will be presumed to have done so, and to have sent in good faith the message upon the terms thus proposed and apparently accepted. The plaintiffs should not now be permitted to allege that their assignor either willfully shut his eyes and refused to see what was so plainly before him, or that- he negligently omitted to us'o them for that purpose. To allow them now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to clo this,, would operate as a fraud upon the defendant. It would enable one party, through his own gross negligence and inattention, to create a liability against another in his own favor, where none was bargained for, or would have been, and. which was expressly stipulated against. The principle of <em>estoppel in pais </em>applies in full force against the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Their assignor, by his conduct, led the agents of the defendant to suppose and believe that he had agreed to the defendant\u2019s propositions, and they cannot now gainsay the apparent agreement. -</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\">In <em>Lewis </em>agt. <em>The Great Western Railway Company </em>(5 H. <em>&amp; N. </em>867), which was a case where the person delivering goods to a carrier filled up and signed a receiving note under a printed head of \u201c conditions,\u201d under which were certain printed conditions, and which the party after-wards, in an action for the loss of the goods, claimed not to have read, Baron Brahwel said: \u201c It would be absurd to say that the document which is partly in writing and partly in print, and which was filled up, signed and made sensible by the plaintiff, was not binding upon him. A person who * signs a paper like this, must know that he signs it for some purpose, and when he gives it to the company, must understand that it is to regulate the rights which it explains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">I cannot refrain from observing here, that the business in which the defendant is engaged, of transmitting ideas only, from one point to another by means of electricity operating upon an extended and insulated wire, and giving. them expression at the remoto point of delivery by certain mechanical sounds, or by marks or signs indented, which represent words or single letters of the alphabet, is so radically and essentially different, not only in its nature and character, but in all its methods and agencies, from the business of transporting merchandise, and material substances from place to place, by common carriers, that the peculiar and stringent rules, by which the latter is controlled \u2022 and regulated, can have very little just and proper application to the former; and all attempts heretofore made by courts to subject the two kinds of business to the same legal roles and liabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>will, in my judgment, sooner or later, have to be abandoned, as clumsy and indiscriminating efforts and contrivances to assimilate things which have no natural relation or affinity whatever, and at best but a loose or mere fanciful resemblance. The bearer of mitten or printed documents and messages, from one to another, if such was his business or employment, might very properly be called and held a common carrier, while it would be little short of an absurdity to give that designation or character to the bearer of mere verbal messages delivered to him by mere signs or speech, to be communicated in like manner. The former would have something which is or might be the subject of property, capable of being lost; stolen and wrongfully appropriated; while the latter would have nothing in the nature of property which could be converted or detstroyed, or form the subject of larceny, or of tortious caption and appropriation, even by the \u201cking\u2019s enemies.\u201d But oven if the defendant is held to be an ordinary common carrier, it had the right to limit its liability by express contract, as is now well settled. <em>(Bissell </em>agt. <em>New York Central Railroad Company, </em>25 <em>N. Y. </em>442; <em>Dorr </em>agt. <em>N. J. Steam Navigation Company, </em>1 <em>Kern. </em>485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In <em>MacAndrew </em>agt. <em>The Electric Telegraph Company </em>(17 <em>Com. B. </em>3; 84 <em>E. C. L. R.), </em>it was held that a mere regulation of the corporation, similar to the one here in question, was a reasonable regulation under the act 16 and 17 Victoria, and shielded the corporation from liability for the mistake of sending the message to Southampton instead of Hull ; and so in <em>Camp </em>agt. <em>The Western Union Telegraph Company </em>(1 <em>Metcalfe, Ky. </em>164), it was held that a printed notice similar to the conditions here, not in the form of an agree-\u00bb ment, was a reasonable regulation on behalf of the company, and binding upon the person delivering the- message to be transmitted.. Our statute providing \u201cfor the incorporation and regulation of telegraph companies \u201d <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1848, <em>chap. </em>265, \u00a711), makes it the duty of the owner, of any telegraph line doing business within this state, to receive dispatches, and on payment of their usual charges for transmitting dispatches, \u201c as established by the rules and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tions of such telegraph line, to transmit the same with impartiality and good faith,\u201d under a certain prescribed penalty. Thus the statute, it will be seen, recognizes the right of the owners of these lines of communication, to \u201c establish rules and regulations \u201d for the transmission of communications, delivered to be forwarded, in nearly the same terms as the act of 16 and 17 Victoria. The legislature obviously never intended that these corporations, or persons engaged in this novel, interesting and extraordinary business, should be placed upon the same footing in respect to liability with ordinary carriers of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">There is no -question here of gross negligence, against . which the defendant could not, as carrier even, shield himself by contract. The case states that the message was duly transmitted from the office at Palmyra, as written and delivered, \u201cbut by error of some of defendant\u2019s operators working between Palmyra and -New York, the precise cause of which is unknown,\u201d it was received in New York and delivered as an order to purchase $7,000 in gold instead of $700, according to the message delivered and\" duly transmitted at Palmyra. In view of tho nature of this business, and of the peculiarly.delicate and subtle-agencies and forces employed in carrying it on, it is impossible for the court to say, from the statement, that tho error complained of was the result of any negligence or inattention whatever on the part of the agents employed by the defendant. For aught we can see it may have been produced by causes over which no person had any control. And these considerations show most forcibly the importance and necessity of allowing those carrying on this business tho right to make rules and regulations and contracts, limiting and controlling, to a reasonable extent, the grounds and measure of their liability^</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the facts stated in the case made do not entitle tho plaintiffs to. any recovery. The defendant must, therefore, have judgment for its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
