The action was commenced in the justices\u2019 court, where a judgment was rendered in favor of tho plaintiff for \u00a7100 damages, besides costs. From that judgment the defendant appealed, to the county court, and recovered judgment for costs. After the notice of appeal was served, the plaintiff served upon the defendant the following.offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201c ALBANY COUNTY COUBT :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">Oscar O.

But assuming that it cpuld properly be proved upon the trial, it does not follow that it was appropriately received upon the trial in the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-14\">It appears, from the case, that it was used by the defendant for a purpose wholly unauthorized, and well calculated to prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s case. Previous to. the introduction of the offer, the counsel for the defendant stated <em>to the jury that the offer was made because the plaintiff had no confidence in his case. </em>This statement was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the ground that there had been no proof on the subject, and that if an offer had been made, it could not be proved to the jury. The offer was then given in evidence by the defendant, and read to the jury under the plaintiff\u2019s objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>properly introduced to apprise the jury of its effect upon the question of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">If it be assumed that this position is sound, the difficulty yet remains, as the offer was not used for that purpose, neither the court nor counsel informed the jury of the proper effect of the offer. On the other hand, we must assume from the facts detailed in the case, that an erroneous impression was produced upon the minds of the jury in regard to the object of such offer, which was allowed to remain uncorrected by the court, and probably did, influence the jury to the prejudice of the plaintiff. It is said by the defendant\u2019s counsel that as the verdict was for the defendant, it is apparent that no injury resulted from the introduction of the offer, as it could only affect the amount of damages in case the plaintiff prevailed in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">\u2022 I do not think that we should thus assume, as it is impossible to calculate how far the jury might have been influenced by the improper use of such evidence. An error can only - be disregarded when it affirmatively appears that no possible injury could arise to the party complaining <em>(Worrall </em>agt. <em>Parmelee, </em>1 <em>Comstock, </em>519). I am therefore of opinion that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial had in the county court, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
