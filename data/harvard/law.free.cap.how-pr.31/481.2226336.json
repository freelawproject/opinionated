The prayer of the complaint is,-that plaintiff\u2019s dower maybe assigned and admeasured to her, and that she may be put in possession, and that she may be paid one-third the rents of the premises, and that she may have such other relief as is proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">The answer admits the conveyance to defendant by plaintiff\u2019s husband, and defendant\u2019s occupation of premises, but avers a release of dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">The trial took place at special term without a jury, before Hon. John M. Barboub, justice. The plaintiff proved the allegations in her complaint. The defendant offered no defense. The plaintiff offered evidence of the value of the -premises and of the rents, with a view to having the plain-tiff\u2019s dower assigned and <em>mesne </em>profits awarded by the court. 'The court, however, although admitting the evidence, \u25a0declined to adjudicate upon these matters, further than to \u00abdecide the plaintiff entitled to dower and a portion of the \u00abrents, and to direct a reference to ascertain them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">The judgment directed a reference to Daniel P.

Brown, the husband \u00f3f the plaintiff, conveyed to the defendant certain lots of land lying between One Hundred and Twenty-fifth and One Hundred and Twenty-sixth streets and the Seventh and Eighth avenues, and a dwelling house thereon. On the 27th of October, 1855, William H. Brown died. The plaintiff never released her dower in the premises. Shortly after her husband\u2019s death, she demanded of the defendant that her dower be assigned to her, &amp;c. The defendant refused. The premises in question consisted of twelve lots, six fronting on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth street, worth $1,900 each, together $11,400, and six fronting on One Hundred and Twenty-sixth street, worth $800 each, together $4,800. The dwelling house, exclusive of improvements put upon it by the defendant, was worth $8,500, and the other buildings, &amp;c., were worth $400, mailing together $20,100, of which the widow\u2019s one-third was $6,700. The improvements added to the dwelling house were worth, at the time of the hearing, $800, making it worth, in its improved state, $4,300. The referee assigned this house to the widow, together with three of the inferior lots worth $2,400, making the whole amount of the value of the property awarded her equal to $6,700, to be held by her during life. The rents for the period inquired of amounted to $3,900, which were reduced by repairs and taxes, &lt;fec., to $2,037.56, of which the plaintiff was entitled to one-third, or $679.15.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-8\">O. R. Steele, <em>attorney, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-9\">R. W. Andrews, <em>counsel for defendant, appellant.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-10\">This action was brought for the admeasurement and recovery of dower in certain lands and premises in One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Hundred and Twenty-fifth and One Hundred and Twenty-sixth streets, New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-5\">The action was tried before Hon. J. M. Babboub on the 28th day of October, 1863, and the justice found that plaintiff was entitled to dower, and that in November, 1855, and subsequently, she had demanded the dower of defendant, and that he refused to comply with the demand. That plaintiff was entitled to one-third of the rents from 27th day of October, 1855, up to the time of such finding, with certain deductions, and directed a reference to assign the dower and set aside particular lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-6\">An order of reference was thereupon made to D. P. Ingraham, Jr. The reference proceeded before Mr. Ingraham, who, on the 1st of September, 1864, made his report, setting aside to the widow the dwelling house upon the premises, with all its improvements, and three lots of land; and that plaintiff was entitled to receive $679.15 for rents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-7\">The report was sent back for a more specific report as to the value of the house and these lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-8\">A supplemental report was made November 29th, 1864.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-9\">These reports were confirmed December 5, 1864, and judgment entered accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-10\">I. The justice erroneously finds that demand of dower was made and refused in November, 1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-11\">The only evidence as to demand is contained at folios 11, 12, 26. The only positive evidence of demand is the written demand at fol. 26, which was made June 18, 1863.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-12\">TL. The widow is only entitled to damages, or rents as damages, from the time of demand of dower; and the damages are not to be estimated on any improvements made after death of the husband (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. </em>33, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21).</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-13\">The justice, therefore, erred in finding that the plaintiff was entitled to one-third of the rents from October 17,1855.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-14\">ITT. The justice erred in sending the proceedings to a referee to assign the dower. There are but two methods prescribed by statute to recover dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-15\">1. Ejectment for dower (3 <em>R. S. 5th eel. </em>592).</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-16\">2. Proceedings by petition to the supreme court, county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>court or surrogate, for admeasurement of dower (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. </em>791).</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-5\">In both these cases the statute expressly provides that \u201cthree reputable and disinterested freeholders\u201d shall be appointed commissioners to admeasure dower. (3 <em>R. S. 5th ed. p. </em>598, \u00a7 48, <em>&amp;c.; p. </em>792, \u00a7 13.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-6\">Neither of these provisions is inconsistent with the Code of Procedure, and both still exist. There can be no question as to the existence of the action of ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-7\">And the other proceeding by petition is a \u201c special statutory remedy, not heretofore obtained by action,\u201d and is saved by section 471 of the Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-8\">It will be seen that the referee has attempted to get over these provisions of the statutes, as he reports that he \u201c took the deposition of three disinterested freeholders,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-9\">IV. The referee erred in setting aside for the widow, the dwelling house. All the improvements made by defendant were upon the house, and in giving the house to the plaintiff she gets all these improvements, and the defendant gets vacant lots, without any allowance being made to bim for the improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-10\">V. The referee errs in finding that the only amount paid for taxes by defendant was $52.94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-11\">The evidence show.s that defendant paid for taxes of 1857, $89.62. Tax of 1859, $103.61. And for Croton water taxes of 1857, 1858, 1859,1860, 1861, 1862 and 1863.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-12\">The referee erred in striking out the evidence of payment of Croton tax. This tax was a hen on the property for the non-payment of which the property might have been sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-13\">VI. The referee should'have allowed payments for insurance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-14\">Insurance was necessary for tne preservation of the property, and was as well for the benefit of the plaintiff as of defendant. And defendant expended for that purpose $302.25.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-15\">Mathews &amp; Swan, <em>attorneys, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b489-16\">Albert Mathews, <em>counsel for plaintiff and respondent.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>First. </em>This is an equitable action to have dower assigned to the plaintiff. The complaint, and its prayer, is framed in the manner of a bill in equity, and is a proper mode of proceeding.

Rep. </em>711; <em>Code of Procedure, </em>\u00a7 468.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-5\">I. The Revised Statutes have not affected the equitable remedy for dower. They abolished only the legal writ of dower, and substituted therefor the legal action of ejectment (2 <em>R. S. p. </em>343, \u00a7 34, <em>and p. </em>303, \u00a7 2, <em>sub. </em>2).</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-6\">II. The plaintiff properly recovered the rents and profits, as well as the assignment of her dower in the same action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\">.(1 <em>Revised Laws, p. </em>57, \u00a7 20, <em>p. </em>60, \u00a7 1; 1 <em>R. S. p. </em>742, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20, 21; <em>Oode of Procedure, </em>\u00a7 167, <em>sub. 5.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-8\">III. If there be any technical error the court must disregard it <em>(Code of Procedure, </em>\u00a7 176).</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-9\"><em>Second. </em>The exceptions taken on the trial to the admissibility of evidence are frivolous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-10\">I. The testimony was admissible under the issues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-11\">II. The evidence could not have affected the judgment or prejudiced the defendant. <em>(Craig </em>agt. <em>Sprague, </em>12 <em>Wend. R. </em>41; <em>Belmont </em>agt. <em>Coleman, </em>1 <em>Bosw. Rep. </em>188.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-12\"><em>Third. </em>The judgment was proper in form, and the exceptions thereto are immaterial. <em>(Hugh\u2019s Equity Draughtsman, p. </em>827; <em>Swaine </em>agt. <em>Perrine, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. R. p. </em>482; <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Cox, 2d Edw. V. C. R. 178; Stilwell </em>agt. <em>Doughty, 2 Brad. Surr. R. </em>311.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-13\"><em>Fourth. </em>This being an equity case, the exceptions taken upon the hearing before the referee after judgment, are not to be considered with the same strictness as in a bill of exceptions arising in an action at law. The judgment will not be reversed for technical error. It is enough if it is substantially right <em>(Forrest </em>agt. <em>Forrest, </em>25 <em>N. Y. R. </em>511).</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-14\"><em>Fifth. </em>The report of the referee was in all respects just and warranted by the facts proved .before him. So far as there was any conflict of evidence, his findings, and those of the court at special term, upon the matters of fact, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>conclusive. <em>(Cohen </em>agt. <em>Dupont, </em>1 <em>Sandf.

The referee was bound to estimate the value of the property (on the diagram) as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\">Six lots on One Hundred arid Twenty-fifth street, No. 437 to</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-7\">442, at $1,900 each................ $11,400</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-8\">Six lots on One Hundred and Twenty-sixth street,</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-9\">No. 399 to 404, at $800 each.........'......... 4,800</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-10\">Dwelling house, exclusive of <em>\u201c </em>improvements \u201d by</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-11\">defendant................................... 3,500</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-12\">Other buildings, &amp;c., exclusive of \u201c improvements \u201d by defendant................................ 400</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-13\">$20,100</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-14\">Widow\u2019s share one-third, $6,700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-15\">1. The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses furnished the only reliable criterion for determining their value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-16\"><em>(a) </em>Samuel B. Kenyon, a <em>freeholder, </em>resident of Harlem for twenty years, dealer (buying, selling, mortgaging, renting,) in real estate for twelve years, gives the above estimate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-17\"><em>(b) </em>Benjamin F. Raynor, resident of Harlem, <em>freeholder, </em>dealer in real estate in Harlem (buying, selling,) for many years, gives the same estimate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-18\"><em>(c) </em>Walter Brady, also a resident of Harlem, <em>freeholder, </em>dealer in real estate for twelve years, gives the same estimate and a little more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-19\">2. These estimates are opposed only by the defendant in person, whose opinions are unreliable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-20\"><em>(a) </em>He is interested pecuniarily in the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-21\"><em>(b) </em>His feelings appeared on the reference to be bitterly excited against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-22\"><em>(o) </em>His judgment is naturally biased in respect to his own property and dwelling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-23\"><em>(d) </em>His estimates and opinions are fanciful, arid do not bear scrutiny or criticism. They were incapable of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>made the basis of the referee\u2019s report. They were irreconcilable with the estimates of the disinterested witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-5\">3. The defendant values only the house and buddings, and does not controvert the valuation of the lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-6\">II. In setting apart a portion of the property, worth $6,700, to the widow, the referee had a right to divide as he thought proper, and properly give her a life estate in that which will be available to her. \u2022 The vacant lots would be useless to a life tenant. The defendant can easily keep his property by paying the widow a fair equivalent (2 <em>R. S. </em>490, \u00a7 13; <em>White </em>agt. <em>Story, </em>23 <em>Hill R. </em>547.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-7\">1. Adopting the estimates of the three disinterested witnesses, the widow was entitled to have the dwelling set apart to her, together with three lots on One Hundred and Twenty-sixth street, thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-8\">Dwelling house................................. $3,500</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-9\">Improvements................................. 800</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-10\">Three lots..................................... 2,400</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-11\">$6,700</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-12\">2. Even upon the estimates of the defendant himself, the widow should have the house, and at least the two lots upon which it stands, and one of the adjoining lots.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-13\">III. The referee, for the reasons aforesaid, was bound to adopt the testimony of the three disinterested freeholders, as to the value of the rents, during the period required by the order of reference, that is, from October 28, 1857, to October 28,1863, as follows : Bent of dwelling for six years, exclusive of the increased rent by reason of improvements, $700 per year, equal to $4,200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-14\">1. The three freeholders, Kenyon, Baynor and .Brady, were competent to speak, and were disinterested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-15\">2. The witness Dean was not competent to speak on the subject. He had no knowledge upon which to base an opinion. His estimate is purely fanciful and unreliable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-16\">3. The estimate of the defendant is unsupported, and is extremely improbable on its face, and is open to the same observations as are made as to his other estimates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>IV. From this amount the referee deducted all the \u201c taxes\u201d imposed on the premises, for the six years, between October 28,1863, which had been paid by the defendant.

Whether then we regard this as a case of reference under the judgment to set out this dower, and to take the account of these rents as specifically provided for by the Code or not, there can be no question of the power of the court in the premises to act, either under the Code or under the former practice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-10\">1.

The court had power to grant \u201c any relief consistent with thq case made by the complaint and embraced within the issue \u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 275). The judge tried and decided every isssue, and the reference was ordered merely as a customary mode of administering the relief to which the court adjudged the plaintiff to be entitled. The court decided the plaintiff entitled to dower and rents, and to a reference to ascertain the <em>quantum </em>thereof. The evidence adduced on the trial was insufficient, and was not intended to enable the court to determine this. There was no evidence as to <em>improvements </em>on the land, repairs or taxes. The case does not find, or purport to find, that the parties sought to have or could have had these matters determined on the trial. The pro'of concerning the same should have come from the defendants. They offered no proof whatever. A decision by the court as to the <em>quantum </em>of dower and rents on the evidence would have been impossible without great prejudice to the defend ants. The reference was for their benefit. The court could not survey or set out the dower by metes and bounds. The reference was, therefore, necessary to prevent a failure of justice. Moreover, this court is bound to presume, if necessary, in order to sustain this judgment, as was the fact, that the parties designedly omitted to offer evidence as to these details, because they preferred to have the <em>quantum </em>of dower and rents ascertained by a reference ordered to carry the judgment into effect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>By the court, </em>Robertson, Ch.

In the last <em>(Chamberlain </em>agt. <em>Dempsey), </em>the amount due on the mortgage sought to be foreclosed, was not determined on the first trial, but on an order of reference made by a different judge, and on a second trial, a judgment, without disposing of the question of costs was given and a reference ordered, on which a different judgment was afterwards rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The present action is certainly sustainable as one in a court of equity for the admeasurement of dower, over which such courts always had jurisdiction concurrently with courts of law. (1 <em>Story's Eq. Juris. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 624 <em>to </em>632; <em>Badgley </em>agt. <em>Bruce, </em>4 <em>Paige, 98; Townsend </em>agt. <em>Townsend, </em>2 <em>Sandf. S. C. R. </em>711.) If it be also an action of ejectment for the recovery of dower, there is no difficulty in the junction of the two. .Indeed courts of equity have always administered other equities in conjunction with such admeasurement <em>(Swaine </em>agt. <em>Perrine, </em>5 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>482; <em>Bell </em>agt. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>49), and seem the more appropriate, and even exclusive tribunals in some cases of the kind. <em>(Van Dyne </em>agt. <em>Thayer, </em>19 <em>Wend. </em>162; <em>Cooper </em>agt. <em>Whitney, 3 Hill, </em>95; <em>Baker </em>agt. <em>Chase, </em>6 <em>Id. </em>482; <em>Runyon </em>agt. <em>Stewart, </em>12 <em>Barb. </em>537.) The facilities for taking an account, in a court of equity, of the rents and profits, would seem to render an action of an equitable character, or in a court of equity, most proper. But all the boundaries of jurisdiction and distinctions between causes of action as legal or equitable being removed, there seems no reason why all the. relief to which the plaintiff is entitled, should not be given in one action. Indeed, a court of equity when it has gained jurisdiction for one purpose, may retain it for other purposes, although they alone would not have constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>primary ground of equity jurisdiction. The objection is therefore not one of jurisdiction, but of misjoinder of causes of action, and has been waived by not being taken by answer or demurrer. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7144, 148; <em>Bank of Utica </em>agt. <em>City of Utica, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>399; <em>Ludlow </em>agt. <em>Simond, </em>2 <em>Cai. C. </em>156; <em>Truscott </em>agt. <em>King, </em>6 <em>N. Y. R. </em>147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">But, although the action may be fairly in this court, and no objection has been made to an adjudication in it upon all the issues involved, it is said such court cannot use a referee to admeasure the plaintiff\u2019s dower, and assess her damages by loss of rents and profits, instead of the three <em>freeholders </em>formerly required in an action of ejectment for dower (2 <em>R. S. </em>312, \u00a7 48, <em>sub. 1; Id. p. </em>310, \u00a7\u00a7 36 <em>to </em>47), or a special petition <em>(Id. </em>489, \u00a7 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The appointment of such freeholders under such statute, was clearly only a mode of supplying the defects of the machinery of a court of law, after giving judgment, in carrying it out, and to save the necessity of a new action or proceeding. Now, however, the only ordinary proceeding in a court to enforce or protect a right, or to prevent a wrong, is in the most general terms an \u201caction <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 2). It can have but one form <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 69). Every distinction \u2022 between actions at law and suits in equity, and their forms, is abolished <em>(Id). </em>Every court, therefore, whether exercising legal or equitable jurisdiction in such proceeding, now possesses the former powers of both courts of law and equity to investigate disputed questionsby every mode peculiar to either, and to make its judgment as to the rights of parties effectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The Code expressly declares, that <em>\u201c </em>all rights of action given or secured by existing laws, may be prosecuted in the manner provided by it \u201d (\u00a7 468). Every court has power, where an answer is put in to grant relief consistent with the <em>case </em>made by the complaint and embraced within the issue <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 275). The court in this action had power, therefore, to admeasure and enforce the plaintiff\u2019s right of dower,.if it determined that she had any under the case made. What part of the land the plaintiff was entitled to, as dower, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>well as the amount due her for her share of the profits withheld, were specific questions of fact involved in the issue made by the pleadings, and were therefore proper subjects, of reference, and their determination was necessary to carry the judgment into effect (Code, \u00a7 254). There surely could be no doubt of the power of the court in such an action to admeasure the dower <em>itself, </em>if it had sufficient materials before it, after acquiring jurisdiction over the subject. If so, it could transfer the inquiry to a referee to aid in ascertaining it. The defendant waived every objection, except a want of jurisdiction, and even a right of appeal from the order of reference, by litigating before the referee without such appeal, and by filing exceptions to the report. <em>(Caines </em>agt. <em>Wyckoff, </em>1 <em>Cai. R. </em>147; <em>Forrest </em>agt. <em>Forrest, </em>8 <em>Bosw. </em>653; <em>S. C. </em>25 <em>N. Y. R. </em>510; <em>Claflin </em>agt. <em>Farmers\u2019 and Citizens\u2019 Bank, Id. </em>296). On appeal also, such an error in the proceeding as admeasuring the dower by one referee instead of three (as it does not appear that he was <em>not </em>a freeholder), should be disregarded, as not affecting the substantial rights of the defendant <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 176).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The plaintiff of- course was only entitled to one-third of the land according to its value at the time of its alienation in 1854 to the defendant, under the statute of 1806 (1 <em>R. L. </em>1813, 60, \u00a7 1), and the Revised Statutes (1 <em>R. S. </em>740, \u00a7 1; <em>Id. </em>742, \u00a7 17; <em>2 Id. </em>490, \u00a7 13), and was not to be allowed for any increase in value since <em>(Walker </em>agt. <em>Schuyler, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>481), or any improvements <em>(Coates </em>agt. <em>Cheever, </em>1 <em>Cow. </em>460).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">No evidence was given of any change in its value to the time of the inquiry before the referee, or of any improvements put upon the premises, except upon the; house exclusive of the improvements, the house could hardly have- been worth as much at the time of the trial as at that of the alienation.' Omitting the house, the relative, value of the lots remaining, to those assigned to the plaintiff, must most probably have continued the same between those dates. The use of the house at its present valuation, including the costs of improvements made by the defendant thereon, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>assigned to make up the value of the one-third of the premises, exclusive of the valuation of the improvements on the house, assigned to her for dower. There is no rule of law forbidding absolutely the assignment of such improvements as part of the dower, provided they are not taken into account in admeasuring the dower, although, if an assignment be otherwise practicable, they are not to be included (2 <em>R. S. </em>490, \u00a7 13, <em>sub. </em>2; <em>Coates </em>agt. <em>Cheever, </em>1 <em>Cow. </em>460; <em>Bell </em>agt. <em>Mayor, </em>&amp;c. <em>of New York, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>42, 72); such improvements could not well be separated from the house. The propriety of the exercise of the discretion of the referee in that respect, was passed upon by the judge at special term, and his decision should not be disturbed <em>(Forrest </em>agt. <em>Forrest, ubi sup). </em>The other provision of the same statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>490, \u00a7 13, <em>sub. </em>2), was complied with by deducting from the lands allotted for dower, the value of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Taxes before the six years to which the inquiry was limited, being before October, 1857, were properly excluded, as was the rate paid for the use of Croton water by the defendant. Any amount paid for <em>ornamental work </em>or repairs to the additions or improvements was properly excluded. There was no evidence that the defendant insured the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the premises, or. anything more than his own, whether he or she could have recovered, if he had so insured, is doubtful <em>(De Longueman agt. Trademens Ins. Co. </em>2 <em>Hall, </em>539): he was not entitled, therefore, to any premiums of insurance paid, unless shown to have been for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, l\u00edo errors of fact have been shown to have been committed by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The judgment and order confirming the report must, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
