At the time of Cotton\u2019s commitment, he requested the officer not to commit him, but to satisfy the execution by a seizure and sale of personal property of Jones, and proposed to point out sufficient unincumbered personal property of Jones to satisfy the execution ; but the officer declined to take said property, and, by order of the plaintiff, arrested Cotton, and committed Mm to jail, he protesting against the arrest, and denying the right of the officer +o arrest him. The execution upon which Cotton was arrested, after reciting the judgment, \u201cwhereof execution remains to be done,\u201d proceeded as follows: \u201c We command you, therefore, that of the goods, chattels or lands of the said defendants, within your precinct, you cause to be paid and satisfied unto the said plaintiff, at the value thereof in money, the aforesaid sums,\u201d &amp;c.; \u201c and for want of goods, chattels or lands of the said defendants, to be by them shown unto you, or found within your precinct, we command you to take the bodies of the said defendants, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>them commit \u201d to jail, &amp;c. This execution was returned to the clerk\u2019s office, and an alias execution issued for the whole amount of the judgment, which is still unpaid. The parties submitted the case to the court of common pleas at February term 1855, upon these facts, and agreed that if the action could be maintained, judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff for the amount of the original execution and interest; otherwise, for the defendants. The case came to this court by appeal from the judgment of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-5\"><em>J. C. Wolcott, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avf\">The officer might lawfully, by direction of the creditor, have levied the execution either on goods and chattels, or on lands. But he was not authorized by law, nor by the form of his execution, to take the body of one of the defendants, when sufficient property of the other defendant was offered to be shown to him. Rev.

It seems also to be sanctioned by the express provisions of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>97, \u00a7 12. The body of the debtor, Cotton, was therefore properly arrested and committed to jail, and the bond given by the defendants was a legal bond. <em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em> </em>By <em>Sf. </em>1855, c. 444, which took effect on the 4th of July 1855, imprisonment for debt is abolished, except in certain eases of fraud, therein specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
