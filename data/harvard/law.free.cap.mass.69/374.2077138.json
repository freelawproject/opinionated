The plaintiff also offered evidence of the reasons assigned by the wife to her father\u2019s family, on the day after she returned to her father\u2019s house, for leaving her husband. <em>Mellen, </em>J. admitted all such declarations made by the wife on the day of her return home, but rejected such as were made on the day following. A verdict was returned for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0f\">The only ground on which the plaintiff could claim to recover for the support of his daughter, the wife of the defendant, was that he had compelled her, by his neglect and misconduct, to leave his place of abode ; and that in such case the law holds the husband liable for necessary supplies, to any person who, at her request, supplies them, without or against the husband\u2019s consent. Upon this principle the case was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The reasons given by the wife for leaving her husband\u2019s house, not under oath, and she not a competent witness against her husband, could only be given in evidence as <em>res gestee, </em>as connected with and part of the act of leaving her husband\u2019s house, and to this extent they were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
