The complaint does not allege that the sale was not one of those permitted by the act. It does not allege that the liquor sold was not liquor the right to sell which is given by some law of this commonwealth.\u201d But this motion was overruled. After verdict of guilty, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, for the reasons set forth in the motion to quash; but this motion also was overruled. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-6\"><em>J. E. Field, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3d\">This complaint only negatives the defendant\u2019s \u201clegal appointment or authority to sell intoxicating liquors.\u201d The words \u201c appointment or authority,\u201d used together, have the same meaning as in <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>322, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 14, and refer only to appointments as town \u00e1gents, or licenses from county commissioners. But a new provision was inserted in <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 2, not contained in <em>St. </em>1852, namely, that the act should not be construed to forbid sales by importers, in the original packages, &amp;c., nor by druggists, for medicinal purposes only. Such sales are not under any \u201c legal appointment or authority \u201d conferred upon the seller, but are simply declared not to be unlawful. This complaint is therefore defective, because it does not negative all the circumstances of exemption and modification contained in the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>Suffolk, March 1853.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-7\"><em>J H. Clifford, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJT\">relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>above cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>Middlesex, 1853; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>2 Gray, 510 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>10 Cush. 405.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACR\">The defendant insists that a negation of \u201c authority to sell intoxicating liquors \u201d extends no further than to cases of persons not having an appointment to sell as agents of the town, or in some form authorized by the acts of an appointing power, or some direct authority conferred on them personally. Bui, in the opinion of the court, this is too narrow a construction of the allegation. Authority to sell such liquors may as well be derived directly from the general law, operating upon all citizens under the same circumstances, as from an appointment or license, by an authorized tribunal, to the individual. Authority to do a thing is having the legal power or right so to act. The first section of the statute upon which this complaint is founded, is certainly in accordance with the construction that \u201cauthority\u201d to sell embraces all the various forms under which a legal right to sell may exist. It declares it to be unlawful and criminal for any person to sell any intoxicating liquor, \u201c unless he is duly authorized so to do, as is hereinafter provided.\u201d The term \u201c duly authorized,\u201d as here used, clearly embraces all the various cases of legal sales under the provisions of the act, under whatever form they may be authorized\u2014whether by appointment as town agents; or under the provisions authorizing the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors under the approval of the county commissioners, upon a special application to them for that purpose ; or lawful sales made without any special authority or appointment therefor, by importers of liquors of foreign production, or by druggists to other druggists, apothecaries and physicians, for medicinal purposes. <em>Exceptions overruled</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> A similar decision was made in Middlesex, October term 1855, in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Babney McShebby, in which the indictment alleged that the defendant, at Watertown on the 20th of May 1855, and at said Water-town from that day to the day of finding this indictment, \u201c without then and tii ere having any license, appointment or authority therefor, first duly had and obtained according to law, was then and there a common seller of spirituous and intoxicating liquors, against the peace of said commonwealth, and the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>J.
