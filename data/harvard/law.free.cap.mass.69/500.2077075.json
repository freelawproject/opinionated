Sts. <em>c. </em>37, and <em>St. </em>1847, <em>c. </em>273, before making insurance in this commonwealth. And Byington, J. ruled that the action could not be maintained. To this ruling the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-6\"><em>B. Palmer Sf J. D. </em>Colt, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq16\">The burden of proof is on the defendant to show that the company had failed to comply with the provisions of the statutes of this commonwealth.

Emerson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-8\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVr\">It was essential to the validity of the contract of insurance, which was the consideration of this note, that the insurance company should previously have complied with the provisions of the statutes of this commonwealth. As it is admitted that a compliance with these provisions was denied in the answer, neither the company nor their treasurer, being the payees named in the note, can maintain this action, without proof of such compliance. If the plaintiff were a <em>bona fide </em>holder, without notice, the rule would be different, and a compliance with the requisitions of the statutes might be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>Atlantic Mutual Fire Ins.
