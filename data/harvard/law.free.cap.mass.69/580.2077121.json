In their application, they agreed, in terms, that the answers given to the questions propounded to them, and the accompanying statements and declarations, should be the basis of the policy, and that if the same were not in all respects true, and correctly stated, the policy should be void. And it was moreover stated in the policy itself, that it was understood and agreed to be the true intent and meaning thereof, that if the answers and declaration made by the assured, and on the faith of which the policy was declared to be made, should \u201c be found in any respect untrue,\u201d the policy should be null and void. The jury having found that some of those answers were untrue, and no motion being made to set aside the verdict as against the evidence, there is an end of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
