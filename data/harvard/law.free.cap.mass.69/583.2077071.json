J., it appeared that, at the time of the making of the policy, there was, in one of the buildings covered by the policy, a grist mill, which was not mentioned in the policy, nor in any indorsement thereon, nor in the application; and the defendants contended that the policy was thereby rendered void. There was no evidence of any change in the business carried on in the buildings insured, between the time of the insurance and the time of the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-6\">The plaintiff called John Field, who testified that he was an agent of the defendants, with full power to make contracts of insurance in their behalf, and was furnished by them with blank forms, signed by then- president and secretary, which he was authorized to fill up and deliver at his discretion, without reference to the company for their sanction; that he was well acquainted with the premises, having previously examined them, for the purpose of insuring them in behalf of another company, and that, at the request of Davis &amp; Kilburn for an insurance, he went upon the premises in company with Kilburn, examined the property particularly, and saw the grist mill, and made such inquiries in relation to the property as he deemed necessary; and, after Kilburn and he had agreed what was material to be inserted in the application, put down the answers as they were given, and filled up the application with such a description as he thought suitable, and Kilburn signed it and returned it to the agent, who then filled up the policy, which had already been signed by the president and secretary, and delivered it to Kilburn, and received the premium agreed upon, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was the highest rate of premium charged for extrahazardous risks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\">The defendants objected to the_ introduction of this evidence, and as ked the court to instruct the jury that if, when the policy was made or when the fire occurred, the premises were applied to or used for the purpose of carrying on or exercising therein any business denominated hazardous or extrahazardous, or specified in the memorandum of special rates, and not named in the policy, or added to or indorsed thereon, the policy was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">But the court admitted the evidence, and refused this instruction, and instructed the jury that, if the agent of the defendants, having full authority to make contracts of insurance, upon being applied to for this insurance, instead of relying upon representations made to him by the insured in their written application, visited the premises in order, by inspection and inquiry there, to satisfy himself of the nature and extent of the risk, and, in company with the insured, went over the property, inspected it to his satisfaction, and made such inquiries in relation to it and its uses as he thought proper, and the owners in good faith answered all inquiries without concealment, and, after the parties had consulted as to what was necessary to be stated in the application, the agent wrote the answers, and inserted whatever he saw or had agreed was material to be stated, and thereupon the agent took the premium and delivered the policy, then no omission to make a perfect enumeration of the occupations carried on in the buildings insured would vitiate the policy, provided the agent knew all the facts concerning such occupation, and purposely omitted to state them because he had agreed to consider them not essential to the risk; or provided the facts woidd have been known by him if he had made such inquiry and examination as it was his duty to make under the circumstances ; and provided further that the facts now known were not material to the risk, that is to say, would not have occasioned the insurers to increase the premium or to decline taking the risk ; that, under such circumstances, the defendants were equitably estopped from claiming that to be material which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>agent knew at the time, and omitted to insert in the application because he then agreed that it was not material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions, upon which the case was argued at Boston in January 1854.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-6\"><em>G.

Co. 1 </em>Sumner, 434. The warranties (if any) in this case have been complied with. Warranties are to be construed strictly. The enumeration, in the policy or application, of certain occupations, is not a warranty that no others are carried on in the same building, unless the intention of the assured so to warrant appear distinctly and inevitably. If the assured limits or qualifies his answer, and the insurer accepts such limited and qualified answer, the warranty is so far limited and restrained, and the insurer is bound by its terms, equally with the assured. <em>Gates </em>v. <em>Madison County Mutual Ins. Co. 2 </em>Comst. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">But the doctrine of warranty has not been applied with strictness in this state to cases of fire insurance ; but the inquiry has always been whether there has been any misrepresentation, concealment or alteration, by which the insurers have been misled. <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Fire Ins.

A chair shop and tub and pail factory are manufacturing establishments of the most hazardous class, and the mention of them in the policy is a sufficient compliance with its provisions. The premises were never \u201c appropriated, applied to, or used for the purpose of carrying on \u201d a grist mill, within the meaning of the clause in the policy. A merely secondary or incidental use of the premises for a purpose not disclosed will not avoid the policy, especially when it does not increase the risk. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Robberds, </em>6 Ad. &amp; El. 75. <em>Mayall </em>v. <em>Mitford, </em>1 Nev. &amp; P. 732. <em>New York Equitable Ins.

Field relied on his own survey, and not on the statements in the application, in estimating the hazard, and issuing the policy; agreed with the assured upon what facts were material to be inserted in the application ; and himself filled it up. The defendants are therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>estopped to set up any omission, thus made by their agent, as material to the risk, or as avoiding the policy. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Saratoga Mutual Ins.

This was clearly contrary to the express stipulation in the policy, and permitted the jury to substitute, in the place <em>of </em>the written agreement of the parties, their acts and statements prior to the execution of the policy. Upon the most familiar principle of the law of evidence, all previous verbal agreements must be taken to be merged in the written contract of the parties, made for the very purpose of embodying the terms of their contract, and designed to be the repository and proof of their final intentions. It must be presumed conclusively that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and mode of their undertaking, was reduced to writing, and all evidence of a previous <em>colloquium </em>is incompetent. This wise and salutary rule cannot operate harshly upon parties who read and understand their written agreements before executing them. The agreement in the policy was that the carrying on of a trade included in the class of special risks should render the policy void. This was a clear and explicit stipulation, the manifest purpose of which was to exclude paroi evidence as to the danger of such occupations, and th ;ir materiality to the risk, and substitute in place thereof the agreement of the parties, about which there could not be any cavil or dispute. The evidence offered by the plaintiff, and submitted to the jury under the foregoing instructions, was in direct contravention of the written contract. It not only tended to vary it by paroi evidence, but directly to contradict it. It was the assured who were estopped by their own deliberate and solemn agreement in writing, and not the defendants, who relied solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>on the terms of the contract which the plaintiff sought to enforce against them. The recent case of <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Union Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>7 Cush. 175, well illustrates and enforces the rule of evidence excluding paroi testimony, as applicable to policies of insurance, and is decisive of this case, as the facts are now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">We have not deemed it necessary to decide whether the policy in question would be rendered invalid by the use of the premises insured for purposes or occupations enumerated in the conditions annexed to the policy as belonging to the same class with those specified in the policy, but not stated or set out as being purposes or occupations to which the insured intended to appropriate the buildings insured; that is, whether, in a policy upon a building, stated in the policy as one used for a particular hazardous or extrahazardous risk, the insured might use the premises for any other occupation, not stated in the policy, but coming within the same class of hazards. But we confine our decision to the precise case of buildings enumerated in the policy, and specified therein as being used only for particular designated occupations, and which, subsequently to the making of the policy, were actually appropriated to the carrying on of a business coming within the class of special hazards, for which special rates of premium are charged, and which was not named or designated in the policy. It is clear that the latter class of hazards stand on their own peculiar ground, and that the premiums thereon do not come within any rate or tariff common to risks of a particular kind, but are intended in all cases to be the subject of a special agreement and distinct rate of insurance, to be determined on by the parties, according to the circumstances of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained ; new trial in this court.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">At September term 1854, the parties submitted the case to the decision of the court upon a statement of facts, embodying substantially the facts proved and found by the jury at the former trial, and also the following facts, which were agreed to be true, provided paroi evidence would be admissible to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>them : The risk was a special risk; the rate of premium paid was that usually charged for special risks, (though there was no uniform rate for such risks,) and higher than the agent had ever before charged on extrahazardous risks. The rate would be higher on two or more extrahazardous risks than on one; but two rooms occupied for a pail factory and one for a grist mill would not be so great a risk as if all three were occupied for a pail factory. When two or three kinds of business, all special risks, are carried on in the same building, the rate usually charged would be that chargeable for the greatest risk. The premium in this case was determined by the hazard of making tubs and pails, which was the greatest of the several special risks in the building insured. The use of the building for a grist mill was not material to the risk. The fire, by which the buildings were consumed, originated in the tub and pail factory, which was a separate building from the blacksmith\u2019s shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"><em>Huntington Sf Wells, </em>for the plaintiff, in addition to the points taken by them at the former argument, argued that the opinion already given did not settle this case, because it was founded on the assumption that the property insured was only extrahazardous, whereas it was now agreed to have been a special risk, and taken at the highest rate known to the office ; and that as, by the terms of the policy, the conditions of insurance were to be referred to in order to explain it, and one of those conditions, by stipulating that the policy should be avoided by any use which increased the hazard, implied that any use which did not increase the hazard would not avoid the policy, paroi evidence was admissible to show that the risk was not rendered more hazardous, but that the special hazard, taken by the company, was in fact diminished by the substitution of a grist mill in one of the rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">They also contended that if the policy was avoided as to the larger building insured, it was still (especially as it was not issued by a mutual insurance company) good as to the blacksmith\u2019s shop, which was a separate subject of insurance, and not applied to any other use than the one described. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>New England Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 346. <em>Trench </em>v. <em>Chenango County Mutual Ins. Co. </em>7 Hill, 122.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Davis Sf </em>Allen, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<author id=\"b600-4\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEy\">Upon a careful consideration of this case, in the aspect in which it is now presented by the agreed statement of facts, we are satisfied that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. It is conceded that the premises insured, in addition to the purposes specified in the policy, were, at the time of the fire, appropriated to carrying on a grist mill. This was a distinct use of one of the buildings insured, not assented to by the defendants, for an occupation included in the classes of hazards, annexed to che policy, as a <em>\u201c </em>special hazard.\u201d It was therefore a violation of the express stipulation in the policy, and by its terms avoids the contract. Nor does it at all affect the result, that this additional unauthorized use of the premises was for a purpose comprehended within the same class of hazards as that which was specified in the policy, and originally covered by the .nsurance. The manifest purpose of this stipulation was to prevent any use of the premises for an occupation or business ncluded in any of the classes of risks denominated \u201c hazardous, extrahazardous or special,\u201d without the express sanction of the. company in writing. It was not intended to limit the assured, in the use of his property, to the same class of risks as those specified in the policy, and to allow him to change the mode of its occupation, or appropriate the premises to additional uses of the same grade of hazards, at his pleasure. Such is not the import of the language used in the policy, nor would such a construction of it be just or reasonable. To prevent the accumulation of hazardous occupations in the same premises, without their assent, was the object which the defendants sought to accomplish by this agreement. Each distinct use of a building insured, for a purpose or business of a hazardous nature might, in the opinion of the insurers, increase the risk by fire; and this might be so, whether the additional use came within the same kind of hazards as that specified in the policy, or belonged to a higher or lower class. It was not, therefore, a compliance with this stipulation to use general terms of description, in the application and policy, comprehending various kinds of risks, even of the same class. The insurance of a building described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>only as a mill, a factory, a store, or workshop, without any words designating or limiting the particular uses to which it was to be appropriated, would include a wide range of risks, some of which, if known, the defendants might not be willing to assume. It was necessary to state specifically the business or occupation to be carried on in the premises, and to confine then-use to the purposes specified in the policy. By this means the defendants were enabled to ascertain the precise nature of the risks they assumed. But this was not the only object effected by this agreement. It also enumerated the various trades and occupations which should be deemed, under the policy, \u201c hazardous, extrahazardous, and special,\u201d and which, if carried on in the premises without the consent in writing of the defendants, should avoid the policy. It thereby put at rest all questions between the parties, as to the different nature of the uses to which buildings might be appropriated, and their materiality to the risk actually assumed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">It results from this view of the agreement of the parties, that the objection to the right of the plaintiff to recover does not rest on the ground of misrepresentation or concealment by the assured in the description of the property contained in his application for insurance. But it proceeds solely on the ground that the assured has violated an express stipulation in the policy, by the very terms of which the contract between the parties is at an end. Nor can this stipulation be in any way controlled or modified by reference to the \u201c conditions of insurance \u201d annexed to the policy, so as to open the question whether the use of a grist mill on the premises was material to the risk. These conditions are, by the terms of the policy, to be resorted to, in order to explain the rights and obligations of the parties, only in cases not otherwise specially provided for in the policy itself. The use of the premises insured, for purposes not specified, is a matter expressly provided for in the policy, by a distinct agreement of the parties. It is not, therefore, in any way affected by the provisions embraced in the conditions of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We can see no reason for applying the doctrine of estoppel to the- defendants, on the ground that the assured was misled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the acts of the agent of the company. In making the application for insurance, he did not act for the defendants, but for the assured. In delivering the policy, although acting as agent for the defendants, he did nothing which can be construed into a waiver of any of the provisions in the policy. It was the written contract, which 'fixed and determined the rights of the parties, and these could not be varied or changed, in the absence of fraud, by the verbal acts or conduct of the parties or their agents, previously to its execution and delivery. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Union Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>7 Cush. 175. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>8 Cush. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The policy cannot be held valid for a portion of the risk and invalid for the residue. It was an entire contract, entered into for an entire consideration. The property was insured as one risk, and was in fact closely connected together. It is impossible to say that either portion of the risk would have been taken without the other. Besides, it is expressly agreed that, in case of a breach of the stipulation as to the use of the premises for purposes not specified in the policy, \u201cthese presents shall cease and be of no force or effect.\u201d The contract was therefore, by its terms, at an end. <em>Judgment for the defendants.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
