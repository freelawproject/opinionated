Accordingly, where an indictment recited that the defendant was accused of the crime of <em>\u201cassault </em>with intent to commit murder,\u201d and then proceeded to state facts showing that the defendant had <em>administered poison with intent to kill, </em>etc.: <em>Held, </em>that the indictment did not charge two offenses, and was good.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b73-10\">Appeal from a judgment upon a demurrer to the indictment, in the County Court of Del Norte County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-11\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-12\">J. <em>Hamilton, Attorney-General, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-13\"><em>James E.

The defendant has not filed any points in support of the demurrer, but the only ground that seems to require notice, is that more than one offense is charged in the indictment. The indictment recites that the defendant is accused by the grand jury of the crime of \u201c an assault with intent to commit murder, committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>as follows.\u201d Following this is a statement of facts, showing that the defendant administered to John Nelson \u201c a large quantity of a certain deadly poison, called red oxide of mercury,\u201d with the intent, etc., to murder said Nelson. The facts there stated appear to be sufficient to bring the case within the provisions of \u00a7 216 of the Penal Code; and they do not charge two offenses. The fact that the offense thus charged has not been given by the indictment its legal appellation, is not fatal to the indictment, as it is a mere irregularity in matter of form. The name given in the indictment to the offense charged, or sought to be charged, by the statement of facts constituting the offense, is not of itself the charge of an offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>39 Cal. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to overrule the demurrer to the indictment. Bemittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
