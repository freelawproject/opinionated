At the trial, the defendant gave some testimony, without objection on the part of the plaintiffs, to the effect that Chas. Jones was a man of good character. The jdaintiffs, in rebuttal, offered \u201c the record with a plea of \u2018 guilty \u2019 to an indictment of Charles Jones, <em>alias </em>George Jones, in the Municipal Criminal Court of San Francisco, for stealing a horse from one Wm. McMaster on the 9th of June, 1876, and which record also shows that he had been previously convicted of petit and grand larceny. \u2018 I offer it,\u2019 (said plaintiffs\u2019 counsel) \u2018 for the purpose of contradicting Mr. Curran\u2019s statement that this was a man of good character. \u2019 \u201d The offer was objected to by counsel for defendant, on the ground, among others, that the character of Charles Jones was not in issue in the case, and that the offered evidence was irrelevant. The Court ruled as follows: \u201c The record is admitted in evidence for the purpose of rebutting the good character of Charles J ones, leaving the jury to determine the identity of the individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>To this ruling the defendant excepted, and assigns it as error entitling him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">That the character of Jones was not an issue in this case does not admit of question. The only question is, whether the giving of irrelevant testimony upon that subject by the defendant entitled the plaintiffs to go into evidence in reply to it. The affirmative of this proposition was held in <em>Grafton Bank </em>v. Woodward, 5 N. H. Rep. 301, and in <em>Furbush </em>v. Goodweed, 5 Foster, (N. H.) 449; but in the note to \u00a7 469a, 1 Greenleaf on Ev., it is said the rule is, in general, the other way. And we agree with the Court in <em>Walkup </em>v. Pratt, 5 Har. &amp; J. 56, where they say: \u201c The offering improper evidence by one of the litigant parties never can justify the introduction of similar evidence by the other party ; such doctrine would lead to endless confusion, and destroy all the established rules of evidence.\u201d (See also, <em>Mitchell </em>v. Sellman, 5 Md. 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Because of the error committed in the particular mentioned, the judgment and order must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Morrison, C. J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
