The allegations of the complaint were, in effect, admitted, except the allegation as to the grant from the city; and, with reference to this, it was admitted that a grant was made by the Alcalde; but it was claimed that this operated as a grant from the city only by virtue of the Act of March 11th, 1858, entitled \u201c An Act to ratify and confirm certain ordinances of the Common Council of said city,\u201d and the ordinance therein referred to; and that by the said act and ordinances the grant was made subject to the streets established by the plan or map referred to in the complaint, among which was Green Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">The case was submitted, in the lower Court, upon the pleadings'and the following stipulation:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">\u201c Title of Court and Cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">\u201c Stipulated, that the only points in controversy in said action are the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-9\">\u201c 1st.

M. Leavenworth, Alcalde of the Pueblo of San Francisco, to one A. C. Harris, on the 22nd day of September, 1848, which was in the usual form of alcalde grants, and made in compliance with the then customary formalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The question of the validity of such a grant, and that it conferred the right <em>to the </em>possession upon the <em>grantee, </em>cannot be reconsidered by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">The 7th day of July, 1846, has been recognized by the Courts and by the Congress of the United States, as the date when the authority of the Mexican departmental officials terminated in Calitornia. But in <em>Cohas v. Raisin, </em>(3 Cal.) 448, it was held that a grant, or a town lot, made by an \u201c American Alcalde,\u201d in 1847, conveyed a title to the grantee; and the Supreme Court said: \u201c A grant of a lot in San Francisco, made by an Alcalde, whether a Mexican or of any other nation, raises the presumption that the Alcalde was a properly qualified officer; that he had authority to make the grant, and that the land was within the boundaries of the pueblo.\u201d It was further said, that such grants were <em>not </em>of any portion of the public domain, made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>by officers of the conquering power, but were \u201c grants of municipal lands, made by the regularly authorized municipal authorities, under the laws, usages and customs of the country, which were not interfered with by the military or <em>de facto </em>government,\u201d etc. It is, indeed true, that the particular grant there present, was a grant made before the treaty of peace; but there is nothing in the reasoning of the Court in <em>Cohas </em>v. <em>Raisin, </em>which would suggest that a different rule could be applied to a grant made after the actual overthrow of the Mexican authority, whether made before or after the treaty was signed and ratified. The Court, in their opinion, add: \u201c The fact that this right (of granting lots) was exercised by the municipality, in its different forms, <em>from </em>1835 to 1850, without question or restriction, would prove the usage and custom in the absence of the law.\u201d If it should be admitted, as suggested\u2014and we find it unnecessary to admit it\u2014that the decision in <em>Cohas </em>v. <em>Raisin </em>would be justified only by reason of the disturbed condition of land titles and threatened breaches of the peace, that very fact should induce us, after this lapse of time, to stand by the judicial solution of the question involved as <em>res adjud\u00edcala.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>' </em>The grant considered in <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Lambier, </em>(7 Cal. 347) was made by the officer who executed that under which the present plaintiff deraigns title, and was issued nearly two months <em>later. </em>In <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Lambier, </em>the Court said: \u201c In the examination of this case we have observed the same line of defense, substantially, as that made in the case of <em>Cohas </em>v. <em>Raisin ; </em>and, lest it might be supposed that there is some disposition on the part of this Court to question that decision, we take this occasion to approbate the same, and to announce our determination of adhering to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Passing <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>and <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>15 and 16 Cal.\u2014which recognize the cases previously referred to as authoritative\u2014 Wh<em>ite </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>21 Cal. 34, is directly in point. There the grant had been made in 1849. The case was decided in 1862, long after the \u201cVan Ness Ordinance\u201d had been ratified, and the Court declared: \u201c The law upon this point, whatever may be the opinions of individuals, or the determination of tribunals not gov- -erned by our judgments, must be considered settled, so far as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>depends upon the decisions of this Court,\u201d and cited <em>Cohas </em>v. <em>Raisin, Dewey </em>v. <em>Lambier, Welsh </em>v. Sullican, 8 Cal. 179, and <em>Payne </em>v. Dewey, 16 Cal. 232. As late as 1871 it was said, in <em>Broad </em>v. <em>Broad, </em>40 Cal. 496: \u201cThat an Alcalde\u2019s grant passed a title to a grantee therein named, is beyond controversy in this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Nor (if it could be so overthrown) was the authority of the cases above cited overthrown by the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Roulet, </em>13 Wall. 386. The grant there held to be invalid, was of a parcel of the common lands of the <em>pueblo, </em>and was made by Horace Hawes, <em>elected </em>and acting as <em>Prefect of a district, </em>which included the pueblo within its boundaries. The judgment of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of California, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court, was to the effect, that although each <em>Prefect </em>of California, while the same was part of the Mexican territory, had power to make grants of the common and unappropriated lands of the pueblos within their jurisdiction, yet that from and after the conquest and acquisition of the country by the United States they ceased to have such power, and, consequently, the grant of Prefect Hawes was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The officers of the Territory of California, (including prefects) empowered by Mexican law to make grants of public lands, could grant lands within the pueblo ; but the powers of such officers to make grants anywhere ceased upon the conquest; and the power was not transferred to the military officers <em>de facto, </em>who immediately succeeded such departmental or territorial officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">As we have seen, however, it has been determined by the Court, that a grant by an Alcalde was not an ordinary grant of the public domain, but a grant of <em>municipal </em>lands, made by a regularly authorized municipal officer, under the laws, usages, and customs of the country, not interfered with by .the United States, or the <em>de facto </em>government which existed in California subsequent to the conquest and prior to the admission of the State into.the Union. To maintain this position, it is not necessary to hold that the title or estate of the municipality was in any wise different from such as it was said to be in <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Burnett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Counsel for appellants seem to have misapprehended the effect of their citations from <em>\u201c </em>Dwinelle\u2019s Colonial History of San Francisco.\u201d Governor Gutierrez, as there quoted, says: \u201c The Ayuntamiento, (or Alcalde, see <em>Hart </em>v. Burnett) may dispose of these lands, (the ejidos) for building lots.\u201d \u201c The <em>ejidos </em>could be alienated only for the purpose of granting <em>solares </em>or building lots,\u201d etc. (Dwinelle, p. 11.) The question, however, is not involved in the present case, for two reasons: 1st. It does not appear that the lot described in the complaint constituted a portion of the <em>ejidos ; </em>2nd. It is not a question which can be considered here, in view of the <em>agreed case or stipulation </em>in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiff being the absolute owner of the lands described in the complaint, they cannot be entered upon without her consent ; nor can any portion of them be appropriated to the use of the public as a street, except upon due compensation paid or secured, and in pursuance of proceedings prosecuted for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Boss, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
