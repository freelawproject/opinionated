Hendrix, 1 Ala. 212; <em>Allen </em>v. Craig, 1 Green. 294; 489 Marsh. 267.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b511-16\"><em>B. S. </em>Brooks, for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-17\">If the rule is, that in an action of tort against several defendants who have taken different parts in the transaction, \u201cthe measure of damages ought to be the same which ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>awarded against the most guilty of the defendants,\u201d then the result would be, that we ought to have judgment against Small for the <em>meliora damna. </em>But <em>Tie </em>cannot complain that our judgment or verdict against him is less than it should be. Nor is it a matter that concerns Mahoney. (2 Greenleaf Ev. \u00a7 277; <em>Harrill </em>v. <em>Stringfield, </em>1 Morr. [Iowa] 18; <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Schoonover, </em>43 Ill. 494.) If it is an error, it is an immaterial error. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 475.) There is no such reason for such a rule, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench questioned whether there was any such .rule. <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>Cotterel, </em>18 Eng. L. &amp; E. 99-105.) In that case, one judgment was rendered against the Sheriff and another. The Court held the damages not excessive as to the Sheriff, and refused him a new trial; but that the damages were excessive as to the other, and granted him a rule to show cause why there should not be a new trial granted as to him <em>on this ground only.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">Suppose the defendants here had been tried separately. \u201cIn an action for assault, two defendants pleaded severally at different times. The two issues were tried separately <em>at the same term. </em>In the first, the jury gave \u00a3200 ; in the second, \u00a350, and the other made default. Judgment was rendered against <em>all </em>for the \u00a3200.\u201d <em>(Sir John Hayden\u2019s Case, </em>11 Coke, 6.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-7\">Department No. 1, Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Plaintiff sued defendants, jointly, for malicious arrest and prosecution. The defendants answered separately. The cause was tried with a jury, and this verdict was returned: \u201c We, the jury in the above-entitled action, find for plaintiff, against Ma-honey $3,000, and against Small $500.\u201d Judgment was thereupon rendered that plaintiff recover of Mahoney $3,000, of Small $500, and of Mahoney and Small $282.75 costs of suit. The defendants made a motion for a new trial, which was denied, and appealed from the judgment and the order denying them a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">After the argument of the cause here, the plaintiff asked leave to enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to Small, and to consent that <em>as to him </em>the judgment be vacated and the suit dismissed. If this motion should be allowed, it is not at all clear\u2014in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the nature of the action and the peculiar form of the judgment \u2014but that it would operate a discharge of both defendants <em>(Minor </em>v. <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank, </em>1 Peters, 87); and we think it fairer to all of the parties to deny the application, and to determine the cause as presented by the original record.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The judgment as entered is clearly erroneous. The action being for a wrong in which both defendants joined, the damages could not be severed. <em>(Beal </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>11 N. Y. 128; <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>9 Pick. 555; <em>O'Shea </em>v. <em>Kirker, </em>8 Abb. Pr. 69; <em>Bohun </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>6 Cow. 312; <em>Minor </em>v. <em>Mechanics' Bank, </em>1 Peters, 74; <em>Layman </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>1 Ala. 212; <em>Hardy </em>v. Thomas, 23 Miss. 544; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>1 A. K. Marsh. 321; <em>Salmons </em>v. <em>Smith, 1 </em>Saund. R. 207, note 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">As this view renders it necessary to remand the cause for a new trial, it becomes unnecessary to notice the other points made by counsel for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Motion to enter <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to Small denied, and judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">McKinstby, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
