The words \u201c existing corporations\u201d are to be treated as merely <em>descriptiopersonarum: </em>Constitutional Law. \u2014An unconstitutional provision in an act does not affect the validity of another provision in the same act, which is not obnoxious to the objection, unless the two provisions are so united that a presumption .arises that the Legislature would not have adopted the one without the other.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-14\">Application for discharge on writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-15\">Judgment was rendered in this case on the 1st day of October, 1878, remanding the prisoner, and a rehearing granted November 26th of the same year.

The Legislature has the power to create offices, and appoint the officers in such mode as it may designate. (Con. \u00a7 6, art. 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Provines, </em>34 Cal. 541; <em>In re Bulger, </em>45 Id. 553-557; Cooley Con. Lim. 115, note; <em>Bridger </em>v. <em>Shallcross, </em>6 W. Va. 590.) The designation of the societies <em>as corporations </em>is merely a description. It is unnecessary to discuss the right to collect fees. If the provisions of the act to this effect are unconstitutional, this does not vitiate the remainder of the act. <em>(Lathrop </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>19 Cal. 530; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nally, </em>49 Id. 482.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-7\">In bank, McKinstry, P. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">It is argued by counsel for petitioner, that the Act of April 3rd, 1876, \u201c to regulate the practice of medicine,\u201d as amended in 1878, (Laws 1877-8, p. 918) is <em>void, </em>because a violation of the provisions of the late Constitution: \u201c Corporations may be formed under general laws, but shall not be created by special act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The second section of the act confers the exclusive power to appoint Boards of Examiners upon three <em>medical societies, </em>and prohibits such appointment by any other corporation, society, person, or persons. The eighth section of the amendatory act makes it a misdemeanor for any person (except an appointee of one of the three societies named) to sign, seal, or issue a certificate purporting to authorize the practice of medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">It is claimed by petitioner, that the power to appoint is a franchise which the act attempts to confer upon the three named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>incorporations, and which is not enjoyed by other medical societies incorporated under the general laws ; that the act is, therefore, violative of the provisions of the Constitution above recited, as the same was construed in <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Spring Valley Water Works, </em>48 Cal. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I. We shall assume that the State, in the exercise of the police power, may provide for boards authorized to examine persons seeking to be admitted to practice medicine, to be appointed by any citizen or citizens named.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">There is nothing in the language of the law to indicate tnat it was the purpose to confer this power of appointment - upon the particular <em>corporations. </em>If it should be made to appear that the societies named had never been incorporated, the power of appointment would still remain to be employed by the <em>societies </em>or aggregations of individuals who had adopted the society names mentioned in the act. The assumption of the power by these individuals or societies would be the assumption of a public duty, and the performance of the duty simply would not be profitable or beneficial to them, as societies, nor, should they happen to be incorporated, as private corporations. The second section of the act confers the power of appointing Boards of Examiners upon the three named societies, which are said to be \u201c existing corporations \u201d ; but, as we have seen, this designation does not oblige us to declare that it was intended to confer the power of appointment on the three societies as corporations. The words \u201c existing corporations \u201d may be treated as merely \u201c <em>descriptio per sonar umV</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">II. We need not inquire whether certain other portions of the act are unconstitutional. This may be assumed, without being decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The portions of the act thus <em>assumed </em>to be invalid are not so connected with the rest as to render invalid any other portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The title of the act sufficiently indicates its main purpose and design. Its general framework shows, that it was intended to require, of those alone authorized to practice the profession, that knowledge of pathology, anatomy, and physiology recognized as necessary by every school of the science of medicine. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>portions of the act assumed to he unconstitutional are not inseparably connected with, nor do they necessarily depend upon, other portions of the same act. It is well settled, that if a provision, which is not obnoxious to objection, is found even in the same section with another, which is repugnant to the Constitution, the one in itself valid and complete must be sustained, unless the two are so united as that it must be presumed the Legislature would not have adopted the one without the other. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nally, </em>49 Cal. 482; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>22 Id. 379; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Hutchings, </em>5 Gray, 485.) The parts of the statute assumed to be unconstitutional, and those portions of it to which no such objection can be taken, are wholly independent of each other, and the latter may be maintained and carried into effect, without reference to the former. In such cases, the portions which are constitutional are not affected by the portions which are invalid. (<em>Warren </em>v. <em>Mayor of Charlestown, </em>2 Gray, 98; <em>French </em>v. <em>Teschemaker, </em>24 Cal. 548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Our conclusion is, that by conferring the authority and imposing the duty of appointing Boards of Examiners on the three societies named in the act, and prohibiting the issuing of certificates by others than the appointees of such societies, the Legislature did not exceed the limitation of its powers contained in the provision above quoted, and that it is unnecessary herein to express any opinion as to the other portions of the law, since, even if it be assumed that such other portions are unconstitutional, the remaining parts are stated independently, and of themselves contain a complete scheme for the examination of diplomas and applicants, and for the prohibition of certificates by others than those empowered by the act to issue them.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The petitioner must be remanded. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Morrison, C. J., Ross, J., Thornton, J., and Myricic, J., concurred,</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Sharpstein, J., being disqualified, took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
