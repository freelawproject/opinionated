Mullany, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-16\">It seems to be now a well-settled rule of law that any conveyance of lands intended by the parties making it to be a security for the payment of money, constitutes a mortgage. <em>(Steel </em>v. <em>Steel, </em>4 Allen, 415; 1 Washb. R. P. 479; <em>Lanfair </em>v. <em>Lanfair, </em>18 Pick. 299.) Whether a conveyance be a mortgage or not is determined by its object. If given as security, it is a mortgage, whatever its form. This is so, whether the condition of defeasance form a part of the deed, or is evidenced by other writing, or\" exists in parol. The fact of its being given as security determines its character, and not the evidence by which the fact is established. <em>(Miami Ex. Co. </em>v. <em>Bank of U. S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Wright, 252; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>17 Iowa, 586; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>19 Ohio, 212; Civ.

When it is once ascertained that the conveyance is to be considered and treated as a mortgage, then all the consequences appertaining in equity to a mortgage are strictly observed, and the right of redemption is regarded as an inseparable incident. (4 R. C. 143; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 1018 <em>et </em>seq.; 1 Herman on Mort. \u00a7 170.) Any agreement or stipulation cutting off the right of redemption has always been held to be utterly void. (1 Jones on Mort. \u00a7 7; Herman on Mort. \u00a7\u00a7 31, 119, 120, 126; <em>Union Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>No. 5604.) In this State the time for redemption has been fixed at six months after a sale under a decree of foreclosure. (Code Civ.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">1st. The instrument annexed to the complaint, and marked \u201c Exhibit D,\u201d is a deed of trust, which authorizes the trustees therein named to sell and convey the lands described, upon default in the payment of the note or interest, and is not a mortgage requiring judicial foreclosure. <em>(Koch </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>14 Cal. 256.) The doctrine of <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Briggs </em>has never been overthrown by subsequent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">2nd. Appellant\u2019s second point is, that the promissory note \u201c C \u201d \u2014secured by the deed, \u201c D \u201d\u2014was barred by limitation before \u201c default \u201d was declared by the Board of Directors of the Savings and Loan Society, and that all remedy against the security for its payment became barred with the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Section 17 of the Statute of Limitations, which was in operation before the Codes, provided that actions could \u201c only be commenced \u201d within the periods mentioned. (Hittell\u2019s G. L., p. 635.) The provision of the Code of Civil Procedure is: \u201c The periods prescribed for the commencement of actions are * * * within <em>four </em>years, an action upon any contract, obligation, or liability, upon any instrument in writing,\u201d etc. The Statute of Limitations is to be employed as a shield, and not as a sword; as a means of defense, and not as a weapon of attack. It is true that <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Liscom, </em>(34 Cal. 365) has sometimes been supposed to hold the contrary. But <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>Liscom, </em>was, in effect, an action by one in possession to <em>quiet title, </em>under the 25th section of the former Practice Act. The plaintiff\u2019s possession established his case <em>prima facie, </em>and\u2014as against the assertion by the defendant of a right to the possession\u2014plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>iff was permitted to rely upon his five years <em>adverse </em>possession. In that case Mr. Justice Sawyer used the language following: \u201c <em>Whatever may he true of personal contracts, </em>it certainly cannot be said with reference to realty, in view of the authorities cited, that the statute only takes away a remedy, or that a right \u2014a title\u2014is not <em>practically </em>extinguished as to one party and acquired by the other. The five years adverse possession, <em>practically at least, </em>is conclusive evidence of title in the possessor.\u201d Undoubtedly, as that case was presented, and for all \u201c practical \u201d purposes, it was immaterial whether the five years adverse possession was treated as operating a transfer of the title of the defendant to the plaintiff, or considered as creating an estoppel to the assertion of the defendant\u2019s right to the possession. And the learned judge in terms reserved any expression of opinion as to the effect of the statutory limitations upon contracts relating to personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">It has never been held that the expiration of the statute time for bringing an action to recover a debt, or to enforce any personal obligation, operated either an <em>extinguishment </em>or <em>payment. </em>Such a result cannot be derived from the language of our statute, the reason or policy of the law, or the decisions of courts in this State or elsewhere. The contrary has been often held ; and, by our established rules of pleading, the limitation must be specially pleaded or it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Ho action has been commenced upon the promissory note. The present plaintiff, however, who has transferred the legal title to the lands conveyed as security for the payment of an indebtedness, which has never been satisfied in whole or in part, comes into equity to ask that the sale by the trustees under the power conferred by his deed be enjoined, without tendering payment; but, on the contrary, (since he asks that the debt be held to be extinguished) boldly avowing his intention never to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">McKee, J., and Ross, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
