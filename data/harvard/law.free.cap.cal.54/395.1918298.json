After the filing of the remittitur, the case was tried on the merits, and resulted in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The complaint in this case alleges that, pending the appeal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that case, the defendant and his coplaintiff in the case of <em>Tully and Durkin </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>caused an execution to be issued in that case, and the property of plaintiff\u2019s testate sold under the same for the sum of $301.

That question was determined before this action was commenced, in an action in which said testate was plaintiff and the appellants defendants, in the Nineteenth District Court. The judgment rendered in that action must be held to be final and conclusive upon the points involved in it, whenever they arise in another action between the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Order denying a new trial affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Myrick, J., and Thornton, P.
