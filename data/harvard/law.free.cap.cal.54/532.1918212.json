The plaintiffs have brought themselves within this clause, and \u00a7 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This also defines nuisances, and declares them to be the \u201c subject of an action. Such action may be brought by any person whose property is injuriously affected, or whose personal enjoyment is lessened, by the nuisance.\u201d The case of <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>The North Pac. Trans. Co. </em>50 Cal. 592, is in point. See also Wood on Nuisance, \u00a7\u00a7 769, 779, 815, 829, 830. The case of <em>Blanc </em>v. <em>Klumpke, </em>29 Cal. 156, is also in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>Lake &amp; McCoon, </em>and <em>H.

The plaintiffs must show, therefore, that they will sustain some <em>special private </em>injury\u2014one peculiar to themselves, and not common to them and the public or many others. They do not show this. <em>(Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Cowen, 146; <em>Butler </em>v. Kent, 19 J. R. 223; <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Bunting, </em>1 Sand. Sup. Ct. 1; 2 Waite\u2019s Prac. 56; <em>Aram </em>v. <em>Schallenberger, </em>41 Cal. 449; <em>Market St. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cent. R. R.

Co. </em>16 Barb. 313.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b553-7\">Department No. 1, Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Plaintiffs, who are private persons, are the owners and in possession of a certain block of land fronting on Berry Street, in the City and County of San Francisco, and bring this action to enjoin defendants from constructing a street railroad in and upon said street. The only averment of injury to plaintiffs found in the complaint is the following: \u201c That the use and occupation of said street by defendants for the purpose of constructing and operating said railroad, as aforesaid, would cause great and irreparable injury to plaintiffs and their property, by reason of the constant obstruction and use of the said street by the said defendants, in front of plaintiffs\u2019 premises, as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The insufficiency of this pleading to show such special damage to plaintiffs as would enable them to maintain an action to enjoin the construction of a public nuisance, is obvious. <em>Facts </em>must be stated to show that the apprehension of injury is well founded. (Dillon on Mun. Cor. \u00a7 522, and authorities there cited; <em>Bigley </em>v. <em>Nunan, </em>53 Cal. 403; <em>George </em>v. <em>N. P. T. Co. </em>50 Id. 589; Civ. Code, \u00a7 3493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">For this reason, as well as for the reason that in the record we discover no abuse of discretion of the Court below in dissolving the preliminary injunction, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">McKinstey, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
