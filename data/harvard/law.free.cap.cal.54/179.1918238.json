That decree directed the entry of all the judgments. Then, subsequently, on the 8th of February, 1878, a motion was made for an order that they be entered as of the date when that decree was made\u2014the 5th of October\u2014and the order was made <em>nunc pro tunc.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-16\"><em>Mr. Mullaney, </em>for Appellant.\u2014 \u201cThe judgment is dated February 8th.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Department No. 1, Mr. Justice McKinstry, presiding:</author>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The judgment was, in fact, entered February 8th, 1878, and the notice of. appeal filed and served within the year prescribed by statute. The circumstance that the order was made <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, cannot affect the question. We all agree that the notice.of appeal was served within a year after-the entry of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Crittenden.\u2014\u201c My next point is, that there was no notice of appeal served in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Mullaney.\u2014\u201c I have here an affidavit of the serving of the notice of appeal by delivering it to the cleric at the office of the counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\"><em>Mr. </em>Crittenden.\u2014\u201c I have two affidavits that no service was made\u2014my own, and the affidavit of my clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Me.
