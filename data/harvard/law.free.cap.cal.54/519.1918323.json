The order for judgment was made on the 7th day of October, 1878, but the judgment was not entered until the 29th day of October, 1878, or twelve days after the service of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">Section 939 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c an appeal may be taken from the final judgment * * * within one year after the <em>entry </em>of the judgment.\u201d This appeal is from a final judgment. Prior to the adoption of the Code, \u00a7 336 of the Practice Art authorized an appeal to be taken from a final judgment \u201c within one year after the <em>rendition </em>of the judgment.\u201d In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>28 Cal. 416, this provision of the Practice Aft was.before this Court for a construction, and the Court in its opinion defined with precision and minuteness the distinction between the <em>rendition </em>and the <em>entry </em>of a final judgment within the meaning of that act. The distinction which the Court drew between the two was, that a judgment is <em>rendered </em>when ordered by the Court, and <em>entered </em>when actually entered in the judgment book. \u201cWe cannot,\u201d says the Court, \u201c resist the conclusion that the terms \u2018 rendition \u2019 and ' entry \u2019 are used in different senses, and to express the idea appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>to those words respectively.\u201d This decision was cited and approved afterward in many other cases by the same Court before the enactment of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Legislature must be presumed to have been familiar with these decisions, and to have had them in view when it changed the clause as above stated! It adopted the definitions which the Court had given to the two words, by substituting one for the other. It in effect enacted that thereafter an appeal must be taken within one year after the entry, instead of within one year after the <em>rendition </em>of a judgment; and that both the \u201c entry \u201d and \u201c rendition \u201d of a judgment had been correctly defined by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Unless we hold that the words \u201crendition\u201d and \u201centry\u201d mean one and the same thing, we must fix upon one or the other as the time after which an appeal may be taken. If a judgment is \u201c entered \u201d when \u201c rendered,\u201d within the meaning of the Code, then this appeal was taken after the <em>entry </em>of the judgment ; otherwise not. Section 936 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that \u201ca judgment or order- in a civil action, except when expressly made final by this Code, may be reviewed as prescribed in this title, <em>and not </em>otherwise.\u201d One of the requirements of that title is, that an appeal be taken \u201c within one year after the <em>entry </em>of the judgment.\u201d If we are correct in our view of what constitutes an entry of a judgment, this appeal was taken <em>before </em>and not <em>after </em>the entry, and therefore must be dismisged.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Myrick, J., and Thornton.
