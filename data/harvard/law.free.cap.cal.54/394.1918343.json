The case was tried by a jury. Plaintiff had judgment; defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied, and defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Three alleged errors are relied upon by appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-15\">1st. Plaintiff, being examined on his own behalf, was asked, \u201c How much of the Knickerbocker stock did defendant buy under your advice ? \u201d Defendant objected. The question was asked with the avowed object, not to claim anything for Knickerbocker stock, but to show the connection between the parties, and their relations and actions growing out of the contract alleged. The Court overruled the objection; no exception was taken. The answer, \u201c He bought some, he told me so,\u201d could not have prejudiced the defendant; on the contrary it might tend to show the relations of the parties, viz., that they were dealing in stocks, and it was therefore relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-16\">2nd. Question addressed to plaintiff: \u201c Did you obtain employment as purser on the steamship <em>Salvador, </em>on the 22nd day of August, 1874? \u201d Defendant objected; the objection was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>overruled; no exception taken. The answer was given, which was matter of inducement to the alleged contract. At a subsequent period in the trial, defendant moved to strike out the testimony, which motion was denied, and defendant excepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Even if the testimony had been irrelevant and immaterial, its retention is not ground for granting a new trial, unless it appear that the party was prejudiced by it. <em>(Tully </em>v. Harloe, 35 Cal. 302.) But we are of opinion that the testimony was relevant for the purpose for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">3rd. The third alleged error is, as to a question put to the witness Barney, on cross-examination. Defendant objected to the question, the objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. It does not appear from the transcript that the question was ever answered; neither does it appear but that the direct examination of the witness by the defendant laid a foundation for the question. No direct examination of the witness is in the tran-' script.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Thornton, P. J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
