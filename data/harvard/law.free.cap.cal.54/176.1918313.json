The day succeeding this being Saturday, and plaintiff being desirous of raising the house, he caused the necessary material for that purpose to he placed on the lot, with the intention of commencing work the following Monday morning. During the intervening Sunday night, the entry complained of was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The possession thus shown in plaintiff was sufficient to entitle him to maintain the action, and was not in any sense a scrambling possession, as contended by appellants. By a scrambling possession is meant a struggle for possession on the land itself\u2014not such a contest as is waged in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The papers in the actions of <em>Voll </em>v. <em>Walsh, Welton </em>v. <em>NcNear, </em>and <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>were properly excluded under objection on the part of plaintiff. None of those cases had any bearing upon the question in the present action, for the reason just suggested. The other objections, sought to be made to the rulings of the Court below, are' too vague and indefinite to be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">As respects the defendant Epstein, the evidence fails to connect him with either the forcible entry or forcible detainer. This was virtually conceded by respondent\u2019s counsel at the argument, but it was contended by them that Epstein\u2019s answer, in effect, admitted the forcible detainer, and that, therefore, no proof as to him was necessary. But Epstein\u2019s answer was the same as that of the other defendants\u2014all having answered together\u2014and plaintiff tried the case in the Court below upon the theory that the answer was sufficient to put in issue all of the material allegations of the complaint, and endeavored to prove Epstein\u2019s connection with the forcible entry and forcible detainer. Under such circumstances, it is the settled rule' that objection to the sufficiency of the pleading cannot be made for the first time in this Court. <em>(Cave </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>53 Cal. 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">It results, that the judgment and order must be affirmed as to all of the defendants except Epstein, and as to him the judgment and order must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">McKinstry, P. J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
