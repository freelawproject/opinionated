On April 9th, the amount was tendered to the plaintiff in person, but he declined to receive it; on the ground that it had not been paid on the '1st of April.

No formal election or notice was necessary to the continuance of the lease. <em>(Kramer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>7 Gray, 550; <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>1 Daly, 419.) The tenders were sufficient, (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1942)\u2014time not having been made the essence of the contract. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1442.) If the payment were to be construed as a condition precedent, the defendant would be entitled to relief from a forfeiture. <em>(Baxter </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>7 Paige, 350; <em>Haskett </em>v. <em>Alcock, </em>1 Call, 535; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Dayton, 2 </em>John.

When, therefore, the defendant in this action, as tenant under the lease from the plaintiff, made default in payment of the last installment of rent at the time it became due, and failed to perform the covenants of the lease as to payment of taxes and assessment liens, her possession of the leased premises, after the expiration of the term, did not operate as notice to plaintiff that she had elected to continue the term, nor did it work a renewal of the lease; for her right to renew depended upon the performance by her of her covenants in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Morrison, C.
