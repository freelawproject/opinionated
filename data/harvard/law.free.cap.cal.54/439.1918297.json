And it is charged that the defendant received as \u201c rent or compensation \u201d for the use of the property, large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>sums of money, of the amount of which plaintiff is ignorant, and he prays for an accounting and division of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"AFm\">Each, allegation of the complaint is specifically denied by the answer, and a special defense is also set up. The proofs on the trial establish these facts: That in June, 1873, one Conklin was owner of the \u201c circus property \u201d mentioned in the pleadings, and manager of a certain troupe or company of circus performers ; that by a bill of sale Conklin transferred the property to the parties in this action, as security for the payment to them of certain sums of money, which they had severally advanced to him. That they agreed with each other that defendant should take possession of the property, and transport it from place to place in the State of California, upon a performing tour, and receive or collect the income of the performances, and apply it, first of all, to the payment of money advanced by the plaintiff, and then to the payment of what he himself had advanced to Conklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Pursuant to this agreement, defendant took possession of the property; and, being a teamster, made a contract with Conklin for the transportation of the property, during the summer season of 1873, from place to place in the State of California, on a performing tour, under the direction of Conklin. Performances were given in various interior towns and cities of the State, at which the defendant collected or received $4,200; but he has failed and refused to account for or pay to the plaintiff any portion thereof. Upon these proofs the Court below rendered judgment against the defendant for the amount of money advanced by the plaintiff to Conklin, and interest thereon from the date of its advancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The bill of sale to the parties made them joint owners of the property <em>(Heyland </em>v. Badger, 35 Cal. 404); but a mere joint ownership in personal property does not constitute the owners partners. <em>(Post </em>v. Kimberly, 9 Johns. 470; <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>1 Gray, 289.) Nor did the agreement between them have that effect. A partnership is the association of two or more persons for the purpose of carrying on business together, and dividing its profits between them. (\u00a7 2,235 Civ. Code.) But plaintiff and defendant were not engaged in the circus business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>nor did they agree to carry it on. The- business belonged to Conklin <em>alone; </em>and in it the defendant used the joint property of himself and the plaintiff\u2014as he was authorized to use it in the business of any other circus manager\u2014upon the terms and conditions that <em>he </em>was to receive the income of the business from Conklin, for the payment of their claims against Conklin. Only to the extent of the income, or, as the pleader calls it, \u201c rent or compensation,\u201d receivable by the defendant, were they at all interested in the business; but an agreement to divide the income of a business does not create a <em>partnership; </em>therefore, when the defendant received the income, he did not receive it as a partner, but as a trustee; and he held so much of it as was necessary to pay the plaintiff\u2019s demand against Conklin, in trust for that purpose, and it was his duty to account for it to the plaintiff; failing in <em>that, </em>the plaintiff had a right to compel him to account for so much of it as came into his hands for the purpose of discharging his trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The character of the agreement between them, as set forth in the complaint, and that proved at the trial, made an account necessary to determine the respective rights of the parties. <em>(Gar </em>v. Redman, 6 Cal. 576.) And while there is some difference between the agreement as stated in the complaint, and that proven at the trial, yet the variance is not material. It is one which could not have misled or surprised the defendant to his prejudice in maintaining his defense upon the merits. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 469; <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>20 Cal. 590; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>O'Reilly, </em>32 Ind. 14; <em>Woolcott </em>v. <em>Meach, </em>22 Barb. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Boss, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
