This is an action upon a promissory note signed by Fanny Baber and A. J. Baber, who were husband and wife. The note is dated March 12th, 1874. There is an indorser. The Court below rendered judgment against all the defendants; and on motion granted a new trial as to Fanny Baber, on the ground that she was a married woman at the time the note was executed, and not liable thereon. From this order plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">. At the time the note was executed, \u00a7 167 of the Civil Code read <em>thus: \u201c </em>A wife -cannot make a contract for the payment of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">. The effect of this section is claimed to be modified by \u00a7\u00a7 158, 159, 162, 171, and 1556, Civil Code, and \u00a7 370, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">We do not see that the sections referred to at all modify \u00a7 167. Those'sections refer to property, and authorize the wife to make contracts relating thereto, and to pursue her remedy, in cases where theretofore she had not the power to act by herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">It is true that under \u00a7 17, Code of Civil Procedure, the words \u201c personal property \u201d include money; which is claimed to place money within \u00a7 158 of the Civil Code, and so authorize a married woman to make a contract in reference to <em>money\u2014i. e., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>to \"pay money; but as \u00a7 167, as above quoted, refers to that very subject, directly, it will prevail over any inference that might otherwise be drawn from other sections, and withdraws money from the effect of the word property, as used in \u00a7 158, Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We are of opinion that during the time \u00a7 167, as above quoted, was in force, she had no power to execute the note in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Thornton, P. J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
