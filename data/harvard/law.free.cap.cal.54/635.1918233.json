The demurrer was sustained; and plaintiff failing to amend, judgment went for defendants, and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On the argument we were informed by respondent that he seeks to sustain the ruling of the Court below on the demurrer, and claims that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">1st. That the plaintiff claims that he is entitled to the possession of the crop of grain \u201c by virtue of certain conveyances and instruments duly recorded,\u201d and does not annex the originals or copies, or incorporate them in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">2nd. The instruments were brought into Court under defendant\u2019s plea of oyer, and on plaintiff failing to incorporate them in his complaint, defendants had a right to make them part of the pleading, and demur if a material variance appeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">3rd. As there is a material variance between the complaint and the instruments, as appears therefrom on their being produced, defendants may demur to plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">As to the first point, plaintiff does not declare on the instruments, but alleges possession, which is sufficient, without stating the means by which he had possession. The allegations relate to the instruments, and are surplusage in a pleading, though the instruments may be evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">As to the second and third points, we are not advised by the transcript that any proceedings for <em>oyer </em>were had, nor that the instruments tvere produced, nor that there was any variance. Neither does it appear to us how questions of that character could be raised on demurrer to a complaint, where, as in this case, the plaintiff does not count on the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded to the Superior Court of Kern County, with instructions to overrule the demurrer, with leave to defendants to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Thornton, P. J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
