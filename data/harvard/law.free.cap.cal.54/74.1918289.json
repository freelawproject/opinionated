The last section of that title provides, that the title is applicable to natural persons as well as to corporations. The occupation and use of the same street by two or more railroad corporations for a distance of more than five blocks being forbidden, it follows that the Mayor and Common Council had no authority to pass the ordinance in question, granting to the defendants the right to lay down a railroad track as therein mentioned, which exceeded the distance of five blocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The section just above cited (\u00a7 499) differs materially from the first section of the Act of March 29th, 1870, (Statutes 1869-70, p. 481) which was construed in <em>O. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>O. B. &amp; F. V. R. R. Co. </em>45 Cal. 378. The proviso to that section does not forbid, as does \u00a7 499, the occupation and use of the <em>same street </em>by two corporations for a distance of more than five blocks, but merely forbids the use of the same track by two. companies \u201cfor more than five blocks in all.\u201d The construction of that section, as laid down in that case, has no application to \u25a0 the section of the Civil Code above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Order dissolving the injunction reversed.
