Plunket, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-15\">The controlling question in this case is, whether premises invested with the character of a homestead before judgment, but after the levy of an attachment thereon, are subject to execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>tion or forced sale where the judgment is not obtained in any of the cases mentioned in Civil Code, \u00a7 1241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">By Civil Code, \u00a7 1240, the homestead is exempt from execution or forced sale except as otherwise provided in the same title. The exceptions are contained in Civil Code, \u00a7 1241, and the case of respondents does not come under any of them. By Civil Code, \u00a7 1265, it is expressly provided that, except in the cases above specified, the homestead \u201c <em>in no case </em>\u201d shall be liable for the debts of the owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">The judgment cannot be a lien upon the homestead. The statute provides that it shall become a lien only on property not exempt from execution. <em>(Ackley </em>v. Chamberlain, 16 Cal. 181-3; <em>Bowman </em>v. Norton, Id. 220; Civil Code, \u00a7 1241.) A judgment does not relate back to the date-of the attachment, where a declaration of homestead is filed after the attachment, but before the judgment. (Smythe\u2019s Homesteads and Exemptions, p. 178, \u00a7 198; <em>Hawthorne </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Nev. 185; Civil Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1240-1241, 1265; <em>McCracken </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>54 Cal. 81.) In Mississippi it has been decided that premises liable to sale <em>at the date </em>of the judgment can be impressed with the rights of a homestead before levy or sale. <em>(Trotter </em>v. <em>Dobbs et ux. </em>38 Miss. 198; <em>Lesley </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>49 Id. 790.) <em>A fortiori, </em>property can be impressed with the character of a homestead <em>before judgment, </em>as in this case. The Constitution seems to empower the Legislature to authorize a declaration of homestead to be made at any time before sale. (Const. [old] art. xi, \u00a7 15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-7\"><em>T. F.
