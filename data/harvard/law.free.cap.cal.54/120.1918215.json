Some evidence had already been given in the case, regarding the acts of defendants and Euphrit in obtaining the property now in-dispute, tending to show a fraudulent combination between them for that purpose, and that evidence, with the evidence offered, the plaintiff was entitled to have submitted to the jury. <em>(Wiggin </em>v. <em>Day, </em>9 Gray, 97; <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>12 Pick. 306; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>16 Conn. 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Court erred in sustaining the objection, in granting the nonsuit, and in refusing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Judgment and order refusing new trial reversed, and the Court below directed to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Thornton, P.
