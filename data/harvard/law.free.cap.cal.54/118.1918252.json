Even when\u2014in the case of excessive damages\u2014he is prepared to show that the excess indicates passion or prejudice, in such case, he may rely upon either one of these two grounds: that the evidence does not sustain the verdiet, or that the verdict is the result of passion or prejudice. Further, we are of opinion that this bill of exceptions contains a sufficient specification of the particulars, in which the evidence is claimed to be insufficient. And we add\u2014there being a substantial conflict in the evidence upon the main issues submitted to the jury\u2014we will pursue in this case the established rule, winch is, where such conflict appears, to sustain the action of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Court having granted a new trial, the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
