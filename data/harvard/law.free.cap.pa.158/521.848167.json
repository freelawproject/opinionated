Allegheny Co., May T., 1893, No. 68, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AGO\">Before Sterrett, C.

There is also in the possession of the administrator for distribution an Allegheny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>county riot bond, appraised at $1,040. Alex. R. Grade, the husband of the decedent, alleges that the money deposited by her was his, that the bond was purchased with his money, and claims it and the whole fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-4\">\u201c The deposits in the Dollar and Real Estate Savings Banks were all made more than six years prior to the decedent\u2019s death, and it is contended that as to them the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Whilst the claimant stands in the position of a creditor of his wife\u2019s estate, McDermott v. Miners\u2019 Sav. Bk., 100 Pa. St. 288, yet the same disability, to wit, the unity of persons which prevents a wife from maintaining an action against her husband, Marsteller v. Marsteller, 93 Pa. 350, would also prevent a husband from maintaining an action against his wife. His remedy was therefore postponed until her death; the statute would not begin to run until then, and his claim is consequently not barred by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">\u201c For the purpose of showing that the moneys deposited in bank belonged to the claimant, he proved declarations made by his wife to different persons to the effect that it belonged to her husband, and also offered a testamentary paper in her handwriting, dated February 11, 1875, in which she provided as follows: \u2018 The money I have in my name in the Dollar Savings Bank is money belonging to my beloved husband, for it is his hard earning, therefore it is all his and I wish him to have it all. And the money I have in my name in the Real Estate Savings Bank is\u2019all his; he always gave me the money and I saved it for him and it is all his hard earnings; also the mortgage which I hold in my name against George Bauman, also is the money which my beloved husband worked hard for and gave it to me to buy the mortgage and let me have it in my name and I wish him to have it all.\u2019 This paper was signed by the decedent and witnessed by a domestic living with her at the time; but when it was found after her death her signature was torn off; for this reason it was objected to as incompetent evidence. Whilst it could not take effect as a will, there is no apparent reason, it being in the handwriting of the decedent, why it is not competent proof of her declaration. It is conceded that oral proof can be made of them and we have much better proof, to wit, written evidence. This paper, in connection with the other evidence in the case, shows very sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>isfactorily that all the moneys deposited in the Dollar and Real Estate Savings Banks, prior to February 11, 1875, belonged to the claimant. The only deposit made after that date in either was one of $1,267, on September 18, 1879, in the Dollar Savings Bank. The evidence, however, shows that this was a transfer from the account of George Gracie, son of the claimant, of moneys which he had deposited for his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\">\u201c It is clear therefore that the money here for distribution arising from the deposits in these banks belonged to the claimant. If then he did not intend to make a gift of it to his wife, his claim as to these deposits must be sustained. He was for a number of years steadily employed as manager of oil refineries in the suburbs of the city, where he resided, and it was inconvenient for him to visit the banks. He gave his wages to his wife, who deposited them, and seems to have attended to all outside business for him. She gave as reasons for depositing it in her name to one witness, \u2018 Because Mr. Gracie was not much of a business man; \u2019 \u2018 that he never had time to go with it.\u2019 To another, \u2018 that Mr. Gracie had no business qualities, and she had to attend to this money and look after it, and if she didn\u2019t attend to this business that they would have nothing in no time.\u2019 There is no evidence that she ever claimed these deposits as her own, but both in her oral and written declarations she acknowledged it was his money, and in her writing expressly states that she saved it for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">\u201c The evidence is sufficient to rebut any presumption of gift, and is much stronger than that adduced in McDermott\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 358, where a husband\u2019s claim against his wife\u2019s estate for money deposited in her name was sustained. His claim must therefore be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">\u201c The only evidence as to the Allegheny county riot bond is that of George Gracie, son of the claimant; he testified that the decedent, who was his stepmother, told him that she purchased this bond with her husband\u2019s money, and that he understood from her that it belonged to him. Whilst the evidence as to the claimant\u2019s right to it is not as satisfactory as to the deposits, yet taking it in connection with all the circumstances of the case, it seems sufficient to establish his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">\u201c On the death of the decedent\u2019s father in 1872, she inherited one-fifth interest in a house and lot on Fourth avenue, and in 1875 she purchased with her husband\u2019s money the other four-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>fifths interest, and also a ground rent, the title being taken in her name. The net rental of this property was probably four hundred dollars per jmar. The claimant was not employed for some years prior to his wife\u2019s death, and no doubt a portion of the rents were applied to the support of the family. The deposits in the bank of Pittsburgh were all made subsequently to 1875, and probably some of the rents were included in them. The balance in this bank, however, was only $349, not sufficient to pay the expenses charged in the account for the administration of her estate. And as the fund for distribution is not sufficient to pay the amount found to be due the claimant, irrespective of his claims, for these deposits, it is not necessary to pass upon the questions raised as to them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-4\">The court awarded the whole fund to claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">Exceptions by appellant to the adjudication were dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\"><em>Prrors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-7\"><em>George P. </em>Hamilton, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay1\">cited: Braman\u2019s Ap., 89 Pa. 78; 2 Wood on Limitations, p. 580; Marsteller v.
