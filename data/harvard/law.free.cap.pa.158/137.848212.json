J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">\u201c The borough of Butler is under the borough act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320. In pursuance of said act the town council passed and the burgess duly approved, on April 3, 1887, the ordinance offered in evidence carrying into effect, in said borough, section 2, clause 9, of said act: \u2018 To prohibit and otherwise regulate the running at large of horses, cattle, etc., and to authorize their seizure and sale for the benefit of the borough.\u2019 Defendant was, on May 31, 1892, high constable, in and for said borough, duly elected and qualified. This ordinance, in its provisions, is reasonable and for the common good and not in restraint of trade, nor imposing a burden without an apparent benefit. This \u2018 yellow cow \u2019 was, on May 31,1892, running at. large in the borough of Butler in violation of the provisions of said ordinance. Defendant found this \u2018 yellow cow\u2019 running at large in the borough of Butler in violation of the provisions of said ordinance on May 31,1892, about noon of said day, and seized and impounded her as required of him by section 2 of said ordinance. Therefore this \u2018 yellow cow,\u2019 the property of plaintiff, at the time of replevin was in the lawful custody of defendant. There can be no doubt that the defendant was an officer \u2018 acting in his office under the authority of the state,\u2019 within the provisions of the act of April 3,1779, 1 Sm. L. 470, and the writ of replevin, therefore, issued in this case, was irregular, erroneous and void: Pott v. Oldwine, 7 Watts, 173. The plaintiff cannot set up that the seizure was illegal. His proper remedy was an action of trespass: Stiles v. Griffith, 3 Yeates, 82; Elkins v. Griesemer, 2 Penny. 52. Therefore, it follows that this motion must be sustained and this <em>writ </em>quashed, and defendant awarded treble costs, under the provisions of act of April 3, 1779, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">\u201c And now, March 29,1893, upon due consideration, motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>sustained and writ of replevin quashed, and treble costs awarded o the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">The ordinance provided in \u00a7 1, that \u201c it shall not be lawful for any person or persons to permit the following named animals to be or run at large within the limits of the borough of Butler,\u201d and names cows as within the prohibited class. Section 2 authorized the high constable to seize and impound all animals running at large in violation of the first section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">The evidence showed that the cow had been turned out of plaintiff\u2019s field by some one breaking open a gate without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-7\"><em>James M. Galbreath, Clarence Walker </em>with him, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alt\">\u2014 The ordinance was not violated, as plaintiff did not permit his cow to run at large.

Oldwine, 7 Watts, 173; Elkins v. Griesemer, 2 Penny. 52; Stiles v. Griffith, 3 Yeates, 82; Zane\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. Cowperthwaite, 1 Dall. 312; Shaw v.

The constable could not be expected to know how the cow escaped. He found her straying in the streets and it was his duty to impound her. As a matter of course he was an officer acting under the authority of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
