A second well was to be completed within two years, and in case of failure to complete the well within two years, the lessee was to pay a certain sum or forfeit the lease. In an action to recover the penalties for not completing either of the wells provided for in the lease, defendant filed an affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of defence, in which he averred that from drilling wells in the vicinity it was found that there was no oil or gas in plaintiff\u2019s farm, and that therefore no wells had been put down, and that the lease became void and of no effect. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit was insufficient to prevent judgment.

Gas Co., 145 Pa. 430, and Leatherman v. Oliver, 151 Pa. 646. The manifest purpose of the lease was to test the demised premises for oil and gas purposes by putting down two wells thereon. This was not done, nor was it even attempted. If it was intended that a test of the leased premises might be made by putting down wells outside thereof, the defendant should have protected himself by a stipulation in the lease to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
