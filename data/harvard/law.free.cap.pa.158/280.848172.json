Magee &amp; Co., from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., June T., 1890, No. 840, on verdict for plaintiff, Clarence Reisinger.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxRL\">Before Sterrett, C.

It also omitted the charge of the court in the order required by Rule 17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-12\">From plaintiff\u2019s statement as printed in appellee\u2019s paper book it appeared that plaintiff claimed to recover a balance due on sale of lease. A note for $600 had been given for the amount by Howard, an accommodation maker, but the note had been lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-13\">The court charged in part as follows by Collier, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-14\">\u201c The first money was paid and a note was given for the balance, which has been lost. They now sue upon the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>contract as if the dealings were between these parties originally, and they have a right to do that; and it is totally immaterial whether the note was protested or not, as far as the defendants, Magee &amp; Co., are concerned. If a verdict is given against them here, there is no likelihood of their having to pay that note in the hands of an innocent party who got it before maturity. The court will protect them by compelling the plaintiff in court to file a bond of indemnity to protect the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\">Defendant\u2019s points, which were refused, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">\u201c 1. The plaintiff is not entitled to judgment under the evidence, for the reason that he has not filed a copy of the note sued on in this case with his statement of claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">\u201c 2. That he is not entitled to judgment, nor can he recover in this action, because he has not produced the original note nor a copy of the same on the trial of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">\u201c 3. That if the jury should find for the plaintiff it can only be for the principal without interest, as there is no evidence in the case to show that a bond of indemnity was ever tendered defendant before suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">\u201c 4. James Howard, Jr., being the maker, and E. Magee &amp; Co. the indorsers in this lost note, there can be no recovery as against the defendants in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-8\">\u201c 5. Under the evidence in this case, the verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $749.40.

For that reason alone plaintiff would be entitled to an affirmance of the judgment. But waiving that, there appears to be nothing in either of the specifications of error that would warrant a reversal. From the statement of claim, \u2014 supplied by the appellee, \u2014 and the charge of the learned trial judge, it appears that the suit is for balance purchase money due on sale of the coal yard lease referred to in the testimony. It also appears that said balance is represented by the note alleged to have been lost; but the court can so control the execution as to amply protect the defendants against the collection of said note by innocent holders for value. This may be done by restraining the execution until they are sufficiently indemnified by plaintiff, or until they are fully protected by the bar of the statute. According to the evidence, the note was at six months from June 3, 1887, and will therefore be barred by the statute of limitations in a few weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The verdict was warranted by the testimony, and there appears to be nothing in the record that requires a reversal of the judgment entered thereon. The court below, on application of defendants, will see that they are properly indemnified, or otherwise protected against the outstanding note.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Judgment affirmed, with stay of execution until leave to issue the same is granted by the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
