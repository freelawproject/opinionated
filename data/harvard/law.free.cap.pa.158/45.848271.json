J7</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">From the record it appeared that, on Oct. 10, 1890, J. A. Waterhouse purchased certain lands from plaintiffs, and gave a mortgage to secure balance of purchase money. The Fredonia National Bank took a second mortgage on the same premises. In September, 1891, T. D. Collins bought and took a conveyance of the timber on the mortgaged premises from Waterhouse. The bank consented to this sale of the timber, and received the purchase money from it. Subsequently the owners of the first mortgage obtained a judgment, which was subsequently assigned to the bank. Execution was issued and the land was sold to the cashier of the bank. On Jan. 17, 1893, Collins procured the sale to be set aside, on giving bond to increase the bid at the next sale. The court also directed as follows : \u201c It is further ordered that if the above conditions be complied with, that on a resale the sheriff shall first offer the land, reserving the timber sold to the petitioner, and shall not sell said timber unless it be necessary to do so to satisfy liens in his hands.\u201d On Feb. 27, 1893, the court vacated the portion of the order quoted above. On Sept. 1, 1893, the court refused to grant a rule to open the judgment and stay proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\"><em>Frrors assigned </em>were (1) in vacating above order; (2, 3) in not granting rule to open judgment, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\"><em>Samuel T. </em>Neill, <em>T.

L. 326; act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 534; Arna\u2019s Ap., 65 Pa. 72; Phelps\u2019s Ap., 98 Pa. 546.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AM4\">October 30, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A2x\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We must assume, as it is averred by appellant, and not denied by plaintiff, that the bank as holder of the second mortgage consented to the sale of the timber by the mortgagor to appellant, and accepted the purchase money. This was equivalent to a releasfe of the timber from the lien of its mortgage, and it has now no right to levy upon or sell the timber under that mortgage. It is precisely analogous to the release of a portion of the mortgaged premises. Its claim against such released portion is gone, and as against an intervening purchaser cannot be revived. But Pratt and Phillips had the first lien, on the timber as well as the land, and it is claimed that the bank by purchasing their judgment acquired all their rights. This, as an ultimate right, to obtain satisfaction of the judgment, may be conceded, but it cannot be used to obtain payment of the bank\u2019s original second mortgage out of the timber which it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>released from that lien. The appellant\u2019s petition presents a clear case for the equitable control of the order of execution, on the principles established in the line of cases from Mevey\u2019s Appeal, 4 Pa. 80, to Martin\u2019s Appeal, 97 Pa. 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Nor is the appellant limited as the appellee argues to a proceeding under the act of 22 April, 1856, sec. 9, P. L. 534. The purpose of that act was to provide a speedy and effectual process for certain clear cases of equitable rights of terre tenants and vendees, without interference with the rights of the judgment plaintiff. The latter has, says Sharswood, J., in Arna\u2019s Appeal, 65 Pa. 72, \u201can unquestionable judgment against all the lands of his debtor, the defendant. He has a right to proceed against any part. He cannot, in law or equity, be obliged to wait until the terre tenants have settled their equities between themselves.\u201d It was accordingly held in that case that the plaintiff must be presented with the alternative either to levy his execution in the order directed by the court, or to accept his debt and assign his judgment to the terre tenant having an equity of subrogation. What is said in that ease, and in Phelps\u2019s Appeal, 98 Pa. 546, as to the exclusiveness of the remedy under this statute, and the application of the act of 21 March, 1806, must be limited strictly to the cases then in hand. This was expressly held in Milligan\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 503, where it was said that the act of 1856 \u201c did not give the equity, or the right to substitution. It provides merely the mode of enforcing such right in-certain cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">It is well settled that the jurisdiction of equity is not taken away by the subsequent establishment of a remedy in the courts of law. This is the recognized rule in Pennsylvania, Wesley Church v. Moore, 10 Pa. 273; and notwithstanding the act of 1806, remedies at law and in equity may co-exist, and be con current and at the election of the plaintiff. Aycinena v. Peries, 6 W. &amp; S. 243, 257; Biddle v. Moore, 3 Pa. 161, 176; Church v. Ruland, 64 Pa. 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">This is not a case where the plaintiff is entitled to have a tender of his whole debt, as an alternative to the court\u2019s control of his execution. Such privilege under the act of 1856 is confined to the cases described by Sharswood, J., in Arna\u2019s Appeal, supra, where the plaintiff has a clear right to proceed against any part of the debtor\u2019s land, and the equity arises be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tween the terre tenants without any fault of Ms. It may be conceded that Pratt and Phillips, having done nothing to raise any equity to the contrary, had such right against the appellant, but when the bank bought their judgment it bought subject to the equity which its own act had raised as to the timber. Having released that fz-om the lien of the second moz-tgage, the bank cannot now enforce that liezi thz-ough its present ownership of the prior judgment. Should it be necessary for the payment of that judgment to sell the timber, it may be done, but not otherwise. If the land alone will produce enough to pay that first incumbrance, then the timber is released.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">Thez-e does ziot appear to be aziy dispute as to the facts, and therefore no need to open the judgment. The relief desired can be obtained by controlling the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The order of February 27, 1893, vacating a portion of the order of January 17, 1893, is reversed, and the order of Jaziuary 17, 1893, directing the sheriff to first offer the land, reserving the timber, etc., is reizistated and affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellee, the Fredonia National Bank.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
