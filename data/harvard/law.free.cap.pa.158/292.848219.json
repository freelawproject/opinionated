T., 1890, No. <em>4, </em>dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in partition in estate of Henry Donaldson, deceased.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A37V\">Before Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Thompson, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">Petition for partition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The case was referred to William M. McGill, Esq., as auditor, who reported the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">Henry Donaldson died March 28,1890, intestate, unmarried, and without issue, leaving both real and personal estate ; and leaving to survive him, as his heirs at law, two sisters, a brother William, and children of a deceased brother. \u201e Prior to this, William Donaldson had been indebted to R. J. Potter, which indebtedness had been in part reduced to judgment. Within a few days after the death of Henry Donaldson, R. J. Potter issued execution upon his judgment, and bought at sheriff\u2019s sale all the right, title and interest of William Donaldson in the real estate of Henry Donaldson, deceased, which interest was an undivided one fourth. It was claimed, however, by the other heirs, that at the time of Henry Donaldson\u2019s death, and for some years prior thereto, William Donaldson had been and was indebted to him; and at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale under the judgment of Potter, the question was raised by the other heirs of Henry Donaldson as to the right or equity of the estate to charge, against the share of William Donaldson, his indebtedness to the estate ; and with a view to the preservation of such right or equity, if any existed, notice was given at the sheriff\u2019s sale that the interest of William Donaldson was \u201c to remain and be subject in the hands of the purchaser, and his heirs and assigns, in like manner and to like extent,.as while in the hands of the said William Donaldson, to the right or equity, if any there be, of the estate of Henry Donaldson, deceased, to have charged against the said one fourth, as for an advancement, the indebtedness of the said William Donaldson to said estate.\u201d This notice was attached to the sheriff\u2019s return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of sale and made part thereof. Proceedings in partition were subsequently begun and carried forward, and in these proceedings Potter was recognized as the vendee of the interest of William Donaldson in this estate, and as such he appeared and bid in one of the purparts into which the real estate was divided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">The auditor, appointed to ascertain liens, etc., found that the evidence failed to establish that there had been a gift by Henry to William of the latter\u2019s indebtedness. He accordingly reported that the indebtedness was a lien upon William\u2019s share, and that this share passed to the sheriff\u2019s vendee, subject to the lien of these debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were dismissed by the court in the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">\u201c (1) It cannot be said that the auditor committed plain error in his finding of facts. The witnesses were before him, and their credibility was for him. There is evidence to justify his finding. Assuming his finding to be correct, his conclusions of law follow logically. The share of William Donaldson is certainly subject to the equity of payment of his indebtedness to Henry Donaldson, through whom he derived title as heir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">\u201c (2) The adjustment of the indebtedness in the present proceedings in partition is necessary to complete relief. That indebtedness is in fact a part of the estate of Henry Donaldson, deceased, and the sheriff\u2019s vendee of William Donaldson\u2019s share as an heir of Henry Donaldson in the land which is the subject of partition, bought expressly subject to the equity of its payment, and consequently bought what was left after its deduction. The equity of payment ran with the land, and its adjustment here is necessary to equality of partition. Even assuming personal liability for its payment, why resort to circuity of action ?

Walker, 150 Pa. 585.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">\u201c The parties and the subject-matter are within the jurisdiction of this court, and that jurisdiction must be made effectual for complete relief: Shollenberger\u2019s Appeal, 21 Pa. 337.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">Feb. 8, 1893, decree entered as recommended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-10\"><em>Errors'assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, quoting them; and in entering decree charging appellant\u2019s purpart with William Donaldson\u2019s debts to decedent\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>W.
