T., 1886; that Fourth street is a street in the \u201c General Plan of Verona Borough \u201d approved by councils (of said Verona Borough) Sept. 11,1872, being the plan referred to in the act of April 22,1873, entitled \u201cAn act authorizing the borough of Verona, in the county of Allegheny, to open any part or parts of streets,\u201d said Fourth street being entirely within the limits of Oakmont borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">\u201c That the town council of Oakmont borough, by ordinance passed February 29, 1892, and recorded in the Ordinance Book of said borough, provided for the opening of a part of said street, to wit, that portion lying between E and G streets, both being open and used as public highways.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">\u201c That said ordinance was published in one newspaper published in said county, and by at least twelve copies thereof put up in as many of the most public places of said borough of Oakmont more than ten days before the signing of this application, a copy of which ordinance is hereto attached and part hereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-10\">\u201c That said Fourth street is located between Railroad avenue and Fifth street in said borough.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-11\">Viewers, duly appointed, reported in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201c That in pursuance of said order, after due and timely notice, according to law, the viewers met, on the premises described in the said order and in the petition, filed on June 2, 1892, and after being duly sworn, proceeded to view said premises, having prior thereto given due and legal notice to all persons interested and the owners of property, or lots or parts of lots, adjacent to said street, and thereupon proceeded to view the said property, located between E street and G street, and the location of that portion of Fourth street proposed to be opened over the same ; and that, thereupon, having made the said view, as aforesaid, and having had regard to both the advantages and disadvantages caused to the several properties along the line of and adjoining the said street proposed to be opened, from, or by reason of, the opening of the said Fourth street, from E street to G street, we are of the opinion and so report, that the property of Salinda Anderson is injured thereby in the amount of two hundred dollars, and we do hereby assess the damages to the said Salinda Anderson at the sum of two hundred dollars by reason of the opening of said street, as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">\u201c We further proceeded to ascertain the names of all owners of lots, or parts of lots, which may be benefited, or be increased in value, and which are adjacent to the said Fourth street, and find that no property adjacent to the said street is benefited or increased in value over and above all disadvantages by the opening of the said street, except the property of which M.

That said Fourth street, between E and G streets, was laid out in 1872, and dedicated to the public by Peter Bright, recorded Nov. 13, 1872, in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county.

A. Diamond, another viewer, owned property at the time of the appraisement on Fourth street on the line of improvement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\u201c That damages assessed in favor of Salinda Anderson, namely, two hundred dollars (|200) are grossly inadequate and unjust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201cThat said Margaret J. Anderson and E. B. McAbee, two of the petitioners, had no notice of the proceedings of viewers, written or otherwise, and did not learn of the same until April, 1893.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\">\u201c That said Fourth street, as laid out and reported by said viewers in accordance with original plan of Verona, includes twenty-five feet of Fourth street, as dedicated by said Peter Bright\u2019s heirs and used by the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-10\">\u201c That no damages have been paid under said report of viewers, nor has any attempt been yet made to open the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-11\">\u201c That said Fourth street, as dedicated and used by the public, and as now used, has never been vacated; nor has there ever been a petition filed to have the same vacated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-12\">\u201c That the viewers have filed no draft or plan of the street proposed to be opened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-13\">\u201c That the records show that the ordinance was only published in one newspaper, and notice of the same should have been published in two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-14\">\u201c That the borough of Oakmont has no general plan or map.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-15\">\u201c That Fourth street is not a street by any plan of Oakmont borough, and was never adopted as a street by the borough of Oakmont.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cThat the act of assembly of 1873, being a special act for the borough of Yerona, will not apply to the borough of Oakmont.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-5\">\u201c Wherefore, the petitioners claim the proceedings at No. 73 March term, 1892, to be illegal, and pray the court to grant a rule to show cause why the same should not be vacated, set aside and quashed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">The borough filed an answer, denying that the street alleged to have been dedicated by the heirs of Peter Bright had ever been accepted by the authorities, and also denying the material averments of the petition.

W. </em>Kinnear, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABA\">\u2014 The notice to owners was insufficient: Trickett Borough Law, \u00a7 225, p. 281; Taylor Avenue, 146 Pa. 638; Central R. R. of New Jersey\u2019s Ap., 102 Pa. 38; Plumcreek Township, 110 Pa. 547; Act of April 3, 1851, \u00a7 7, art. 3, P. L. 320.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-9\">As no plan was attached to the report, the proceedings were irregular: Act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75; April 3, 1851, P. L. 320; Hanover Borough\u2019s Ap., 150 Pa. 202.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-10\">The system provided by the act of 1891 for opening streets seems entirely inconsistent with the system of the act of 1856.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-11\">When there is evidence of an express dedication a much less length of user by the public is needed to justify the inference of an acceptance by the public than where there has been mere user without evidence of expressed dedication: Com. v. Moorehead, 118 Pa. 352; Noble Street, 5 Whart. 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-12\">The act of April 21, 1873, validating the plan of Yerona borough was not such legislation as would make the various unopened streets binding on the property owners and territorial in application until said borough passed some ordinance adopting the street as a public street, and opening the same, or until damages had been assessed on account of said street.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-13\"><em>J. P. </em>Hunter, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdJ7\">\u2014 The plan of Yerona borough was sufficient to sustain the proceedings: Verona Borough\u2019s Ap., 108 Pa. 83; C Street, Verona Boro., 118 Pa. 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>This plan was, long prior to the erection of Oakmont borough, filed in the office of the clerk of quarter sessions, and therefore it is difficult to understand the necessity of an additional plan every time a street is to be opened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-4\">The decree of the quarter sessions erecting the borough of Oakmont does not repeal the provisions of the act of April 21, 1873, P. L. 824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">The court cannot legislate, and territory once made the objects of legislation remains subject to the law imposed : Parsons v. Winslow, 1 Grant, 160; Lackawanna Co. v. Stevens, 105 Pa. 466; Irwin v. McCallin, 28 Pitts. L. J. 322; Crawford Co. v. Meadville, 101 Pa. 573.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-6\">The decree of confirmation of the report is a final adjudication of the question of notice, and all matters of fact involving the merits : Road in South Abington, 109 Pa. 122; Sheridan Ave. in Bellevue, 138 Pa. 264; Plumcreek Twp. Road, 110 Pa. 547; Road in Lower Merion, 18 Pa. 238 ; Road in Springdale Tp., 91 Pa. 260.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-7\">Counsel, on authority of Taylor Avenue, 146 Pa. 638, insist that notice of the proposition of the laying out of the street must be given as provided by the act of 1851, but his argument ignores the fact that this is not a street ordained and enacted under the act of 1851, on the contrary it is a street ordained and enacted under the special act of 1873.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-8\">Under the act of 1851, council had power to ordain, enact and provide for the street; the opening was under the general road law of 1836. This was changed by the act of 1856: Parkesburg Borough Streets, 124 Pa. 523.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-9\">The alleged street in the Bright plan does not conform to this general plan, but is about twenty-five feet further east, overlapping the street proposed. The effect of the opening of the street according to the Bright plan would be that, at either end of the Anderson property, there would be an offset of twenty-five feet. The question as to its being a public highway was adjudicated against the position now urged by appellant, and that adjudication remains unappealed from and unreversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-10\">The act of April 22, 1856, Purd. Dig. 212, P. L. 527, is not repealed by the act of May 16, 1891: Hand v. Fellows, 148 Pa. 456; McCall v. Coates, 148 Pa. 462; Hanover Borough\u2019s Ap., 150 Pa. 203.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOSY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>November 13, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b499-4\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We find nothing in this record that calls for a reversal of the decree of the court below.
