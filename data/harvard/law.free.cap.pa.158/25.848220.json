If, therefore, in the above case the deceased was in the stable with intent to steal.the harness, he had committed a felony, though the actual larceny was not completed, and the right of the prisoner to pursue and arrest him must be determined as in cases of felony actually committed, not of a felony attempted but abandoned by a fleeing criminal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b49-11\"><em>Credibility of defendant </em>\u2014 Charge <em>of court.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b49-12\">On the trial of an indictment for murder it is improper to char\u2019ge: \u201c The defendant is, of course, most deeply interested in your determination, and just so far as he fails in being substantiated and corroborated by other testimony in the case, or facts in the ease, and that interest and feeling would bias him or prejudice him in giving his testimony, so far would you be warranted in discrediting that testimony.\u201d</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b49-13\">Argued Oct. 3, 1893.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_\">Appeal, No. 59, Oct.

Defendant testified in substance that on the night in question he saw from his bedroom window some person ride out of South alley toward his stable, from the direction of Morgan street, and in a very few moments after, he saw a flash of light in his stable, as if some person was striking matches there \u2014 that he hastily dressed himself, seized his revolver,-and went around his lot and the house of Elza Spragg, .up Whiskey alley, and through the cracks in the weatherboarding of his stable, saw a man inside the stable examining his harness by the light of matches which he was striking for the purpose. That he passed around the stable coming to the double door at the north side where he found the door open, and, as he stepped to the door the person inside the stable came to the door with a set of harness on his arm\u2014 that the man meeting defendant at the door, dropped the harness and struck defendant a blow with his fist in the face and after some scuffling, the man ran up South alley toward Morgan street and directly toward an electric light standing on Morgan street where it is intersected by South alley. That he pursued the man along the alley at a distance of some 60 or 65 feet, and that when the prisoner came to the mouth of a private alley he called twice to the man to halt, and that they were then twelve or fifteen feet apart. The man not halting he fired his revolver into the air to scare him. The man then turned upon defendant, made a grab at him with his left hand and tore his shirt and scratched his breast, and the prisoner, believing that his life was in danger, shot the man, as he alleged, in self defence. That immediately after shooting, the man fell and defendant went to him, found him lying on his face \u2014 that -he put his arms around his body under his arms, raised him up and carried him some ten feet back toward his stable, leaned him against the fence and immediately ran to the house of. a neighbor and gave the alarm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The commonwealth introduced evidence which tended to show ill feeling between defendant and deceased.

Offered as corroborative of the evidence already introduced showing that deceased entered defendant\u2019s stable on the night of Aug. 22, 1891, for the purpose of committing a larceny.

If you ascertain what the defendant was doing there, and what the deceased was doing there, you would doubtless have some light upon what subsequently followed as to determining exactly what happened between them when they did come to a conflict, you would be better able to ascertain under just what circumstances the shot was fired that occasioned the taking of Huffman\u2019s life. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-9\">\u201c In ascertaining all these facts you necessarily must pass to a greater or less extent upon the credibility of the witnesses.

When a witness has been successfully contradicted it would warrant you in discarding his testimonjr, at least so far as that contradiction goes, unless sustained by other testimony in the case or some other matters. Contradictions are introduced for the purpose of affecting the credibility of the witness, so you must take them into consideration in passing upon the testimony with regard to determining what the true state of facts may be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\">\u201c [The defendant is, of course, most deeply interested in your determination, and just so far as he fails in being substantiated and corroborated by other testimony in the case, or facts in the case, and that interest and feeling would bias him or prejudice him in giving his testimony, so far would you be warranted in discrediting that testimony. But notwithstanding the interest of any witnesses if they are corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses and other testimony in the case, then you cannot disregard it simply because of their feeling or interest in the case.

All evidence therefore which bore directly on such inquiry, was relevant and admissible, even though it incidentally tended to show the commission by the deceased of a crime not part of that on trial. The two offers included in the first and second assignments of error were clearly within this principle. The presence of the deceased inside of a locked stable, near midnight, was of itself very strong evidence that he was there with some criminal intent, and what this intent was, would be made clear, if it should be shown, as was offered, that' part of a harness belonging to the prisoner had been stolen, that it had been in the possession of the deceased, and that the latter had traded it to another person with a promise to supply the missing part. Evidence to that effect was admissible. It did not come within the general rule that one crime cannot be introduced as evidence of another separate and unconnected. Such evidence, as was said in Goersen v. Com., 99 Pa. 388, \u201c cannot be received to impeach (the prisoner\u2019s) general character, nor merely to prove a disposition to commit crime. Yet under some circumstances evidence of another offence by the defendant may be given. Thus it may be to establish identity; to show the act charged was intentional and willful, not accidental; <em>to prove motive;'''\u2019 </em>etc. Examples of the exceptions to the general rule may be found in Com. v. Ferrigan, 44 Pa. 386; Kramer v. Com., 87 Pa. 299; Goersen v. Com., supra; and Com. v. Johnson, 133 Pa. 293. The first and second assignments must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">While the point is not expressly raised on this record yet as the case must go back for another trial, it is proper to call at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tention to the act of April 22, 1863, sec. 2, P. L. 531, by which the willful and malicious entry of a stable etc., either by day or by night, with or without breaking, with intent to commit any felony therein, is itself a felony. If therefore the deceased was in the stable with intent to steal the harness, he had committed a felony, though the actual larceny was not completed, and the right of the appellant to pursue and arrest him must be determined as in cases of felony actually committed, not of a felony attempted but abandoned by a fleeing criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">The fourth assignment must also be sustained. While it was entirely proper to call the jury\u2019s attention to the prisoner\u2019s interest, as affecting his credibility, and while-the terms in which the learned judge did so might be correctly understood by him and bjr members of the bar, familiar with legal distinctions, the general effect of the charge on this point was to discredit the prisoner as a witness and to lead the jury to throw out his testimony except where it was corroborated. This is the usual rule as to accomplices, not as to defendants, and in a case where the prisoner was necessarily the only witness as to the actual circumstances of the shooting it put upon him a greater burden than the law imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
