The corporation was authorized to hold real and personal property, and the control of its business was vested in an acting committee or council. The corporation connected itself with the general Swedenborgian church of Pennsylvania. By the organization of this church in Pennsylvania, the bishop and other pastors and ministers constitute the General Ecclesiastical Council, having charge of spiritual affairs, and the council of the laity, having \u201c charge and control of the civil- and business affairs and of the property of the body of the church, and shall be the representatives of the same in all matters relating to the civil law and government of the country.\u201d There was no provision that the property of the separate societies should become the property of the general church. The Pittsburgh society by a vote of thirty-seven to twenty-two severed its connection with the general church. The bishop of Pennsylvania thereupon appointed trustees to take possession of the society\u2019s property, but this was resisted by the old society. The minority of the old society and the trustees then organized another church under the name of \u201cChurch of the Advent, Pittsburgh.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that a bequest to \u201cthe New Church of Pittsburgh\u201d should be awarded to the corporation known as. \u201c The First New Jerusalem Society of the city of Pittsburgh and its vicinity.\u201d</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b565-6\">Argued Nov. 9, 1893.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A83\">Appeal, No. 296, Oct.

J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">\u201c The controversy here grows out of adverse claims to a legacy bequeathed by Mrs. Aitken to \u2018 the New Church of Pitts-burg the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to be used as the Council of that Society deem best.\u2019 It is conceded that the beneficiary intended was \u2018The First New Jerusalem Society of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Pittsburgh and its Vicinity,\u2019 incorporated under the laws of this state; but there are rival claimants here to represent that society, and the question submitted is, which of these claimants has the right. The material facts are these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">\u201c The charter of \u2018 The First New Jerusalem Society of the City of Pittsburgh audits Vicinity,\u2019 granted July 6, 1863, provided amongst other things that \u2018 all adult persons of good moral and religious character who may be attached to and profess faith in the doctrines of the New Church may, on application to the president or presiding officer of the meeting at which such application shall be mude, and on complying with such other form as may in any by-law passed for that purpose by said corporation be required, become members of the same. There shall be elected annually a president, secretary, treasurer, librarian and trustees, all of whom together shall form an acting committee, whose duty it shall be to take cognizance generally of the affairs of the society, but in all important matters the acting committee may be controlled by a vote of the society. . . . To receive or take.by gift or devise, purchase or otherwise, property, real, personal and mixed; .... to make such by-laws for the management of its affairs and the good government of its officers and members, as may be deemed expedient, .... and generally to exercise any and all powers generally appertaining by law to a corporation or body politic.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">\u201c The by-laws provide amongst other things that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">\u201c \u2018 Section 2. The ecclesiastical affairs, or those pertaining to the divine law and worship, shall be administered by the pastor or minister, and he shall exercise his functions according to the laws enacted by the general body or bodies of the church with which this society shall be connected.

The annual meeting of the society shall be held on the second Monday of January of each year for the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of officers, hearing reports and the transaction of any other business that may be brought before the society.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\">\u201c This society seems to have connected itself with the General (Swedenborgian) Church of Pennsylvania, for the express purpose of co-operation in missionary work and not to give control over its own individual affairs in any manner whatever, and with the General Convention of the United States. By the organization of the church in Pennsylvania, the bishop and other pastors and ministers constitute the General Ecclesiastical Council having charge of spiritual affairs, and the Council of the Laity having \u2018 charge and control of the civil and business affairs and of the property of the body of the church, and shall be the representatives of the same in all matters relating to the civil law and government of the country.\u2019 There is no definition of what shall constitute the property of the body of the church, nor any provision that property of societies which may become connected with, shall become the property of such church. There is no prohibition of secession by any society from the General Church. On the contrary, the right has never been denied until the present dispute arose; but has been repeatedly exercised and recognized. Thus a list of societies in Pennsylvania is furnished which have severed their connection with the General Church, and taken their property with them, without, so far as appears, even a protest or question. The General Church itself exercised the right of secession from the \u2018 General Convention \u2019 of the United States in 1890, and was allowed to depart in peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">\u201c After the secession of the General Church, an organization on a new basis having been began, which was subsequently carried out as is alleged illegally, the Pittsburgh society, in February, 1892, decided by a vote of 87 to 22 to sever its connection with'the General Church. The bishop of Pennsylvania thereupon, although he had previously conceded the right of secession, appointed George A. Macbeth and two other trustees, and undertook with them to take 'possession of the society\u2019s property, but was prevented by the trustees who had been regularly elected. The minority then meeting under the authority of the bishop and the trustees appointed by him bought other property and built a church in Pittsburgh, where they now worship under the name of \u2018 Church of the Advent, Pittsburgh,\u2019 without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>any charter right. They took no action looking to the election of trustees or other officers. The majority have kept up a regular organization by election in accordance with the charter and by-laws.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">\u201c In the meantime George A. Macbeth, for himself and others, filed in the court of common pleas, against the parties in possession of the church property* with a view to raise the question as to who are the proper and legal representatives of said Pittsburgh society, a bill in equity; but the present audit, involving the same question, having come on first, the parties, by writing filed, have submitted it for final decision by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">\u201c This court finds that [the Rev. John Whitehead, Albert \u2018 H. Childs et al. are the proper and legal representatives of the First New Jerusalem Society of Pittsburgh and its vicinity, and as such entitled to the charge and control of its property.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">Exceptions to adjudication were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions to adjudication, and decree, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-8\"><em>Thomas </em>Patterson, <em>Knox \u00a7 Reed </em>and <em>Edwin 'Z.
