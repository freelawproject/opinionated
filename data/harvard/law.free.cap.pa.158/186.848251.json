In 1863 seven were living \u2014 Samuel, William, James, Mary, Joseph, John and Eliza. The other had died unmarried and without issue. Between 1863 and the date of John Gilmor\u2019s death, Samuel, Mary, James, William and Joseph Gilmor died, all dying intestate, unmarried and without issue. Each one left to survive him or her as his or her next of kin and heirs at law those of the brothers and sisters then surviving, upon whom the law cast the respective decedents\u2019 estates in equal proportions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-5\">\u201cAs each one died, administration of the estate-was committed to one or more of the survivors, and an appraisement was made of the estate for the collateral inheritance tax. From the records of these appraisements, and of the settlement of the tax, it appears that each one had, at his or her death, a considerable estate, being, respectively, as follows: (1) Samuel, 1863, personal $5,373.95, real $6,496, total $12,869.95, less debts $8,989.84, net balance, $4,780.11. The debts here deducted appear to have been due to his sisters then living. (2) Mary Gilmor, personal $6,116.02, real $1,200, total $7,316.02, less expense $500, net succession $6,816.02. (3) James Gilmor, net succession $27,203.49. (4) William Gilmor, net succession $21,105.47. (5) Joseph Gilmor, net succession $30,592.82.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajq\">\u201cIncluded in these appraisements was the undivided share or interest of each in several tracts of land held by the brothers and sisters in common. Previous to John Gilmor\u2019s death all this land was sold, at various times, except the farm and mountain or wood land above mentioned. The land so sold brought, in all, about $30,927.50. One sale, that to John White, by John and Eliza, made in March, 1888, yielded $21,000, which money was all invested by Mr. Gehr in John Gilmor\u2019s name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">\u201c On July 1, 1879, by letter of attorney of that date, Eliza Gilmor constituted John Gilmor her attorney in fact, with full power to receive and collect any money, debts, etc., due her, and generally to take charge of and manage all her personal property and estate, and to invest the same in any securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that to him might seem safe and satisfactory, and to manage her real estate and take the profits thereof. John Gilmor acted under this authority to some extent until his death. It was not proven to what extent he acted under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-4\">\u201c The foregoing facts represent as fully the evidence taken on this subject as the auditor deemed practicable or necessary. He has endeavored to make them embody every material fact. He does not find anything in them or in the evidence to warrant his finding that the testator was indebted to Eliza Gilmor, as trustee or otherwise, in anj' sum greater than that represented by the duebills \u2018 D \u2019 and the note \u2018 E.\u2019 He therefore finds that the testator, at his death, was indebted to Eliza Gilmor in the amounts of the duebills \u2018 D,\u2019 with interest from their dates, at six per cent, and in the amount of the note \u2018 E,\u2019 with interest from October 1,1889, at four per cent, and in no further sum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">The auditor further reported in a supplemental report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">\u201c The claims of Eliza Gilmor\u2019s executor were : (a) for the United States bonds or their value in money, and (5) for certain mortgages and a judgment found in the pocketbook marked with- her name, or the proceeds thereof. The facts relating to these claims are fully set out in the report, (a) The first claim was rejected. So far as it was for the bonds in specie it was in the teeth of the well known rule that in a distribution of the orphans\u2019 court no claim to the decedent\u2019s property can be adjudicated when made adversely to the decedent\u2019s title thereto. In this forum only creditors, legatees and next of kin can be heard: McBride\u2019s Ap., 72 Pa. 480; Gravenstine\u2019s Ap., 2 Penny. 61; High\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 222.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">\u201c It was sought to bring the claim within the exception to this rule established by Marshall v. Hoff, 1 Watts, 440, and Miller\u2019s Ap., 84 Pa. 391, namely, that the fund sought to be recovered \u2018may be shown tobe wrongfully in the account, either because, though in the name of the decedent, it is really a trust, or because the title is in another person,\u2019 and in this aspect the value of the bonds in money was claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-8\">\u201c The right and power of the orphans\u2019 court to assume jurisdiction of such a claim cannot be doubted, but the evidence produced before the auditor wholly failed, in his opinion, to establish it. It was shown that for some years the testator had acted as Eliza Gilmor\u2019s attorney in fact, and had, from time to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>time, received into his hands a large sum of money belonging to her. On April 1, 1889, a few months before his death, he made, in her favor, a promissory note of $50,000, and below it wrote a memorandum to the effect that it was \u2018 invested in government bonds at four per cent, belonging to Eliza Gilmor.\u2019 How this can b$ construed into a declaration that all of the bonds in testator\u2019s name belonged to Eliza Gilmor, or that he held them in trust for her, the auditor cannot see. The note was a declaration that-the testator owed Eliza $50,000 on the date thereof, and the memorandum seems to do no more than indicate where it was invested. If it had appeared that the testator had bought, with $50,000 of Eliza\u2019s money, bonds of that par value, and had held them as hers, then her right to any increase in their value would be clear. But there was not a word of evidence to show when, with whose money or at what price the bonds had been bought. For all that the evidence shows the testator may have bought them on April 1,1889, or at any other time, using $50,000 of his sister\u2019s money and enough of his own to make up the balance of their cost. The memorandum seems entirely consistent with such a theory, and, when taken in connection with the note, inconsistent with any other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">\u201c An additional reason why, even if the evidence had been thought sufficient, the auditor would be compelled to reject this claim is that the premiums on the bonds do not enter into the account, and it would be impossible to ascertain their amount, and, if ascertained, to award them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">\u201c The claim was accordingly rejected in so far as it exceeded the face of the note, $50,000, with interest. The duebills found with it were also allowed, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">\u201c (5) The second claim was for the mortgages and judgment in the pocketbook, or their proceeds. It was rejected for much the same reason as the former claim \u2014 the auditor did not think the evidence sufficient to sustain it in any aspect in which it might be considered. As the auditor gathered from the arguments of the claimants\u2019 counsel, there were three grounds upon which the claim might be rested : (1) That the setting aside of these securities in the wallet marked with Eliza Gilmor\u2019s name, and containing the note and duebills above mentioned, amounted to a gift of them to her; (2) that, taken in connection with his relation to her as attorney in fact, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>amounted to an acknowledgment of his indebtedness to her in that amount; and (3) that it amounted to a declaration of trust on his part in her favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-4\">\u201c The evidence of the testator\u2019s indebtedness to Eliza Gilmor, as shown by the report, was that she had inherited from her brothers and sisters, dying intestate, at various times from 1863 to 1879, about 133,000, and that in 1879 she had given the testator a general power of attorney for the management of her estate. Apparently it had all passed into his hands, for when she died her executor found nothing, practically, upon which to administer. This seemed sufficient to the auditor to warrant the conclusion that the testator died indebted to his sister, and the note and the duebills above referred to confirm that conclusion. But the evidence seemed by itself, without any declarations or admissions of the testator, insufficient to fix the amount of the indebtedness. These were altogether wanting, except in the notes and duebills, and in determining this question and that concerning the United States bonds, the auditor has looked upon the notes and duebills as furnishing the only safe measure of the testator\u2019s indebtedness. It seemed incredible that the testator should have taken such pains accurately to fix and ascertain a portion of this indebtedness, and then leave the balance to be evidenced by his' sister\u2019s name on the receptacle of certain papers. The auditor does not wish to be understood by this as admitting the testator to limit his liability by his own declaration. What he means is that without such declaration it would be impossible to fix the liability at all, and that when the placing of these securities in the marked book is contrasted with the care with which the note and duebills were prepared, it loses all force as an admission of indebtedness. If this be so, then the second ground upon which the claim is made- \u2014 -as a debt \u2014 must fail, because no indebtedness is established. The first ground also fails, for as a gift it is without consideration and void, because .unexecuted. Plumstead\u2019s Ap., 4 S. &amp; R. 545; Crawford\u2019s Ap., 61 Pa. 52.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">\u201c This leaves the claim to be sustained, if at all, upon the footing of a declaration of trust, and the auditor finds the evidence upon this subject quite as unsatisfactory as upon those already discussed. It consists of the placing of the securities claimed in a pocketbook, along with the notes and duebills, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the book bearing on the outside a label with 4 Eliza Gilmor \u2019 written thereon in the testator\u2019s writing, and the words 4 EIRa Gilmor\u2019s Money,\u2019 written in the same writing, in pencil, on the paper lining of the book. There was nothing whatever to connect these marks on the book with its contents. There was nothing to show at what time or for what purpose they were made. They stand alone and upon them the trust, if trust there be, must rest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-3\">\"'There is no certain form required in the creation of a trust. In the case of personal property or choses in action trusts may be proved by parol. If the declaration is in writing .... it may be couched in any language which is sufficiently expressive of the intention to create a trust.\u2019 Clark, J., in Smith\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 428.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-4\">\"'The intention must be plainly manifest and not derived from loose and equivocal expressions made at different times and upon different occasions. The donor need not say in so many words, 441 declare myself a trustee,\u201d but he must do something which is equivalent to it and use expressions which have that meaning; for, however anxious a court may be to carry out a man\u2019s intention, it is not at liberty to construe the words otherwise than -according to their proper meaning: \u2019 Id. 487.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">44 The requisites for raising a trust of this nature (and it will be observed that the auditor, having found no indebtedness be-tween the parties, treats this as a purely voluntary one) are stated by Mr. Bisphara to be three in number \u2014 sufficient words to create it, a definite subject, and a certain or ascertained object; to which may be added another, that the terms of the trust should be sufficiently declared: \u2019 Eq. 65.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">\"And in the English case of Warriner v. Rodgers, L. R. 16 Eq. 340, Bacon, V. C., makes it indispensable to the validity of such a declaration that the donor part absolutely with that interest in the subject-matter which has been his up to the declaration, and put the property out of his power, at least in the way of interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-7\">\"Now applying these principles to the facts of this case it .seems to the auditor almost beyond question that the declaration of trust, if any was intended, must fail for want of the .most essential and necessary features. The only one of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Bispham\u2019s requisites which is present is the \u2018 certain or ascertained object \u2019 \u2014 Eliza Gilmor. The subject is altogether uncertain, for the words on the book are in no way connected with its contents; and the words used are certainly, in the absence of such connection, insufficient to create it, for they are expressive of no intention whatever. Mr. Bispham\u2019s additional essential is also wanting, for there is no declaration of the terms of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-4\">\u201c Then, too, the fact that this disposition of the securities was never made known by the testator to any one in his lifetime, is important. It would not be essential that he had done so, if the memoranda on the book appeared to be the deliberate expression of his purpose, or if such fact could be established by any circumstances. But the failure of the memoranda, so to speak, and the absence of any such circumstances would seem to make it a significant fact that the trust was kept secret by the testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">Exceptions by Thomas A.

They are: [1) Whether the learned court below erred in refusing to award to the appellant the value of the four per cent government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>bonds which he claimed belonged to the estate of Eliza Gilmor, deceased; (2) whether it was error to calculate interest at four per cent on the 150,000 secured by John Gilmor\u2019s note under date of April 1, 1889; and (8) whether error was committed in the refusal to award to the appellant the amount of the mortgages and judgments found in the wallet labeled in John Gilmor\u2019s handwriting \u201c Eliza Gilmor,\u201d and designated by the learned auditor in his report as exhibit 11J.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">From the inventory of the personal property of John Gilmor, filed December 28, 1889, we learn that the face value of the government bonds held by him was $60,000, and that with the accrued interest and premium they were then worth $72,400. It is claimed by the appellant that although these bonds were in John Gilmor\u2019s name, Eliza Gilmor\u2019s money to the amount of $50,000 was used in the purchase of them, and that her estate is therefore entitled to receive from the estate of John Gilmor the sum which bonds of the face value of $50,000 were worth at the time of the inventory. It will be noticed that this claim assumes that the bonds were bought at their face value, and that there is nothing on this record which shows when they were bought or the price paid for them. In the absence of evidence on this point the fair presumption is that the amount paid was their market value at the time of the purchase. As there was no fraud or bad faith in the transaction, and it does not appear that they were bought for less than they were appraised at in December, 1889, it follows that if the claim is valid in other respects the most that can be recovered upon it is their face value, $50,000, with interest from October, 1889, and as that amount was awarded to the appellant by the learned court below, on the theory that the money invested in the bonds was a loan to John Gilmor for which he gave the note above mentioned, it seems to be unnecessary to further consider this branch of the case. But is there any merit in the claim that Eliza Gilmor was the owner of five sixths of the bonds held by her brother John ? The only evidence to support it is the memorandum made by him on his note to her for $50,000. The learned auditor, reading the memorandum in the light of the surrounding circumstances, held, with the approval of the learned court below, that it, considered in connection with the note on which it was indorsed, was not equivalent to a declaration that he bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and held the bonds for her, but that it was intended simply to show how he had invested the money for which the note was given. This conclusion is consistent with the conduct of the parties, which was clearly inconsistent with the claim made by the appellant. John Gilmor paid interest on the note to Eliza Gilmor, July 1, and October 1,1889, as appears by her receipts written thereon. While they said in plain words that the money so paid and received was interest on the note, and thus recognized the <em>$50,000 </em>as a debt due from the maker to the payee, we are asked to contradict them and say that it was interest on her bonds. We cannot do this unless we regard the note with the indorsement upon it as a declaration of trust instead of an obligation for the payment of money. The memorandum is clearly insufficient to warrant an inference that John held the government bonds in trust for Eliza, or to discharge him from liability to her on the note according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Was it error to refuse to award to the appellant interest on this note at the rate-of six per cent? The note was payable one day after its date, and the payee would, in the absence of evidence qualifying her right, be entitled to interest upon it from its maturity at the legal rate. But it is a fair implication from the receipts upon it that the parties agreed upon a rate of four per cent. It is not unnatural or unreasonable in view of their relations that the payee should be willing to accept and the maker to pay the same rate of interest that he received on his investment of the money for which he gave the note. In the adoption of this rate by the learned auditor the appellant secures the same interest he would have received if he had established his claim to the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The learned auditor was clearly right in refusing to award to the appellant the amount of the mortgages and judgments found in the wallet labeled \u201c Eliza Gilmor.\u201d This wallet was in John Gilmor\u2019s possession at the time of his death, the mortgages and judgments were in his name, and there was no evidence showing that any of Eliza\u2019s money was invested in them. The entry upon and the entry within the wallet were relied on to support the claim that John held these securities in trust for his sister, but they furnished no adequate ground for an inference that he so held them. Aside from these entries there was nothing to suggest that she had any interest in them. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>theory that they belonged to her derives no support from the claim that her estate is much larger than the note and duebill. This claim is not sustained by the evidence. If it be conceded that all of Eliza\u2019s property exclusive of her unsold interests in real estate passed into John\u2019s hands under the power of attorney dated July 1, 1879, the appellant has no just cause to complain of the decree, because he received under it at least $25,000 more than he has shown such property was worth. The note and duebill were acknowledgments by John that he was indebted to his sister in the amounts stated in them, and we think the conclusion of the learned auditor that they furnished theyneasure of his liability was warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The specifications of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
