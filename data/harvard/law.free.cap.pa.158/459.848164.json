It appears in evidence that the title to this property is in the name of John and Bertha Schroedel ; therefore the interest is not truly stated and the sole ownership of the property is not in John Schroedel; therefore the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, the contract being void according to its very terms. The plaintiff undertook to defeat this by showing that John Schroedel\u2019s name was inserted by mistake and it ought to have been John and Bertha Schroedel. In order to justify that, it is necessary that the evidence of mistake should be clearly established by clear and indisputable evidence. The plaintiff has failed in that, in my judgment, because the fact depends upon the unsupported testimony of Mrs. Schroedel, who saj^s that she told the agent of the company how the title was held. This is contradicted by Mr. Fink, the agent; therefore the testimony of Mrs. Schroedel being uncorroborated, in my judgment is insufficient to justify a finding that the' contract should have been different from what it is. Therefore I instruct you that your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

This, in the absence of any proof of fraud or mistake, as to the insertion of the stipulation above quoted, was a flat bar to plaintiff\u2019s recovery. There was therefore no error in directing a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
