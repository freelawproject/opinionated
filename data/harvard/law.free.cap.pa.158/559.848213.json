In an action for the gas alleged to have been furnished, the statement alleged that the claim was to recover a certain amount, naming it, for natural gas furnished to defendant during certain months. The statement further averred that defendant used for fuel natural gas furnished by plaintiff during the months named, and thereby became liable to pay plaintiff at a certain rate per day for each of the five boilers. There was no avei\u2019ment that the amount of gas supplied was sufficient for the use of the boilers. <em>Held, </em>that it was doubtful whether a right to judgment could be sustained upon the statement, even in the absence of an affidavit of defence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b583-9\"><em>Contract </em>\u2014 Affidavit <em>of defence.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b583-10\">In the above case, defendant filed an affidavit of defence, averring that plaintiff did not supply enough gas to run the boilers, and that defendant was obliged to expend large sums for coal to make up the deficiency of gas; that the value of the gas actually delivered was much less than the amount claimed; and that gas was not furnished for the number of days claimed in the statement, but for a less number of days, which were specified for each month.

The affidavit is sufficient to prevent judgment: Nixon v. McCrory, 101 Pa. 292; Shaw v. Fleming, 11 Cent. R. 620; Lee v. Baylie, 13 Atl.

Brady, 127 Pa. 169, \u201c being really affidavits to conclusions of law, carefully stated so as to appear to be facts.\u201d The affidavit says that its rights were obtained, \u201c saving to every other consumer upon the pipe lines of the said Clopper, at the date of the aforesaid agreement, a similar right of supply.\u201d Where is the offer to prove this by the paper, or by parol evidence that this was what the paper meant ? It is argued as a legal proposition and nothing else. Class v. Kingsley, 142 Pa. 636, is to the same effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">If it were possible to conclude from these affidavits that there was any understanding of the language, at the time, different from that for which we contend, or that any contemporaneous parol agreement was made on the subject, then according to Sanders v. Sharp, 153 Pa. 555, they are not sufficiently clear and precise to prevent judgment. Again, the practice of embracing conclusions of law, as well as statements of fact, in a single proposition is condemned in Superior Nat. Bank v. Stadelman, 153 Pa. 634.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AH-G\">December 30, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AiTI\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The claim of the plaintiff was strictly limited in the statement of claim filed to a right to recover for gas under the original contract as modified by the subsequent letters, during the months of Januaiy, February and March, 1892. The claim is for $542.50 for the month of January, $507.50 for the month of February, and $490 for the month of March, aggregating $1,540. There was not, and there could not be, either under the original contract, or under'the subsequent letters modifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>it, any right of action to recover anything except for gas actually furnished by the plaintiff to the defendant during the months named. Yet there is no precise and definite averment in the statement of claim that the gas for which the claim is made was actually furnished to the defendant during the months mentioned, or at any time. The first part of the statement alleges that the claim is to recover $1,540 for natural gas furnished to the defendant for the months of January, February and March, 1892, in accordance with a written contract of March 10,1888, and certain letters of which the dates are given, and copies attached. There is a description of what the claim is. Then follows an averment that the defendant used for fuel natural gas furnished by the plaintiff during the months named, and thereby became liable to pay the plaintiff at the rate of $3.50 per day for each of five boilers, amounting in the aggregate to $1,540, and adds a statement for each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">This statement amounts to this, that the defendant used, as fuel, natural gas, which was furnished by the plaintiff during the three months named, at the rate of $3.50 for each one of five boilers, and became liable to pay therefor $1,540. All this may be true, and yet the plaintiff may not have actually furnished any more than a mere fraction of the quantity really required for the use of the boilers. It would still be the use for fuel of natural gas furnished, although the quantity furnished may have been infinitesimal, and the defendant may have been actually required to furnish other fuel in large quantities to supply the deficiency. The amount of the liability specified in the statement does not help the insufficiency of tbe allegation as to the quantity furnished, as it is nothing more than a legal conclusion, and its correctness as such necessarily depends upon the quantity actually furnished, adjudged by the terms of the contract. Now the contract requires that the amount of gas to be furnished should be \u201c an amount sufficient to supply the boilers now in use, or hereafter to be erected for use in its paper and pulp mills at West Newton in said county for the period of five years.\u201d By the subsequent terms of the contract it appears that there were thirteen boilers then in actual use, and each one was to be paid for at the rate of $2.65 for every day of twenty-four hours. It is also further provided that, in case of an interruption or failure in the gas supply ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>eessitating the shutting down of the mills, no charge should be made for gas for the days the mills are not running; and also that, if for any other cause the mills are not in operation, no charge for gas shall be made for the period of such cessation, \u201c it being the intention of the parties hereto, that said second party shall pay at the rate hereinbefore stated for the number of days and fractions of days said mills are in actual operation, and said gas is actually used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">It will be seen therefore that the obligation of the defendant is to pay for gas actually furnished only, and the amount to be furnished was to be sufficient to supply the boilers. The contract was made in 1888. In May, 1891, the correspondence commenced, and it is to be inferred from the letters, and is alleged in the affidavit of defence, that the plaintiff did not furnish enough gas to supply the thirteen boilers. Thereupon the original contract was modified so as to require the plaintiff to furnish enough gas to supply a minimum of five boilers at a price of $3.50 per day for each. But the defendant, by the two final letters of June 4 and June 12, 1891, expressly stipulated as follows, \u201c we do not want to agree to pay for any gas we do not use,\u201d and \u201c we shall probably be glad to use all of the gas you (San furnish us, but our understanding of the result of our correspondence is, that you accept our proposition as contained in our letter of May 14th and that we are to pay for gas only as used.\u201d In the letter of June 12th the defendant, writing to the plaintiff, says, \u201c I feel authorized to accept your suggestion that five boilers shall be the minimum of boilers in use, and if we cannot be supplied with this amount of gas, we will want to discontinue the use of gas altogether.\u201d As this is the last of the letters appearing before us, we conclude that it was the modified agreement of the parties that the plaintiff, from that time on, should furnish as much gas as was required to supply at least five boilers per day, and that only such gas as was actually furnished and used should be paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">If we consider the statement of claim in the light of the original contract and the modified contract as appears by the letters, it would seem that it is quite insufficient to support the claim made, as it does not aver that an amount of gas necessary to supply a minimum of five boilers per day was ever actually furnished. It is extremely doubtful therefore whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>a right to judgment could be sustained, even in the absence of any affidavit of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">But the affidavits filed allege specifically and positively, not only that the plaintiff never did supply enough gas to run the thirteen boilers, and set out at length the precise injury done thereby in dollars and cents which they were obliged to expend in obtaining coal to make up for the defieiencj^ of gas, but also charge that during the three months for which the plaintiff\u2019s claim is made \u201c the plaintiff continued to divert its supply of natural gas from the defendant and to deliver the same to consum\u00e9is subsequent in date of contract to the defendant, and that the gas furnished by plaintiff to defendant during said three months, by reason of such deficiency in quantity, was only worth the following sums: January, 1892, one hundred and eight and dollars (#108.50) ; February, 1892, one hundred and one dollars (#101.50) ; March, 1892, ninety-eight dollars (#98.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">As we are bound to assume the truth of the averments in the affidavits of defence, it is clear there can be no right of recovery for #1,540 for the gas furnished in the three months, when the value of all that was actually furnished was only #308.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">But the supplemental affidavit further alleges that gas was not furnished for the number of days claimed in the statement,, but for a less number of days, which are specified for each month, and further avers, \u201c That during said months plaintiff wholly failed to deliver to defendant natural gas sufficient to supply five boilers with fuel, and that in order to heat said boilers, and to supply fuel for the operation of its mill, which under the original contract, and the contract as amended, by the letters set forth by plaintiff, defendant was compelled to purchase and did purchase coal at the market price thereof, which market price was the sum of five thousand and nineteen dollars, which was paid by defendant, and defendant was compelled to employ laborers, at the fair market price of labor, to handle said coal and the ashes and waste therefrom, and that the sum so paid for labor was thirteen hundred and forty-seven and x8090 dollars, all of which was lost to defendant by reason of plaintiff\u2019s failure to supply gas for heating the boilers of defendant according to the - contract as it originally stood and as amended.\u201d The affidavit further alleges that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>said sums of money were paid out because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure and refusal to supply a sufficient quantity of gas for heating the boilers of the defendant at its mills, and particularly the five boilers set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, and that the expense was incurred on the days when the plaintiff undertook to furnish the said gas. Other averments of a specific and positive character are made which tend directly to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. As all the averments in the two affidavits must be taken as verity, there can be no recovery for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and it was error to enter such judgment in the face of the facts alleged in these affidavits. They are precise, definite, positive, and, if true and unexplained, they seem to be fatal to any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
