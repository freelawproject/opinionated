L. 110. A statement of the plaintiffs claim was filed, and the defendants filed an affidavit of defence and also a paper denying the right of the plaintiff to require an affidavit of defence, or to have a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The learned court below concluded that the defendants were not \u2018obliged to file any affidavit of defence because the action was not an action ex contractu, but held that the defendants waived the right to resist judgment on that ground by having filed the affidavit, and thereupon gave judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. That this could not be done has been emphatically decided by this court and is manifest upon the plainest considerations. If there was no right to a judgment for want of any affidavit of defence, there certainly could not be a right to judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit. In Hutchinson v. Woodwell, 107 Pa. 509, we said: \u201c The first question is, was the plaintiff below entitled to a judgment if no affidavit of defence had been made? If he was not, the judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence must be reversed, for in such case no affidavit of defence is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>from the defendant: Gottman v. Shoemaker, 86 Pa. 31; Strock v. Commonweath, 90 Id. 272. The filing of one is no waiver of an objection to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of claim.\u201d This court held the same doctrine in the case of Yates v. The Borough of Meadville, 56 Pa. 21, and again in Barr v. Duncan, 76 Pa. 395, in which it was said: \u201cIf then the judgment entered in this case was not authorized by any rule of the district court, it is unnecessary to consider whether the facts set out in the affidavit of defence would, if true, be a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s action.\u201d The question is too plain to require further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
