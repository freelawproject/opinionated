There is nothing to prevent appellants after substitution from taking a nonsuit. It will then be open to defendants under the act of April 3,1872, P. L. 33, to force the bringing of another ejectment within a year and thereby prevent their title from being clouded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">The intent of the act of April 13, 1807, \u00a7 3, is that the person next in interest may be compelled to appear: Darnes v.
