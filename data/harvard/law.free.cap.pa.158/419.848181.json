Before McClttng-, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">At the trial it appeared that some time previous to the accident, the Chartiers &amp; Robinson Turnpike Co. was engaged in the work of rebuilding and raising its bridge over Corks Run, and that this work rendered it necessary to lift the tracks of the street railway for a short distance on either side of the bridge to meet the change in the elevation of the bridge. Early in the morning of July 21,1891, plaintiff and her son were driving along the turnpike, and had reached a point near the Corks Run bridge, where the work was still in progress, when the front wheels of the wagon dropped down between the tracks into the excavation made by the removal of cobblestones, and plaintiff was thrown from the wagon and injured. Plaintiff claimed that the repairs were being made under the direction of defendant\u2019s officers. William J. Burns, defendant\u2019s superintendent, testified as follows: \u201c Q. Do you know who made those repairs ? A. The repairs were made by the Chartiers &amp; Robinson Township Turnpike Company. Q. Was that the name of the Old Turnpike Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. The repairs were made under your direction, weren\u2019t they? A. They were made under the direction of the Turnpike Company \u2014 all those repairs. Q. All those repairs were made under the direction of the Turnpike Company ? A. Yes, sir. Q. The Turnpike Company were laying the rails to run the cars ? A. They were building a bridge there and they raised it up probably eighteen inches higher than it was before, and they had to take up the roadway to get their new construction, or bridge, or superstructure in, and they were doing all the work connected with it. Q. Who superintended and controlled that work? A. Well, I directed part of it. Q. You directed part of it? A. Yes, sir. Q. You had control of it? A. By the order of the board, yes, sir. Q. Wasn\u2019t the work done by men employed by the Pittsburgh &amp; West End Railroad Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. Everything that was paid was paid by the Turnpike Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. But you had control of the work; superintended it? A. The engineer had the general supervision of it. Q. But it was done under your direction, as superintendent of this Passenger Railway Company ? A. Yes, sir; partially so. Q. And rails were laid for your cars to run on? A. Yes, sir. . . . Q. The men doing that work were under your control, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>weren\u2019t they ? A. They were under the engineer\u2019s and mine.\u201d He also testified that during the progress of the repairs the track was-in use by defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-3\">It did not appear that there was any light or barricade to warn or keep off travelers from the dangerous part of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">\u201c2.

The public had a right, and, it appears, was accustomed to use the tracks in common with defendant; and, if the track was put in such a condition as to render it dangerous to public travel, it was the duty of those having charge to give adequate warning. Others may have been culpably negligent; but there was certainty evidence which justified submission of the question of defendant company\u2019s negligence to the jury. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
