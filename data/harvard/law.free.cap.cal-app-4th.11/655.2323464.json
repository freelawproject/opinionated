Zolin, as Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), appeals from a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the suspension of respondent Steven William Yordamlis\u2019s driving privilege. The DMV contends that substantial evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s decision to overturn the suspension. We disagree. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">On March 8, 1991, Officer Bhatnagar of the Fremont Police Department observed Yordamlis driving erratically. After pulling Yordamlis over, Bhatnagar observed that Yordamlis smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot/watery eyes, slurred speech, and an unsteady gait.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Bhatnagar arrested Yordamlis at approximately 7:15 p.m. for violation of Vehicle Code section 23152.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yordamlis elected to submit to a blood test. Based on his belief that the blood test would show a blood-alcohol concentration (BAG) of more than 0.08 percent, Bhatnagar issued Yordamlis an administrative per se order of suspension pursuant to section 13353.2, which requires suspension of the driving privilege of anyone driving with a BAG of 0.08 percent or more. Subsequent analysis of the blood sample revealed a BAG of 0.17 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">At the ensuing administrative hearing that Yordamlis requested, the DMV submitted Bhatnagar\u2019s sworn statement, the administrative per se suspension order, the laboratory report of the blood test results, a supplemental sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>statement of another officer that also reported the blood test results, and Yordamlis\u2019s driving record. Yordamlis objected to admission of the sworn statements and the laboratory report, arguing in part that the DMV had failed to present admissible evidence of the trustworthiness and reliability of the test results and of a nexus between the time he was driving and the time he gave the blood sample. Yordamlis did not testify and presented no evidence. On this record, the administrative hearing officer upheld the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, Yordamlis petitioned for a writ of mandate. The superior court found that the DMV\u2019s \u201cfiindamental finding\u201d regarding Yordamlis\u2019s \u201cblood alcohol content at the time of driving\u201d was \u201cnot supported by the evidence.\u201d It therefore granted the writ.  The DMV now appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The trial court\u2019s task in this case was to determine, using its independent judgment, whether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative decision. <em>(Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 537, 545 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].)  \u201c[U]nder the independent judgment rule, the trial court must weigh the evidence and make its own determination as to whether the administrative findings are sustained.\u201d <em>(Petrucci </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 83, 87 [117 Cal.Rptr. 735].)  The trial court has \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe ultimate power of decision . . . <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67, 72 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Accordingly, on appeal, we review the trial court\u2019s decision as we would review any other civil appeal. <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 907, 915 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d 33].)  Thus, we \u201creview the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, fn. 10 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242].)  We must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 72; <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Fair Employment Practice Com. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 43, 52 [154 Cal.Rptr. 29].) Where the evidence supports more than one inference, we may not substitute our deductions for the trial court\u2019s. <em>(Yakov, supra, </em>at p. 72.)  We may overturn the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence before the trial court is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain those findings. <em>(Merrill, supra, </em>at p. 915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>These rules of appellate review apply even where the evidence in the administrative record is undisputed, if that evidence is \u201csubject to conflicting inferences with respect to the crucial issue. In such a case the trial court, if authorized ... to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence, may draw its own inferences from the evidence in the record, and if the inferences so drawn are supported by substantial evidence, they are binding on the reviewing court. [Citations.]\u201d  <em>(.Interstate Brands </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 770, <em>774, </em>fn. 2 [163 Cal.Rptr. 619, 608 P.2d 707].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Having reviewed the record, we cannot say that the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding the DMV\u2019s evidence insufficient to establish that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG at the time of driving was 0.08 percent or more. The DMV submitted evidence that Yordamlis was driving erratically, smelled of alcohol, and had bloodshot/watery eyes, slurred speech, and an unsteady gait. It also submitted the laboratory report showing that a blood sample the laboratory received three days after Yordamlis\u2019s arrest had a BAG of 0.17 percent. However, the DMV submitted no evidence to establish when Yordamlis gave the tested blood sample. On this record, the trial court reasonably could have determined that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG <em>at the time of driving </em>was lower. Therefore, we must affirm its decision. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We reject the DMV\u2019s contention that, under sections 23152, subdivision (b), and 23153, subdivision (b), we must presume that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG \u201cwas in excess of .08 percent while driving [because] a chemical test taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>within three hours indicated a level of .08 percent or more.\u201d By their express terms, those presumptions apply only if the chemical test was performed \u201cwithin three hours after the driving.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 23152, subd. (b), 23153, subd. (b).) As we have already stated, there is no evidence that Yordamlis gave the tested blood sample within three hours of driving. Therefore, the presumptions do not apply. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"> We also reject the DMV\u2019s attempt to rely on the presumption that an \u201cofficial duty has been regularly performed . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664) to establish that Yordamlis gave the blood sample within three hours of driving. The DMV\u2019s argument depends on section 23157, subdivision (a), under which a driver \u201cis deemed\u201d to have given consent to a chemical test that is \u201cincidental to a lawful arrest. . . .\u201d In <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 142, footnote 4 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 818], the court held that this section imposes on an officer a duty \u201cto administer the test or have it administered by another.\u201d However, we find nothing in the language of this section that \u201cimposes any particular time requirement that can be assumed to have been met pursuant to the presumption codified by Evidence Code section 664.\u201d <em>(Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 550, fn. 10 [rejecting similar argument premised upon regulation requiring drawing of blood sample \u201c \u2018as soon as feasible\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Nor do we agree with the DMV that, even if Yordamlis gave the blood sample more than three hours after driving, we must reverse because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Department hearing referee would have been entitled to rely upon the observation of California\u2019s appellate courts that \u2018the greater the elapse of time the greater the benefit to the defendant, as the alcohol in his system becomes dissipated by the normal bodily processes.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d Appellate courts have also observed that a person\u2019s BAC rises for a period of time after drinking, and that a subsequently administered blood test therefore may reflect a BAC higher than the BAC at the time of driving.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App,4th at p. 548.) The DMV submitted no evidence to establish that a 0.17 percent BAC reading from a blood sample taken more than three hours after alcohol consumption is necessarily inconsistent with a BAC of less than 0.08 percent at the time of driving. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 549, fn. 8.) Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s determination is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Finally, we do not agree that the evidence regarding the manner in which Yordamlis drove, his behavior, or his physical condition <em>requires </em>a different result. We recognize that some courts have stated that such facts are both relevant and admissible as circumstantial evidence that a driver\u2019s BAC was above the legal limit at the time of driving. <em>(Burg </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 257, 266, fn. 10 [198 Cal.Rptr. 145 [673 P.2d 732]; <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 519, 526, fn. 6 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 18]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randolph </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 6-7 [262 Cal.Rptr. 378].) However, nothing in the record establishes that Yordamlis\u2019s conduct is necessarily inconsistent with a BAC of less than 0.08 percent. On the contrary, the Legislature based its decision in 1989 to lower the legal limit from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent on \u201cmedical and driving demonstration studies [that] revealed that <em>most </em>people are impaired at a BAC of 0.05 percent or greater.\u201d (Cal. Highway Patrol, Enrolled Bill Rep. for Sen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Bill No. 408 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 1989, italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the evidence on which the DMV relies is consistent with a finding that Yordamlis\u2019s BAC at the time of driving was lower than 0.08 percent.  Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court erred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">White, R J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-14\">All further statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Although Yordamlis has not filed a respondent\u2019s brief, it is appropriate for us to examine the record and the DMV\u2019s briefs and reverse only for prejudicial error. <em>(Ruttenberg </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1282 [240 Cal.Rptr. 249].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We believe that the dissent, in making an \u201cindependent determination based on the undisputed facts\u201d (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 664), applies the wrong standard of review. The trial court stated at the hearing that the DMV\u2019s finding regarding Yordamlis\u2019s BAG \u201cis not supported by the evidence.\u201d In the judgment, the court stated both that the DMV\u2019s decision \u201cis not supported by the evidence,\u201d and that the DMV \u201cfailed to sustain its burden by a preponderance of the evidence in that the evidence used to support a finding or determination that [Yordamlis] had been driving . . . when he had 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his blood was insufficient, as a matter of law . . . .\u201d We find it clear from these statements that the court, using its independent judgment, was unwilling to infer from the evidence that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG was at least 0.08 percent. We review such a factual determination using the substantial evidence test. Indeed, this is precisely the standard of review that <em>the DMV </em>asks us to apply. The dissent\u2019s independent judgment test applies where the evidence is both undisputed and not subject to conflicting inferences and the issues only involve proper application of a statute or regulation. <em>(Interstate Brands </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 774, fn. 2; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 619, 625 [232 Cal.Rptr. 50].) Even in the dissent\u2019s view, the evidence in this case gives rise to only a \u201cpermissive\u201d inference that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG was 0.08 percent or greater. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 665, fn. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion as to whether the evidence was sufficient to support a contrary inference, i.e., that Yordamlis\u2019s BAG at the time of driving was 0.08 percent or more. Given the posture of the case, that question is not before us; we need only decide whether the evidence supports the inference the trial court drew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The DMV also relies on CALJIC No. 12.61.1 (1990 rev.) (5th ed. pocket pt.) and section 23155. CALJIC No. 12.61.1 is simply the jury instruction used in connection with sections 23152, subdivision (b), and 23153, subdivision (b), and likewise requires proof that the tested blood sample was obtained within three hours of driving. Under section 23155, subdivision (a)(3), a BAC of 0.08 percent or more gives rise to a presumption \u201cthat the person was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d However, suspension under section 13353.2 depends on proof of a BAC at the time of driving, not on proof that the driver was under the influence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"><em>Santos </em>fully supports our decision. There, the DMV relied on test results for a blood sample that Santos gave at some unknown time and the arresting officer\u2019s sworn statement, which reported that (1) Santos had been \u201cdriving in the slow lane at speeds of 45 to 60 miles per hour, weaving within the lane, crossing into the adjacent lane several times and following a small sedan too closely,\" and (2) had \u201cbloodshot and watery eyes, unsteady gait, slurred speech and smelled of alcohol.\u201d <em>(Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 542.) On this record, the appellate court found substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s reversal of the suspension, principally because there was no evidence of when Santos gave the blood sample. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 548-550.) The dissent finds <em>Santos </em>distinguishable because, unlike Yordamlis, Santos offered an <em>expert who </em>stated a belief that Santos\u2019s BAC was less than 0.08 percent at the time of driving. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 665-666; <em>Santos, supra, </em>at p. 548.) However, the hearing officer in <em>Santos </em>could have disbelieved that evidence and upheld the suspension. (See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at pp. 138-145 [affirming suspension notwithstanding expert testimony that, given evidence of driver\u2019s weight and drinking pattern, properly functioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>machine would have shown a BAC of between 0.02 and 0.06 percent].) Nevertheless, the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Indeed, it was this observation that led the Legislature to enact the statutory presumption that the BAC shown by a chemical test performed within three hours of driving is the BAC at the time of driving.

The question for us on appeal is not whether substantial evidence supports the administrative determination, but whether there is substantial evidence in support of the <em>trial court\u2019s </em>findings. <em>(Petrucci </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.3d at p. 87.) In concluding that there is, we do not, as the dissent suggests, hold that omission of the time of the test \u201cnecessarily deprive[s] the test results of probative value as a matter of law.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 666.)

On appeal, that determination will be reversed only if it is not supported by substantial evidence <em>(ibid.; Coombs </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 568, 576 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 249]) or is based upon an erroneous conclusion of law <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 619, 625 [232 Cal.Rptr. 50]).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">In the instant case, the trial court ruled the evidence used by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to support its finding Yordamlis was driving a motor vehicle when he had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08 percent or more was insufficient \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d The trial court based its ruling on (1) lack of foundation for the admissibility of the BAC test results, (2) lack of foundation as to the qualifications of the person who performed the chemical analysis of Yordamlis\u2019s blood test, and (3) failure to demonstrate a relationship between the BAC test results and Yordamlis\u2019s BAC at the time of driving. Since the court\u2019s ruling, however, appellate court decisions have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>established that the first two bases are erroneous as a matter of law. <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 140-143 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 547; <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 519, 525-526 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 18]; <em>Burge </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 384, 389 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 5]; <em>Imachi </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 809, 816-817 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 478].) Consequently, the only remaining basis for the court\u2019s ruling is failure of the DMV to offer expert opinion connecting Yordamlis\u2019s BAC of 0.17 percent at the time of the test to his BAC at the time of his driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Because the trial court ruled the above evidence insufficient <em>as a matter of law, </em>this court is not, as my colleagues assume, limited to substantial evidence review, but, rather, may reach its independent determination based on the undisputed facts. (E.g., <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 625.) Based on the undisputed facts, I believe the trial court erred in finding the evidence insufficient as a matter of law to support suspension of Yordamlis\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The law is settled that BAC at time of driving can be shown <em>only </em>by circumstantial evidence and that a chemical test result is merely one kind of circumstantial evidence. <em>(Burg </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 257, 266, fn. 10 [198 Cal.Rptr. 145, 673 P.2d 732]; <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 526, fn. 6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randolph </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 6-7 [262 Cal.Rptr. 378].) In the instant case, the hearing officer had before him the following circumstantial evidence: (1) the sworn statement of Officer Bhatnagar, the arresting officer, that Yordamlis was stopped because he was driving erratically and, at the time of the stop, his eyes were bloodshot and watery, his speech slurred, his gait unsteady, and he had about his person an odor of alcohol; and (2) the report of the blood test results showing that at the time Yordamlis\u2019s blood was drawn he had a BAC of 0.17 percent. In addition, the hearing officer was permitted to draw inferences and deductions from the evidence before him. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (b); compare <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 524 [absent contrary evidence, hearing officer could infer police officer observed driver driving in an inebriated condition shortly before his arrest] with <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 549-550 &amp; fn. 9 [given contrary evidence, hearing officer could not infer driver\u2019s BAC at time of driving was at least as high as at time of testing].) Here, the evidence showed objective indicia of intoxication at the time of Yordamlis\u2019s arrest and a BAC of more than double the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Pursuant to Vehicle Code section 23152, subdivision (b), if the blood sample was collected within three hours of Yordamlis\u2019s arrest, the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>officer, absent contrary evidence, would be required to find the test results established Yordamlis\u2019s BAC at time of driving. <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 391; accord, <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, ante, </em>p. 304 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 830].) If, by contrast, the sample was collected anytime after three hours, the hearing officer, in my view, could reasonably infer that at the time of driving Yordamlis\u2019s BAC was at least equal to and probably higher than the 0.17 percent shown by the test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The logic of the latter inference has uniformly been recognized by case law in this state. Thus, in <em>In re Martin </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 509, 512 [24 Cal.Rptr. 833, 374 R2d 801], our Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is a matter of common knowledge that the intoxicating effect of alcohol diminishes with the passage of time; hence, the probative value of a blood test diminishes as well. In a short period of time an intoxicated person may \u2018sober up\u2019 sufficiently to negate the materiality of a blood test where the sample has not been timely withdrawn. [Citation.]\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Schrieber </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 917, 922 [119 Cal.Rptr. 812] [\u201c[T]he greater the elapse of time the greater the benefit to the defendant, as the alcohol in his system becomes dissipated by the normal body processes.\u201d]; see also <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 549, fn. 8 [\u201cIf the blood was drawn more than three hours after the arrest, the test results would reflect a blood-alcohol level lower than the maximum that had been reached before the alcohol began to dissipate\u201d].) Consequently, regardless of when the blood sample was taken, the 0.17 percent test result, together with the other evidence, was sufficient to permit the hearing officer to find the DMV had met its burden of proof that Yordamlis was driving with 0.08 percent or more BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Santos </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>does not compel a contrary conclusion. In <em>Santos, </em>as here, the DMV introduced the arresting officer\u2019s sworn statement showing probable cause to arrest the driver and that she displayed objective indicia of intoxication, together with a blood test report showing, in that case, a BAC of 0.13 percent, with no indication of the time the sample was taken. The <em>Santos </em>court expressly recognized that (1) the untimed test results were admissible; (2) the hearing officer could rely on reasonable inferences and deductions from the evidence before him or her; and (3) if the blood was drawn more than three hours after the arrest, the test results would reflect a BAC lower than the maximum that had been reached before the alcohol began to dissipate. (5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 542, 549 &amp; fin. 8.) In contradistinction to this case, however, the driver in <em>Santos </em>introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>evidence that her BAG would have been less than 0.08 percent at the time of driving \u201cbecause at least the last drink she consumed would not yet have been absorbed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 548.) <em>In light of that evidence, </em>the <em>Santos </em>court correctly held that the time the blood sample was drawn was \u201ca piece of information critical to a determination\u201d of the driver\u2019s BAG at the time of driving. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 549.) Lacking such information, \u201c[t]he Department did not rebut respondent\u2019s evidence that the test results failed to prove her blood-alcohol level <em>at the time of driving </em>was 0.08 percent or higher\u201d <em>(ibid., </em>italics in original) and thus failed to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Here, of course, Yordamlis introduced no evidence contrary to the DMV\u2019s initial showing. The superior court thus erred in ruling the DMV failed as a matter of law in its burden of proof. (Cf. <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 526, fn. 6 [absent contrary evidence, circumstantial evidence driver was intoxicated when driving provided independent support for hearing officer\u2019s determination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In concluding the blood-alcohol test results were probative circumstantial evidence of Yordamlis\u2019s BAG at the time of driving, I in no way intend to condone the deficient procedures in this case that permitted collection of a blood sample with no indication of the time the sample was collected. Surely, it would be a simple matter to devise a specimen label or form that requires notation of the time a sample is collected, as, indeed, the DMV evidently has already done. I merely advance the unremarkable proposition that omission of the time here did not necessarily deprive the test results of probative value as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 5, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The inference, of course, is permissive, not required. But if the hearing officer in the exercise of his discretion draws the inference, he does not, as the superior court ruled, err as a matter of law in relying thereon in determining the DMV has made a prima facie case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
