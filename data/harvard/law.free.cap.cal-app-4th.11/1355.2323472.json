An undercover investigation by the Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Patient Abuse of the California Department of Justice revealed Dr. Gandotra had falsely billed Medi-Cal for patients who either were not treated or were treated by unlicensed medical assistants in violation of Medi-Cal regulations and state licensing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">In the published portion of the opinion, we discuss Dr. Gandotra\u2019s convictions of aiding and abetting his unlicensed assistant in the prescribing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>furnishing of controlled substances (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11153, subd. (a) [counts 6, 10], 11352 subd. (a) [count 8]). Dr. Gandotra contends these counts must be reversed because there was no evidence at trial that the challenged prescriptions and medications were medically inappropriate treatments of the symptoms described by the undercover agents to the unlicensed assistant. Dr. Gandotra argues that, on this record, had he personally prescribed and furnished the medications, he could not have been charged under these statutes. We uphold the convictions on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we modify the judgment against Dr. Gandotra by striking some fines imposed in violation of Penal Code section 654. We affirm the judgments as modified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">It is undisputed that Dr. Gandotra hired three unlicensed medical assistants (Carlos Cuellar, Ricardo Santos, and Winston Saunders) to provide medical care to Medi-Cal patients at Dr. Gandotra\u2019s clinic. The assistants were not licensed in California to practice medicine or write prescriptions, and they were not authorized Medi-Cal providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Based on the medical services provided by the unlicensed assistants, Dr. Gandotra billed Medi-Cal under his own provider number for their unauthorized services. Substantial evidence established that Dr. Gandotra also presented Medi-Cal claims for services that were never rendered. Rita Gandotra, Dr. Gandotra\u2019s wife, processed some of the clinic\u2019s false Medi-Cal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">As a result of their fraudulent Medi-Cal billing, Dr. Gandotra and his wife were charged with and convicted of the following felonies: Medi-Cal fraud (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14107 [counts 11-15]), grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (1) [count 16]), and conspiracy to defraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(4) [count 17]). They do not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions on these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">During the investigation which led to this prosecution, five undercover agents posing as Medi-Cal patients received either forged controlled substance prescriptions (signed with Dr. Gandotra\u2019s name) or small quantities of controlled substances from Dr. Gandotra\u2019s unlicensed medical assistants. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>a result of the medical treatments, prescriptions, and medications provided to the agents by the unlicensed assistants, Dr. Gandotra was charged with and convicted of aiding and abetting the unlicensed assistants in: (1) practicing medicine without a license (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2052 [counts 2, 9, misdemeanors]); (2) forging prescriptions (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4390 [counts 1,3, 5, 7, felonies]); and (3) distributing and prescribing controlled substances in violation of state law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4227 [count 4, a misdemeanor]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11153, subd. (a) [counts 6, 10, felonies]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352 [count 8, a felony]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Dr. Gandotra contends his convictions of aiding and abetting an unlicensed assistant to (I) prescribe (counts 6, 10) and (II) dispense (count 8) controlled substances must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Both defendants contend: (III) the trial court abused its discretion by failing to discharge a juror who became unable to perform his duty during deliberations; (IV) counts 11 through 15 (Medi-Cal fraud) must be reversed due to instructional errors; and (V) the trial court erred in imposing fines against Dr. Gandotra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">We find the jury properly convicted Dr. Gandotra of aiding and abetting Ricardo Santos, an unlicensed medical assistant, in prescribing controlled substances to Agents Milne (count 6, Diazepam) and Blair (count 10, Fiorinal with codeine No. 3) in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11153, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude there was sufficient evidence to support these verdicts and find no instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">A. <em>Count 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">Agent Milne, posing as patient Scott, went to the clinic and complained of sleeplessness and itching. Santos examined Milne and forged Dr. Gandotra\u2019s signature on a prescription for Diazepam, or Valium, a schedule IV controlled substance (\u00a7 11057, subd. (d)(7)). As a result of Santos\u2019s unlicensed treatment of Agent Milne, Dr. Gandotra was convicted of aiding and abetting Santos in (1) forging a prescription (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4390, [count 5]), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>and (2) issuing an unlawful prescription for a controlled substance (\u00a7 11153, [count 6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The trial court fined Dr. Gandotra $10,000 on count 5 and $20,000 on count 6. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we stay the fine imposed on count 5 in violation of Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">B. <em>Count 10</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Agent Blair went to the clinic posing as patient West and complained of a headache. Santos examined West and forged Dr. Gandotra\u2019s signature on a prescription for Fiorinal with codeine No. 3, a schedule III controlled substance (\u00a7 11056, subd. (e)). As a result of Santos\u2019s unlicensed treatment of Agent Blair, Dr. Gandotra was convicted of aiding and abetting Santos in unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance (\u00a7 11153, subd. (a) [count 10]), and was fined $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">C. <em>Section 11153 Bars Unlicensed Assistants From Writing Controlled Substance Prescriptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">Section 11153, subdivision (a) states: \u201cA prescription for a controlled substance shall only be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his or her professional practice. The responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances is upon the prescribing practitioner, but a corresponding responsibility rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. Except as authorized by this division, the following are not legal prescriptions: (1) an order purporting to be a prescription which is issued not in the usual course of professional treatment or in legitimate and authorized research; or (2) an order for an addict or habitual user of controlled substances, which is issued not in the course of professional treatment or as part of an authorized methadone maintenance program, for the purpose of providing the user with controlled substances, sufficient to keep him or her comfortable by maintaining customary use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">Section 11153, subdivision (b) states: \u201cAny person who knowingly violates this section shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or in the county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), or by both a fine and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">Section 11153 is part of the 1972 Uniform Controlled Substances Act (\u00a7 11000 et seq. [the Act]) which is division 10 of the Health and Safety Code. Subdivision (a) of section 11153 states that only \u201cpractitioners\u201d may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>issue prescriptions for controlled substances. \u201cPractitioner,\u201d as defined elsewhere in the Act, includes doctors, dentists, veterinarians, podiatrists, and, in specified instances, pharmacists, registered nurses, and physician\u2019s assistants acting within the scope of authorized projects. (\u00a7 11026.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Subdivision (b) of section 11153 describes the punishment that may be imposed against any \u201cperson\u201d who violates subdivision (a). \u201cPerson,\u201d as defined elsewhere in the Act, \u201cmeans individual, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, or association, or any other legal entity.\u201d (\u00a7 11022.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">According to the prosecution\u2019s trial theory, Santos was the unlicensed \u201cperson\u201d who violated section 11153 by knowingly issuing forged prescriptions for controlled substances. Dr. Gandotra, who gave Santos the prescription blanks bearing Dr. Gandotra\u2019s name and registry number, was the \u201cperson\u201d who aided and abetted Santos in writing the illegal prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">On appeal, Dr. Gandotra contends neither he nor Santos may be convicted under section 11153. According to Dr. Gandotra, Santos is immune from prosecution because \u201csection 11153 has been \u2018limited to physicians and pharmacists\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>[(1972)] 29 Cal.App.3d 551, 561 [105 Cal.Rptr. 664]).\u201d And since Santos could not have violated the statute, Dr. Gandotra contends he cannot be guilty of having aided and abetted Santos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">The referenced passage in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 551, 561 [105 Cal.Rptr. 664], however, concerned a different statute, former section 11162.5, which was repealed by the Act. Former section 11162.5 provided: \u201c \u2018A prescription, in order to be effective in legalizing the possession of unstamped narcotic drugs and eliminating the necessity for use of order forms, must be issued for legitimate medical purposes. Tlte responsibility for the proper prescribing and dispensing of narcotic drugs is upon the practitioner, but a corresponding liability rests with the pharmacist who fills the prescription. An order purporting to be a prescription issued to an addict or habitual user of narcotics, not in the course of professional treatment but for the purpose of providing the user with narcotics sufficient to keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use, is not a prescription within the meaning and intent of this division; and the person filling such an order, as well as the person using it, may be charged with violation of the law.\u2019 [Italics omitted.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 559.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Anderson </em>that the last sentence of section 11162.5 was unconstitutionally vague, the appellate court stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>\u201c[W]e conclude that. . . section 11162.5, <em>by its terms limited to physicians and pharmacists, </em>is sufficiently certain and not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 561, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">The <em>Anderson </em>court\u2019s dictum that former section 11162.5 was by its terms limited to physicians and pharmacists is neither controlling nor relevant to our determination of the broader scope of section 11153. When the Act was adopted in 1972, it replaced former division 10, Narcotics, which was enacted in 1939. (Stats. 1939, ch. 60, p. 755.) Parts of former division 10 were in turn derived from the 1929 \u201cact to regulate the sale, possession, distribution and use of habit forming, narcotic and other dangerous drugs and substances, and providing penalties for the violation thereof.\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 216, p. 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Section 1 of the 1929 act provided in relevant part: \u201cNo person, other than a physician, dentist or veterinary surgeon, duly licensed to practice in this state, shall write any prescription for any of the drugs mentioned in this section . . . (Stats. 1929, ch. 216, \u00a7 1, p. 381.) In addition, section 1 provided in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any practitioner of medicine, dentistry or veterinary medicine or any other person to . . . prescribe, administer to or furnish any of the foregoing substances for himself or any person not in the regular practice of his profession . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 216, \u00a7 1, p. 382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">Section 6 of the 1929 act made a violation of section 1 punishable by imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than six years for the first offense, and by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years for the second offense. (Stats. 1929, ch. 216, \u00a7 6, p. 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Reading section 11153 as a whole, we conclude the statute by its clear and unambiguous terms (1) prohibits nonpractitioners from writing controlled substance prescriptions, and (2) prohibits practitioners from writing controlled substance prescriptions that have no legitimate medical purpose and that are outside the course of their usual professional practice. These crimes have been on the books since at least the 1929 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">We reject Dr. Gandotra\u2019s assertion that his section 11153 convictions have rendered section 11150 superfluous. Section 11150 states: \u201cNo person other than a physician, dentist, podiatrist, or veterinarian . . . shall write or issue a prescription.\u201d Notably, section 11150 does not specify any criminal punishment for a violation of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">Section 11153 is a more specific statute than section 11150. Section 11153, unlike section 11150, sets forth the criminal punishment which may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>be imposed against any person who knowingly violates its terms. It thus appears that the Legislature intended to make the conduct described in subdivision (a) of section 11153 a crime without resort to section 11150, a more general statute which covers the same matter as section 11153. Accordingly, we distinguish <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Douglass) (1979) 24 Cal.3d 428, 434 [155 Cal.Rptr. 704, 595 P.2d 139], which is relied upon by Dr. Gandotra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">In <em>Douglass, </em>a Business and Professions Code section which described unprofessional conduct without specifying a criminal punishment was held not to constitute a misdemeanor made punishable by an omnibus penalty section covering other sections which did not specify a penalty. The <em>Douglass </em>majority concluded that the omnibus penalty section was \u201creasonably susceptible of a construction that would exclude from its reach an act or omission which is declared only to be \u2018unprofessional conduct\u2019 and is not expressly described as a violation or crime. . . . [T]he construction urged by the People, whereby [the omnibus penalty section] would make criminal acts or omissions specified as \u2018unprofessional conduct,\u2019 would render superfluous those provisions previously noted which expressly state that such conduct is criminal.\u201d (24 Cal.3d at p. 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Here, on the other hand, section 11153, a more specific statute which imposes a criminal penalty for the same conduct proscribed by section 11150, may be considered an exception to section 11150 under the \u201csupplanting\u201d doctrine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pangelina </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 414, 422, fn. 4 [172 Cal.Rptr. 661].) \u201cThe controlling principles are set forth in <em>In re Williamson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 651, at page 654 [276 P.2d 593] as follows:  \u2018 \u201cIt is the general rule that where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act, and thus conflict with it, the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment. Where the special statute is later it will be regarded as an exception to or qualification of the prior general one; and where the general act is later the special statute will be considered as remaining an exception to its terms unless it is repealed in general words or by necessary implication.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>{Lyons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 829, 839 [142 Cal.Rptr. 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Moreover, we further distinguish <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Douglass), supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 428, 434, on the ground that section 11153 contains no ambiguity and leaves no doubt as to its meaning.  In construing a Penal Code section, \u201cappellate courts first examine the language of the code section to determine whether the words used unequivocally express the Legislature\u2019s intent. If no ambiguity, uncertainty, or doubt about the meaning of the statute appear, the provision is to be applied according to its terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>without further judicial construction. [Citation.] [][] When the language of the section is on its face ambiguous or leaves doubt, however, the court must resort to extrinsic aids to ascertain the purpose behind the statute and give the provision a judicially created meaning commensurate with that purpose. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 149, 156 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46]; <em>In re Andrews </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 208, 212 [133 Cal.Rptr. 365, 555 P.2d 97].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Applying these rules here, we conclude the statutory language of section 11153 is conclusive. In a somewhat analogous situation, a minor who was found to have violated Penal Code section 288 (committing a lewd and lascivious on a child under age 14) and who was declared a ward of the juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602), challenged the application of Penal Code section 272, which \u201cprovides that \u2018[e]very person\u2019 who commits an act which causes or encourages any person under the age of 18 years to become delinquent is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(In re James P. </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 681, 685 [171 Cal.Rptr. 466].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The <em>James P. </em>court rejected the minor\u2019s contention that Penal Code section 272 applies only to adult offenders, stating: \u201cA statute free from ambiguity and uncertainty needs no interpretation. [Citations.] Interpretaton of a statute is for the purpose of ascertaining the legislative will. When this is clear, interpretation is not permitted. [Citation.] The term \u2018[e]very person,\u2019 as used in Penal Code section 272, is all-inclusive. It includes everyone, irrespective of whether the person is an adult or a minor. [Citation.] The term is specific, free from ambiguity, and therefore not subject to any construction other than a literal one.\u201d <em>(In re James P, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">In this case, section 11153, subdivision (b), uses the similarly unambiguous and all-inclusive term, \u201c[a]ny person.\u201d The term includes everyone, regardless of whether the person is licensed or unlicensed to write prescriptions. The term \u201cis specific, free from ambiguity, and therefore not subject to any construction other than a literal one.\u201d <em>(In re James P, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">D. <em>The Other Section 11153 Decisions Are Not Controlling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">By stating that controlled substance prescriptions \u201cshall only be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his or her professional practice\u201d (\u00a7 11153, subd. (a)), the Legislature has banned the writing of prescriptions by unlicensed assistants, without regard to whether the prescriptions were medically appropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>We acknowledge that the previously published section 11153 decisions did not involve prosecutions of licensed physicians for aiding and abetting their unlicensed assistants to violate the statute. They generally involved prosecutions either of licensed physicians for prescribing controlled substances to addicts (or undercover agents posing as addicts) without any legitimate medical purpose or appropriate medical examinations (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lonergan </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 82, 89-92 [267 Cal.Rptr. 887]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at pp. 555-556), or of licensed pharmacists for indiscriminately filling controlled substance prescriptions not intended for a legitimate medical purpose (see <em>Vermont &amp; 110th Medical Arts Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Board of Pharmacy </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 19, 22-25 [177 Cal.Rptr. 807]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The prior section 11153 decisions do not require or persuade us to conclude the statute may not be used to prosecute licensed physicians who aid and abet unlicensed assistants to write illegal prescriptions. As previously explained, the plain language of section 11153 is broader in scope than the reported decisions alone might suggest. As we read the unambiguous language of subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 11153, nonpractitioners may not issue even medically appropriate controlled substance prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Had Dr. Gandotra, rather than Santos, written the challenged prescriptions, the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove the absence of a legitimate medical purpose would have been fatal. But because an unlicensed individual, rather than Dr. Gandotra, wrote the prescriptions, whether or not the prescriptions were medically appropriate is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">We find nothing absurd about applying section 11153 literally in this case. (See <em>Isaac </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 260, 264 [146 Cal.Rptr. 396] [\u201cWhere the legislative intent is clear, penal statutes must be construed reasonably to effectuate such intent. They should not be read literally where to do so would lead to absurd consequences. [Citations.]\u201d].) The fact that Dr. Gandotra and Santos intended and caused no harm to their unsuspecting Medi-Cal patients does not make the application of section 11153 absurd. Since at least 1929, California has made it a crime for an unlicensed person to issue controlled substance prescriptions. The medical licensing board, not an individual physician-employer, must determine an employee\u2019s qualifications to issue controlled substance prescriptions. Whether the unlicensed assistants, by luck or by skill, issued appropriate prescriptions in this case is not determinative of whether Santos, with Dr. Gandotra\u2019s assistance, violated section 11153. The adoption of Dr. Gandotra\u2019s position essentially would repeal the prohibition against unlicensed medical practice unless the treatment harmed a patient. We think the Legislature properly could take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>safer course and proscribe <em>any </em>unlicensed medical practice, even if the treatment did not injure the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">We find the verdicts on counts 6 and 10 are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">E. <em>Instructional Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Dr. Gandotra next contends the trial court erroneously instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe defendant Dr. Gandotra is charged in counts 6 and 10 of the information with having committed the crime of aiding and abetting in the issuance of a prescription for a controlled substance without legitimate medical purpose while not acting in the usual course of the medical practice, a violation of Section 11153(a) . . . which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-8\">\u201cAny person who knowingly issues a prescription for a controlled substance other than for a legitimate medical purpose while not acting in the usual course of the medical practice, is guilty of the crime of prescribing a controlled substance without legitimate medical purpose, a felony[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-9\">\u201cIn order to prove the crime, each of the following elements must be proved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-10\">\u201c1. That a person knowingly issued a prescription for a controlled substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-11\">\u201c2. That a person was not acting in the usual course of the medical practice when the prescription for a controlled substance was issued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-12\">\u201c3. That the defendant Dr. Gandotra aided and abetted in the issuance of a prescription for a controlled substance(s), in violation of Section 11153(a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">Dr. Gandotra contends this instruction was erroneous for two reasons. First, practitioners are the only persons within the ambit of section 11153, which does not reach any other persons as was erroneously implied in the instruction. And second, the instruction omitted an essential element of a section 11153 violation\u2014the absence of a legitimate medical purpose in prescribing the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">We previously discussed and rejected both of these contentions. Accordingly, we find no instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">Dr. Gandotra was convicted on count 8 for aiding and abetting Santos in furnishing an undercover agent with two tablets containing lyienol with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>codeine No. 3, a schedule III controlled narcotic drug (\u00a7 11056, subd. (e)), in violation of section 11352, subdivision (a).  Dr. Gandotra contends count 8 must be reversed because section 11352 was aimed at curbing illicit drug trafficking and not the mere dispensing of two common analgesic tablets. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Agent McSween, posing as patient Smith, went to the clinic and complained of an earache. Santos examined Smith and signed Dr. Gandotra\u2019s name on prescriptions for eardrops, an antibiotic, and lyienol with codeine No. 3, a schedule III controlled substance (\u00a7 11056, subd. (e)). When Smith said she needed something for her immediate pain, Santos gave her two tablets of Tylenol with codeine No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">As a result of Santos\u2019s treatment of Agent McSween, Dr. Gandotra was charged with and convicted of aiding and abetting Santos in (1) forging a prescription (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4390; count 7); (2) unlawfully furnishing a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352; count 8); and (3) practicing medicine without a license (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2052; count 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The trial court fined Dr. Gandotra $10,000 on count 7, $20,000 on count 8, and $1,000 on count 9. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we stay the multiple fines imposed on counts 7 and 9 in violation of Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Section 11352, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this division, every person who transports, imports into this state, sells, furnishes, administers, or gives away. . . (2) any controlled substance classified in Schedule III. . . which is a narcotic drug, unless upon the written prescription of a physician . . . licensed to practice in this state, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Dr. Gandotra contends his conviction under this narcotics trafficking statute \u201cis nothing short of absurd,\u201d since the two common analgesic tablets were issued in good faith to a \u201cpatient\u201d who had complained of an earache. Dr. Gandotra asserts an exception must be allowed for the good faith furnishing of two common analgesic tablets following a medical examination by a foreign medical graduate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">In our view, however, Dr. Gandotra\u2019s license to practice medicine does not make him immune from prosecution under section 11352 for aiding and abetting an unlicensed person to dispense a controlled substance. Section 11352\u2019s exception for prescriptions by licensed physicians would only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>applicable if Dr. Gandotra personally had prescribed and dispensed the controlled substance to Agent McSween.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">We distinguish <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 124 [100 Cal.Rptr. 771], upon which Dr. Gandotra relies. In <em>Baker, </em>a licensed physician was charged with violating former section 11912 (now \u00a7 11379) by writing prescriptions (which were never filled) for restricted dangerous drugs upon request without first examining the \u201cpatients\u201d (who were undercover agents) to establish a medical necessity. Former section 11912 punished, among other things, the furnishing of \u201c \u2018any restricted dangerous drug, except upon the prescription\u2019 \u201d of a physician. <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d at p. 126.) The majority in <em>Baker </em>concluded a physician may not be prosecuted under former section 11912 for prescribing a restricted dangerous drug without a medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Recently, another appellate court disagreed with the <em>Baker </em>majority opinion and held that \u201ca physician who prescribes and, pursuant to that prescription, sells a controlled substance without a legitimate medical purpose can be tried for violating section 11379 [(former section 11912)].\u201d <em>(Perzik </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 898, 899 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 1].) The <em>Perzik </em>court concluded <em>Baker </em>was not dispositive for two reasons: \u201cThe <em>Baker </em>majority based its conclusion on (1) the factual circumstance that \u2018no drugs were ever obtained by means of the[] prescriptions\u2019 written by the physician, and (2) a legal examination of the statutory scheme that differentiated between narcotics and what were then classified as restricted dangerous drugs. [Citation.] Here, controlled substances were obtained from petitioner. Moreover, subsequent to <em>Baker </em>the Legislature enacted a massive reorganization of the statutory scheme, thereby largely obliterating the distinction between narcotics and all other controlled substances. (See Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3.)\u201d <em>(Perzik </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">We agree with the <em>Perzik </em>court\u2019s analysis of <em>Baker </em>and find that <em>Baker </em>is not dispositive of this case. Here, as in <em>Perzik </em>and unlike <em>Baker, </em>the undercover agent actually received a controlled substance. While there was no evidence that the drug in this case was medically inappropriate, the statute does not require such evidence when the charge is based on the furnishing of a controlled substance by an unlicensed person. Section 11352 specifically forbids \u201cevery person\u201d from distributing controlled substances \u201cunless upon the written prescription of a physician . . . licensed to practice in this state.\u201d \u201c \u2018Physicians are not excluded from the definition of the word \u201cperson\u201d and it is apparent that all persons, including physicians, are thereby forbidden under liability of criminal prosecution to furnish or sell any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>[nonnarcotic controlled substance] except as otherwise provided in the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>Perzik </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Dr. Gandotra may not rely on the medical appropriateness of Santos\u2019s illegal prescription to escape liability under section 11352 because Santos is not a licensed physician. Section 11158, subdivision (a) provides, among other things, that \u201cno controlled substance classified in Schedule III . . . may be dispensed without a prescription meeting the requirements of this chapter.\u201d It is undisputed that Santos dispensed a schedule III drug (Tylenol with codeine No. 3) without meeting the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">We reject Dr. Gandotra\u2019s assertion that his \u201cconduct in aiding and abetting Santos did not fall outside the scope of a physician\u2019s legitimate and usual course of practice in diagnosing and treating patients . . . .\u201d There is no authority for the proposition that physicians may permit unlicensed medical assistants to prescribe controlled substances on the physician\u2019s official blank prescription forms and distribute small quantities of such controlled substances. The jury was entitled to find that Dr. Gandotra\u2019s conduct in aiding and abetting Santos constituted a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">We also reject Dr. Gandotra\u2019s assertion that his conviction under section 11352 \u201cpush[ed] the criminal law beyond legitimate reason.\u201d Codeine No. 3 is without doubt a controlled substance, and the statute on its face prohibits the dispensing of a controlled substance without a valid prescription by a licensed physician. The Legislature did not exempt (as it could have) all licensed physicians from section 11352. Instead, the statute by its terms reaches \u201cevery person.\u201d For the reasons stated in part I, we conclude the unambiguous term needs no construction and should be applied literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">We modify the judgment against Dr. Gandotra by staying the fines and penalty assessments imposed on counts 2, 5, 7, 9, and 11 through 15, and direct the trial court on remand to recalculate the new total of fines and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>assessments owed. As modified, the judgments against both defendants are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Spencer, P.
