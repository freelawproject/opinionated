On the 17th, police arrested defendant for prowling and then released him after he had made bail. When defendant was arrested, he said, \u201cI want an attorney.\" The next day, the 18th, the police arrested defendant again, but this time for burglary and possession of stolen property. Defendant, on the way back to the station, after hearing that police had searched his apartment, volunteered to talk about his activities. On this occasion on the 18th, the police read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the end of a conversation concerning whether he should have counsel, defendant said he would talk to the police without counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">During the questioning, the police asked the defendant if he had ever hurt anyone during a robbery. He said no, but he had hurt someone in California. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Defendant then confessed to hurting a girl. His confession led to his conviction for the girl\u2019s murder. On the 19th, defendant asked police whether they had found out any more information about a girl being hurt in California. Defendant subsequently added additional details to his confession of the 18 th.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The victim was not wearing panties when police found her body; nor were her panties found either in the area of the body or anywhere else. On the 18th, defendant admitted to the officers that he had a \u201ctrademark\u201d in any of his acts which was to take some article of a girl\u2019s underclothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">However, on the 19th, defendant said in a confession that the girl was not wearing panties when he had picked her up. The victim\u2019s sister, however, testified that the victim meticulously wore underclothing. During the trial, defendant\u2019s wife testified that she had found a box of panties in the defendant\u2019s possession and that defendant had said the articles of underwear were from girls with whom he had gone to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On appeal defendant contends that (1) the trial court improperly admitted his statement to police officers in Nevada because he invoked his right to counsel and his right to remain silent; (2) if his statement is admissible because he failed to timely object, he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (3) he was denied a fair trial by the admission of evidence that he possessed a box of women\u2019s underwear and that taking women\u2019s underwear was his trademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\n<em>Admission of Defendant\u2019s Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">A. <em>Failure to Object</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Defendant claims that his statement to the police in Nevada is inadmissable because he invoked his right to an attorney and his right to remain silent. The People contend that this issue was not preserved for appeal because the defendant did not object to the admission during the trial. The People are correct. \u201c[Qjuestions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 542, 548 [146 Cal.Rptr. 732, 579 P.2d 1048], citing Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 826, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>853-854 [268 Cal.Rptr. 802, 789 P.2d 983].)  The defense attorney did not object to admission of the defendant\u2019s taped confession during the preliminary hearing; nor did he object to it during the trial. Defendant is therefore barred from raising it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Nevertheless, an appeals court may review the substance of a defendant\u2019s contention \u201c[t]o forestall any . . . charge of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 682 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351].)  \u201cTo establish entitlement to relief for ineffective assistance of counsel the burden is on the defendant to show . . . [that] it is reasonably probable that a more favorable determination would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 288 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892], citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699, 104 S.Ct. 2052],)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   We therefore address ourselves to the merits of an objection, based on <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602], to the Nevada confession in order to determine whether a failure to object was ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">B. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Defendant contends that he invoked his right to counsel and his right to remain silent, which he did not subsequently waive.  On appeal, \u201cdeterminations as to the validity of a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights\u2014a predominantly legal mixed question\u2014are reviewed independently. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mickey (1991) </em>54 Cal.3d 612, 649 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tyson </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1275, 1281 [243 Cal.Rptr. 525].)  Police must stop interrogating a defendant once he has requested counsel and cannot resume interrogation unless either the defendant\u2019s counsel is present or the defendant himself initiates further exchanges, communications, or conversations with the police. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 477, 484-485 [68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386, 101 S.Ct. 1880].)  If defendant waives his right to counsel, his waiver \u201cmust not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege, a matter which depends in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>each case \u2018upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>at p. 482 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">1. <em>Noncontinuous Custody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Police arrested defendant on the 17th for a misdemeanor offense of prowling. At that time he said, \u201cI want a lawyer,\u201d a clearly unambiguous request for an attorney. Defendant asserts that once he invoked his right to an attorney, the police could not thereafter interrogate him, based on the <em>Edwards </em>line of cases. <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>451 U.S. 477.) We determine that defendant\u2019s assertion would only have had merit, under these facts, had defendant remained in continuous custody. However, the police released defendant that day without his making any statements sought to be introduced. On the 18th, the police arrested the defendant again for a different offense, burglary. We therefore consider whether defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to counsel during the first custody on the 17th bars a waiver for purposes of defendant\u2019s interrogation after his second arrest on the 18th for a different offense. No California court has considered whether the <em>Edwards </em>rule applies where the defendant\u2019s custody was not continuous. However, numerous decisions from other jurisdictions have held that the rule does not apply in that situation. (See, e.g., <em>Dunkins </em>v. <em>Thigpen </em>(11th Cir. 1988) 854 F.2d 394, 397, and cases from three other circuits cited therein.) \u201cThe rationale behind these decisions generally is that a non-contrived, non-pretextual break in custody where the defendant has reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney dissolves an <em>Edwards </em>. . . claim.\u201d <em>(Willie </em>v. <em>State </em>(Miss. 1991) 585 So.2d 660, 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In our case, there is no indication in the record that the break in custody was contrived or pretextual. Police arrested defendant a second time on suspicion of a different offense with a one-day interval. The 11th Circuit held, in a similar situation with regard to a one-day break between custodies, that the break was sufficient to remove the <em>Edwards </em>bar. <em>(Dunkins </em>v. <em>Thigpen, supra, </em>854 F.2d at pp. 396-398.) On these facts, we hold that the <em>Edwards </em>ban was dissolved by the break with respect to defendant\u2019s request for counsel during his first custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">2. <em>Waiver of Right to Counsel and Right to Remain Silent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">We next examine defendant\u2019s contention that he invoked his right to counsel and to remain silent on the 18th.  \u201c[A] suspect may invoke his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>right to silence by any words or conduct reasonably inconsistent with a present willingness to discuss his case freely and completely.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duran </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 485, 492 [189 Cal.Rptr. 595], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 375, 382 [99 Cal.Rptr. 1, 491 P.2d 793].) As to determining whether a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, his requests need not be unequivocal or unambiguous statements to be construed as invocations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 165 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857]; <em>Duran, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.3d at p. 492.) However, if a defendant\u2019s statements are ambiguous, several cases have held that an interrogator can ask questions to clarify whether defendant has invoked his right to counsel. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Turnage </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 201, 211 [119 Cal.Rptr. 237]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fouche </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 776 F.2d 1398, 1404-1405 [80 A.L.R.Fed. 605], citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry </em>(5th Cir. 1984) 733 F.2d 1124, 1130-1131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Thompson, </em>defendant\u2019s statements were considered in context to determine what he meant by saying \u201c T don\u2019t even think I should be talking now . . . [The attorney told me] not to say nothin\u2019 about the case or anything, unless I had a lawyer present. . . . And I agreed with him,\u2019 [and] \u2018I\u2019m just going to go with what, you know, what the lawyer said because I. . . What else can I say, well, really. I don\u2019t want to see her here.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 165.) The court there determined the defendant was only giving reasons \u201cwhy he was willing to proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn fact, twice when the officers spoke of terminating the discussion, defendant insisted on continuing it. Defendant did not want the discussion to stop. The statements defendant relies on were intended to communicate only that, despite the advice he had received from the public defender, he was willing to talk in the hope of obtaining Lisa\u2019s release.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 165-166.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">As we will explain, we have determined that defendant\u2019s statements were ambiguous, in their context, and not an invocation of defendant\u2019s right to counsel. Defendant said, \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be [an attorney] running around here now, would there? ... I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d These questions do not indicate a lack of a present willingness to talk to the police without an attorney present, but on the contrary, in context of defendant\u2019s previous assertion that he wanted to confess and his answer to the officer\u2019s next question whether he wanted an attorney, indicated indecision.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Several cases have held somewhat similar language to constitute an invocation of a right to counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In California, <em>Duran </em>held that very similar language, \u201cHave you got an attorney right here present, close?\u201d was an invocation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duran, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.3d at p. 492.) <em>Duran </em>is factually distinguishable, however, from this case, because the <em>Duran </em>question was preceded by defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWell then I think it\u2019s better that I have an attorney here.\u201d <em>(Duran, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.3d at p. 490.) In light of the defendant\u2019s preceding statement in <em>Duran, </em>the question whether an attorney was close appears much more clearly as a lack of a present willingness to talk with police without an attorney present. In our case, defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t happen to be one running around here somewhere,\u201d was preceded by statements by the defendant that he wanted to confess. It is thus factually more ambiguous than the situation in <em>Duran.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Both <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>451 U.S. at page 485 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 386] and the later case of <em>Minnick </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 146, 149-150, [112 L.Ed.2d 489, 495, 111 S.Ct. 486] use language requiring defendant to <em>clearly assert </em>his right to counsel. Some courts have therefore found such language as \u201c \u2018might want to talk to a lawyer,\u2019. . . T don\u2019t know,\u2019. . . \u2018maybe I should call my attorney,\u2019 [and] \u2018maybe I should talk to an attorney before making a further statement,\u2019 \u201d ambiguous or equivocal. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Borg, supra, </em>918 F.2d at p. 1393, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fouche, supra, </em>776 F.2d at p. 1405, <em>Grooms </em>v. <em>Keeney </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 826 F.2d 883, 886-887, <em>Robtoy </em>v. <em>Kincheloe </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 871 F.2d 1478, 1482 and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em>733 F.2d at p. 1130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Comparing the defendant\u2019s language in the case at bar with these examples, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s language was ambiguous. Defendant\u2019s language was phrased in a question. It displayed a lack of decisiveness that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the defendant wanted to assert his right to counsel.  Under these circumstances, we hold that the police could properly, as they did, narrowly question the defendant further to determine whether he really wanted to assert his right to counsel. We realize that \u201cpostrequest responses to further interrogation cannot be used to cast doubt on the clarity of the initial request\u201d <em>(Owen </em>v. <em>State of Ala. supra, </em>849 F.2d 536, 539); however, here the initial statement was not an invocation, and it was followed by clarifying questions and repeated offers by the police to obtain counsel for defendant, until such time as defendant elected to waive his right to counsel and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The break in custody removed any possible <em>Edwards </em>bar on police initiated interrogation without counsel on the 18th. Defendant did not invoke the right to counsel or to remain silent on the 18th. Rather, he waived those privileges.  Defendant\u2019s confessions were therefore admissible. Because we have determined that any objection to the admissibility of these confessions would not have been successful and therefore any such objection would not have resulted in a fair probability of changing the result in the trial, we hold that defendant has no grounds for reversal based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of the Underwear Evidence</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Umlin, Acting P.
