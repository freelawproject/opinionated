Spitler, one of the original defendants in the McMartin Preschool child molestation prosecution, against Children\u2019s Institute International (CII) and Kathleen \u201cKee\u201d MacFarlane (MacFarlane), the child care professionals who interviewed the McMartin preschool children at the behest of the Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>District Attorney\u2019s Office. The trial court granted CII and MacFarlane\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that each of four statements identified as defamatory by plaintiff in the discovery process was either privileged, protected opinion, not \u201cof or concerning\u201d plaintiff, and/or barred by the statute of limitations. The court also denied plaintiff\u2019s request for additional discovery pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h). This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Plaintiff, a teacher at the McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, was indicted by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on March 22, 1984, for allegedly participating in the molestation of numerous children attending the preschool. After an 18-month preliminary hearing, plaintiff and 6 codefendants were bound over for trial. Ira Reiner, the then newly elected district attorney, dismissed charges against plaintiff and four of her codefendants on January 17, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">On June 12, 1986, plaintiff, together with her husband and two minor children, commenced this action against CII, MacFarlane, the County of Los Angeles, the City of Manhattan Beach, Astrid Heger, Bruce Woodling, Robert Philibosian, Wayne Satz, and ABC Television, Inc. The complaint asserted causes of action against CII and MacFarlane for conspiracy to violate civil rights, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, defamation, invasion of privacy, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, outrageous conduct and declaratory relief. Through a succession of demurrers, reviewed by this court in an opinion issued February 28, 1990, plaintiff\u2019s husband and children were dismissed and her action was reduced to a single claim for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">After her second amended complaint was found deficient for failing to plead the defamatory statements (or the circumstances allegedly making them nonprivileged) with the specificity required by this court\u2019s decision, plaintiff alleged in her third amended complaint \u201ca social and romantic relationship\u201d between MacFarlane and ABC broadcast journalist Wayne Satz, from which emerged the \u201csame defamatory statements\u201d allegedly made during three different time periods: (1) prior to the initiation of criminal charges against plaintiff; (2) during the course of the criminal proceedings; and (3) after criminal charges against plaintiff had been dismissed. Upon CII and MacFarlane\u2019s motion, the trial court struck the allegations concerning defamatory statements made during the course of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In response to interrogatories and document requests asking plaintiff to identify all statements made by CII or MacFarlane which purportedly defamed her, plaintiff proffered the following four statements: (1) testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>MacFarlane gave before a United States congressional subcommittee investigating the nationwide incidence of child abuse;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) statements made during interviews of the McMartin preschoolers; (3) a statement attributed to Dr. Astrid Heger, a medical consultant to CII, and published in Los Angeles magazine;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (4) comments MacFarlane made to the press following dismissal of charges against plaintiff and four of her codefendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contending that none of these statements was actionable, CII and MacFarlane moved the trial court for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication as to each statement. The court granted the motion, finding that each statement was either privileged, barred by the statute of limitations, protected opinion and/or not \u201cof and concerning\u201d plaintiff. The court also denied plaintiff\u2019s request for a continuance to conduct further discovery, and denied plaintiff\u2019s request for leave to amend to add allegations regarding her alleged belated discovery of defamatory statements as a basis for tolling the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The following questions are thus presented for review: (1) Did the trial court abuse its discretion in striking the allegations concerning defamatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>statements made by MacFarlane to Satz during the course of criminal proceedings? (2) Did the court properly determine that none of the four allegedly defamatory statements was actionable because either privileged, barred by the statute of limitations, protected opinion or not \u201cof and concerning\u201d plaintiff? (3) Did the court abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s request for leave to amend to add allegations regarding her belated discovery of defamatory statements for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">MacFarlane testified extensively at the preliminary hearing, implicating plaintiff in molestation of McMartin preschoolers. Plaintiff believes that this testimony was false, perjurious and defamatory. She acknowledges, however, that because these statements were given as testimony in a judicial proceeding, they are absolutely privileged under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In her third amended complaint, plaintiff added allegations that MacFarlane \u201cpreviewed\u201d her preliminary hearing testimony to Satz, who then \u201ccoached\u201d her in delivering that testimony at the preliminary hearing.  Because this communication between MacFarlane and Satz was not made \u201cin any judicial proceeding,\u201d plaintiff contends that it was not privileged, and the trial court therefore abused its discretion in striking the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The Supreme Court recently enunciated the \u201ctest\u201d for application of section 47(b) as follows: \u201cThe usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication (1) made injudicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 205, 212.) It appears from plaintiff\u2019s briefs that she challenges the first prong of this test (that MacFarlane\u2019s statements to Satz were made in a judicial proceeding) since she emphasizes that they were made <em>''\u2018'before </em>[MacFarlane\u2019s] testimony.\u201d However, there can be no doubt that the communications were made in a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>proceeding, for \u201cthe privilege is not limited to statements made <em>during </em>a trial or other proceedings, but may extend to steps taken prior thereto, or after-wards, provided they have some relation to it.\u201d (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 505, p. 591; see also, <em>Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 212 [the privilege applies \u201ceven though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no fiinction of the court or its officers is involved\u201d].) Were this not the rule, it would undermine the vital purpose effectuated by the litigation privilege, \u201cto afford litigants and witnesses [citation omitted] the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Plaintiff does not specifically assert that the purported statements fail to meet the remaining prongs of the test. In any case, they in fact do meet the requirements set forth in <em>Silberg. </em>As a principal witness in the preliminary hearing, MacFarlane was clearly \u201ca participant authorized by law.\u201d And since the substance of the allegation was that MacFarlane rehearsed her testimony with Satz, plaintiff can make no claim that there was no connection or logical relation between the defamatory statements and the judicial proceeding. Finally, as the <em>Silberg </em>court noted, \u201c[t]he requirement that the communication be in furtherance of the objects of the litigation is, in essence, simply part of the requirement that the communication be connected with, or have some logical relation to, the action, i.e., that it not be extraneous to the action. . . . The \u2018furtherance\u2019 requirement was never intended as a test of a participant\u2019s motives, morals, ethics or intent.\u201d (50 Cal.3d at pp. 219-220.) Therefore, the alleged statements meet the <em>Silberg </em>test, and are thereby privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Since the absolute privilege of section 47(b) applied to the alleged defamatory statements of MacFarlane made to Satz during the course of the preliminary hearing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in striking those allegations from the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">We next turn to the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of CII and MacFarlane.  Summary judgment is appropriate where the record establishes as a matter of law that no material disputed issue of fact exists or that the cause of action cannot prevail. <em>(Willcerson </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1224 [261 Cal.Rptr. 185].) Because the motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, this court will make its own independent determination of the questions of law raised in the motion. <em>(Slivinsky </em>v. <em>Watkins-Johnson Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 799, 803-804 [270 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>585]; <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Wells Fargo Bank, supra, </em>at p. 1225.) Applying the foregoing standard, we find the trial court properly granted CII and MacFarlane\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Because the judgment will be upheld if correct on any legal theory (see 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (9th ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 259, p. 266, and cases cited therein), we review below each of the allegedly defamatory statements to determine if it is not actionable because privileged, barred by the statute of limitations, protected opinion, or not \u201cof and concerning\u201d plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>MacFarlane\u2019s Congressional Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The privilege set forth in section 47(b) applies to \u201cany\u201d legislative proceeding. The use of the term \u201cany\u201d necessarily requires that its application be construed broadly and it certainly applies to congressional testimony. Plaintiff does not argue otherwise. She seems to contend, however, that the <em>republication </em>of MacFarlane\u2019s testimony in the local press, which in certain respects inaccurately reported the original testimony, was itself defamatory. In order to establish a cause of action against the defendants based on republication of an originally privileged communication, the plaintiff must allege that the republication was authorized, consented to, or participated in, by the defendants. If the privileged statements are changed in the republication, then the plaintiff must allege that the defendants authorized, consented to, or participated in the publication of the article <em>as changed. (Montandon </em>v. <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 932, 937 [120 Cal.Rptr. 196].) MacFarlane denies so doing, and plaintiff submits no evidence to contradict MacFarlane (and indeed does not even allege that MacFarlane consented to or participated in the republication). Therefore, no issue of fact exists for determination at trial regarding these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\n<em>Communications With McMartin Children During CIFs Diagnostic</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\n<em>Interviews</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">As this court ruled in its prior opinion in this case, pursuant to the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11172), CII and MacFarlane are absolutely immune from liability as a result of the professional services which they rendered in evaluating the McMartin preschoolers for possible sexual abuse. Though plaintiff argues that the immunity afforded CII and MacFarlane under Penal Code section 11172 is limited, we held otherwise in our prior opinion when we concluded: \u201cPenal code section 11172 was intended to provide absolute immunity to mandatory reporters for acts committed in a professional capacity or within the scope of employment giving rise to the obligation to report, as well as for the act of reporting.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>(Spitler </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Institute International </em>(Feb. 28, 1990) No. B036111 [nonpub. opn.]; see also <em>McMartin </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Institute International </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1393 [261 Cal.Rptr. 437]; <em>Krikorian </em>v. <em>Barry </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1211, 1223 [242 Cal.Rptr. 312].) Having stated the law of the case, we need not repeat our reasoning here.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\n<em>Dr. Heger\u2019s Alleged Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A Los Angeles magazine article reported that during the course of the McMartin investigation, which was \u201chitting dead ends,\u201d Dr. Astrid Heger, CII\u2019s medical consultant, \u201cadmonished the parents: \u2018You\u2019ve got to accept it. If your children went to McMartin, they were probably abused.\u2019 \u201d Plaintiff bases a claim for defamation against CII on this article.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Consistent with the foregoing discussion, however, this communication does not provide the basis for an actionable libel. According to the article, Dr. Heger\u2019s statement was made to McMartin parents in connection with the ongoing child abuse investigation. Dr. Heger was retained by CII, whose services had been requested by the district attorney\u2019s office. Thus, not only was the statement absolutely privileged pursuant to section 47(b)(2) (having met the four-part <em>Silberg </em>test discussed at pages 438-439, <em>ante), </em>but Dr. Heger is immune from liability for this statement since she was a mandatory reporter acting in her professional capacity pursuant to Penal Code section 11172.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">As stated above, CII cannot be held liable for any republication of Dr. Heger\u2019s absolutely privileged comments by third parties over whom it had no control. In the absence of any evidence (or even any allegation) that Dr. Heger or CII consented to, authorized, or participated in the republication of these remarks, plaintiff cannot succeed on a claim against CII based on this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\n<em>MacFarlane\u2019s Comments Regarding the District Attorney\u2019s Decision to</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\n<em>Dismiss Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">MacFarlane was asked her opinion about the district attorney\u2019s decision to drop the criminal charges against plaintiff and four of her codefendants. Plaintiff alleges that MacFarlane\u2019s response to that question, published in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Easy Reader, defamed her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that these statements were not \u201cof and concerning\u201d plaintiff, and were nonactionable opinion concerning a matter of public concern which did not imply an assertion of any undisclosed, verifiably false fact.  Plaintiff offers no argument or authority challenging this ruling on appeal. Because the trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed to be correct <em>(Denham </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564 [86 Cal.Rptr. 65, 468 P.2d 193]) and the burden is therefore on plaintiff to demonstrate the court\u2019s error <em>(Maria P. </em>v. <em>Riles </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295 [240 Cal.Rptr. 872, 743 P.2d 932]), we do not consider the issue on this appeal. <em>(In re Marriage of Ananeh-Firempong </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 272, 278 [268 Cal.Rptr. 83].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Finally, plaintiff makes the following arguments: (1) The statute of limitations should have been tolled due to her delayed discovery of certain defamatory statements made by MacFarlane; (2) \u201cTTie trial court prematurely put the burden of proof on plaintiff on a concealment issue\u201d (the \u201cconcealment issue\u201d presumably relates to the delayed discovery/statute of limitations argument); (3) section 48.7, subdivision (a) mandates tolling of the statute of limitation with respect to plaintiff\u2019s claims; (4) plaintiff should have been permitted leave to amend, although she does not state what amendments she would make if permitted to do so; and (5) plaintiff should have been permitted further discovery pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h), in order to counter Dr. Heger\u2019s recent denial that she made the statements attributed to her in the Los Angeles magazine article.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">None of the foregoing arguments, even if accepted by the court, would change the outcome of this case.  Because we find that the allegedly defamatory statements were privileged, plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in relying on the statute of limitations to disallow plaintiff\u2019s claims is unavailing. Similarly, because of our conclusion that the statements attributed to Dr. Heger in Los Angeles magazine were privileged under section 47, subd. (b), permitting plaintiff time to conduct additional discovery to contradict Dr. Heger\u2019s disavowal would be pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the trial court properly disposed of plaintiff\u2019s claims on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Fukuto, Acting P.

Although frightened and confused, the parents were reluctant to submit their children to a process they knew little about, but soon they agreed. A member of one of the groups later told a defense investigator that Heger admonished the parents: \u2018You\u2019ve got to accept it.
