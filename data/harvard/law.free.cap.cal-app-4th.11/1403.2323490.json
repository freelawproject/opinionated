J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aph\">This action for declaratory relief between two insurers involves errors and omissions insurance policies that provide coverage for claims made upon the insured. We must decide whether a claim is \u201cmade\u201d upon an insured when a claim letter is dated by the claimant, as asserted by plaintiff Safeco Surplus Lines Company (Safeco), or when the letter is received by the insured, as maintained by defendant Employer\u2019s Reinsurance Corporation (ERC). Like the trial court, we find that a claim is not \u201cmade\u201d until it has been received; therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for ERC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Safeco and ERC issued successive claims-made errors and omissions policies to the insured, McGee &amp; Thielen Insurance Brokers, Inc. (McGee), a California corporation. ERC\u2019s policy was in effect from November 23, 1985, to November 1, 1989; Safeco\u2019s policy took effect on November 1, 1989. Safeco\u2019s policy provides that its coverage is excess over any other valid and collectible insurance available to McGee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">McGee acted as insurance broker for Nacht &amp; Lewis Architects, Inc. (Nacht), one of the firms involved in the design and construction of the Sacramento County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">Late in 1989, Nacht\u2019s law firm (located in San Francisco) sent McGee a letter alleging that claims had been filed against Nacht for alleged design errors in the construction of the jail and tendering defense of these claims to McGee. Although the letter was dated October 27, 1989, McGee did not receive it until November 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">McGee subsequently tendered defense of the Nacht claim to both Safeco and ERC. Safeco agreed to defend under a reservation of rights; ERC refused to defend on the ground that Nacht\u2019s claim had not been made within its policy period, which ended on November 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">Safeco moved for a declaratory judgment as to which insurer owed McGee a defense and indemnity. Both parties thereafter moved for summary judgment on stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">Following argument, the trial court granted ERC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Safeco\u2019s motion. The court subsequently entered judgment in favor of ERC, from which Safeco now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">A motion for summary judgment is properly granted if the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)  The construction of an insurance contract is a question of law because it is based on the terms of the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence; accordingly, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation, but must consider the question de novo. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 866 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839]; <em>McGreehan </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 997, 1000-1001 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 235].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Although ambiguities in an insurance contract must ordinarily be construed against the insurer, this rule does not apply to a dispute between two insurers over their respective liabilities. <em>(Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1285, 1300 [260 Cal.Rptr. 190]; see <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 496, 506 [99 Cal.Rptr. 617, 492 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">In this case the parties dispute not only whether Nacht\u2019s claim against the insured was \u201cmade\u201d within ERC\u2019s policy period, but also whether ERC\u2019s policy requires that a claim be reported to the insurer within the policy period in order to trigger coverage, and whether, if so, the notice-prejudice rule bars ERC from denying coverage on the ground that the claim was not reported to it within its policy period.  However, we need not reach the latter questions, because we find, as did the trial court, that the answer to the first question is dispositive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">ERC\u2019s policy provided that the insurer agreed to pay damages for errors and omissions arising out of the insured\u2019s business \u201cas respects claims first made against the Insured during the policy period.\u201d The policy defined \u201cclaims first made\u201d as follows: \u201c[T]he term \u2018claims first made\u2019 shall mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>that the Insured has received notice of legal process, that <em>a demand for money or services has been made against the </em>Insured, or that the Insured has become aware of a proceeding, event or development which has resulted in or could in the future result in the institution of a claim against the Insured. In the event of any such proceeding, event or development, notice must be to the Corporation during the policy period; . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Safeco contends that Nacht\u2019s claim against McGee was a \u201cdemand for money or services made against the Insured\u201d and ERC does not disagree. Safeco contends further that Nacht\u2019s claim was \u201cmade\u201d against McGee on October 27, 1989, the date shown on the letter from Nacht\u2019s attorneys to McGee\u2014a date which falls within ERC\u2019s policy period but precedes that of Safeco. ERC disagrees. So did the trial court, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Safeco cites no authority holding that a claim is made on the date shown on the demand letter, rather than on the date the insured receives the letter. Safeco excuses this failure by asserting that the case is one of first impression in California. Examination of the cases Safeco relies on leads to a different conclusion. Even though the narrow question posed by Safeco may not have been addressed before in a published decision, the cases Safeco cites all support the principle (which common sense would also suggest) that a claim is not \u201cmade\u201d until the party against whom it is asserted has notice of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Safeco first cites <em>San Pedro Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sayre &amp; Toso, Inc. </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 750, 755 [21 Cal.Rptr. 844], and <em>Williamson &amp; Vollmer Engineering, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 261, 269 [134 Cal.Rptr. 427], for their interpretations of the terms \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201cdemand.\u201d <em>Williamson </em>notes: \u201cA \u2018claim\u2019 has been defined in ordinary English as \u2018a demand for something due or believed to be due.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dict. (7th ed. 1972) p. 152.) Each party refers to the definition of claim set forth in <em>San Pedro Properties, [supra,] </em>[disapproved on another issue[,] <em>Gyler </em>v. <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 216, 220 [110 Cal.Rptr. 139, 514 P.2d 1219]]. There the court collated definitions from prior precedents as follows: \u2018 \u201cThe word [claim] is derived from the Latin clamor, meaning a call, a demand. In its ordinary sense the term imports the assertion, demand or challenge of something as a right; the assertion of a liability to the party making it to do some service or pay a sum of money . . . .\u201d [Citation.] [f] A \u2018claim\u2019 refers to a debt due the claimant. [Citation.] It is a money demand. [Citation.] H] \u201cClaim\u201d means \u201cTo ask for, or seek to obtain, by . . . right, or supposed right; to demand as due.\u201d [Citation.] [f] A claim connotes an assertion of a legal right, as distinguished from a recognition of that right. . . .\u2019 \u201d (64 Cal.App.3d at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>Safeco boldly asserts that the <em>Williamson </em>and <em>San Pedro Properties </em>interpretation of \u201cclaim\u201d \u201clogically leads to only one conclusion: that the date of the October 27, 1989, letter signifies the date of the \u2018demand\u2019 for money or services made against McGee &amp; Thielen.\u201d We do not grasp the logic of Safeco\u2019s conclusion. All the operative verbs recited in the <em>Williamson-San Pedro Properties </em>definitions of \u201cclaim\u201d necessarily imply two-party transactions. One cannot meaningfully \u201cask for,\u201d \u201cseek to obtain,\u201d \u201cdemand as due,\u201d or \u201cassert\u201d a supposed right in a vacuum. To have a meaning, this act must have an audience. Thus the definitions cited by Safeco logically lead to the conclusion that a claim is \u201cmade\u201d only when the party claimed against learns of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Furthermore, although the issue of when a claim is made was not presented in <em>Williamson </em>or <em>San Pedro Properties, </em>both cases contain language which undercuts Safeco\u2019s position. In <em>San Pedro Properties </em>the court noted that the claims at issue were made on the dates the parties against whom the claims were made received notice of the claims. (203 Cal.App.2d at pp. 753, 755.) Similarly, in <em>Williamson </em>the court found that the plaintiff knew of the claim against it because it had received a letter giving notice thereof. (64 Cal.App.3d at pp. 268-270.) Neither court stated or implied that the claims could have been deemed made absent such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Safeco also relies on <em>Employers Reinsurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 545 [230 Cal.Rptr. 792]. Its reliance acts as a boomerang, because <em>Phoenix </em>expressly refutes Safeco\u2019s argument. In <em>Phoenix, </em>the errors and omissions policy at issue provided coverage \u201c \u2018if claim is made <em>or suit is brought </em>against the insured during the policy period.\u2019 \u201d (186 Cal.App.3d at p. 551, italics added.) Construing the underlined phrase, the court held that the filing of a suit triggered coverage even if the defendant had not yet received service or other notice of the suit. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 554-555.) Safeco contends that the same logic applies by analogy to the phrase \u201cclaim is made.\u201d However, Safeco overlooks die fact that the defendant in <em>Phoenix </em>likewise argued the two phrases were analogous, but failed to persuade the court: \u201c. . . [T]here is an inherent difference between the \u2018making\u2019 of a claim and the \u2018bringing\u2019 of a lawsuit. <em>The former, by its very nature, involves some kind of notice. The latter only requires the filing of a complaint.\" (Id. </em>at p. 555, italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Thus the authority Safeco relies on tells against its position. So does common sense. As ERG points out, Safeco\u2019s proposed rule is unworkable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>because it could seldom if ever be proved when a claimant \u201cmade\u201d his claim under that rule. It is common knowledge that letters do not always go out in the mail on the dates they are written or addressed. Thus a rule that looked only to the timing of the claimant\u2019s actions would introduce an intolerable element of uncertainty which the correct rule avoids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">In its reply brief Safeco asserts that ERC, having failed to include a receipt requirement in the language of its claims-made policy, is now trying to rewrite the policy by \u201creading in\u201d such a requirement. In support of this contention Safeco cites cases from various foreign jurisdictions in which the claims-made policy provisions expressly referred to \u201cthe <em>receipt </em>of a demand for money or services\u201d by the insured, unlike the corresponding provision of ERC\u2019s policy. <em>(Rentmeester </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Lawyers Mut. </em>(1991) 164 Wis.2d 1 [473 N.W.2d 160, 163], italics added; <em>Hofing </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Companies </em>(1991) 247 N.J.Super. 82 [588 A.2d 864, 867]; <em>Buckhannon-Upshur Cty. Airport </em>v. <em>R&amp;R Coal </em>(W.Va. 1991) 413 S.E.2d 404, 408; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Sauvinet </em>(La.Ct.App. 1988) 525 So.2d 686, 688.) However, as we have explained, ERC\u2019s interpretation of its policy \u201creads in\u201d nothing, but simply construes the policy according to the logical implications of its terms. The fact that other insurance policies have incorporated an express reference to the insured\u2019s receipt of a demand for money or services does not prove that an insurer must make such express reference to establish the requirement of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Here, a \u201cdemand for money or services\u201d was made on November 6, 1989, when McGee received the letter from Nacht\u2019s law firm. The demand was made during Safeco\u2019s (but not ERC\u2019s) coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">The trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">Davis, J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Although the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to ERC does not state the reasons for the court\u2019s decision, the court made these reasons clear during the hearing on its tentative ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">Safeco asserts that even though the trial court did not reach the reporting and notice-prejudice issues, we must do so because we are required to make our own independent interpretation of ERC\u2019s policy and because the parties raised these issues in the underlying cross-motions. Safeco is mistaken. On review of a grant of summary judgment we will affirm if the judgment may be upheld on any ground <em>(Snider </em>v. <em>Snider </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 756 [19 Cal.Rptr. 709]) and if we find by independently interpreting the writing at issue that the trial court\u2019s resolution of a single question correctly decided the case we need not discuss other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">The defendant in <em>Phoenix </em>came at the question from the opposite side. Having sought to deny coverage where suit had been brought but not yet served, it argued that the phrase \u201csuit is brought\u201d necessarily implied the giving of notice, by analogy to the phrase \u201cclaim is made.\u201d (186 Cal.App.3d at p. 555.) However, the court\u2019s reasoning works in both directions, denying Safeco as well as the defendant in <em>Phoenix </em>the benefit of the proposed analogy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
