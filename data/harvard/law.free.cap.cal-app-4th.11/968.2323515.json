A jury convicted him of second degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187. Unless otherwise noted, statutory references are to the Penal Code) and other related charges. On appeal he contends: (1) there is insufficient evidence of implied malice to sustain the murder conviction, (2) the trial court committed instructional error, and (3) he was prejudiced by wearing jail clothing during the trial. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Appellant was charged with second degree murder (\u00a7 187, count I), gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a); count II), driving under the influence of alcohol and causing great bodily injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a); count III), and driving while having .08 percent blood alcohol and causing great bodily injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b); count IV). Two prior driving-under-the-influence convictions were alleged (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13202.5; counts III and IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations. His motion to bifurcate trial of the allegations was granted, and he then admitted both allegations. A jury convicted appellant of all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion to modify his conviction of second degree murder was denied. The trial court sentenced appellant, on count I, to state prison for 15 years to life, and stayed the 2-year state prison terms on counts III and IV. Count II, on the People\u2019s motion, was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">On Tuesday, April 9, 1991, about 4 a.m\u201e John Forbes was on his way to work as a shuttle driver for Prime Time Shuttle when he noticed a dark Audi without lights. Mr. Forbes had exited the 5 Freeway onto Sunland Boulevard when the Audi passed him, going west on Sunland at least 45 miles per hour in a posted 30 mile-per-hour zone. Appellant was the driver and sole occupant of the Audi.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The Audi passed San Fernando Road and when it crossed some railroad tracks it went airborne. Some distance ahead, a yellow Volkswagen, with its lights on, and plainly visible, entered Sunland from a gas station and proceeded east. The Audi continued at a high rate of speed and, while on the wrong side of the road, struck the Volkswagen on the driver\u2019s side. A police officer a block or two away heard the collision and immediately responded to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Appellant was behind the wheel of the Audi, obviously intoxicated but not seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Twenty-four-year-old Todd Makowski was pinned in his Volkswagen and suffered major injuries. He died on the operating table at 7:20 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">A police investigation determined the Audi had left 8 to 10 feet of pre-impact skid marks and was moving at 45 miles per hour at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">On the front floorboard of the Audi there were three empty twelve-ounce beer containers\u2014two cans and one bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Appellant was arrested and jailed. Two blood samples were taken from him. The 8:30 a.m. sample registered .26 percent blood alcohol. The 5:12 a.m. sample registered .31 percent blood alcohol. An expert testified that at 4 a.m., the time of the accident, appellant\u2019s blood alcohol would have been .32 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">The director of a court referral driving-under-the-influence course testified that appellant attended the 10-week course from November 1989 to March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>1990. The course emphasized the dangers of driving under the influence and explained the effects of alcohol on the body. It directly dealt with injuries and death caused by drunk drivers. Appellant\u2019s class was in Spanish and had 12 to 15 attendees. A portion of a course videotape, \u201cSo Long Pal,\u201d was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">There was no defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">1. <em>Appellant contends there is insufficient evidence of implied malice to sustain the murder conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The seminal case on drunk-driving-murder is <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279]. It stated: \u201cWe have said that second degree murder based on implied malice has been committed when a person \u2018does an act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with conscious disregard for life . . . .\u2019 Phrased in a different way, malice may be implied when defendant does an act with a high probability that it will result in death and does it with a base antisocial motive and with a wanton disregard for human life.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300.) (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.) <em>Watson </em>continued: \u201cBased upon our independent review of the record, we believe that there exists a rational ground for concluding that defendant\u2019s conduct was sufficiently wanton to hold him on a second degree murder charge. The facts upon which we base this conclusion are as follows: Defendant had consumed enough alcohol to raise his blood alcohol content to a level which would support a finding that he was legally intoxicated. He had driven his car to the establishment where he had been drinking, and he must have known that he would have to drive it later. It also may be presumed that defendant was aware of the hazards of driving while intoxicated.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Appellant focuses upon the second <em>Watson </em>factor and contends the evidence of implied malice is insufficient because \u201c[t]here was no evidence appellant knew at the time he made the decision to drink that he was going to be driving.\u201d Appellant is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">There is little to distinguish the instant case from <em>Watson </em>with respect to the decision to drink and drive. In <em>Watson </em>the defendant \u201cconsumed large quantities of beer in a Redding bar.\u201d (30 Cal.3d at p. 293.) Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>consumed even larger quantities of beer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Watson </em>the fatal driving occurred <em>in Redding </em>an hour and a half after the defendant left the Redding bar. <em>(Ibid.) Watson </em>is silent regarding <em>how the </em>defendant \u201cleft\u201d the bar, whether by driving his car or by some other means. More importantly, <em>Watson </em>is silent regarding what the defendant did during the hour and a half after he left the bar and before the accident. In the instant case the circumstances suggest, at least as strongly as in <em>Watson, </em>that appellant \u201cmust have known that he would have to drive\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 300) after drinking. Appellant\u2019s .32 percent blood-alcohol level indicates prolonged drinking, time enough to consume approximately 12 to 15 beers. Since appellant was driving alone at 4 a.m., it is a reasonable inference that when he \u201cleft\u201d wherever he had been drinking, his car was available and he had intended to drive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">But even if, when appellant was drinking, he did not know he would have to drive\u2014still the evidence of implied malice is sufficient to sustain the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 984, 988 [218 Cal.Rptr. 567].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The cases have relied upon some or all of the following factors in upholding drunk-driving-murder convictions: (1) a blood-alcohol level above the .08 percent legal limit; (2) a predrinking intent to drive; (3) knowledge of the hazards of driving while intoxicated; and (4) highly dangerous driving. In the instant case there was substantial evidence of all four factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">We find the instant evidence of implied malice indistinguishable from other cases upholding drunk-driving-murder convictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>David </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1109 [281 Cal.Rptr. 656]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 734 [275 Cal.Rptr. 498]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 395 [260 Cal.Rptr. 474]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brogna </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 700 [248 Cal.Rptr. 761]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCames </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 525 [224 Cal.Rptr. 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Albright </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 883 [219 Cal.Rptr. 334]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 984.) Appellant cites no case where a drunk-driving-murder conviction has been reversed for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>2. <em>Appellant contends the trial court committed instructional error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The trial court instructed the jury about implied malice in accordance with CALJIC No. 8.11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also instructed the jury about voluntary intoxication and specific intent in accordance with CALJIC No. 4.21 (1989 rev.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant does <em>not </em>contend either instruction misstates the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">After they were instructed, and during their deliberations, the jury asked the trial court this question: \u201cAre we supposed to apply the implied malise [s\u00edc] portion of the law at the point in time when the defendant was intoxicated or prior?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">After first discussing this question with counsel, the trial court informed the jury that its question \u201cmay well be answered by ... a combination of instruction 8.11 and 4.21.\u201d The court added: \u201cThat is all I can tell you at the moment, so why don\u2019t you go back and see if anybody has understood what I said. [j[] Then if you need some additional assistance, why, then we will come here ...\u201d The jury did not seek additional assistance regarding its question.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Appellant contends that in light of the jury\u2019s question, CALJIC Nos. 8.11 and 4.21 were inadequate and \u201cthe court should have instructed the jury to apply the voluntary intoxication instruction [CALJIC No. 4.21] both to the time appellant decided to drive, and to the time appellant chose to drink.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on applicable general principles of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 503 [244 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803].) It did so. \u201c[I]t was defendant\u2019s obligation to request any clarifying or amplifying instructions . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Appellant made no such request to the trial court and \u201cerror cannot now be predicated upon the trial court\u2019s failure to give them on its own motion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633, 639 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Ricardi </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 249 [270 Cal.Rptr. 425] is misplaced. <em>Ricardi </em>found error in the trial court\u2019s omission of CALJIC No. 4.21, an instruction given in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">3. <em>Appellant contends he was prejudiced by wearing jail clothing during the trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201c[A] criminal defendant is entitled to be tried in ordinary clothing.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 488, 494 [183 Cal.Rptr. 64, 645 P.2d 115].) But \u201cthe right may be waived by a failure to timely object or otherwise bring the matter to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Nor does a failure to request civilian clothes for appellant suggest that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance to appellant. \u201c[T]here may be instances where for tactical reasons the defendant may wish to be tried in jail garb. [Citation.] Recognizing that the defendant is entitled to be tried in ordinary clothing, an attorney may nevertheless decide, based on the peculiar circumstances of an individual case, not to exercise that right.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 496.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 11, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Watson\u2019s blood alcohol, 30 minutes after the accident, was .23 percent; appellant\u2019s blood alcohol about an hour after the accident was .31 percent. Appellant had apparently been drinking beer because two empty beer cans and one empty beer bottle were found in his car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The instruction reads: \u201c \u2018Malice\u2019 \u201d may be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">\u201cMalice is implied when:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">\u201c1.
