Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co. </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1041 [282 Cal.Rptr. 277, 811 P.2d 296] (cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>den. Nov. 12, 1991, _ U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 450, 112 S.Ct. 430]), our Supreme Court held that Civil Code section 31 ll<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, which creates liens on real property in favor of trust funds established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) The question before us is whether the same thing is true relative to stop notice statutes, as pertains to these same trust funds. (\u00a73156 et seq. &amp; \u00a7 3179 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">The named plaintiffs in this suit are: Carpenters Health and Welfare Trust Fund for California, Carpenters Vacation and Holiday Fund for Northern California, Carpenters Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund for Northern California, and Carpenters Annuity Trust Fund for Northern California (Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds). These are multi-employer trust funds established under collective bargaining agreements and employee pension benefit plans or employee welfare benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA. (See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1), (2)(A), &amp; (21)(A).) These trust funds are funded through employer contributions for covered employees. In this case, the covered employees are members of unions affiliated with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (Union).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">In September 1988, The Housing Group\u2014Northern California (Housing Group), as owner of certain real property in Danville, executed plans to develop its property into a residential subdivision known as the \u201cHidden Hills Development.\u201d It contracted with Jack Raley Construction, Inc. (Raley Construction), to do the rough carpentry work and framing for the 43-unit development. Raley Construction performed this work between September 1988 and September 1989 using employees covered by the Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that prior to its involvement in the development, Raley Construction entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Union which incorporates \u201cthe Carpenters\u2019 Master Agreement for Northern California and the various trust agreements establishing each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 trusts. By these agreements [Raley Construction] promised that it would pay to the Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds fringe benefit contribution[s] at [specified] rates ... for each hour of covered carpentry work . . . .\u201d However, according to the complaint, during the months of June, July, August and September 1989, the company failed to make the agreed contributions. As a consequence, plaintiffs allege that Raley Construction owes the Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds $82,154.67 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">To secure their claim, plaintiffs, on October 16, 1989, recorded mechanics\u2019 liens with the county recorder\u2019s office against certain lots in the Hidden Hills Development, pursuant to section 3111. Thereafter, in order to release the real property from these liens, the Housing Group obtained a release bond from defendant Developers Insurance Company (Developers). Developers assumed the role of a surety by way of the transaction. The release bond was recorded with the county on or about November 30, 1989. Then on April 18, 1990, plaintiffs filed a complaint for enforcement of the mechanics\u2019 liens release bond against Developers. Developers answered the complaint. Additionally, Developers and the Housing Group filed a cross-complaint against Raley Construction for indemnity and alleged breach of contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">Plaintiffs took additional action as well. On October 27, 1989, plaintiffs served Central Bank, the construction lender on the Hidden Hills Development, with a bonded stop notice, pursuant to section 3159.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice required Central Bank to withhold sufficient money from the construction loan to cover plaintiffs\u2019 claim. On or about April 11, 1990, the Housing Group secured a release of the stop notice bond from Developers. The effect of the release was to prevent plaintiffs from enforcing the stop notice and to substitute the bond as a basis for payment of all unpaid fringe benefit contributions. In response, plaintiffs, on June 4, 1990, filed a complaint against Developers for enforcement of the stop notice release bond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>Subsequently, both complaints filed by plaintiffs were consolidated and stayed pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1041, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation. Part of that stipulation states: \u201cThe undersigned parties further agree that the issue presented in the <em>El Capitan Development </em>Case is dispositive of the question of ERISA preemption of the lien and/or stop notice in this action.\u201d The <em>El Capitan </em>decision was handed down in June 1990. Based on that decision and the parties\u2019 stipulation, Developers filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the motion as to both the stop notice claims and the mechanics\u2019 lien claims. Plaintiffs appeal only from that portion of the judgment pertaining to the stop notice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">In <em>El Capitan, supra, </em>Carpenters Southern California Administrative Corporation (CSCAC), the administrator of various multi-employer trust funds established under collective bargaining agreements (including the Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds), brought suit to foreclose certain mechanics\u2019 liens it had filed against certain real property owned by the El Capitan Development Company (El Capitan). The liens were filed pursuant to section 3111. El Capitan was in the process of building a condominium project on the property. The general contractor of the project had subcontracted with Pacific Southwest Framing (Pacific) to do part of the framing work. In its complaint, CSCAC alleged that Pacific and John Hall Enterprises were one and the same entity and that the latter company was delinquent in making fringe benefit contributions to CSCAC pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. El Capitan demurred to CSCAC\u2019s complaint, arguing that ERISA preempted section 3111. The trial court granted the demurrer with leave to amend. When CSCAC declined to amend the complaint, the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal. The Court of Appeal concluded that ERISA preempted section 3111 and affirmed the judgment of dismissal. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">In reaching its decision, the <em>El Capitan </em>court looked initially at ERISA\u2019s broad preemption provision which expressly covers \u201c \u2018any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter <em>relate to </em>any employee benefit plan . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1047.) Noting that the term \u201crelate to\u201d had been broadly interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, it said, \u201cMost recently, in <em>[Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon </em>(1990) 498 U.S. 133 [112 L.Ed.2d 474, 111 S.Ct. 478], [that] court explained that \u2018[] Congress used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>those words in their broad sense, rejecting more limited pre-emption language that would have made the clause \u201capplicable only to state laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] This is consistent with the court\u2019s previous instruction in <em>[Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 41 (95 L.Ed.2d 39, 107 S.Ct. 1549)] that1 \u201ca state law \u2018relate[s] to\u2019 a benefit plan, \u2018in the normal sense of the phrase, <em>if it has a connection with or reference to such a </em>plan.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] . . . [][] In determining whether section 3111 \u2018relates to\u2019 a benefit plan, we take note that the United States Supreme Court has on several occasions stated that \u2018state laws which make \u201creference to\u201d ERISA plans are laws that \u201crelate to\u201d, those plans within the meaning of \u00a7 514(a) [of ERISA].\u2019 [Citations.] Indeed, the court has \u2018virtually taken it for granted that state laws which are \u201cspecifically designed to affect employee benefit plans\u201d are pre-empted . . \u201e [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 1048-1049, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Focusing directly on section 3111, the <em>El Capitan </em>court found that the statute is specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans. It said, \u201cThe section expressly refers to \u2018trust fund[s] established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement\u2019 and provides to such funds a mechanic\u2019s lien remedy not provided by Congress. Thus, [it] singles out ERISA plans for special treatment.\u201d <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049.) The court further reasoned, \u201cERISA plans do not furnish labor or materials for construction projects. Accordingly, to treat them as persons who do furnish labor or materials is to single them out for special treatment. Because section 3111 singles out ERISA plans for special treatment and is, in fact, designed to affect them specifically, we conclude the statute \u2018relates to\u2019 ERISA plans.\u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">The <em>El Capitan </em>court rejected any notion that the preemption question turns on a finding that the law at issue actually regulates an ERISA plan. Nevertheless, it noted that when it <em>can </em>be said that a state law regulates the terms and conditions of an ERISA plan, this necessarily includes a finding that the law \u201crelates to\u201d the plan as well. It said it found that section 3111 regulates ERISA plans by creating a funding mechanism not provided by Congress [i.e., a lien against real property]. \u201cHence, the fact that section 3111 regulates ERISA plans provides further support for the conclusion that section 3111 \u2018relates to\u2019 ERISA plans and is preempted.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 1051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">\u201cIn essence, section 3111 creates a new state cause of action for the collection of contributions owed to benefit plans and makes an additional entity liable for such contributions. ...[][] [However,] ERISA preempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>new state-law causes of action for the collection of contributions because, consistent with its goal of providing \u2018appropriate sanctions and ready access to federal courts\u2019 [citation], ERISA itself provides the remedies for the collection of contributions.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 1052.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Finally, differentiating section 3111 from a Georgia general garnishment statute which the United States Supreme Court held was not federally preempted in <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Lanier Collections Agency &amp; Serv. </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 825 [100 L.Ed.2d 836,108 S.Ct. 2182], the <em>El Capitan </em>court said, <em>\u201cMackey's </em>analysis of Georgia\u2019s general garnishment procedures does not save section 3111 from preemption. The decision concerned a third party action for enforcement of judgments against beneficiaries of an ERISA plan. ERISA does not contain remedial provisions for such actions. Largely for this reason, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u2018state-law methods for collecting money judgments must, as a general matter, remain undisturbed by ERISA; otherwise, there would be no way to enforce such a judgment won against an ERISA plan.\u2019 [Citation.] The present case is not similar because ERISA expressly provides remedies for recovery of delinquent contributions to employee benefit plans.\u201d (53 Cal.3d at p. 1055.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">\u201cCalifornia\u2019s trust fund lien statute does more than provide a new enforcement mechanism for collecting judgments; it creates new substantive rights. [Citation.] Section 3111 permits the creditor (the trust fund) to enforce a debt (for outstanding fringe benefit contributions) not against the debtor (the defaulting employer), but against the property of a third party that is not a party to the collective bargaining agreement. Section 3111 gives a trust fund a right to a lien against the property of third parties, such as El Capitan, that the fund would not, and does not, have under ERISA. In the absence of section 3111, El Capitan would have no liability to the funds for the fringe benefit contributions. Therefore, section 3111 cannot be upheld under <em>Mackey </em>as it creates a new substantive right against the property of a third party that is not created by ERISA and, thus, goes beyond being a mere means of enforcing a judgment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1055.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">In the same way the mechanic\u2019s lien procedure outlined in <em>El Capitan </em>was found to be preempted by ERISA, the stop notice procedure at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>issue in the instant case is preempted as well. By their terms, the stop notice provisions (\u00a7 3156 et seq. &amp; \u00a7 3179 et seq.) incorporate section 3111 by reference, thereby making express reference to the entities covered by section 3111\u2014i.e., \u201ctrust fiind[s] established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d As was found in the case of section 3111, this part of the stop notice provisions \u201crelates to\u201d ERISA plans by virtue of the fact that it is specifically designed to affect them. It provides such funds a stop notice remedy not provided by Congress, thus singling out ERISA plans for special treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Section 3159 states, \u201cAny of the persons named in Sections 3110, 3111, and 3112 may . . . give to a construction lender a stop notice or a bonded stop notice.\u201d As so defined, \u201cpersons\u201d eligible to file a stop notice or a bonded stop notice are \u201c[m]echanics, materialmen, contractors, subcontractors, lessors of equipment, artisans, architects, registered engineers, licensed land surveyors, machinists, builders, teamsters, and draymen, and all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon ... on, or furnishing materials or leasing equipment to be used or consumed in or furnishing appliances, teams, or power contributing to a work of improvement. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3110); or section 3111 trust funds; or \u201c[a]ny claimant who, at the instance or request of the owner ... of any lot or tract of land, has made any site improvement. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3112). This is the same category of entities eligible to file mechanics\u2019 liens under section 3109 et seq. As was noted in <em>El Capitan </em>in relation to the latter provisions, \u201cERISA plans do not furnish labor or materials for construction projects. Accordingly, to treat them as persons who do furnish labor or materials is to single them out for special treatment.\u201d <em>(Carpenters So. Cal. Admin. Corp. </em>v. <em>El Capitan Development Co., supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1049, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Because the stop notice statutes single out ERISA plans for special treatment and are, in fact, designed to affect them specifically, we conclude that they \u201crelate to\u201d these plans and are preempted. (53 Cal.3d at p. 1049.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">Moreover, while not a prerequisite to a preemption finding, the stop notice procedure, like the lien procedure, regulates ERISA plans by creating a funding mechanism not provided by Congress (i.e., a hold on construction loan moneys). It creates a new state cause of action for the collection of contributions owed to benefit plans and makes an additional entity liable for such contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">Plaintiffs here attempt to distinguish the stop notice provisions from the lien provisions. They argue that the stop notice procedure does not create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>any additional funding mechanism or any new substantive rights but merely mandates that the construction lender set aside funds it would normally pay the contractor until the dispute is settled. We find appellants\u2019 argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">As pertains to section 3111 trust funds, the stop notice procedure functions similarly to the lien procedure. It permits the creditor (the trust fund) to enforce a debt (for outstanding fringe benefit contributions) not against the debtor (the defaulting employer), but against the property of a third party that is not a party to the collective bargaining agreement. The only difference is that whereas the lien procedure involves liens, the stop notice procedure involves stop notices. Both, however, operate as encumbrances on property-\u2014one encumbering real property, the other encumbering construction loan money. Both give the trust fund a right to an encumbrance against the property of third parties that the fund would not, and does not, have under ERISA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the absence of the stop notice procedure, neither the Housing Group nor Developers would have any liability to the Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds for the fringe benefit contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">White, P.

If a payment bond has previously been recorded in the office of the county recorder where the site is located in accordance with Section 3235 or in accordance with Section 3162, then the construction lender shall withhold funds pursuant to a bonded stop notice filed by an original contractor and may, at its option, withhold funds pursuant to a stop notice or bonded stop notice given by anyone other than an original contractor.
