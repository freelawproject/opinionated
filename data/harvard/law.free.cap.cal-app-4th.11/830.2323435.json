The issue is whether a designated driver exclusion (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, subd. (d)(1))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is applicable when the driver operated the vehicle without the insured\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Ruben Pena was involved in an automobile accident while driving Yamasaki\u2019s vehicle. Substantial injury was sustained by other persons and the car was declared a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Yamasaki made a timely claim to Mercury, her insurance company, for her property loss and for defense and indemnification against third party claims. Mercury denied coverage, claiming Yamasaki had designated Pena as a person specifically excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Yamasaki filed the underlying complaint against Mercury seeking declaratory relief for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Mercury\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. Yamasaki appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Yamasaki\u2019s policy included a \u201cDesignated Person(s) Coverage Exclusion\u201d specifically excluding Pena from coverage. The exclusion states, \u201cIt is agreed that coverage and the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend, under this policy, shall not apply nor accrue to the benefit of any insured or any third party claimant while any motor vehicle is being used or operated by a natural person or persons designated above. . . . This limitation shall apply to any use or operation of a motor vehicle including the negligent or alleged negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle to any designated person.\u201d In other words, Mercury is excused from, its duty to provide coverage or defend its insured if the car involved in the accident was driven by a person specifically excluded from coverage by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Yamasaki does not challenge the exclusion clause itself, acknowledging it is specifically authorized by section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, she maintains it is applicable to permissive drivers only; because Pena was driving without her permission, the insurance company is bound to defend and indemnify her.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Yamasaki explains that because this exclusion limits the carrier\u2019s liability, it must be strictly construed. It does not specifically state it is applicable when an excluded driver takes the vehicle without permission. Therefore, she argues the clause must be read to provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">It is true \u201cany ambiguity [in an exclusion] is to be interpreted against the insurer and reasonable doubts as to uncertain language should be resolved against the insurer. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Elite Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 739, 751 [161 Cal.Rptr. 322].) But both the exclusion and the statute upon which it is based are clear. Neither contains any ambiguous or uncertain language. Coverage does not accrue \u201cwhen any motor vehicle is being used or operated by a natural person or persons designated by name.\u201d Moreover, the plain meaning of \u201cany use or operation\u201d (italics added) is that all kinds of use or operation, including permissive and nonpermissive drivers, are to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Next, Yamasaki asks us to assume the Legislature intended section 11580.1, subdivision (d)(1) to apply only to permissive users.  But, \u201c\u2018if statutory language is \u201cclear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Hyland Therapeutics </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 509, 514 [220 Cal.Rptr. 590].) \u201cAn intention to legislate by implication is not to be presumed. . . . \u2018Courts should not read into statutes qualifications or modifications that will materially affect their operation so as to conform to a supposed intention not expressed by the Legislature. [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Krater </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 839, 845 [181 Cal.Rptr. 923].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Moreover, Yamasaki misconstrues the public policy requiring automobile liability insurance. The \u201cmain objective [of the statute was to provide] monetary protection\u201d to innocent third party accident victims. <em>(Metz </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 45, 53 [109 Cal.Rptr. 698, 513 P.2d 922], internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Yamasaki got what she paid for. She reduced her premiums by excluding Pena. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To adopt Yamasaki\u2019s argument would render the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>meaningless. Any insured could simply maintain the designated person was driving without permission. Judgment affirmed. Mercury to recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Crosby, Acting P. J., and Wallin, J\u201e concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 6, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-12\">All statutory references are to the Insurance Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Section 11580.1, subdivision (d) states in part: \u201c[T]he insurer and any named insured may, by the terms of any policy of automobile liability insurance . . . agree . . . H] (1) That coverage and the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend under such policy shall not apply nor accrue to the benefit of any insured or any third party claimant while any motor vehicle is being used or operated by a natural person or persons designated by name. These limitations shall apply to any use or operation of a motor vehicle including the negligent or alleged negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle to such designated person or persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">The insurer must, however, defend the insured when the designated person resides in the \u201csame household as the named insured. [1] . . . [I]s jointly sued with the named insured, [f] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>. . . [And] is an insured under a separate automobile liability insurance policy issued to him or her as a named insured, which policy does not provide a defense to the named insured.\u201d (\u00a7 11580.1, subd. (d)(1).) This provision is inapt here. The parties stipulated Pena was not separately insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Yamasaki recognizes the exclusion\u2019s economic significance. As she explains, it is \u201cbased on economic reasons. When the insured has either a relative or a friend who would normally operate the subject vehicle but either because of age or driving record is considered a high risk, the insured in an effort to reduce the premium would exclude this person from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>policy.\u201d In other words, the insured accepts the risk that the excluded individual will take the vehicle without permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
