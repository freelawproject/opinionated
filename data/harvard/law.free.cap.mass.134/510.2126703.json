Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Aldrich, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that he found the cows of the defendant in one of his fields, doing damage; that he drove or caused the cows to be driven from the field into the highway, and immediately notified the defendant of what had occurred; that the defendant, who lived within. half a mile of the plaintiff\u2019s land, went at once to the place where the plaintiff had the cows in the highway; that the plaintiff then demanded of the defendant five dollars for the damage done by his cows upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and said to him that, if he did not pay the five dollars, he would sue him for the same; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>defendant refused to pay the five dollars, and thereupon took possession of his cows, without any objection on the part of the plaintiff, and drove them back to his own premises; and that the plaintiff did not attempt, or make any claim of a right, to distrain the defendant\u2019s cows until the defendant should pay the sum demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\">The judge instructed the jury, that, if the plaintiff found the cows of the defendant doing damage on his land, he might recover his damages in an action of tort against the defendant, or he might distrain the cows; and that if the plaintiff distrained or undertook to distrain the defendant\u2019s cows, and by that means to enforce the payment of the five dollars demanded by him, he could not now maintain this action for the recovery of the sum so demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">No objections were made to the instructions given to the jury; but, after the instructions had been given, the defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that, if the plaintiff took the cows of the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s premises, drove them away and detained them, and kept them under his control until the arrival of the defendant, whom the plaintiff had sent for, and, when the defendant came, demanded of him five dollars as damages done by the cows on the plaintiff\u2019s premises, such act of the plaintiff was an impounding of the cows, and the plaintiff could not recover such damages in this action. The judge declined to give this instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-7\"><em>J. </em>Ladd, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>Gr.
