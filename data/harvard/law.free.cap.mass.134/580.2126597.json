Allen, JJ., absent.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b596-5\">A. mortgaged a parcel of land to B., and subsequently mortgaged the same land to 0. by a deed which was signed and sealed by B. as well as by A., but B.\u2019s name did not appear in the deed except in the <em>in testimonium, </em>clause, as \u201c mortgagee named in a mortgage on said premises, for the purpose of discharging said mortgage.\u201d This deed was acknowledged by A. but not by B., and was recorded. No reference was made on the margin of the record of the first mortgage to the second. After this B. died, and his administrator assigned the first mortgage to D., who purchased it in good faith and for a valuable consideration. G. and D. then foreclosed their mortgages. <em>Held, </em>that D. could not maintain a writ of entry against C. to obtain possession of the land.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">Writ of entry, dated May 20, 1882, by the administrator of Asa Pierce, against the Leominster Savings Bank and John B. Allen, to recover a parcel of land in Leominster. The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the tenants, to this court, on appeal, on agreed facts, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">On May 27, 1870, the tenant Allen executed a mortgage, in the usual form, of the demanded premises, with other real estate, to Nancy Conant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-8\">On October 10, 1870, the tenant Allen executed a mortgage of the demanded premises to the tenant bank. The deed contained a covenant that the premises were free from all incumbrances, and was in the iisual form except the <em>in testimonium </em>clause, which was as follows: \u201c In witness whereof we, the said John B. Allen and Louise E. Allen, his wife (and Nancy Conant, mortgagee named in a mortgage on said premises, for the purpose of discharging said mortgage so far as the premises hereby conveyed are concerned), said wife in token of her release of all right and title of or to both dower and homestead in the granted premises, have hereunto set our hands and seals this tenth day of October in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and seventy.\u201d This deed was signed and sealed by Allen and his wife, and by Conant. It was acknowledged by Allen alone, and was duly recorded. Conant\u2019s name nowhere appeared in this mortgage, except in the <em>in testimonium </em>clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>She signed the deed without consideration, and did not release her interest in the demanded premises, unless such is the effect of her signature to the mortgage to the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-4\">On February <em>2, </em>1875, the administrators of Conant\u2019s estate assigned the first mortgage to Asa Pierce, who paid full consideration for it. Neither the administrators of Conant nor Pierce then knew of the fact that Conant had signed the mortgage to the bank; and no reference was made on the margin of the record of the first mortgage in the registry of deeds to the second mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">On March 25,1881, the demandant, as administrator of Pierce\u2019s estate, entered upon the premises for a breach of the conditions of the mortgage and for the purpose of foreclosure, and a certificate of such entry was duly recorded in the registry of deeds. The mortgage note is still unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">On May 8, 1882, the bank entered upon the demanded premises for a breach of the conditions of its mortgage and for the purpose of foreclosure, and a certificate of such entry was duly recorded in the registry of deeds. John B. Allen now occupies the premises as a tenant of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">Demand was duly made upon both tenants, before the date of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the demandant was entitled to possession of the premises, judgment was to be entered for him; otherwise, judgment for the tenants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-9\"><em>H. Mayo, </em>for the demandant, cited <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>8 Pick. 532, 536.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-10\">Tenants, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b597-11\">Devens, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8n\">The statutes of the Commonwealth provide two ways by which a mortgage may be discharged; namely, by an entry acknowledging satisfaction thereof, made on the margin of the record of the mortgage in the registry of deeds and signed by the mortgagee, and also by a deed of release duly acknowledged and recorded. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>89, \u00a7 30. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>120, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">When the mortgagee joined in a conveyance of the mortgaged premises, for the purpose of discharging the mortgage, although her name was not in the granting clause, she in effect released the premises from the incumbrance which the mortgage had theretofore been upon them, so far at least as the savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>bank was concerned. The words are not to be construed as the mere declaration of a purpose, but constituted an act, when her hand and seal were affixed thereto, by which her purpose was accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">It is said that there is no grantee in this discharge, but the intent of that which was done was that the savings bank, which was named in the granting portion of the deed, should secure a good title, and the bank must be held to be the grantee, if any be necessary. We are not prepared to say that any is necessary. The deed of release referred to in the statute, like the entry of satisfaction upon the record, is a mode of discharging the mortgage, intended to operate for the benefit of any one who may possess the title to the real estate upon which it is an incumbrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Nor is the effect different if it be held that this discharge would operate only as an estoppel. It is an estoppel that binds her and those who claim* under her.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">As the signature of the mortgagee discharged the premises conveyed from the mortgage, the acknowledgment of one of the grantors was sufficient. <em>Pidge v. Tyler, </em>4 Mass. 541. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>6 Pick. 86. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
