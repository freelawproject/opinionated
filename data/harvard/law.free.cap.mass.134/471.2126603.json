Sts. c. 85, so far as it authorizes a third person to recover treble the value of money lost by gaming, is a penal statute; and by the Gen. Sts. c. 155, \u00a7 20, an action by such third person is barred, if not brought within one year after the date of the loss.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b487-6\">The answer to a declaration, under the Gen. Sts. c. 85, \u00a7 1, in three counts, averred that \u201c the cause of action, the alleged offence mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, was not committed within one year before the suing out of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, wherefore he. cannot maintain his said action.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that, even if the declaration set out more than one cause of action, the statute of limitations, Gen.

The first count alleged that, on or about August 7, 1880, one Henry G. Cole played at cards in \u00e1 certain building in Boston, and lost by said playing at cards the sum of $1060, and paid to the defendants said sum; that said Cole neglected to, and did not, within three months after said loss, without covin or collusion, prosecute the defendants with effect for said money lost as aforesaid; and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover treble the value of the money so lost. The second and third counts were similar, except that they respectively alleged that the defendants were the owners, and the tenants and occupants, of the building where the money was so lost. The answer contained a general denial, and also the following: \u201cAnd the defendants further answering say that the cause of action, the alleged offence mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, was not committed within one year before the suing out of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, wherefore he cannot maintain his said action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">Trial in the Superior Court, before Mason, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, which, after stating that the pleadings formed part thereof, was, in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">The plaintiff introduced evidence to show that, on August 6 and 7, 1880, Henry G. Cole lost to the defendants, by playing at cards, the sum of $1060.41. After the plaintiff had introduced his testimony, and all evidence in the case had been put in, the defendants requested the judge to rule that the action could not be maintained, because it was not begun within one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>year after the date of the loss of said money, as required by the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>155, \u00a7 20. The judge refused so to rule. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-4\"><em>A.

Sts. <em>c. </em>85, (Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>99, \u00a7 1,) under which this action is brought, so far as it authorizes a third person to recover three times the sum of money or value of goods lost by gaming, is a penal statute; or that the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>155, \u00a7 20, (Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>197, \u00a7 4,) apply to this action. <em>Read </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>129 Mass. 407. <em>Cumberland &amp; Oxford Canal </em>v. <em>Hitchings, </em>57 Maine, 146. A right of action is given to the loser to recover the money or value of the goods lost, but his right of action is limited to three months, and is remedial. After the expiration of that time, all right of action in the loser is gone-, and a right of action accrues to any third person who may choose to sue for the penalty; but this action must be brought within one year next after the offence is committed, which, in this case, was the winning and receiv ing the money. <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Gray, 8 </em>Gray, 243. <em>Barnicoat </em>v. <em>Folling, </em>3 Gray, 134. We are of opinion that the statute of limitations was properly pleaded to all the causes of action, if there was more than one set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We do not understand from the bill of exceptions that there was any contest that the money was lost on August 6 and 7, 1880, or that there was any evidence which could have warranted the jury in finding that the loss occurred at any other time; and, as the action was not brought until September 19, 1881, we think the jury should have been instructed that the action could not be maintained. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
