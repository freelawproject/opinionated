The jurat annexed to the complaint and the warrant issued thereon were each signed by \u201c Ichabod N. Luce, trial justice.\u201d The defendant was tried on the complaint, adjudged guilty, and sentenced by said -magistrate; from this sentence he appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">In that court, the defendant moved to quash the complaint, on the ground that it did not appear by the record that Ichabod N.

This motion was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-9\"><em>J. </em>Brown, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-10\">6r.

No one but a justice of the peace can be a trial justice; Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>155, \u00a7 7; and a justice of the peace duly appointed trial justice ceases to be such if his commission as justice of the peace expires before his commission as trial justice. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>155, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">It follows that a signature as trial justice involves a signature as justice of the peace, and no separate designation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>inferior office is necessary. The signature as trial justice means that the signer is the legal holder of that office, that is, that he is a justice of the peace holding a commission as a trial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">The entry must be, <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
