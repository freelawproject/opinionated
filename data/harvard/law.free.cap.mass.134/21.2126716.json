Writ dated September 13, 1881. Answer: 1. A general denial. 2. The statute of limitations, U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5057.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Knowlton, J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that he was appointed assignee in bankruptcy of John Hood on May 19, 1875; that Hood, before his bankruptcy, namely, on September 8,1874, sold to the defendant a set of wheels for $16, which sum the defendant had never paid; and that this claim, with others, had been sold by the plaintiff to F. H. Maxwell, for whose benefit this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">Upon this evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that this claim, being for a debt due the bankrupt\u2019s estate, was barred by the U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5057. The judge so ruled, and ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\n<em>J.

According to the construction which has been given to the U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5057, by the Supreme Court of the United States, it must be; and the present action is therefore barred. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>21 Wall. 342. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>98 U.
