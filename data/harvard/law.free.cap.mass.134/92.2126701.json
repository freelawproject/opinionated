The plaintiff, under the 26th rule of the Superior Court, admitted that the witness would, if present, testify to the facts stated in the affidavit, and agreed that the same should be received and considered as evidence on the trial, in like manner as if the witness was present and had testified thereto; and a continuance was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>At the trial, the defendant\u2019s wife appeared as a witness, and testified materially differently from what it was stated she would testify to in the affidavit. The plaintiff then offered the affidavit in evidence; and it was objected \u00abto by the defendant, and excluded by the judge, against the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of one cent; and he alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-5\"><em>E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7O\">We can see no ground upon which the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney, made for the purpose of procuring a continuance, was competent evidence. The plaintiff contends that it is admissible under the rule which permits proof that a party to a suit has suppressed evidence, or has suborned or attempted to suborn a witness. Such acts of a party are competent, because they are in the nature of admissions, and tend to show a consciousness that he has not a good case, the fair inference being that, if a man has a good case, he will not resort to corrupt means to sustain it. This rule cannot justly be extended to cover this case. The affidavit is not the act of the defendant; it does not appear that it was made by the counsel in his presence or by his dictation, or that he ever approved it or even knew that it had been made. There is nothing to show that the error in stating what the defendant\u2019s wife would testify to was not an innocent mistake of the counsel. If a similar affidavit made by the defendant himself would be competent, which we need not decide, this bill of exceptions does not show that he authorized or is responsible for the erroneous statements of his counsel. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
