The prayer of the bill was that Joslin might be restrained from selling the premises conveyed by said deed; and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">The answer of Whitney alleged the following facts: Whitney, at the request of Elijah Hale, wrote out and prepared the deed mentioned in the bill, on or about the day of its date, and, as a magistrate, took the grantor\u2019s acknowledgment thereof. The grantor then placed the deed in Whitney\u2019s hand, and said: \u201cI want you to take it and keep it as long as I live. Say nothing to brother Calvin or anybody else about it, and when I am gone, give it to him.\u201d The deed was in Whitney\u2019s custody until Elijah Hale\u2019s death, and was seen by no other person. On April 24, 1874, Whitney, at the request of Elijah Hale, prepared a will, which was then signed and executed by him, in the first paragraph of which were these words, \u201c hereby revoking all former writings for the purpose heretofore made by me, whether in shape of will, codicil, deed or otherwise.\u201d At the time this will was executed, Elijah Hale told Whitney that the word \u201c deed \u201d so put in referred to the deed made to the plaintiff, which was then in Whitney\u2019s custody, and that he meant to revoke and cancel it; and told Whitney never to deliver the deed to the plaintiff or tell him anything about it, but to hand it back to the grantor some time, as he then preferred to have the property go by his will rather than by the deed. On November 26, 1876, at the request of Elijah Hale, Whitney prepared another writing for a last will, and which was then executed by the former for that purpose, the first paragraph of which contained these words, \u201c hereby revoking all former wills, testaments and writings to that effect, either by deed or otherwise.\u201d At the time of preparing this will, Elijah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Hale said to Whitney that he must revoke and destroy the deed to the plaintiff; that he had the word \u201c deed \u201d so put in this will to revoke it; and that Whitney should hand it back to him some time, as he was not going to have all of his place go to the plaintiff, but meant to have half of it go to Joseph Hale, the plaintiff\u2019s son, as was provided in this will. On September 13, 1878, Elijah Hale, while talking with Whitney about the final disposition of his property, told him that he wanted his homestead place (the same described in said deed) to go to the plaintiff and to his son Joseph equally, and they could divide it to suit themselves; and that Whitney must hand back to him some time the deed he had made, and which was still in Whitney\u2019s custody, and never give it to the plaintiff or say anything to him about it. Upon the appointment of Joslin as executor, Whitney, upon his demand, delivered said deed to him; and the plaintiff never demanded the deed of Whitney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">At the hearing, before Lord, J., it was agreed that the answer of Whitney should be taken as an agreed statement of facts; and the judge reserved the case for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\"><em>G.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0xT\">We think the evidence shows that Elijah Hale did not intend that the deed should be delivered until his death. He did not intend that the plaintiff should have any present interest in the deed, but intended to keep in himself the dominion and control of it. It was in the hands of Whitney as a depositary for the grantor, and not as agent or trustee for the grantee. The act was intended to be in the nature of a testamentary act, which could be revoked at any time. As it was in fact revoked, it is not necessary to consider what effect it would have had if there had been no revocation. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>8 Mass. 230, 237. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>9 Mass. 307. <em>Rockwood </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>16 Gray, 402. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>116 Mass. 566. <em>Shurtleff </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>118 Mass. 154. <em>Wellborn </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>17 Ga. 267. <em>Bill </em>dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
