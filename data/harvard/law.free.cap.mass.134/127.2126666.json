Trial in the Superior Court, before Colburn, J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-4\">The plaintiffs were dealers in gheet-iron, in Boston, and the defendant was a manufacturer of such iron, in the State of Ohio. It was agreed at the trial that the iron, to which the contract relates, was of greater value than $50. The plaintiffs offered to show, by the conversation that occurred at the time this contract was made, that the contract related to six cars; but the judge ruled that it was not competent to show this by paroi. They then contended that the contract should be construed as an agreement to furnish twelve cars of iron, or two or three cars of iron. But the judge ruled that the contract did not require the defendant to furnish twelve, or any other definite number of cars of iron; and ordered a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">If the ruling was right, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, the verdict to be set aside, and a new trial ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-6\">The case was argued, in \u00a1November 1881, by <em>S. C. </em>Darling, for the plaintiffs, and by <em>L. L. iScaife, </em>for the defendant; and was reargued, in \u00a1November 1882, by the same counsel.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-7\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGA\">1. This was a contract for the sale of goods, and not for labor and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">2. It was not competent to show by oral testimony how many cars were meant. All the essential terms must be contained in, or ascertainable from, the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">3. The memorandum does not contain all the essential terms of a sale, but is left incomplete and uncertain. The words \u201c same to be agreed upon \u201d show that one element was to be' agreed upon in the future. The plaintiffs contend that the writing shows that at least two car-loads were to be shipped, and that the action may be maintained to recover for the failure to deliver at least that quantity. But the promise specified is, to ship a balance \u201c to be agreed upon,\u201d and is limited to such balance, and is not enlarged by the following stipulations, which are provisional, and dependent upon a previous determination by agreement. Till such determination, there is no agreement. The construction of the contract in this respect is the same as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the words were <em>\u201c </em>the same to be determined by the award of A. B.\u201d; in which case, until such award, the contract would not take effect. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
