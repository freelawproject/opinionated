After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Because the district court dismissed Bond\u2019s complaint for failure to timely pursue his administrative remedies, we first outline the events in the administrative process and then what happened in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">A. Administrative Process</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Bond, an African American male, was employed under a collective bargaining agreement as an Electronic Integrated Systems Mechanic at Warner Robins Air Force base, where he worked on C-141 jet airplanes. On November 1, 1999, Bond signed a statement of understanding indicating that he would be subject to random drug testing due to the sensitive and important nature of his employment and the flight safety concerns related to his job. On May 30, 2001, Bon was administered a random drug test that yielded a positive result for marijuana use. Bond\u2019s results were reported on June 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">When Bond was informed of the results, he submitted an affidavit from a relative stating that Bond had been tricked into eating a marijuana-spiked cookie. On June 30, 2001, Bond\u2019s removal was proposed. In a written response, Bond claimed he had become very drunk and his drinking had caused him to use marijuana. Bond was terminated effective October 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Bond grieved his termination on October 18, 2001, pursuant to his collective bargaining agreement, on grounds that termination was too harsh a sanction. The Installation Commander at Warner Robins denied the grievance. On December 21, 2001, union officials invoked arbitration on Bond\u2019s behalf. The arbitration hearing was held on August 26, 2002. On November 15, 2002, the arbitrator issued a decision sustaining Bond\u2019s termination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">On November 19, 2002, Bond received correspondence dated November 15, 2002, from his union counsel advising of the arbitrator\u2019s adverse decision. In the letter, Bond\u2019s counsel stated that the arbitrator had found that the Air Force has a \u201cconsistent policy of firing just about everyone in a testing designated position who tests positive for drugs.\u201d The letter also enclosed a copy of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. In the decision, the arbitrator stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cEmployee Relations Chief, Fluellen, testified that all but 1 or 2 unique cases at the base have resulted in termination, and no case in Avionics\u2014 Bond\u2019s division \u2014 has been mitigated.\u201d Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s decision acknowledged Fluellen\u2019s testimony that one or two Air Force employees had not been fired after a positive drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">After receiving this letter on November 19, Bond claims that he gave the arbitrator\u2019s decision and the letter to a third party who contacted Bond on the same day. According to Bond, this unidentified third party \u201chad inside knowledge of [the Air Force\u2019s] history of racial discrimination through covert and subtle means.\u201d The third party pointed out to Bond the statements in the arbitrator\u2019s decision about Fluellen\u2019s testimony and suggested that the referenced testimony gave rise to an appearance of disparate treatment. Bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contended that it was only after this conversation with the third party that Bond was \u201calerted to the possibility\u201d that the facially neutral drug policy was being applied in a racially discriminatory manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">After speaking with the third party, Bond went to the Air Force\u2019s Equal Employment Office (\u201cEEO\u201d) counselor and allegedly first complained of discrimination on January 2, 2003. Before filing an employment discrimination action, federal employees are required to file a formal complaint with the agency \u2014 here, the Air Force \u2014 that allegedly discriminated against them. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.106(a). Under the administrative process, the federal employee must initiate contact with an EEO counselor at the agency within 45 days of the effective date of the allegedly discriminatory personnel action. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1). However, the 45-day time limit shall be extended if the employee \u201cdid not know or reasonably should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred. ...\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Air Force\u2019s EEO counselor initially refused to accept Bond\u2019s complaint, which contained allegations of disparate treatment based on race. However, this decision later was reversed, and his complaint was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The Air Force ultimately dismissed Bond\u2019s complaint on grounds that Bond was terminated in October 2001 and did not contact the EEO counselor within the required 45-day period. Rather, Bond first contacted the EEO counselor on January 2, 2003. The Air Force also dismissed Bond\u2019s complaint because he had elected to pursue his remedies through the union-grievance-arbitration process and could not now proceed through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d)-Title VII process.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.405, Bond appealed the dismissal of his complaint to the EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operations. On May 20, 2004, the EEOC affirmed the Air Force\u2019s decision to dismiss Bond\u2019s complaint for the reasons given by the Air Force. Bond filed a request for reconsideration, which the EEOC denied on August 3, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Bond then filed this employment discrimination action in federal district court. Bond\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint alleged disparate treatment discrimination and retaliation on the basis of his race, color, sex, and age, by the Air Force in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5, 2000e-16c, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bond\u2019s complaint alleged that, in October 2001, he was terminated from his job at Warner Robins Air Force Base for violating the Air Force\u2019s drug policy. According to Bond, \u201cothers who violated ... the drug policy were allowed to remain employed.\u201d The complaint also alleged that, on January 2, 2003, Bond filed charges with the EEOC and received his right to sue letter on August 7, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, on the face of Bond\u2019s complaint, it appeared that Bond had waited until fourteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>months after he was terminated to file his discrimination complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In accordance with local rules, the parties submitted a proposed scheduling and discovery order. In the proposed order, Bond, among other things, stated that the Air Force had retaliated against him by refusing to process his EEO complaint and that the Air Force had \u201conly processed the complaint after being compelled to do so by the former office (USAF/MR) of the now Acting Secretary of the Air Force, Michael L. Dominguez.\u201d The district court entered the proposed scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Bond filed a motion to amend the scheduling order, seeking to add a statement about his allegations that the Air Force had retaliated against him by refusing to promptly process his EEO complaint. The district court denied this motion as moot, noting that identical language about Bond\u2019s allegations of retaliation already appeared in the scheduling order. The district court noted, however, that Bond\u2019s complaint did not include a retaliation claim and advised Bond to \u201camend his Complaint to add a retaliation claim if he in fact intended] to pursue such a claim in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Bond consequently filed a motion to amend his complaint, citing the district court\u2019s direction. In his proposed amended complaint, Bond specified that the Air Force\u2019s refusal to process his EEO complaint occurred in January 2003. He also alleged that the Air Force\u2019s inaction was willful and intentional and that he \u201cbelievefd] that the grievance filed with the Union and the arbitration hearing which upheld the agency\u2019s termination of the Plaintiff in 2001 is what motivated the agency to fail to comply\u201d with his initial request to process his EEO complaint. The Air Force filed a response stating that it did not oppose Bond\u2019s motion to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The Air Force moved to dismiss Bond\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). The Air Force\u2019s brief in support of its motion provided details about how Bond had grieved his termination through his union and the arbitration process. Based on those facts, the Air Force moved to dismiss Bond\u2019s complaint in this civil action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the Air Force argued that Bond did not file his EEO complaint with the Air Force within 45 days of the alleged discrimination, as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.107(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">In response, Bond did not dispute the facts set out in the Air Force\u2019s brief that he was terminated in October 2001 and that he did not contact his EEO counselor until January 2, 2003. Instead, Bond argued that the 45-day limitations period did not begin to run until he knew or should have known of the alleged discrimination. Bond argued that it was only on November 19, 2002, after he received the letter from his union counsel and had the conversation with the unidentified third party that he was \u201calerted to the possibility\u201d that the racially neutral policy was being applied in a racially discriminatory manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The district court dismissed Bond\u2019s complaint, finding that Bond failed to initiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>contact with the Air Force\u2019s EEO counsel- or within the 45-day limitations period and thus failed to exhaust administrative remedies. In so doing, the district court noted that \u201c[ajlthough there are no affidavits or other evidence in the record to show the history of Plaintiff\u2019s challenges, Plaintiff does not challenge the outline set forth by Defendant in his Motion to Dismiss, and concedes the relevant facts.\u201d Specifically, Bond did not dispute that he was terminated on October 12, 2001 and did not notify the Air Force\u2019s EEO counselor of his discrimination claim until January 2, 2008, over fourteen months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Since Bond admittedly did not comply with the 45-day limitations period, the district court examined whether Bond had alleged a basis for tolling of the 45-day limitation. Bond\u2019s allegation was that he did not and reasonably should not have known until November 19, 2002 that others were not terminated when they failed the drug test. According to Bond, he only learned of this fact when he received a letter dated November 15, 2002, from his attorney on November 19, 2002, which described the Air Force\u2019s policy as a \u201cconsistent policy of firing just about everyone in a testing designated position who tests positive for drugs.\u201d Bond alleged that he reasonably should have known of the alleged discrimination only after he received his attorney\u2019s letter with the arbitration decision and that letter and decision were reviewed by an unidentified third party who had inside knowledge of \u201cthe Agency\u2019s history of racial discrimination through covert and subtle means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In light of the uncontested facts and allegations, the district court concluded that Bond had not shown good cause for tolling the 45-day limitations period. Specifically, the district court explained that Bond\u2019s \u201cvague reference to a conversation with an unidentified individual\u201d was insufficient to meet his burden to show tolling was warranted. The district court further stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of any detail as to the new facts confided by this mysterious informant, the Court has no way to determine whether those facts should or should not have been apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.\u201d Bond filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">A. Dismissal of Bond\u2019s Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The district court dismissed Bond\u2019s complaint with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bond does not dispute that he did not contact the Air Force\u2019s EEO counselor within the 45-day limitations period. Rather, the sole issue is whether Bond has alleged facts that are legally sufficient to toll the 45-day period for fourteen months. In deciding that issue, the district court considered many matters outside Bond\u2019s complaint, including the letter from Bond\u2019s union attorney discussing the results of the arbitration and Bond\u2019s alleged conversation with an unidentified \u201cinsider\u201d that led him to suspect discrimination. However, even accepting as true all of Bond\u2019s additional allegations raised in response to the motion to dismiss, we conclude that Bond has failed to allege facts that would be legally sufficient to establish tolling until November 19, 2002 (which is necessary to make the contact on January 2, 2003 timely).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The problem for Bond in this regard is Fluellen\u2019s testimony that was referenced in the arbitrator\u2019s decision sent to Bond by his union counsel. Specifically, Fluellen testified that one or two Air Force employees at Warner Robins had not been fired after a positive drug test. The arbitration hearing, which Bond attended with counsel, occurred on August 26, 2002. If the information in Fluellen\u2019s testimony was capable of provoking Bond\u2019s inquiry on November 19, 2002, it was equally so on August 26, 2002, when it was given. Thus, we conclude that Bond reasonably should have known as early as August 26, 2002 that he might have a discrimination claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Bond did not contact the Air Force\u2019s EEO counselor within 45 days of this date, or by October 10, 2002. Accordingly, under Bond\u2019s own allegations, his January 2, 2003 contact with the EEO counselor was untimely. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Bond\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Ziemba v. Cascade Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1213 (11th Cir.2001) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of complaint and denial of leave to amend where additional allegations in the plaintiffs brief would not have stated a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">B. Denial of Motion for Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Bond also argues on appeal that his retaliation claim was timely and thus should not have been dismissed. However, Bond\u2019s dismissed complaint did not contain a retaliation claim. Furthermore, the district court denied Bond\u2019s outstanding motion for leave to amend his complaint to add a retaliation claim when it stated in the dismissal order that \u201c[a]ll other pending motions\u201d were dismissed. Therefore, there is no retaliation claim for consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Construing Bond\u2019s appellate brief liberally to include a challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for leave to amend, we find no error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bond sought to amend his complaint to allege that the Air Force had retaliated against him by refusing initially to process his EEO complaint. He also stated that the refusal was motivated by Bond\u2019s filing a union grievance and initiating arbitration. However, Bond also explained in his response to the motion to dismiss that his grievance and the resulting arbitration did not involve allegations of race or age discrimination, but only allegations that the sanction of termination was too severe. Thus, it is apparent from Bond\u2019s own pleadings that Bond\u2019s activity in filing a grievance and in participating in arbitration did not constitute statutorily protected activity under either Title VII or the ADEA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (prohibiting retaliation for an employee\u2019s opposition to an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII or an employee\u2019s participation in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under Title VII); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d) (prohibiting retaliation for an employee\u2019s opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>an employment practice made unlawful by the ADEA or an employee\u2019s participation in an investigation, proceeding or litigation under the ADEA).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">For the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bond\u2019s complaint and the denial of Bond\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint to add a retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\">. On December 23, 2002, Bond appealed the arbitrator's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January 23, 2003, Bond\u2019s appeal was dismissed for failure to pay the docketing fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">. Bond\u2019s complaint also named General Dennis Haines, Michael O\u2019Hara and Steven Davis as defendants. The district court dismissed these individual defendants on the grounds that they were not proper defendants under Title VII or the ADEA. Bond does not challenge this ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aql\">. Attached to Bond\u2019s complaint was a copy of the EEOC\u2019s August 3, 2004 decision denying Bond\u2019s request for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">. The Air Force also argued that Bond had elected to pursue his claims to a final decision through the union-grievance-arbitration process and thus was precluded from pursuing his claims under Title VII. The district court did not reach this issue, but granted dismissal on exhaustion grounds. The Air Force raises this election of remedies argument again on appeal. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s basis for dismissal, we need not reach that legal issue either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion, but review <em>de novo </em>\"the underlying legal conclusion of whether a particular amendment to the complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>Harris v. Ivax Corp., </em>182 F.3d 799, 802 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">. We recognize that Bond asserts he did not have enough information until he talked to a third party allegedly on the same day he received his counsel\u2019s letter with the arbitrator's decision. However, as noted by the district court, Bond does not identify the third party or give any facts confided by the mysterious informant. In any event, given that Bond had a full arbitration hearing and that Fluellen acknowledged in the hearing that a few others had not been fired after a drug test, Bond reasonably should have known at that time that he had not been treated the same as others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend and review <em>de novo </em>a district court's determination that amendment would be futile. <em>Freeman v. First Union Nat'l, </em>329 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
