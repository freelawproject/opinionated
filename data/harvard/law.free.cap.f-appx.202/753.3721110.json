According to Otavalo, the BIA and the immigration judge (IJ) should have exercised their discretion to reopen the proceeding despite the fact that he failed to file the motion on or before the September 30, 1996, deadline provided in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). We have held that we lack jurisdiction \u201cto consider whether the [BIA] should have compelled the [IJ] to reopen a case based on the IJ\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority.\u201d <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 247-50 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b781-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
