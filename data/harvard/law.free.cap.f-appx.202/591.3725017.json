Mandamus is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal, we accordingly conclude that Barnett is not entitled to mandamus relief. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). We therefore deny his petition for mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">We grant Barnett leave to proceed in forma pauperis, however, with respect to No. 06-7200, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Barnett v. Bledsoe, </em>No. 7:06-cv-00255, 2006 WL 1288481 (W.D.Va. May 9, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-22\">\n<em>No. 06-7002, PETITION DENIED; No. 06-7200, AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
