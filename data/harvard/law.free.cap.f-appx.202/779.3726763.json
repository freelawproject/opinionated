The magistrate judge determined that Duper-on\u2019s allegations and medical records showed that he was promptly and properly treated; that he was taken to a hospital almost immediately after the severity of the infection was discovered; that surgery for the fracture was performed days later; and that Duperon\u2019s recovery following the surgery was uneventful. The magistrate judge concluded that, at worst, Duperon had stated a claim of negligence or mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>practice. In his appellate brief, Duperon has failed to make specific arguments with respect to his deliberate-indifference claims or to cite the portions of the record upon which he relies. Accordingly, we conclude that Duperon has effectively abandoned his claims, in that they are inadequately briefed. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is therefore dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Duperon\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under the three-strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Duperon is cautioned that if he accumulates a third strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
