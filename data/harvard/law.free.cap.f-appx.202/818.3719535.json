We previously remanded this matter to the district court to allow the court to rule on a post-judgment motion by Ayers seeking reinstatement of his suit. The district court subsequently granted the motion and ordered the case reinstated on the district court\u2019s docket. Accordingly, because the judgment which is the subject of this appeal has been vacated, the present appeal does not present a live case or controversy and is dismissed as moot. <em>See Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
