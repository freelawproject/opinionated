Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Pearson argues that the district court misapplied the Guidelines by not granting him a two-level reduction in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for his mitigating role. Given that Pearson\u2019s role was not peripheral to the Brown Drug Organization, the denial of such an adjustment was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">The district court\u2019s 188-month sentence, which was a deviation from the Guidelines, was not an abuse of discretion. The district court articulated its reasons for the sentence and those reasons reflected the totality of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Armendariz, </em>451 F.3d 352, 358 n. 5 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
