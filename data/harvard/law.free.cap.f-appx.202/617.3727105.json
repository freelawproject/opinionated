Following a resentencing hearing, the district court adopted its findings from the original sentencing hearing and imposed the same sentences it previously imposed. The district court sentenced Anthony to 824 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised released, and ordered that he pay a $5000 fine. The district court sentenced Scott to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and ordered that he pay a $5000 fine. Anthony and Scott again appeal their sentences, challenging: (1) the standard of proof used by the district court; (2) the constitutionality and reasonableness of the use of the 100:1 crack/powder cocaine differential in sentencing; and (3) the district court\u2019s imposition of the same sentence previously imposed, and alleging that the district court\u2019s sentence resulted in unwarranted disparity, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (West 2000 and Supp.2006). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Anthony\u2019s and Scott\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Appellants first challenge the district court\u2019s application of a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in resentencing. This assertion is without merit. <em>See generally United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>Booker, </em>a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez, </em>407 F.3d 118, 125 (2d Cir.2005); <em>McReynolds v. United States, </em>397 F.3d 479, 481 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Tabor, </em>439 F.3d 826, 830 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Next, Appellants challenge the constitutionality and reasonableness of the 100:1 crack/powder cocaine differential in the advisory guidelines in the wake of <em>Booker. </em>We find Appellants\u2019 equal protection challenge to be without merit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Castillo, </em>460 F.3d 337 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, as we previously have held, a sentencing court may not properly substitute its view of an appropriate ratio between crack cocaine and powder cocaine for that determined by Congress. <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 633 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>June 20, 2006 (No. 05-11659). We decline Appellants\u2019 invitation to revisit our decision in <em>Eura. </em>The district court here did not err in refusing Appellants\u2019 request to substitute its own ratio for that set forth in the advisory guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellants also contend that the district court erred by applying a <em>\u201cde facto </em>mandatory Guidelines standard\u201d in resentencing them to the same sentence. During the resentencing hearing, the district judge clearly and accurately enunciated this court\u2019s directive on remand, as well as its statutory and legal obligations in resentencing Appellants, considered the arguments of counsel, and decided that its original findings did not need to be altered. We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). As Appellants\u2019 sentences are within the properly calculated advisory guideline range, they are presumptively reasonable, <em>see United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>we find Appellants\u2019 eonclusory assertions on appeal to be insufficient to overcome that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Finally, Appellants contend that the sentences imposed on them by the district court resulted in \u201cunwarranted disparity\u201d in contravention of \u00a7 3553(a)(6), as compared to those sentences imposed on co-defendants in the same prosecution. Merely noting that co-defendants received lesser sentences is insufficient to establish an unwarranted sentencing disparity, which renders a within-Guidelines sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). The district court properly rejected Appellants\u2019 claim of disparity, as the characteristics and circumstances of these individual Defendants and the application of the advisory guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) factors to them produced the disparity, the disparity was not unwarranted, and Appellants have failed to demonstrate error by the district court in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Anthony\u2019s and Scott\u2019s sentences. Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find their sentences to be reasonable. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> This court previously affirmed Anthony\u2019s and Scott\u2019s convictions, but remanded their cases to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which case was decided after their original sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Anthony, </em>138 Fed.Appx. 591 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
