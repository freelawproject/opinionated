Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum and order of March 20, 2006, we modify the court\u2019s judgment in one respect and as modified affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">In summary, the record fully supports the district court\u2019s determinations that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">1. Ramroop was terminated for legitimate, non \u2014 discriminatory reasons \u2014 his aggressive and disruptive behavior over a period of several months \u2014 for which he was warned both verbally and in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">2. Ramroop failed to produce summary judgment evidence that Cooper Cameron\u2019s stated reasons for termination were pretextual or that Ramroop\u2019s FMLA leave was a motivating factor in his termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">3. Similarly, the record demonstrates that Ramroop\u2019s termination had nothing to do with his EEOC charge of discrimination filed several months before his termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">4. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s state law assault claim asserted against one of his superiors, Fred Holland. The district court inadvertently overlooked expressly dealing with the related state law assault claim appellant asserted against Cooper Cameron. We are satisfied that this was an oversight and that the district court intended to decline jurisdiction over this claim also. This was well within the discretion of the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing petitioner\u2019s federal claims against Cooper Cameron is AFFIRMED. We modify the judgment to reflect a dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiffs state law assault claims against Cooper Cameron and Holland and as modified we also affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b29-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
