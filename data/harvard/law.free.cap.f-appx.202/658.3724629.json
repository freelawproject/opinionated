California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Nellums filed a response arguing that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary as to the amount of loss used to enhance his sentence and that the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentenced based on that loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Nellums\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue in this direct appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
