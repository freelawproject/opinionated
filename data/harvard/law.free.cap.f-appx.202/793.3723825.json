Moore argues that his action should not have been dismissed summarily because his \u00a7 1983 claims have merit and that the limitations period should have been equitably tolled by the pendency of his prior unsuccessful state lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-21\">Because the Texas statute of limitations is borrowed in \u00a7 1983 cases, this court also looks to Texas\u2019s equitable tolling principles. <em>See Rotella v. Pederson, </em>144 F.3d 892, 897 (5th Cir.1998). Texas permits the tolling of a statute of limitations when a plaintiffs legal remedies are precluded by the pendency of other legal proceedings. <em>See Holmes v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.1998). However, the pendency of Moore\u2019s state lawsuits do not entitle him to equitable tolling because they sought a remedy that he need not have pursued. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Because Moore has not demonstrated any justification for equitable tolling or for any other relief, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Moore\u2019s complaint as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Moore is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
