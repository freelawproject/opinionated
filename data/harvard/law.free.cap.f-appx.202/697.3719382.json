Reyes argues that he demonstrated past persecution because of his political opinion and that he would likely be persecuted on that basis in Honduras in the future. He also argues that he is entitled to relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Reyes and his wife were not persecuted because of their political beliefs. Likewise, substantial evidence supports the finding that Reyes is not likely to be persecuted because of his political opinion upon his removal to Honduras. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1231(b)(3); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). We also find that substantial evidence supports the determination that Reyes was not entitled to relief under the CAT because he did not establish that the Honduran government is likely to instigate or condone his torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2), 208.18(a)(1); <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
