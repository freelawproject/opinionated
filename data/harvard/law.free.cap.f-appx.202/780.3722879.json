Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) for indecency with a child was a crime of violence. In <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604 (5th Cir.2000), this court held that the victim of a \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) offense, \u201c \u2018a child younger than 17 years,\u2019 is clearly a \u2018minor.\u2019 \u201d It also held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) was \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604-05. Although Guerrero was convicted under \u00a7 21.11(a)(1), the language in \u00a7 21.11(a) addressing the age of a victim applies to both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), and the <em>Zavala-Sustaita </em>court\u2019s holding is therefore dispositive of this case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 21.11(a). In addition, although <em>Zavala-Sustaita </em>involved an enhancement imposed under a previous version of \u00a7 2L1.2, its reasoning remains sound law and is applicable here. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-75 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d at 604), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). Guerrero has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Guerrero also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government disagrees and further asserts that Guerrero lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Because Guerrero would be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2002). However, Guerrero\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Guerrero properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
