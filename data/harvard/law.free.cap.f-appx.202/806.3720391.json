Polley challenges his underlying conviction and sentence by arguing: (1) that he is entitled to seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate to raise claims that his conviction and sentence were illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) that he is entitled to seek relief under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a); (3) that he is entitled to relief because his indictment was defective in light of <em>Booker; </em>(4) that this defect prevented the district court from having jurisdiction over Polley; and (5) that, in light of <em>Booker, </em>he was actually innocent of the offense for which he was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">Although Polley seeks to proceed under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, he has not shown that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). To the extent Polley argues that the <em>Booker </em>or <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), lines of authority apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and entitle him to file a \u00a7 2241 petition, his argument is unavailing in light of <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">\u201c[T]he All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u201d <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (quotation marks omitted). Because \u00a7 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence, <em>see Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901, the All Writs Act is not applicable to Polley\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">Polley\u2019s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction because of a defect in the indictment is unavailing. A defective indictment does not deprive a court of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630-31, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Jac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>quez-Beltran, </em>326 F.3d 661, 662 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
