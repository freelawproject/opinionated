Espinoza argues that his sentence is unreasonable and that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-27\">This court reviews a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 714 (5th Cir.2006). Espinoza con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>tends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence in that it refused to consider the sentencing disparity between his case and those of defendants in districts which offer U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 \u201cearly disposition\u201d programs. This court recently rejected a nearly identical argument, holding \u201c[t]he refusal to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs does not render a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Espinoza next argues that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors is unconstitutional. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Espinoza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Espinoza properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
