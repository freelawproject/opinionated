The claimant filed for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>The ALJ found that claimant\u2019s back injury and headaches were causally related to an accident that he suffered at work on February 11, 2001, and awarded medical expenses and continuing temporary total disability benefits. The benefits review board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order. We also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">The ALJ\u2019s factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>SGS Control Services v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, </em>86 F.3d 438 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Noble Drilling v. Drake, </em>795 F.2d 478 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">The ALJ\u2019s finding of causation is supported by substantial evidence, even without reference to the Section 20(a) presumption. Both the claimant and his wife testified that his headaches were different, and more severe, after his work accident. Their testimony was corroborated by his treating physician, Dr. Goldware, who testified that the herniated disc at C5-6 was caused by the claimant\u2019s work accident and was not aggravated by a subsequent automobile accident. Accordingly, the order of the ALJ is</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
