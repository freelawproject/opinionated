He asserts that the district court\u2019s strict adherence to the Sentencing Guidelines without adequate consideration of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) resulted in an unreasonably high sentence. He also asserts that the district court clearly erred in imposing firearm and leader/organizer enhancements under the Guidelines. In addition, Garcia seeks to adopt by reference the arguments raised by his co-defendants. However, because he is the sole appellant in this case, we will not consider arguments that are not contained in his brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-23\">The Government asserts that Garcia is barred from appealing his sentence by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. The provision states that \u201cthe defendant waives the right to appeal the plea, conviction and sentence (or the manner in which it was determined) ... except for an upward departure.\u201d We apply the normal principles of contract interpretation when construing a plea agreement. <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). So long as the defendant\u2019s agreement to a waiver provision was knowing and voluntary, the waiver will be enforced. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Garda knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal in the absence of an upward departure. The district court admonished him of the effect of the waiver provision, and Garcia stated that he understood. The court sentenced him at the low end of the guidelines range. Because there was no upward departure, Garcia\u2019s appeal is barred by the plain meaning of the plea agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 746-47. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
