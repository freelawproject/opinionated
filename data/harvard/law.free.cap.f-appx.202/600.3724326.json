The district court sentenced Miller to seventy-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Miller\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Miller\u2019s attorney was ineffective for failing to lodge objections to the presentence investigation report, and asserting that Miller\u2019s base offense level was incorrectly calculated. Miller was given an opportunity to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, and has asserted that his attorney was ineffective for failing to move for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We find to be without merit Miller\u2019s challenge to his sentence. While he is correct that the two prior felony controlled substance convictions on which his base offense level was founded were consolidated for sentencing purposes, they were on offenses separated by an intervening arrest, and thus are not considered to be \u201crelated\u201d for sentencing purposes. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 3) (2004). Hence, the district court properly applied a base offense level of twenty-four to Miller, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), rather than the lesser level set forth in \u00a7 2K2.1 (a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Miller\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless it conclusively appears from the face of the record that his counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). Because the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Miller\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> The probation officer calculated an advisory sentencing guideline range applicable to Miller of seventy-seven to ninety-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, founded on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
