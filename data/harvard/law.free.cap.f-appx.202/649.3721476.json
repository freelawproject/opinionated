The district court sentenced Anderson to 160 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">On appeal, Anderson argues the district court erred in failing to impose a variance sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). Anderson contends that his career offender designation over-represents his criminal history, and that his sentence is longer than necessary to comply with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). However, Anderson\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range of 151-188 months and below the statutory maximum, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
