United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1116, 163 L.Ed.2d 924 (2006). Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires a criminal litigant to file his NOA \u201cwithin ten days after the later of ... the entry of the judgment or the order being appealed.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cAbsent the filing of a timely notice of appeal, a Court of Appeals is without jurisdiction to review the decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d at 1299. A judgment or order is entered for purposes of Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, under Rule 4(b), upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may extend the time for filing the NOA \u201cfor a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by Rule 4(b).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">\u201cIn criminal cases, [we have] customarily treated a late notice filed after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>expiration of the ten-day period and before the lapse of forty days (ten plus thirty), as a motion for extension of time but a motion that properly should be decided by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Ward, </em>696 F.2d 1315, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1983); <em>see also Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 186-87 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that in criminal cases, we have typically treated a late notice of appeal, filed within the 30 days during which an extension is permissible, as a motion for extension of time and remanded to the district court for finding of excusable neglect).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">From our review of the docket, the district court\u2019s judgment denying Martinez\u2019s \u201cMotion for Request Preserved Error Review as to Sentencing\u201d was entered on January 31, 2006, and Martinez\u2019s \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d was entered on March 8, 2006. Even though Martinez failed to file his NOA within 10 days of the district court\u2019s judgment, as required by Rule 4(b)(1)(A)\u00ae, he did file it within the 40-day extension period allowed for by the rules, and our caselaw, and thus the district court should make a determination as to whether Martinez has shown excusable neglect for the late filing of his NOA. Accordingly, we remand Martinez\u2019s case to the district court for the limited purpose of making an \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\">. We previously affirmed the convictions and sentences of Martinez and his codefendants. They were convicted of conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203(a); hostage-taking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203(a); conspiracy to commit carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203(a); car-jacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119(2) and 2; and using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. <em>See United States v.
