(\u201cFord\u201d) dealership in Durant, Oklahoma \u2014 -Durant Ford Lincoln Mercury Sales, Inc. (\u201cthe Dealership\u201d). Plaintiff-Appellant Roy C. Jackson (\u201cJackson\u201d) was a member/manager of LEG and operated the dealership on behalf of LEG. LEG originally invested $220,000.00 in the Dealership. Of that sum, Jackson personally contributed $125,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">On May 31, 2001, less than a year after entering into the dealership agreement, Ford and LEG agreed that Ford would repurchase LEG\u2019s interest in the Dealership for $220,000.00, and that, in return, LEG would resign its operation of the dealership and execute a release in favor of Ford. On July 10, to fulfill its obligation, Ford issued a $220,000.00 check to LEG as payment-in-full for LEG\u2019s interest. The check was mailed to Kim McTurner, another member of LEG, and deposited in LEG\u2019s bank account. Shortly thereafter, Jackson received a portion of the $220,-000.00 \u2014 either $63,245.67 or approximately $68,000.00<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 from LEG\u2019s bank account. McTurner wrote the check for that payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">After LEG\u2019s resignation, Ford\u2019s Dealer Development Regional Manager (\u201cthe Manager\u201d) conducted an exit interview with Jackson. During the interview, the Manager used a standard \u201cOperator Exit Assessment\u201d form (\u201cthe Exit Assessment\u201d) on which the Manager cheeked a blank to indicate that he would recommend Jackson for another operator position and acknowledged that \u201cJackson could be successful as a ... Operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">In September 2004, Jackson filed a petition in Louisiana state court asserting claims for breach of contract and return of his initial investment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This action was subsequently removed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">In November 2005, the magistrate judge entered a Report and Recommendation recommending that summary judgment be granted in Ford\u2019s favor as to Jackson\u2019s breach of contract claim, because the Exit Assessment did not create a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>relationship between the parties or any attendant contractual obligations. In January 2006, over Jackson\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the Report and Recommendation and granted summary judgment in Ford\u2019s favor on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In March, the magistrate judge entered a Second Report and Recommendation recommending that summary judgment be granted in Ford\u2019s favor on Jackson\u2019s reimbursement claim. In May, without objection from Jackson, the district court adopted the Second Report and Recommendation and granted summary judgment in Ford\u2019s favor on the reimbursement claim. Jackson now appeals both of the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Summary judgment is appropriately granted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the moving party establishes its initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a material fact issue, the nonmoving party who bears the burden of proof at trial must sufficiently establish that there is a material fact issue concerning the essential elements of its cause of action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">A party\u2019s failure to object timely in writing to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation relegates the appeal of a district court\u2019s adoption thereof to plain error review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reviewing an appeal under the plain error standard, we \u201chave <em>discretion </em>to correct unobjected-to (forfeited) errors that are plain (\u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019) and affect substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In exercising our discretion, we should be mindful of those errors affecting substantial rights \u201cif the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s first summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and the second summary judgment for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Under Louisiana law, \u201ca contract is an agreement by two or more parties whereby obligations are created, modified, or extinguished.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An obligation is a legal relationship whereby a person binds himself to render a performance in favor of another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Exit Assessment failed to create any obligations on behalf of Ford. Instead, it was simply a standard one-page assessment form in which the Manager personally recommended Jackson for an operator position at another dealership. It, in no way, obligated Ford to do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">Additionally, Ford executed the release with LEG, not Jackson. Pursuant to the release, Ford agreed to and did remit the $220,000.00 to LEG, not Jackson. The $220,000.00 check was sent to McTurner, a member of LEG, who, like Jackson, was a signatory to LEG\u2019s resignation and release. The $220,000 check was then deposited in LEG\u2019s bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">Nowhere in LEG\u2019s resignation or release did LEG specify where or to whom the $220,000.00 was to be sent. Rather, these documents only indicated that Ford was to pay LEG the entire $220,000.00. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Moreover, the dealership agreement is silent as to where or whom Ford must send these sums. Lastly, LEG\u2019s articles of organization do not limit any of its members authority to deposit checks into its bank account. Ford did what it agreed to do\u2014 return LEG\u2019s initial investment to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Moreover, even if Ford had acted inappropriately, by acquiring knowledge of Ford\u2019s actions and failing to repudiate Ford\u2019s actions until September 2003 \u2014 over two years after Jackson received a portion of the $220,000.00 \u2014 Jackson ratified both Ford and McTurner\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, based on the applicable law and our extensive review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not commit any error. Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgments of the district court in favor of Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
