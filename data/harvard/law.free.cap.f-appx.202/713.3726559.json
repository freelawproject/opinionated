However, liberally construed, it contends that the officers and nurses acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs when they gave him a work assignment that was contrary to pri- or work classifications stating that he should not work in direct sunlight. Liberally construed, Davalos\u2019s brief also contends that the officers and nurses acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs when they did not allow him to wear his clip-on sunglasses indoors. Because Davalos conceded in his complaint and at the <em>Spears </em>hearing that Captain Whidden, Warden Wheeler, and Sergeant Smith acted in accordance with the recommendations of Nurse Brunson and Nurse Anderson when they refused to allow him to wear his sunglasses indoors and when they ordered him to work outdoors with sunglasses, there is no indication that the officers knew that Davalos faced any risk of serious harm. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Furthermore, because Nurse Brunson\u2019s and Nurse Anderson\u2019s decisions did not conflict with Davalos\u2019s eye doctor\u2019s evaluation, their medical decisions would amount to negligence at the most and are insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">To the extent that Davalos is claiming that prison officers and medial staff conspired or retaliated against him for filing grievances, his conclusory assertions are not sufficient to establish such a claim. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Lynch v. Cannatella, </em>810 F.2d 1363, 1369-70 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Davalos\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Davalos is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
