Following his guilty plea to one count of securities fraud and one count of mail fraud, Hill was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 60 months on each count, to be served consecutively and to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Hill argues that, in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced, that the enhancement of his sentence caused a structural error in his sentencing hearing, and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enhance Hill\u2019s sentence. Because Hill is challenging the validity of his underlying sentence, his Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(4) motion should have been construed as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 151 (5th Cir.1999); <em>cf. Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2651, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Prior to filing the successive motion, Hill was required to obtain authorization to file the successive motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255. Because Hill failed to obtain such authorization, the district court did not err in denying the motion. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
