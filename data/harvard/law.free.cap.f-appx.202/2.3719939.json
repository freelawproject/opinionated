Because Congress has expressly limited judicial review of federal employee workers\u2019 compensation claims to only those cases involving substantial constitutional issues, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">In 2005, Harvey filed an employment discrimination suit against the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d), a claim against private attorney John Mosby because he failed to include him in a class action suit, and workers\u2019 compensation claims against the USPS and the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-18\">The district court dismissed all of Harvey\u2019s claims. The court found that Harvey was not entitled to relief under the <em>Glover/Albrecht </em>class action handled by Mos-by. The district court also held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction for Harvey\u2019s remaining claims. Harvey also appeals the court\u2019s decision regarding his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-19\">Harvey started employment with the USPS in 1978. In 1983, Harvey suffered an on-the-job injury requiring surgery. As a result of his injury, Harvey was granted compensation for disability (lost wages) until August 5, 1995, when he rejoined the USPS on a limited basis. After his disability payments were eliminated, Harvey appealed to the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d). Although the USPS discontinued his disability payments in 1995, Harvey\u2019s medical compensation and treatment have never ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-20\">In 1999, Harvey retired from the USPS. Between the time he rejoined the USPS in 1995 and 2002, Harvey\u2019s claims were litigated within the regulatory framework for federal employee workers\u2019 compensation claims under the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8145 (2006). Under the FECA, Harvey\u2019s disability claims were repeatedly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>nied by the OWCP and the Employees Compensation Appeals Board (\u201cECAB\u201d), but his ability to receive medical compensation was repeatedly affirmed contingent upon his completing the necessary paperwork. Harvey has not completed the paperwork but continues to receive medical compensation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Harvey appeals the district court\u2019s decision regarding his workers\u2019 compensation claims. A district court\u2019s decision dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo by this court. <em>Lee v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 778, 780 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Harvey alleges that the medical treatment he is currently receiving is insufficient. Thus, Harvey\u2019s only cognizable claim is against the Department of Labor, as the USPS had no authority to review workers\u2019 compensation claims. Congress, through FECA and the Department of Labor, has set up an extensive administrative structure to adjudicate federal employee workers\u2019 compensation claims. Harvey has extensively litigated his workers\u2019 compensation claims under FECA and was denied disability but granted continual medical compensation and treatment contingent upon him completing administrative forms. Harvey alleges that his injuries require more intense medical care than has been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Congress has placed exclusive jurisdiction in the Department of Labor under FECA to handle federal employee workers\u2019 compensation claims. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c) (2006); <em>Benton v. United States, </em>960 F.2d 19, 22 (5th Cir.1992). Nevertheless, this court does have the authority to review claims where a substantial constitutional wrong is alleged. <em>Garner v. United States Department of Labor, </em>221 F.3d 822, 825 (5th Cir.2000). Because Harvey\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims do not rise to the level of a substantial constitutional wrong, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cThe government does not violate the Constitution every time it mistakenly denies a claim for benefits.\u201d <em>Czerkies v. United States Department of Labor, </em>73 F.3d 1435, 1443 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
