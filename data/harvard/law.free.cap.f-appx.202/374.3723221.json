We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding <em>de novo. Garcia v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2002). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In his motion to vacate, Cummings asserted the following claims, which we have slightly rephrased as follows: (1) the original trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment alleged a non-offense; (2) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> his conviction and life sentence must be vacated; and (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court found that the first two claims were procedurally barred because they had not been raised on direct appeal and that Cummings had not alleged or demonstrated cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default. The district court determined that the ineffective-assistance claim failed on the merits, under the applicable <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> standard. We granted a certificate of appealability on one issue:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\">Whether the district court improperly determined that [rephrased] claims [ (1) and (2) ] listed in appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate were procedurally barred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">On appeal, Cummings argues, in essence, that claims (1) and (2) were <em>collateral </em>attacks based on ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, the district court improperly determined that they were proeedurally barred based on his failure to assert them on direct appeal. Thus, he urges the district court should have reached the merits of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u201cUnder the procedural default rule, a defendant generally must advance an available challenge to a criminal conviction or sentence on direct appeal or else the defendant is barred from presenting that claim in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). By contrast, the Supreme Court has held that \u201can ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under \u00a7 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Moreover, we generally will not consider on direct appeal claims of ineffective assistance of counsel if the district court neither entertained the claims nor developed a factual record. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Construing Cummings\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, as the district court also was required to do, <em>Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1254 (11th Cir.2000), it is clear that Cummings\u2019s claims (1) and (2) were, in fact, collateral attacks asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. On his \u00a7 2255 motion form, Cummings stated that these claims were being raised because of his prior counsel\u2019s failure to raise them at trial or on direct appeal. Moreover, on the form he <em>explicitly </em>identified the <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>claims as being ineffective-assistance claims. And in the memorandum that Cummings filed in conjunction with his \u00a7 2255 form, he noted that his attorney had failed to make <em>Apprendi </em>objections, resulting in his conviction and subsequent enhanced sentence. In a later pleading, Cummings stated that his claims were \u201craised in conjunction with ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\u201d Finally, in his reply brief to the government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion, Cummings reiterated his prior assertions of counsel\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>object on <em>Apprendi </em>grounds, explicitly noted counsel\u2019s failure to object to the sufficiency of the indictment, and identified all of these failures as demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Cummings\u2019s pleadings, liberally construed, set out specific failures by his trial counsel and assert that each of these failures rendered counsel constitutionally ineffective. As ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, regardless of whether they could have been raised on direct appeal, the district court improperly determined that Cummings\u2019s claims (1) and (2) were procedurally barred. Despite this error, we need not remand for the district court to consider the claims, as Cummings urges us to do, because our own review of the merits reveals that the claims have no merit. <em>Cf. Peoples v. Campbell, </em>377 F.3d 1208, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004) (in the \u00a7 2254 context, opting to review merits of ineffective-assistance claims for the first instance on appeal, rather than remanding, where the district court erroneously found claims were procedurally defaulted and did not reach merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">To demonstrate that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction, a defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s errors were so deficient as to render his assistance not reasonably effective, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. When the effectiveness of counsel at sentencing is questioned, the test is not whether the sentencing court might have issued a different sentence, but only whether the original sentence comported with the law. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1251, 1259 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Cummings asserts his counsel rendered constitutionally defective assistance when he (1) failed to object on the ground that the indictment charged Cummings with a \u201cnon-offense\u201d because it stated that he conspired with other persons without specifically identifying a co-eonspirator, and (2) failed to object on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Blakely </em>grounds to the district court\u2019s finding of drug type and drug quantity in convicting and sentencing Cummings. Simply put, both of these claims fail under the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>First, counsel was not constitutionally deficient for failing to object to the absence of a specified co-conspirator in the indictment because, under the law of this Circuit, \u201can individual can be convicted of conspiracy with \u2018unknown persons\u2019 referred to in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>720 F.2d 1239, 1244-45, 1245 n. 8 (11th Cir.1983). Second, counsel was not constitutionally deficient for failing to object on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Blakely </em>grounds because the indictment charged and the jury specifically found that Cummings\u2019s drug offense had involved more than five kilograms of cocaine, thus making him eligible for 21 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>841(b)(1)(A)\u2019s statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, which he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Cummings\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, albeit on different grounds from the district court\u2019s analysis. <em>Cf. Powers v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1121, 1123-24 (11th Cir.1993) (stating that this Court can affirm on any ground that appears in the record, \u201cwhether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\">.
