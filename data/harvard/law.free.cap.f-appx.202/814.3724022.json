Dail, Texas prisoner # 750883, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous. Dail asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to consider additional material that he introduced in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s second report and recommendation. Arguably, the district court could have construed Dail\u2019s objections as a constructive motion for leave to supplement his \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d). However, because Dail, a Texas prisoner, had \u201cno constitutional expectancy of parole,\u201d <em>Malchi v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the district court did not abuse its discretion when it did not allow Dail to supplement his \u00a7 1983 action to assert that his disciplinary conviction affected his parole. <em>See Burns v. Exxon Corp., </em>158 F.3d 336, 343 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Doe v. Rains County Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>66 F.3d 1402, 1406 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Dail also argues that the district court abused its discretion when it determined that he could not recover nominal damages. Because Dail failed to establish that his constitutional rights had been violated, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Dail\u2019s claims that sought nominal damages. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Doe, </em>66 F.3d at 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Dail further argues that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed his \u00a7 1983 claims as frivolous. Because Dail\u2019s allegations that the defendants violated his constitutional rights in relation to his disciplinary conviction lacked an arguable basis in law, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Dail\u2019s complaint as frivolous. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Martin, </em>156 F.3d at 579-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">For the reasons set forth above, Dad\u2019s appeal lacks an arguable basis in law, is without arguable merit, and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dail\u2019s complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Dail had two prior strikes. <em>Dail v. Cook, </em>No. 3:02-CV-654 (S.D.Tex. Apr. 30, 2004); <em>Dail v. United States, </em>No. 3:00-CV-2354, 2001 WL 586693 (N.D.Tex. May 22, 2001). Because Dail has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Dail\u2019s motion to preserve evidence is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
