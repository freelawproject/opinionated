Burns now appeals the two-year term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his term of supervised release. He argues that the sentence imposed exceeds the maximum allowed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-19\">At issue is whether the felony classification of the underlying offense, which ultimately determines the maximum term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release, is determined by the Guidelines range calculated by the district court for the underlying offense or by the statute. We recently held that the appropriate classification is determined by the statutory section defining the offense. <em>See United States v. Alfaro-Hernandez, </em>453 F.3d 280, 282 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-20\">Burns was convicted of possession with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D). Section 841(b)(1)(D) provides that, for cases involving less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, the defendant shall \u201cbe sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 years.\u201d An offense having a maximum term of imprisonment of \u201cless than ten years but five or more years\u201d is a \u201cClass D\u201d felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(4). For Class D felonies, the maximum term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release is two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Burns was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 24 months, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>is \u201cwithin the statutorily acceptable range.\u201d <em>Alfaro-Hernandez, </em>453 F.3d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
