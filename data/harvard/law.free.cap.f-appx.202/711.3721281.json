Martinez-Ramirez argues that, although Lazaro Izaguirre was his counsel of record, Roberto Izaguirre was also acting as his counsel. Martinez-Ramirez asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to the conflict of interest caused by Roberto\u2019s representation of Martinez-Ramirez\u2019s co-defendant, Everardo Lopez-Garza.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The district court\u2019s conclusions regarding claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact which this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Bass, </em>310 F.3d 321, 325 (5th Cir.2002). Even if it is assumed that Martinez-Ramirez has established that Roberto was acting as his counsel, he has failed to show that an actual conflict of interest existed regarding Roberto or Lazaro. <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 390-91 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
