He argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of inculpatory statements Chambliss made prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">A claim of ineffective assistance generally will not be considered for the first time on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 527 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[I]neffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Chavez-Valencia, </em>116 F.3d 127, 133-34 (5th Cir.1997) (declining to review claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file motion to suppress).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">We conclude that a motion brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be preferable to direct appeal for deciding Chambliss\u2019s claim. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690. Accordingly, without prejudice to Chambliss\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
