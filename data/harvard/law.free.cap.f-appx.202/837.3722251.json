The district court denied IFP, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Lopez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Because Lopez seeks to challenge his conviction and alleged sentencing errors, a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was the appropriate vehicle to raise the claims. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Lopez does not argue that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See id. </em>He therefore has not established that his claims may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002). Additionally, to the extent that Lopez is attempting to assert a <em>Booker </em>claim in his \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>Booker </em>does not fall within \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause because it is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27. The district court thus did not err in denying Lopez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">Lopez has not demonstrated any non-frivolous ground for appeal. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
