On appeal, Lee argues that the district court erred by imposing an unreasonable sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The district court considered Lee\u2019s properly calculated sentencing range of 57 to 71 months and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) and sentenced him to 71 months of imprisonment. After the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>however, sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as \u00a7 3553(a). If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range and well below the statutory maximum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for each count, to run concurrently. The court permitted counsel to offer extensive arguments in mitigation, including consideration of Lee\u2019s personal history and circumstances. Hence, we reject Lee\u2019s assertion that the court considered his criminal history exclusively in imposing a sentence. Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
