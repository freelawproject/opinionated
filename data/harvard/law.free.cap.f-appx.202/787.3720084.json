The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), (g). We construe Mann\u2019s motion as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). A dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). The complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Mann\u2019s brief is noncompliant with Rule 28(a)(9) because he fails to provide any argument relative to the issues that he identifies in his brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.1995). Mann\u2019s brief provides only a restatement of his issues. <em>See Grant, </em>59 F.3d at 524 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Accordingly, Mann has failed to present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. His motion for IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Mann\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Mann that if he accumulates three strikes, he may no longer proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
