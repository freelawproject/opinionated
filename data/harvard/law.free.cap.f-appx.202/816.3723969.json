She argues that the district court clearly erred by not granting her a reduction in her offense level for being a minor or minimal participant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because she was merely a drug courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we continue to review \u201ca district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines in the same manner as we did <em>pre-Booker.\u201d United States v. Ville-gas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 362 n. 7 (5th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Deavours, </em>219 F.3d 400, 404 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Ochoa admitted that she and her co-defendant were to receive a substantial amount of money for transporting a large quantity of drugs. Under these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err by refusing to grant Ochoa a reduction as a minor or minimal participant. <em>See United States v. Leal-Mendoza, </em>281 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
