We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Rajitha Nair\u2019s Chapter 13 plan was confirmed in May of 2003. When Nair subsequently failed to meet payments on a 2001 Mazda Tribute, Triad Financial, the undersecured lienholder, filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in order to repossess the Mazda. Prior to the resolution of that motion, Triad and Nair filed a proposed agreed order, modifying the automatic stay and requiring Nair to: (1) maintain insurance on the car; (2) pay the arrears due on the note; and (3) pay Triad\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The bankruptcy court signed the order, but only after striking the attorneys\u2019 fees provision. The court then ordered Triad\u2019s counsel to show cause why the offending provision was not sanctionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">At the hearing, appellants counsel argued, as they argue here on appeal, that the Bankruptcy Code is silent on the question of whether an unsecured creditor may assert a priority claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. We disagree. Section 506(b) allows an <em>oversecured </em>creditor to obtain full payment of its attorneys\u2019 fees, but only to the extent that it is oversecured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By negative implication, undersecured creditors are not entitled to full payment of attorneys\u2019 fees. Indeed, while interpreting the identical provision in the context of interests payments, the Supreme Court reached this same conclusion, holding that section 506(b) has \u201cthe substantive effect of denying undersecured creditors postpetition interest on their claims.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">The cases cited by the appellant do not hold otherwise. Those cases, beginning with <em>In re United Merchants, </em>allow an unsecured creditor only an <em>unsecured </em>claim for post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, however, the undersecured creditor seeks a <em>secured </em>claim for attorneys fees. As the bankruptcy court correctly noted below, no published opinion has ever granted such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">Reaching this conclusion at the show-cause hearing, the bankruptcy court sanctioned counsel under Bankruptcy Rule 9011.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 9011(b) requires counsel to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the contents of every petition, pleading, written motion or other paper submitted to the court, and Rule 9011(c) authorizes sanctions upon counsel who fail to discharge this duty. Under Rule 9011(c)(2), \u201c[a] sanction ... shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct....\u201d We review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">On this record, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion. The bankruptcy court found that \u201cTriad\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees was not justified by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\u201d Worse yet, the court found that Triad\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cwas made in the anticipation that it would not be scrutinized by the Court because it was filed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>an agreed order.\u201d Finally, rather than impose monetary sanctions, the district court merely required appellant\u2019s counsel, who appears frequently before the court, to discontinue such requests for attorneys\u2019 fees. Because we are shown no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s disposition of this case, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
