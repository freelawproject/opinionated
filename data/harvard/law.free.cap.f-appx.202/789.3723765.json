He has not briefed a direct challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling. This is the same as if he had not appealed that ruling. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In any event, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ross\u2019s IFP application. <em>See Flowers v. Turbine Support Div., </em>507 F.2d 1242, 1244 (5th Cir.1975); <em>Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339-40, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). At that time, Ross purportedly had $3,250 in savings and checking accounts and was receiving more than $2,000 monthly in various benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Ross\u2019s appeal is without merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
