For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In 2004, Hernandez filed a claim for supplemental security income benefits (\u201cSSI\u201d), pursuant to Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c, alleging that she was unable to work because she had contracted hepatitis C and suffered from severe mental illness. Following statements from her doctor that she had a history of anxiety, the Disability Determination Service (\u201cDDS\u201d) requested that Hernandez be evaluated by a licensed psychologist. The licensed psychologist concluded that Hernandez emotional state appeared average for her age but that she had some fatigue and memory problems. A state agency psychologist also reviewed Hernandez\u2019s records, concluding that Hernandez was not significantly limited in her mental abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On May 14, 2004, the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a decision denying Hernandez\u2019s claim for SSI, holding that she had no severe impairments other than hepatitis C, borderline intellectual functioning, and carpal tunnel syndrome, and that her anxiety did not interfere with her ability to meet the demands of basic work activity. Hernandez then filed an application for administrative review, which was denied by the appeals council.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In December, 2004, Hernandez filed a complaint in district court seeking review of the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201ccommission\u201d) decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On August 22, 2005, the magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the district court affirm the commission\u2019s decision. Instead, on September 22, 2005, the district court vacated and remanded the commission\u2019s decision but held that Hernandez was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Hernandez filed a motion for a new trial on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. That motion was denied. Hernandez appeals on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees to this court under \u00a7 205(g) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA for abuse of discretion. <em>Spawn v. Western Bank-Westheimer, </em>989 F.2d 830, 839 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Under the EAJA, a court awards attorney\u2019s fees to any prevailing party- \u2014 other than the United States \u2014 unless the court finds either that the position of the government was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d or that such an award is unjust. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). In this case, the district court denied Hernandez\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, holding that the commission\u2019s position was substantially justified. In contrast, Hernandez argues that attorney\u2019s fees are proper because the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">The standard for determining whether the government\u2019s position is substantially justified is whether the position is \u201cjustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Hernandez argues that because the ALJ did not apply the six Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) treating physician factors nor accord enough weight to her physician\u2019s diagnosis, the government\u2019s position was substantially unjustified. There is no requirement that an ALJ apply the six SSA treating physician factors as long as there is an opinion of another examining physician providing a basis for a contrary opinion. <em>See Apfel, </em>209 F.3d at 458. Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ditionally, this court has held that considerable weight can be given to the opinions of non-treating physicians, especially when the treating physician\u2019s evaluation is unsupported by the evidence. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 456 (5th Cir.2000). An ALJ can discount the weight of the opinions of treating physicians relative to the opinions of others if the treating physician\u2019s opinion and diagnosis is unsupported. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 566 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">There is ample evidence demonstrating that reasonable people could disagree as to whether Hernandez was eligible for SSI benefits. In assessing mental health claims, it would be reasonable to accord more weight to the opinion of a licensed mental health professional than a doctor who lacked comparable experience. The \u201copinion of a specialist is generally accorded greater weight than that of a non-specialist.\u201d <em>Apfel, </em>209 F.3d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Even if the ALJ had applied the correct standard in reviewing Hernandez\u2019s claims, there is nothing in the record that suggests that the outcome would have been any different. An ALJ can accord considerable weight to the opinion of a non-treating physicians. The ultimate determination that more weight should have been given to the treating physician\u2019s opinion did not transform the government\u2019s position as to Hernandez\u2019s ineligibility for SSI benefits into one that can be characterized as substantially unjustified. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding such.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Additionally, Hernandez argues the district court abused its discretion because it should have waited until she filed a formal application for attorney\u2019s fees before ruling on this issue. However, there is nothing in the EAJA or our cases to support the proposition that a district court must wait until a formal application for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA is made before ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AthP\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
