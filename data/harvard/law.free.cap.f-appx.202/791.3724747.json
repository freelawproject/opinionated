Black contends that his civil rights complaint is not time-barred because (1) the one-year limitations period was tolled during the pendency of his administrative and judicial review and (2) he is entitled to equitable tolling because he did not receive notification of the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s August 20, 2004, denial of his writ application until June 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-24\">By moving for IFP, Black is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Black, however, has not shown that the district court\u2019s time-bar determination presents a nonfrivolous issue, and he is not entitled to equitable tolling because he has not shown that he diligently pursued his legal rights. <em>Cf. Phillips v. Donnelly, </em>216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>223 F.3d 797 (2000). In light of the foregoing, Black\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Black received a third strike for our dismissal of <em>Black v. Wade Corr. Ctr., </em>61 Fed.Appx. 919 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished). He is therefore barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">IFP STATUS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
