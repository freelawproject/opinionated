Payton asserted that he had a liberty interest in his release on parole, that the defendants refused to release him on parole, and that the parole hearing was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Payton\u2019s complaint on the bases (1) that all defendants were immune from liability based on absolute immunity or Eleventh Amendment immunity, and (2) that Payton has no liberty interest in parole that is protected by the Due Process Clause. <em>See Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 31-32 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Hulsey v. Owens, </em>63 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">This appeal is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, it is dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Payton\u2019s lawsuit as frivolous constitute two strikes for purposes of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Payton that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
