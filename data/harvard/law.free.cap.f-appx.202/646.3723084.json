Alexander appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Alexander was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no errors. We note that, while the sentence was substantially above the advisory guideline range of six to twelve months, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (1997), it was within the applicable statutory maximum of sixty months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). Further, while the district court explicitly recognized the advisory guideline range, the court determined that a much longer sentence was in order because of Alexander\u2019s history of repeatedly violating the terms of supervision and the need to set an example in an attempt to deter other supervisees from violating release terms. These are permissible considerations when imposing a supervised release revocation sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2000). Moreover, Alexander does not contend that the court failed to consider any pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude that the sentence imposed upon revocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>supervised release was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438-10 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
