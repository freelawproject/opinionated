Mon-dragon argues for the first time on appeal that the district court misapplied the Sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>terming Guidelines by characterizing his state felony convictions for possession of a controlled substance as aggravated felonies for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Mondragoris argument is unavailing in light of circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Mondragon argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent is inconsistent with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). Having preceded <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, Jerome </em>is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">For the first time on appeal, Mondragon also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that Mondragon lacks standing to bring a facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Because Mondragon may be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2002). Mondragon cannot succeed on his constitutional challenge, however, because his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Mon-dragon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Mondragon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
