He was sentenced to 75 months of imprisonment as to each count, to be served concurrently, and to a three-year term of supervised release. In his plea agreement, Cardona reserved the right to challenge his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">Cardona argues that he is entitled to resentencing under <em>Booker </em>because the district court enhanced his sentence based on facts that were not found by a jury or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Cardona was sentenced after the decision in <em>Booker, </em>he contends that he was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme because this court in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), effectively made the Guidelines mandatory by requiring a district court to make \u201cspecific finding[s]\u201d when imposing a sentence outside the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-27\">After <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. Therefore, to the extent Car-dona contends that the district court was precluded from enhancing his sentence based on facts that had not been either admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, his argument is untenable. Further, Cardona\u2019s argument that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mares </em>effectively made the Guidelines mandatory is unavailing. In <em>Mares, </em>this court noted that the <em>Booker </em>Court left intact 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), which requires a district court to explain the <em>reasons </em>for imposing a particular sentence, including one outside the guideline range. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>519 n. 8. Accordingly, Cardona\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
