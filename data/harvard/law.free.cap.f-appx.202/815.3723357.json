Because Coronado entered an unconditional guilty plea, he waived all nonjurisdictional defects. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Accordingly, he waived the right to challenge the district court\u2019s order striking his motion to suppress, <em>see United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1999), and any denial of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel that is unrelated to the validity of his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386, 392 (5th Cir.2000). The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to review Coronado\u2019s claim that the alleged Sixth Amendment deprivation affected the validity of his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
