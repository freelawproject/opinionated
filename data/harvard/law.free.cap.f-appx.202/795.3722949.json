Michael Worley, Nancy E Larson, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b824-4\">Jeremey Lavray Whatley, Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b824-6\">Before SMITH, WIENER, and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b824-7\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Jeremey Lavray Whatley appeals his guilty-plea conviction of possession with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of a substance containing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii), and his resulting 150-month sentence. He argues that the district court failed to sufficiently state its reasons for his sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). He also contends that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the district court\u2019s application of a two-level offense level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) based upon a finding that he possessed a firearm in connection with a drug-trafficking offense. Finally, he argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of prior conflicts with the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Whatley did not present the arguments that he makes to this court to the district court. His arguments are therefore subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Because Whatley\u2019s sentence of 150 months of imprisonment fell within the guidelines range of imprisonment, and it exceeded 24 months of imprisonment, the district court was required to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence and the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). At the sentencing hearing the district court explicitly adopted the fact findings and conclusions set forth in the PSR. After hearing from Whatley, his family members, and defense counsel, and considering letters submitted on Whatley\u2019s behalf, the district court stated that persuasive arguments had been presented, and that Whatley\u2019s case warranted a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range. The district court also stated that a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range took into account the factors of \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1) by stating the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence and the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">Although Whatley contends that the district court\u2019s application of a two-level offense level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) violated his Sixth Amendment rights, he does not challenge the factual basis for the adjustment. Additionally, Whatley was sentenced in May 2005, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was issued. As the district court observed, Whatley was sentenced pursuant to the <em>post-Booker, </em>advisory guidelines scheme. <em>\u201cBooker </em>contemplates that, with the mandatory use of the Guidelines excised, the Sixth Amendment will not impede a sentencing judge from finding all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. It is a direct contradiction of <em>Mares </em>to contend, as Whatley does, that <em>Booker </em>prohibits a judge from finding facts used to enhance a sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, facts relevant to sentencing include relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3, <em>id., </em>which includes the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) weapons adjustment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(a). The district court therefore did not commit error, plain or otherwise, when it imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range based upon, inter alia, the district court\u2019s factual determination that Whatley possessed a weapon in connection with his drug-trafficking offense. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Finally, regarding Whatley\u2019s argument that his attorney failed to provide conflict-free representation, to establish a Sixth Amendment violation, Whatley, who raised no objection based on this issue in the district court, must show that an actual conflict of interest existed that affected his attorney\u2019s performance. <em>See United States v. Lyons, </em>703 F.2d 815, 820 (5th Cir.1983). Whatley fails to argue in a clear fashion that an actual conflict existed and that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 348 (5th Cir.1984). His speculative claim is insufficient to warrant relief. <em>See Lyons, </em>703 F.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
