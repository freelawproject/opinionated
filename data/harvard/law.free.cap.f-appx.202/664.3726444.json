Blanks appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and essential portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated by the district court in its Memorandum Order entered April 20, 2005, we AFFIRM the Final Judgment entered May 24, 2005 that dismissed with prejudice all of Blanks\u2019s claims against Ford Motor. In addition, we warn Blanks that any further attempts to prosecute this frivolous appeal or any other appeal of the facts and decisions herein may result in sanctions against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
