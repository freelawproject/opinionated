He argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a determination that his prior Michigan conviction for felonious assault was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The district court determined that the increase was warranted because the Michigan felonious-assault offense was the equivalent of aggravated assault, one of the enumerated crimes of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; commentjn. l(B)(iii)). We review the district court\u2019s legal characterization of Saucedo\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 2L1.2 de novo. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 315, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">A prior conviction will qualify as a crime of violence if it is specifically enumerated in \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 1(B)(iii)), regardless whether it has the use of force as an element. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 n. 14 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). In determining whether a state conviction constitutes an \u201cenumerated offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s crime-of-violence enhancement, the court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach,\u201d defining each enumerated offense by its \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">Under the Michigan Penal Code, \u201ca person who assaults another person with a gun, revolver, pistol, knife, iron bar, club, brass knuckles, or other dangerous weapon without intending to commit murder or to inflict great bodily harm less than murder is guilty\u201d of felonious assault. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.82 (2002). The Model Penal Code states: \u201cA person is guilty of aggravated assault if he: (a)attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury purposely, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life; or (b) attempts to cause or purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another.\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">Michigan\u2019s provision is sufficiently similar to the generic contemporary definition of aggravated assault to qualify as an enumerated crime of violence. Saucedo\u2019s argument that the offense of felonious assault does not fall within the ordinary meaning of aggravated assault because, under Michigan law, felonious assault can be committed in ways that do not involve bodily injury is without merit. <em>See Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d at 413. His argument that Michigan felonious-assault offenses include battery offenses which may be committed by mere offensive touching also is without merit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">Saucedo\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.). <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Saucedo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
