See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b676-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b676-20\">Jia Fu Zheng, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">Zheng challenges the Board\u2019s finding that his testimony was not credible and that he otherwise failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will uphold a negative credibility determination if it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006), and reverse the Board\u2019s decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Zheng failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Similarly, because Zheng does not qualify for asylum, he is also ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Finally, substantial evidence supports the finding that Zheng fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). Zheng failed to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
