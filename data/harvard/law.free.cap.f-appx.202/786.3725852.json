Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the alternative, he seeks leave to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">To appeal the dismissal of his Rule 60(b) motion as an unauthorized successive habeas motion, Broussard must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Broussard has failed to show that the district court\u2019s determination that his Rule 60(b) motion should be construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is debatable among jurists of reason. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (standard for COA); <em>see also United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 552-53 (5th Cir.1998) (Rule 60(b) motion that challenges judgment of conviction on constitutional grounds is properly construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Broussard\u2019s request that he be allowed to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is foreclosed by <em>In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court\u2019s grant of certiorari in <em>Burton v. Waddington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2352, 165 L.Ed.2d 278 (2006), does not alter this conclusion. <em>See Ellis v. Collins, </em>956 F.2d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1992). We further reject Broussard\u2019s assertion that he should be allowed to bring his <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. He did not raise this claim in the district court and, in any event, it is without merit. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the request for COA is DENIED. The request for leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
