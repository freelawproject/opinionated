Williams argues that the district court misconstrued his complaint as seeking relief for a deprivation of property which occurred in November 2003, when in fact the complaint alleged claims arising out of a January 2005 incident of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The record shows that Williams submitted the complaint to prison authorities for mailing on December 26, 2004; thus, it is not possible that the complaint alleged claims arising out of an incident occurring in January 2005. Accordingly, the dismissal of the complaint was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). Williams\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Williams is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b847-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
