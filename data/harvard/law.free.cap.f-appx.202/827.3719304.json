He argues that the district court erred in determining that his 2004 Florida felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine was an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). Rocha-Gaytan acknowledges that we have held that simple possession of cocaine is an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). However, he argues that we overlooked <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), in reaching these decisions. Having preceded <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, Jerome </em>is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, the district court did not err in characterizing RochaGaytan\u2019s prior Florida conviction for simple possession of cocaine as an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Rivera, </em>265 F.3d at 312-13; <em>see also Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 693-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Rocha-Gaytan\u2019s constitutional challenge to the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rocha-Gaytan contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rocha-Gaytan properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
