Pena argues that the sentence imposed, which was an upward variance from the guideline range of 21 to 27 months, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). The sentence is reviewed for unreasonableness, taking into account the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-16\">Although the sentence imposed in this case is 57 months more than the high end of the guideline range, the district court thoroughly articulated its reasons for imposing this sentence, and those reasons were fact-specific and rationally related to the sentencing factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The district court considered the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, which includes convictions for seven driving while intoxicated offenses, three controlled substance offenses, two reckless driving offenses, and one assault-domestic violence offense. Further, there were numerous other arrests, some of which related to charges pending at the time of sentencing. Based on this information, the district court found that an upward variance was justified to address four separate sentencing factors: the defendant\u2019s criminal history, \u00a7 3553(a)(1); the need to promote respect for the law, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); the need to afford adequate deterrence, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and the need to protect the public from the defendant, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Because of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>specifically articulated reasons, we do not find that this sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
