Robinson, </em>119 F.3d 1205, 1208, 1215 (5th Cir.1997), which held that in Hobbs Act prosecutions based on local activities that affect interstate commerce, the Government need not prove that the effect of an individual defendant\u2019s conduct was substantial so long as the regulated activity, in the aggregate, could reasonably be thought to substantially affect interstate commerce. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
