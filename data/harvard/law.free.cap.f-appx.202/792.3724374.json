In that complaint, Henderson challenged the constitutionality of Texas\u2019 parole procedures. Henderson\u2019s brief, however, does not address the district court\u2019s determinations that (1) Fifth Circuit precedent deemed his ex post facto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>claim frivolous and (2) his due process challenge was not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 proceeding. These issues are therefore waived. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Henderson\u2019s appeal is frivolous and is therefore dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We remind Henderson that, after the docketing of the instant appeal, we imposed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar in <em>Henderson v. Enns, </em>179 Fed.Appx. 225 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Consequently, Henderson is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
