Valladares argues on appeal that the district court erred by denying his request for an adjustment to his sentence based on his allegedly minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">Valladares contends that he was significantly less culpable than other participants in the underlying offense and that he should have received a corresponding reduction to his sentence. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Valladares was not entitled to this adjustment is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">Valladares has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment. Consequently, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
