Necessary, Texas prisoner # 690032, was convicted of robbery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>sentenced to 60 years of imprisonment. Necessary appeals the district court\u2019s order redesignating his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. \u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Because the district court\u2019s order did not dispose of any of Necessary\u2019s claims, it was not a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. It also was not an interlocutory order specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), was not certified by the district court as immediately appealable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54, and did not meet the collateral order doctrine. Accordingly, this court does not have jurisdiction over Necessary\u2019s appeal. <em>See Acoustic Sys., Inc. v. Wenger Corp., </em>207 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Thompson v. Betts, </em>754 F.2d 1243, 1245 (5th Cir.1985). Necessary\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED. Necessary\u2019s motion to compel production of documents is also DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
