In his first issue on appeal, Olivas-Pena asserts that the district court erred in applying a 16-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 for a prior crime of violence conviction. Olivas-Pena was convicted under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(b) for lewd conduct with a minor. Olivas-Pena preserved error by objecting to the enhancement, and we review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See United States v. Calderon\u2014Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 256 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268,163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 means (1) any of certain enumerated offenses, or (2) \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). We need not reach Olivas-Pena\u2019s argument that his offense does not meet the second prong of the definition, as we conclude that it constitutes the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor. Where, as here, the enhancement provision does not define the enumerated offense, we define it using a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach, looking to the offense\u2019s ordinary, contemporary meaning. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275-76 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). Using that approach, we have defined \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d to include conduct with or in the presence of a minor, the purpose of which is the arousal or gratification of sexual desires. <em>See id. </em>at 275; <em>see also United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 604-05 (5th Cir.2000). The statute at issue in this case criminalizes the commission of lewd or lascivious acts on or with the body of a minor in order to gratify lust, passion, or sexual desires. <em>See </em>CalPenal Code \u00a7 288(a), (b). Such an offense fits within the ordinary, contemporary definition of sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d at 276-77; <em>see also Zavala-Sustaita, 214 </em>F.3d at 604-05. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">In his second point of error, Olivas \u2014 Pena argues that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Olivas-Pena\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Olivas-Pena contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Olivas-Pena properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
