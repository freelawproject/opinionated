Kelly, federal prisoner # 15592-064, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Kelly pleaded guilty in the Western District of Oklahoma to possession with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance. His \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the constitutionality of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">On direct appeal, Kelly\u2019s sentence was vacated under <em>Booker, </em>and the matter was remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>159 Fed.Appx. 864, 867-68 (10th Cir.2005). As Kelly has received all of the relief he was seeking in his \u00a7 2241 petition, his appeal is moot. <em>See McRae v. Hogan, </em>576 F.2d 615, 616-17 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>1978). Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
