Hill, Mississippi prisoner # R3634, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Hill\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Hill is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Hill wears his hair in dreadlocks for religious reasons, and the defendants enforced a prison regulation that required inmates to keep their hair short for hygienic and prison security reasons. Although inmates retain their First Amendment right to exercise religion, the right is subject to \u201creasonable restrictions and limitations necessitated by penological goals.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Garner, </em>69 F.3d 22, 25 (5th Cir.1995) . Hill has not presented a nonfrivolous issue on appeal concerning the denial of his right to the free exercise of religion. To the extent that Hill argues that the outcome of the disciplinary hearing was wrong because his hair complied with the prison regulation, he has not alleged an issue of constitutional dimension. <em>See Johnson v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>38 F.3d 198, 200 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Hill has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Hill\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The dismissal of Hill\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Hill has a prior strike. <em>Hill v. Epps, </em>No. 4:04CV286-P-D (N.D.Miss. Nov. 3, 2004). Because Hill has accumulated at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
