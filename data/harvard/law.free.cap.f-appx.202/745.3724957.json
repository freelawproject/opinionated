He seeks to challenge his conviction for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), on the ground that it cannot be sustained following <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), which decision issued after his direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The district court correctly determined that Balderas had not made the required showing that the <em>Bailey </em>decision rendered him actually innocent so as to satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 and qualify for relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Balderas asserts that there is no evidence that he actively employed the firearm at issue in this case and that his conviction therefore cannot stand <em>post-Bailey. </em>Section 924 is two-pronged, however, and the summary of the trial evidence, which showed that Balderas delivered the murder weapon to his coconspirator to shoot the intended victim in a murder-for-hire scheme, was sufficient to support Balder-as\u2019s conviction under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Schmalzried, </em>152 F.3d 354, 356-57 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Rivas, </em>85 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Balderas complains that the Government did not present, and the district court did not refer to, the original trial transcript, and he urges that it was error to rely on this court\u2019s summary of the trial evidence on direct appeal, since the direct appeal predated <em>Bailey. </em>However, Bald-eras does not challenge the accuracy of the summary of the evidence. Instead, he complains that there is no evidence specifying the exact time and place he gave the gun to Cabello and baldly asserts that the fact that he delivered the gun to Cabello was no more than speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Specific testimony regarding the time and place that Balderas actually transferred the gun to Cabello to kill Garcia was not necessary. <em>See Schmalzried, </em>152 F.3d at 356-57. To the extent that Balderas argues that his \u201cpassive possession\u201d of the gun was insufficient to support his conviction under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, he is incorrect. <em>See Schmalzried, </em>152 F.3d at 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Balderas\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s jury charge was erroneous because it did not specifically define \u201cuse\u201d or \u201ccarry\u201d is without merit. <em>See United States v. Logan, </em>135 F.3d 353, 356 (5th Cir.1998). His challenge to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that its verdict must be unanimous was raised and rejected on direct appeal and is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See United States v. Razo-Leora, </em>961 F.2d 1140, 1143 (5th Cir.1992). Balderas\u2019s new argument that the district court erroneously instructed the jury that it could find him guilty if he had used or carried \u201ca firearm diming or in relation to\u201d a crime of violence will not be addressed as it is raised for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
