Charles\u2019s claims surrounding her disciplinary conviction for extortion are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87,114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Charles\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004), insofar as she asked the district court to expunge the extortion disciplinary conviction from her record. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Charles relief from its judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <em>See Fletcher v. Apfel, </em>210 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 793 (5th Cir.1986). Finally, Charles fails to state a claim for retaliation, because she has neither supplied evidence of motivation nor adequately alleged a chronology of events that would allow a plausible inference of retaliation. <em>See Tighe v. Wall, </em>100 F.3d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-21\">Charles\u2019s appeal is without merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The instant appeal was pending when this court imposed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) three-strikes bar against Charles. <em>See Charles v. Nance, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 494 (5th Cir.2006). That bar remains in effect as to civil actions and appeals filed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Although Charles has paid the filing fees in this case, she is warned that the future filing of frivolous appeals in this court may result in additional sanctions, which may include monetary penalties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>See Goldgar v.
