Dubose, federal prisoner # 06261-043, was convicted in 2002 in the Southern District of Mississippi of manufacturing in excess of 500 grams of methamphetamine and was sentenced to 262 months of imprisonment. Dubose filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition to challenge his sentence, and he now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. He argues that he should be permitted to pursue \u00a7 2241 relief in accordance with the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Dubose has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his purported \u00a7 2241 petition was best construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion over which it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Det. Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1132 (5th Cir.1987). Dubose\u2019s contention that his claim under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), falls under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause lacks merit. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005). His argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing was raised for the first time in his appeal to this court, and we will not consider it. <em>See Leggett v. Fleming, </em>380 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
