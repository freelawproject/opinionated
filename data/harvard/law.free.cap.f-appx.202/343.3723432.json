On February 7, 2006, the district court, adopting as its opinion the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, dismissed his <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by the \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and the fact that he \u201cha[d] not sufficiently demonstrated an imminent danger which would allow him to file his case <em>in forma pauperis. </em>\u201d He appeals, contending that the deprivation of his medication may have caused him to suffer death or serious physical injury. He claims that he was not in a position to \u201cdetail [to the district court] what sort of heart medication and how life-threatening its deprivation is[,]\u201d and common sense dictates that the deprivation of any prescribed medication \u201cmay have deadly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>serious consequences.\u201d He urges us to \u201cpresume imminent danger\u201d whenever a prisoner complains of a medical issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">As an initial matter, appellant has not disputed the district court\u2019s finding that he had filed at least three prior actions, and, thus, is a \u201cfrequent filer,\u201d subject to \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1349 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) contains a \u201cthree-strikes\u201d provision, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, <em>unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (emphasis added). \u201cAfter the third meritless suit, the prisoner must pay the full filing fee at the time he initiates suit.\u201d <em>Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted). \u201cThe purpose of the PLRA is to curtail abusive prisoner litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u201cThe only exception to section 1915(g) is if the frequent filer prisoner is \u2018under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rivera v. Allin, </em>144 F.3d 719, 723 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). A prisoner alleges imminent danger of serious physical injury, when he alleges that a total withdrawal of treatment for serious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) and hepatitis, will cause him to suffer from severe ongoing complications, increased susceptibility to various illnesses, and a rapid deterioration of his condition. <em>See Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">The district court did not err by dismissing the complaint in this case. Unlike the prisoner in <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1346-47, 1349-50, who alleged specific facts about the consequences of being deprived medication for his HIV and hepatitis conditions, appellant merely has alleged that deprivation of his medication <em>may </em>result in suffering serious physical injury. He did not present any description of the condition giving rise to his prescription for heart disease medication, and never alleged that he suffered any physical injury as a result of not receiving the medication. Given that the PLRA was enacted to \u201ccurtail abusive prisoner litigation,\u201d <em>see Dupree, </em>284 F.3d at 1236, appellant\u2019s vague statements do not- satisfy the dictates of \u00a7 1915(g). The district court\u2019s decision is therefore due to be, and is,</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. Appellant also filed notices of appeal from the court\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider and motion to \"set the record straight.\u201d He does not mention these in his brief, however, and, thus, they are deemed abandoned as to any claims thereunder. <em>See Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994) (stating that a <em>pro se </em>litigant abandons an issue by failing to challenge it on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
