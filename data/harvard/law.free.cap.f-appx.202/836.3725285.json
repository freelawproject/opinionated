Penaloza-Hernandez argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing a state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felon/\u2019 for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Penaloza-Hernandez\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997). Penaloza-Hernandez argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent is inconsistent with <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). Having preceded <em>HinojosctrLopez, Jerome </em>is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">For the first time on appeal, Penaloza-Hernandez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Penaloza-Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Penaloza-Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Penaloza-Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
