He contends that, under the circumstances of this case, there was no substantial nexus to interstate commerce because he was merely standing in a city parking lot with some bullets in his pocket. Because such nexus did not exist, the district court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. He contends, moreover, that the Government, in proceeding with his prosecution, exceeded Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause authority because his possession of bullets was not an economic activity that substantially affected interstate commerce. He cites <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), to support his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">We review the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo. United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2001). Pursuant to the Commerce Clause, as interpreted by <em>Lopez, </em>Congress may permissibly regulate (1) the use of the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce; and (3) activities with a \u201csubstantial relation to interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30. <em>Lopez </em>held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which made it a federal offense to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone, was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority because \u201c[t]he act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ment that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. The Court found it dispositive that the act contained \u201cno express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. In <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996), we upheld \u00a7 922(g)(1) against a constitutional challenge based on the reasoning in <em>Lopez. </em>Section 922(g)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). We held that the statute had a jurisdiction element, so it was facially valid, and that McAllister\u2019s as applied challenge failed \u201c[bjecause the government demonstrated that the firearm possessed by McAllister previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390. In finding this statute facially constitutional, we reasoned that, unlike the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>the felon-in-possession statute has an express jurisdictional element, which would \u201censure\u201d that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90 n. 4. We have also held that nothing in Supreme Court precedent decided after <em>Lopez </em>\u201calters the reasoning upon which <em>McAllister </em>is moored.\u201d <em>See Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>McAllister </em>remains good law, as it has not been overruled or called into question by subsequent Supreme Court decisions. We therefore reject as meritless Phillips\u2019s Commerce Clause challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Next, Phillips contends that the district court erred in overruling his objections to this circuit\u2019s pattern jury instruction regarding interstate commerce, and by advising the jury that all that was necessary to sustain the interstate commerce aspect of the charged offense was proof that the ammunition had once moved in interstate commerce. He says that the instruction given to the jury constituted a judgment of guilt on one element of the offense that the Government was required to prove in accordance with <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">We perform a <em>de novo </em>review of jury instructions when the objecting party claims that prejudice was caused by instructions that either misstated the law or misled the jury. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). In determining whether the given instructions reflected the law accurately, we afford the district court wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions. <em>Id. </em>We review jury instructions to determine whether the court\u2019s charge, \u201cconsidered as a whole, sufficiently instructs the jury so that the jurors understand the issues involved and are not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1386 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">To prove a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) the defendant was a convicted felon who (2) knowingly possessed a firearm, and (3) the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Phillips\u2019s jury instruction challenge is meritless because the district court cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>rectly stated the law. The court instructed the jury that, to convict Phillips, they had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was a convicted felon who \u201cknowingly possessed any ammunition in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d The court further advised the jury that \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d included movement of ammunition from one state to another, and that Phillips need not have known of the movement of ammunition in interstate commerce. This instruction was an accurate statement of the law. Moreover, Phillips\u2019s claim that the instruction violated <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>is meritless because he stipulated that the element requiring a nexus to interstate commerce had been satisfied, so the jury did not have to find this fact. The pattern jury instruction was a correct statement of the law, and the district court properly advised the jury so that they understood the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Phillip\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
