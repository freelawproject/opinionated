Irving appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b785-19\">In this diversity action, Irving, a truck driver, sustained serious injuries during a pre-trip inspection of his truck when the truck\u2019s hood fell on his head. The hood of this truck opens from back to front, the opposite of most passenger cars. In order to prevent the hood from \u201cover travelling\u201d and falling past an upright position so as to move towards the front bumper, this particular model of truck uses a pair of nylon straps that prevent the hood from moving past an upright position when opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-20\">On November 11, 2001, Irving was at his brother\u2019s home before a job. He attempted his pre-trip inspection while in the midst of mid-day grilling. He began the inspection with a spatula in his hand but dropped it before opening the hood. After opening the hood, Irving bent over to pick up the spatula. While bent over, the hood \u201cover travelled\u201d and fell on his head, causing serious injuries. Irving filed suit against Freightliner, the manufacturer of the truck, which designated U.S. Xpress, Irving\u2019s employer, as a responsible third party. U.S. Xpress is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-21\">Approximately a week after the incident, two U.S. Xpress employees retrieved the truck, receiving the keys from Irving\u2019s brother Mark. Mark living stated that he was present when the two employees performed a pre-trip inspection prior to taking the vehicle and that he observed one of these employees find a bolt underneath the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The jury found that Freightliner was twenty percent responsible for the incident, U.S. Xpress was ten percent responsible, and Irving himself was seventy percent responsible. Because Irving was found to be more than fifty percent responsible for his injuries, the jury did not reach the damages question. Irving was awarded nothing. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 33.001 (\u201cIn an action to which this chapter applies, a claimant may not recover damages if his percentage of responsibility is greater than 50 percent.\u201d). The district court denied Irving\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, and Irving timely appealed, raising three points of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">We will reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law only if, \u201cdrawing] all reasonable inferences and resolv[ing] all credibility determinations\u201d in favor of the nonmovant, the evidence points so overwhelmingly in favor of the movant \u201cthat no reasonable juror could return\u201d a verdict for the nonmovant. <em>Int'l Ins. Co. v. RSR Corp., </em>426 F.3d 281, 296 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Cousin v. Trans Union Corp., </em>246 F.3d 359, 366 (5th Cir.2001). In reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial, we will only reverse if there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Wells Fargo Bus. Credit v. Ben Kozloff, Inc., </em>695 F.2d 940, 944 n. 3 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See Positive Black Talk Inc. v. Cash Money Records Inc., </em>394 F.3d 357, 375 (5th Cir.2004). This includes a decision by the district court to exclude expert testimony. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">A. Negligence findings against Irving and U.S. Xpress</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Irving argues that the jury\u2019s findings of negligence against him and U.S. Xpress must be overturned on appeal because the record contained no \u201cevidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude as the jury did.\u201d <em>Molnar v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc., </em>986 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir.1993). In particular, Irving argues that the testimony did not establish negligence by Irving or show that any actions or inactions taken by him could have been the proximate cause of his injuries. The defendant\u2019s safety expert testified regarding Irving\u2019s deposition testimony and provided sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that Irving\u2019s inspection was negligent with respect to the straps. The jury has the role of evaluating the credibility of testimony. <em>See Boyle v. Pool Offshore Co., </em>893 F.2d 713, 716 (5th Cir.1990); <em>see also Hindman v. City of Paris, </em>746 F.2d 1063, 1068 (5th Cir.1984) (noting that \u201cthe question of a witness\u2019s credibility is the purest of jury issues\u201d). We find no error by the district court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">With respect to the negligence finding against U.S. Xpress, we likewise observe that the jury\u2019s verdict was based on sufficient evidence. The jury properly considered the testimony and concluded U.S. Xpress was negligent. As the district court pointed out, the evidence against U.S. Xpress was weaker than that against Irving or Freightliner, and the relative assessment of fault reflected this difference. We decline to upset the jury\u2019s finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Irving has not demonstrated that a reasonable jury could not find him and U.S. Xpress liable based on the evidence. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Irving\u2019s motions on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>B. Mark Irving\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Irving\u2019s second point of error is that the district court abused its discretion in excluding a portion of Mark Irving\u2019s testimony relating to the presence of a bolt underneath the truck during a post-accident, pre-trip inspection by U.S. Xpress employees. Mark Irving testified that he observed one of the U.S. Xpress employees find a bolt underneath the truck during an inspection approximately a week after the injury to Irving. Freightliner objected to this testimony on the basis that it contradicted his deposition testimony that he did not know of anything wrong with the truck. The district court instructed the jury to disregard Mark Irving\u2019s testimony regarding the bolt found by the U.S. Xpress employees. Irving argues that the district court\u2019s decision not to permit this evidence to go to the jury was an abuse of discretion for which the jury verdict must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Irving\u2019s counsel claimed to have learned of the evidence only a day before trial and therefore argues that disclosing it two days earlier than when it was disclosed would have made no difference. Freight-liner argues that permitting this testimony would have ambushed it. The district court explained that it refused to permit this evidence because plaintiff\u2019s counsel failed to disclose it to opposing counsel and a continuance was not practicable. Furthermore, in the Order Governing Proceedings, the parties were required specifically to disclose \u201ca fair summary of the substance of the information known\u201d by those people with relevant information about the case. On appeal, we decline to hold that this exclusion was an abuse of discretion requiring reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Brennan\u2019s, Inc. v. Dickie Brennan &amp; Co., </em>376 F.3d 356, 375 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">C. Gerald Rosenbluth\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Irving\u2019s third point of error is that the district court abused its discretion in limiting the testimony of Irving\u2019s expert, Gerald Rosenbluth, relating to a washer being left out of the assembly, thereby allowing the assembly to come loose. <em>See Vogler v. Blackmore, </em>352 F.3d 150, 153-54 (5th Cir.2003) (reviewing expert testimony exclusion under an abuse of discretion standard). While Irving argues that Rosenbluth\u2019s timely-submitted expert report contained sufficient detail to allow testimony about the washer theory, the district court disagreed. In reviewing the expert report, the passages cited by Irving do not sufficiently indicate that this theory is being advanced. The district court\u2019s decision to exclude this evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
