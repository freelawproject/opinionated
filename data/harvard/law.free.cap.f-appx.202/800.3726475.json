Bounds was convicted of conspiracy to manufacture phenylacetone and methamphetamine, manufacturing amphetamine and phenylacetone, use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>He was sentenced to a total of 324 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Bounds\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The errors asserted by Bounds may not be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition unless they arise under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Claims based on <em>Booker </em>do not fall under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b828-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
