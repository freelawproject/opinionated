Walker, Texas prisoner # 585916, appeals from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Walker complains of the <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), hearing in his case being conducted by the magistrate judge. He also asserts that Assistant Warden Wesley Pratt should not have been allowed to testify at the hearing. The magistrate judge had statutory authority to conduct the hearing, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), and this court recognizes that prison officials may testify at <em>Spears </em>hearings. <em>See Wilson v. </em>Barrientos, 926 F.2d 480, 483 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Walker\u2019s allegations and his testimony at the <em>Spears </em>hearing do not give rise to an inference that Major Lynwood Cook retaliated against him for filing a grievance against the prison education department. Rather, the allegations suggest that Walker was placed in safekeeping for his own safety. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997) (requiring that the conduct alleged to be retaliatory would not have occurred absent a retaliatory motivation). Even if his allegations were true, no relief can be granted on the facts Walker alleged. <em>See Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 240 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Walker\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Walker\u2019s action and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal each count as a strike against Walker for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). If he accumulates three strikes, he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
