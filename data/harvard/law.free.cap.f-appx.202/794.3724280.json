We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo and we review a dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Morin v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">Fennell claims that he was retried on a case that had previously been dismissed by Judge Schweitzer. He asserts that Judge Schweitzer made false statements and falsified state documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">Fennel does not address the district court\u2019s determination that Judge Schweitzer is entitled to judicial immunity. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 357-60, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). He has therefore waived the issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-22\">Fennell\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is fiivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Fennell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Fennell has accumulated at least two other strikes. <em>See Fennell v. Sistrunk, </em>198 Fed.Appx. 380 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). As he has at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), Fennell is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 388; \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
