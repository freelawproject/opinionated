California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Beauchamp has filed a response, which includes a claim of ineffective assistance. We do not reach that claim (about which we express no opinion), because the record has not been adequately developed to address it on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 445-46 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-22\">Our independent review of the brief, the government\u2019s response, Beauchamp\u2019s response, and the record discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. All remaining motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
