He had two other tickets upon him when arrested. The box office price for the tickets was $5 each. There was no evidence of other sales by him at any time. He contends that there was error in the judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict in his favor; in refusing to instruct the jury: \u201cMaking a single sale of tickets does not constitute engaging in the business of selling tickets\u201d; and in certain instructions given. He relies chiefly upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>260 Mass. 300, in which we held that evidence of a single act of transportation of a passenger in a taxicab within the town limits of Brookline, did not establish that the driver was engaged in the business of transporting persons for hire in Brookline. That case was submitted on agreed facts which excluded the inference that the act was customary or one of a series, and proved that apart from the act in question no other transportation had taken place. It is nowhere intimated by the opinion that there would not have been a case for the jury had the agreed facts not precluded inferences which a jury might otherwise have drawn. It is true that the offence denounced by \u00a7 185A, added to G. L. c. 140 by St. 1924, c. 497, \u00a7 2, is engaging in the business \u201cof reselling\u201d tickets; and that it is the occupation and not an isolated act which is forbidden; <em>Goodowsky </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, 225 </em>Mass. 448, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>197 Mass. 107; but as was pointed out in the Schwartz case, at page 109, one may be engaged in the business of selling although he has made no sale. A single sale taken with other circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>may be enough to make out the offence of doing business. <em>Goodowsky </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, supra, </em>at pages 450, 451. Here there were other circumstances. The walking about in front of the place of the public amusement, calling aloud the desire to sell, having other tickets on one\u2019s person, charging a price above the box office price, are consistent with doing a business of selling. The effort to sell is part of the business. It follows, therefore, that there was no error in refusing to direct a verdict, and to give the desired instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendant put in evidence, which, if believed, would furnish a complete defence. He took exceptions to portions of the charge which instructed the jury that much of this evidence was immaterial except upon the credibility of his testimony. Where he got the tickets which he had; what he paid for them; how it happened that the friend for whom he testified they were obtained was unable to use them; and that the ticket office at the \u201cGarden\u201d was closed; all were, as the judge instructed, of no importance except as they made his testimony more or less credible. There is nothing in the exceptions to this charge in these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">He excepted also to so much of the charge as stated, \u201cUnder the conditions testified to by the government witness, the defendant is guilty, and the fact that this was the only instance of sale is no defence. It might be a fair inference from the evidence that if the defendant sold two tickets he was going to sell the other two. If he was engaged in reselling a ticket he was engaged in the business as disclosed by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The word \u2018business\u2019 must be construed in the light of the statute in which it is used.\u201d The entire charge is not before us, and we must assume that full and proper instructions were given with regard to what must be proved to entitle the prosecution to a verdict of guilty. The language excepted to is free from error. If the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses with the inferences sought to be drawn from it, was believed beyond reasonable doubt to be true, the defendant was guilty; and that only one instance of sale was shown constituted no defence. An inference that if he sold two of the four tickets which he had he was proposing to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the other two was admissible. If he was engaged in selling, as the Commonwealth's evidence justified finding, he was engaged in the business of reselling, within the meaning of \u201cbusiness\u201d as used in the statute. The cases already cited fully support the charge as given. If other and fuller instructions were desired the defendant should have asked for them. He did not so request. The exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
