During, the seasons of 1927 and 1928 the plaintiff conducted a dance hall in Scituate in the premises now occupied by the defendant, under the trade name of \u201cThe Tent by the Sea,\u201d to which a large number of people \u201ccame from various places in and around Boston and as far as Providence and Worcester.\u201d The main road from Boston passed by the plaintiff\u2019s place of business at Weymouth before passing the defendant\u2019s dance hall. There are three dance halls nearer to the plaintiff\u2019s place than that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">There is no finding that the plaintiff has lost, or is likely to lose, any patronage by reason of the operation of the dance hall at Hatherly Beach by the defendant under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>name of \u201cHatherly Beach Tent.\u201d There can be no recovery unless it appears that there has been a wrongful appropriation by the defendant of business which belongs to the plaintiff. It was said in <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>223 Mass. 104, at pages 106-107 that \u201cThe mere use of a trade name which one person has found highly effective in bringing his goods to the favorable attention of the public in one business territory, by another person in another business territory, constitutes no actionable wrong. Actual or probable deception of the public to the harm of the plaintiff is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>C. A. Briggs Co. </em>v. <em>National Wafer Co. </em>215 Mass. 100. It is plain from the facts found that the defendant\u2019s place of business is not within the same business territory as that of the plaintiff, and the defendant has not adopted any sign or style of advertising in any way resembling that of the plaintiff. On the other hand, the advertisement of the defendant states: \u201cI am in no way connected with Morey Pearl, or The Tent, Inc.\u201d It is manifest that the public \"would not be led to believe that the dance hall operated by the defendant was that of the plaintiff. The master found that there was no intentional fraud practised by the defendant on the plaintiff in the use of the name \u201cHatherly Beach Tent,\u201d but that the defendant \u201cis merely using the name \u2018Hatherly Beach Tent\u2019 and advertising the same as a dance hall situated at Hatherly Beach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant is entitled to use the word \u201cTent\u201d as a part of the name of his place of business. It is a word in common usage, and the plaintiff has no exclusive right to its use unless it has come to have a secondary meaning as a designation of the plaintiff\u2019s place of business which the public has become accustomed to associate with the name. <em>American Waltham Watch Co. </em>v. <em>United States Watch Co. </em>173 Mass. 85, 86. There is no finding that such a secondary meaning has become attached to the use of the word by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Upon the findings of the master the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief which it seeks. The case is governed in principle by <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Kaufman, supra, Burns </em>v. <em>William J. Burns </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>International Detective Agency, Inc. </em>235 Mass. 553, 557, <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Bottenberg, </em>237 Mass. 281, <em>Loew\u2019s Boston Theatres Co. </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>248 Mass. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">No question has been raised as to the form of the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of the appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
