The defendant White is the owner and lessor of the premises; the other defendants are alleged to be the lessor\u2019s agents. The plaintiff alleges that under the provisions of the lease he has the right of way over a \u201cpassageway adjoining the rear of a store, leading to the cellar and also on the first floor leading to an alleyway in the rear of said store, through which the \u201d plaintiff \u201chas been accustomed to take in and send out merchandise . . . and other materials\u201d; that the defendants trespassed on the premises \u201cby bringing thereon lumber, tools, barrels and wheelbarrels [szc] which blocked the said passageway\u201d; that the defendants \u201cby blocking up the said passageway and tearing down the same . . . and by having filled the said premises occupied by the\u201d plaintiff \u201cwith dust and dirt\u201d caused damage to the plaintiff\u2019s business and property. The lease provided: \u201cthe said Lessor doth hereby lease unto the said Murray\u2019s Gift Shop that portion of #43 Pleasant Street, Malden, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>nearest to the corner of Dartmouth Street; the premises to be divided in accordance to the plan attached, and made part of this lease.\u201d The plaintiff asked that the defendants be restrained from using the passageway and from proceeding with the erection \u201cof the wall blocking up said passageway.\u201d He also asked that damages be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The master found that the passageway, or \u201cCorridor\u201d as it is called on the plan, opens on an alley \u201ccoming in from Dartmouth Street\u201d; that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cstore fronts on Pleasant Street\u201d; that the premises No. 43 Pleasant Street had previously been rented as one store; that the plaintiff told the defendants \u201cthat he could not hire more than one half of the store\u201d; that the defendants \u201coffered to rent to the\u201d plaintiff \u201cthat part of the store nearest to Dartmouth Street\u201d and stated if the other part of the store was leased \u201cthere would have to be a change in the partition walls as existing at that time.\u201d The master also found that prior to the execution of the lease nothing was said by the parties with reference to the \u201cCorridor\u201d; that there was no intention on the part of the defendants- to include the \u201cCorridor\u201d \u201cin the lease or [that] the use thereof be included as appurtenant to the store leased\u201d; that the use of the \u201cCorridor\u201d by the plaintiff was not necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of the store.and was without the knowledge of the defendants. In the Superior Court there was an interlocutory decree overruling the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions and confirming the master\u2019s report. A final decree was entered dismissing the bill; from this final decree the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The decree dismissing the bill was right. The terms of the lease do not give the plaintiff a property right in the \u201cCorridor.\u201d By the lease the plaintiff became the lessee of the store No. 43 Pleasant Street, Malden. The reference to the plan was to indicate the manner in which the premises were to be divided. As the use of the \u201cCorridor\u201d was not necessary to the enjoyment of the leased premises, the right to use it is not to be presumed unless such is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the intention of the parties. The master found that the defendants had no such intention. <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Light Co. </em>137 Mass. 37, 43. <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>219 Mass. 556. <em>Prentiss </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>236 Mass. 36, 52. <em>Leuci </em>v. <em>Sterman, </em>244 Mass. 236, 238. <em>Wellwood </em>v. <em>Havrah Mishna Anshi Sphard Cemetery Corp. </em>254 Mass. 350, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The plaintiff contends he is entitled to damages caused to his merchandise by the repairs or alterations made in the adjoining premises. This work was performed by an independent contractor, and if any damage was done to the plaintiff\u2019s property it was not caused by the lessor\u2019s acts. Where the owner of a building uses proper care in the selection of an independent contractor to do work on the premises, the owner is not responsible for the acts of the contractor in the performance of the work unless its nature is such that a nuisance will be created or wrongful consequences result if not guarded against. <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Waldorf System, Inc. </em>241 Mass. 569, 570, and cases cited. There was no negligence on the part of the defendants. The work to be done by the contractor was not unlawful, it did not create a nuisance, and the making of the alterations could be performed without harm to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
