It is contended that the intestate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>was struck by one of the defendant\u2019s cars and received injm \u00edes from which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">There was evidence that the accident happened in the town of Middleton on July 15, 1926, at about 9;15 o\u2019clock at night. As the car approached a white pole designating a possible stopping place the motorman saw \u201cthe waving of the hand or arm straight up and down.\u201d The car was then about ninety feet from the white post. There was evidence that the emergency brake was applied when \u201cthe wave of the hand\u201d was seen; that this was all that could be done to stop the car. The car came to a stop about one hundred feet beyond the white pole. The motorman testified that after the car stopped he waited until he believed the \u201cperson . . . [he] saw wave had got to the car, . . . [he] opened the door; . . . [he] didn\u2019t see anybody coming . . . so . . . [he] reversed the light and shifted . . . [his] handles and went back; it was dark\u201d; that he found the intestate \u201claid out in the gutter side, face down with his feet two and a half or so feet from the rail . . . the body practically at right angles with the rail.\u201d The car was equipped with a headlight called \u201cgolden glow.\u201d Along the side of the way on the side of the car track there were bushes, \u201cregular brush, wood . , -. about three or four feet high.\u201d The foliage at that time of the year was \u201cvery thick.\u201d The rails were dry. As the car approached the place of the accident the grade is down for \u201cprobably four or five hundred feet.\u201d The car was going from twenty to thirty miles an hour when the motorman applied the brakes. There was evidence that when the wave of the arm was first seen the lights were dimmed \u201cin order not to blind\u201d the intestate; that the motorman \u201ckept tooting the whistle\u201d \u201cafter he saw the hand wave.\u201d The place of the accident was sparsely settled \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 only one. or two houses in the immediate vicinity \u2014 and there were no street lights. The travelled part of the way was to the left of the tracks, in the direction the car was going, and the gutter was to the right of the tracks. The car was supposed to stop at or near the white post when a signal was given. The motorman testified that he did not know that any one had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>been struck when he stopped the car. A verdict was directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">We are unable to find any evidence of negligence of the defendant or of the motorman to submit to the jury. The deceased knew that the car was approaching; his signal to stop shows this. The motorman, apparently, did all that could be done to stop the car. He was not bound to assume that the intestate would stand so close to the track that the car would hit him. The speed at which the car was moving was not excessive under all the circumstances shown, and the car was properly equipped. The case is governed by <em>Anger </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>231 Mass. 163, and cases cited. In <em>Daigneau </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>231 Mass. 166, the plaintiff signalled for the car to stop. It was said in that case there was nothing to show that the motorman \u201cought reasonably to have anticipated that the plaintiff would stand so near to the track that he would come in contact with the running board on the side of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The plaintiff relies on <em>Evensen </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>187 Mass. 77, <em>Gerhart </em>v. <em>Holyoke Street Railway, </em>236 Mass. 392, and <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>248 Mass. 572. These and the other cases cited by the plaintiff are to be distinguished on the facts from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As there was no evidence of negligence by the defendant or its servants, we have not considered the question, whether the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a passenger. See <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Fitchburg Railroad, </em>161 Mass. 298; <em>Duchemin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>186 Mass. 353; <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>Concord, Maynard &amp; Hudson Street Railway, </em>223 Mass. 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The verdict for the defendant was directed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
