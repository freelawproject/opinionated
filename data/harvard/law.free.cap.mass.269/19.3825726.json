The case was tried by a judge and a jury. The defendant moved that a verdict for it be directed. The motion was denied and the defendant excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">By G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 15, a town is made liable for a bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>injury resulting to a person by reason of a defect in a way provided such defect \u201cmight have been remedied, by reasonable care and diligence\u201d on the part of the town \u201cobliged to repair the same,\u201d and provided further that such town \u201chad or, by the exercise of proper care and diligence, might have had reasonable notice of the defect . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">It is conceded that \u201cnotice of the time, place and cause\u201d of the alleged injury was given as required by the statute (G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The jury were warranted in finding that at about seven or seven-thirty o\u2019clock on the evening of March 26, 1927, the plaintiff, while walking on a sidewalk made of cinders, which was a part of a public way in the defendant town, which it was obliged to repair (see G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 1), being lawfully on the sidewalk and in the exercise of due care, tripped upon a stake about one inch square which projected above the sidewalk from one and one half to four inches, fell, and received a bodily injury, that such stake was a defect which \u201cmight have been remedied by reasonable care and diligence\u201d on the part of the defendant, and that it was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Stoneham, </em>223 Mass. 173, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">It is contended by the defendant that there was no evidence that it \u201chad or, by the exercise of proper care and diligence, might have had reasonable notice of the defect. ...\u201d There was evidence that the sidewalk was completed late in November, 1926, and that the accident happened in front of the house in which one of the witnesses lived. This witness testified in part .that stakes were put in \u201call over the sidewalk,\u201d that \u201cthey started to put them in there in the latter end of June or the beginning of July. They didn\u2019t pull them up. Some of them are there yet,\u201d that is, at the time of the trial, and that the stake on which the plaintiff tripped was \u201cthe regular size that you see on any stake.\u201d On cross-examination this witness testified that this stake was \u201cright where they had marked to put the cinders.\u201d She \u201ctook no particular notice of that stake in particular until the accident happened.\u201d She saw \u201cthem putting down all the stakes along there.\u201d Some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the stakes \u201cdid disappear, covered up with dirt and filling in with cinders.\u201d She did \u201cknow they disappeared,\u201d but did not \u201cthink they were taken up.\u201d She tripped over one stake herself \u201cdown lower on the road.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that on the day after the accident he \u201csaw some other stakes along the sidewalk.\u201d There was no specific testimony as to when and by whom the particular stake on which the plaintiff tripped was put in the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">We cannot say that the evidence does not support the inference that the stake in question was one of a series of stakes which were put in the sidewalk while it was being constructed, and some of which, including this particular stake, had remained in the sidewalk and sticking up above it from that time until the time of the accident, and the further inference, also, that the defendant, because of the length of time during which the stakes were in the sidewalk, \u201cby the exercise of proper care and diligence, might have had reasonable notice of the defect . . . .\u201d See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>265 Mass. 94, 97. Even though there was no evidence that the particular stake had ever been noticed before the accident happened, it could have been found that proper care and attention to the sidewalk with respect to the stakes generally would have revealed its presence. See <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>147 Mass. 505, 508. It follows that it was not error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
