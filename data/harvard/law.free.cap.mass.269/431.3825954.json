There was no error in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant. We cannot say, as matter of law, that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff in walking as she did, <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>255 Mass. 539, 541, or that the servant was not careless in leaving pieces of ice where they might cause harm. The cases cited by the defendant are not controlling. In them there was no such justification as here for an inference that the servant rather than some other person was in fault. It was not pure speculation that it was he, rather than some one else, who placed the pieces of ice on the sidewalk. The judge was not in error in refusing to instruct as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
