The employee, George W. Gleason, received an injury July 3, 1928, arising out of and in the course of his employment and resulting in his death on September 22, 1928. The claimant and employee were married while he was a patient at the Boston City Hospital on August 4, 1928. He was then eighty years of age and she seventy-six. He left the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>on August 18, returned again August 28 and remained until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The single member found that Mrs. Gleason, the claimant, was a member of the employee\u2019s family at the time of the injury and that she, having been the employee\u2019s wife at the time of his death, is entitled to the compensation due his widow. The reviewing board found that the claimant was not a member of the employee\u2019s family at the time of the injury and that she not being then married to him was not a dependent within the meaning of the statute, although she was his wife at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The board had power to reverse the findings of fact of the single member upon the evidence reported by him. <em>Sonia\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 475. <em>Di Giovanni\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 241. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (3) defines dependents as \u201cmembers of the employee\u2019s family or next of kin who were wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d It is not necessary to decide whether the evidence of the claimant would support a finding that she was a member of the employee\u2019s family at the time of the accident, for the board were not obliged to believe this testimony, and we cannot say that they erred in finding that she was not a member of his family at that time. <em>Stafford\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 93, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, fixes the amount of payments to those wholly or partially dependent at the time of the injury upon the earnings of an employee whose death results from the injury. The contention of the claimant is that she is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32 (a), which so classifies \u201cA wife upon a husband with whom she lives at the time of his death. ...\u201d But this section when considered with the other provisions of the act merely determines which of the persons who are defined as dependents in \u00a7 1 (3) of the statute shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent. The conclusive presumption applies only to those who can bring themselves within the classification of dependents under the section last referred to. The \u201cascertainment of dependents is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>made as of the time of the injury to the deceased employee. It cannot be made as of any other time.\u201d <em>Bott\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 152, 154. <em>Cronin\u2019s Case, </em>234 Mass. 5, 6. Since the claimant was neither next of kin nor a member of the employee\u2019s family at the time of the injury she cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
