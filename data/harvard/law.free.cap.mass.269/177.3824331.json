The case was tried to a jury and a verdict returned for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">There was evidence that, while the plaintiff was operating his automobile with due care, the defendant drove his car \u201cat an excessive rate of speed\u201d upon and into the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, thereby causing the harm and damage complained of. There was also evidence that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, and that the collision was attributable in part to the negligent driving of the plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Without objection or exception, the supervising inspector of the State registry of motor vehicles in Worcester County testified that he partly investigated an automobile accident in which the plaintiff was involved in November, 1926; that the plaintiff told him at the office of the registry \u201che was crossing Washington Square at an estimated speed of seventeen miles an hour, and that he was in collision with this car which he hadn\u2019t seen up to the time of contact.\u201d The defendant then asked the witness, \u201cWhat official action was taken in regard to Peskin\u2019s license?\u201d Subject to the exception of the defendant the judge excluded the answer to the question, and the defendant made an offer of proof in substance \u201cthat the license of the plaintiff was suspended.\u201d In support of the relevancy of the proffered evidence the defendant relies on G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22, which reads: \u201cThe registrar may suspend or revoke any certificate of registration or any license issued under this chapter, after due hearing, for any cause which he may deem sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">It is plain the mere suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license could have no relevancy, no rational tendency to prove want of due care by the plaintiff, and it is obvious that the fact of the suspension, if admitted in evidence, would be prejudicial to the plaintiff. <em>Beauregard </em>v. <em>Benjamin F.
