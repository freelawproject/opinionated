The evidence warrants a finding for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">2. Upon all the evidence, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">3. If a husband and wife are living together and the wife is in the habit of buying goods and pledging credit for them and he has been in the habit of paying the price of such goods, it may be inferred that he authorizes the continued purchase of goods of that character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">4. If a husband and wife are living together and the wife is in the habit of buying goods and pledging credit for them and he has been in the habit of paying the price of such goods, an agency in behalf of the husband to continue to buy such goods may be presumed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">5. The <em>articles </em>purchased were necessaries for which the defendant is liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The Court allowed the first request and denied all the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The defendant also made the following requests for rulings which were all allowed by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201c1. That there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the plaintiff corporation never sold and delivered to the defendant the items enumerated in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">2. That there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant never authorized anyone to make the purchases enumerated in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">3. That there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that the plaintiff corporation and the defendant never entered into any contract, either express or implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">4. That the acts of the person alleged to have had dealings with the plaintiff corporation is not evidence of the authority of that person to bind the defendant in this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">5. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish the refusal or neglect to provide and if proof falls short of this prima facie requirement, the plaintiff cannot recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\"><em>6. </em>If the trier of fact finds that some, but not all, of the items purchased were necessaries the defendant would be liable pro tanto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">7. That the plaintiff must show facts to create the defendant\u2019s liability; if the plaintiff sold the wife more or other goods that her necessaries require, the plaintiff cannot recover of the defendant for those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">8. That in order for the plaintiff to recover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the plaintiff must show that either the defendant refused or neglected to provide for his wife with whom he was living,, or that the necessaries furnished were with the defendant\u2019s knowledge and consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">9. That the plaintiff has not maintained a prima facie case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">10. That there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Court made the following \u201cFinding of Fact\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201cThe defendant was the father of two children, one of whom is now deceased, and I find as a fact that at no time did the defendant refuse to provide any necessaries for either child at any time. I further find that he and his wife had started proceedings for separate support which at no time up to the present have ever been withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">and found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The report states that it contains all the evidence material to the question reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the denial of its requests numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5, and by the allowance of all of the defendant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">It is difficult to reconcile the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s first request for rulings with the allowance of the defendant\u2019s ninth request.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">If there was evidence warranting a finding for the plaintiff, it could not be ruled at the same time that the plaintiff had failed to maintain a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The reason given by the trial judge was \u201cthat at no time did the defendant refuse to provide any necessaries for\u201d the defendant\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"> We hold that this is not the only test. It is true that a mere relation of husband and wife does not create an agency of one for the other <em>Hannon v. Schwartz, </em>304 Mass. 468; but it is also true that one may be an agent of the other, <em>Corbuzzi v. Parks, </em>315 Mass. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The defendant concedes that the husband would be liable if he had failed to furnish necessaries of life for his wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">But there are other occasions when a husband would be liable to a storekeeper for goods purchased by the wife: (1) when she had express or implied authority to make such purchases, or (2) when the husband has ratified his wife\u2019s making them.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In the present case it could be found that the wife had implied authority to make the purchases. For ten years she had purchased goods from the plaintiff, and the defendant husband paid the bills without question. He did not pay this last one because of the pendency of probate proceedings and because his lawyer told him \u201che would take care of it\u201d. But no notice was ever given the plaintiff to stop giving credit to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In the case of <em>Rice v. James, </em>193 Mass. 458, at page 464, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cIf people were allowed to deal with an agent in such a way, and the principal recognized these dealings as valid, and gave no notice of any changes in the .conditions, he might be bound by subsequent transactions of a similar kind, even though they were unauthorized or expressly forbidden\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">We think that the plaintiff\u2019s third and fourth requests are correct statements of the law in such cases. We also agree with the statement of plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his brief, page 3, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201cUnder the doctrine of agency, and irrespective of whether any item was or was not a necessary, the defendant was liable. By his conduct his wife had implied authority from him to buy merchandise from the plaintiff and charge it to him. She was his agent for this purpose, like any other case where one holds out a person as having authority to buy things and charge it to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">This statement is in accord with that of Williston on Contracts, (3d Ed.) \u00a7270a, page 149:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cWhere a husband and wife are living together and the wife is in the habit of buying goods including luxuries and pledging her husband\u2019s credit for them and he has been in the habit of paying the price of such goods, it may fairly be inferred that he authorizes the continued purchase of goods of that character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In a much stronger case than the instant one, a wife who had gone through an invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>marriage ceremony with a man with whom she lived as a married couple, bought a fur coat and other articles in his name as her husband, the Court held that the evidence entitled the plaintiff to go to the jury on the ground of implied agency and of ratification.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b85-7\">Abraham I. Fine of Boston, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIs\">Herbert Jacobs of Needham, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is not necessary to consider the other grounds for this appeal because we find that there was prejudicial error in the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s requests 3 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The finding for the defendant is to be vacated and a new finding is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $97.32 with interest from the date of the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
