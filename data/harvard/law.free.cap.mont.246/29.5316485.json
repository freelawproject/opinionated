The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to ten (10) years with fqur (4) years suspended on Count I, Theft; ten (10) years with four (4) years suspended on Count II, Issuing a Bad Check; and ten (10) years with four (4) years suspended on Count III, Issuing a Bad Check. All three sentences shall be served consecutively. The remaining conditions and requirements as imposed by Judge Keedy will remain in effect and the petitioner shall be given credit for the 87 days incarceration in the Flathead County Jail.
