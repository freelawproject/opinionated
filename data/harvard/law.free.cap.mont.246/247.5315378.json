State Medical brought a cross-claim against the Boyds for damages for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and actual or constructive fraud. Following a jury trial in the District Court for the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, the jury returned a verdict against the Boyds on the Boyds\u2019 claims, and against State Medical on State Medical\u2019s claims. Thus, no damages were awarded to either side. The District Court then denied the Boyds\u2019 motion for a new trial. The Boyds appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">1. Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court erred in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 special verdict form and replacing it with the court\u2019s own general verdict form?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">2. Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court improperly admitted testimony of defendants\u2019 expert?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">3. Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court failed to properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Steven and Jerri Boyd, husband and wife, owned and operated a corporation known as Montana Medical Oxygen Supply, Inc. (Montana Medical). In 1983, the Federal Medicare Division initiated Medicare fraud charges against Montana Medical and Steven Boyd in federal court. These criminal charges resulted in a five year prison sentence for Steven Boyd and a $190,000 fine for Montana Medical. The federal judge agreed to review the prison sentence and fine under Rule 35 of the Criminal Rules of Civil Procedure if Steven Boyd would divest himself of all ownership in Montana Medical within 120 days. In response, Boyd executed an agreement with defendants Williams, Hungerford and Cloutier, for the sale and purchase of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Montana Medical. At about the same time, the Boyds executed documents granting powers of attorney to Williams, Hungerford and Cloutier and providing them with the right to manage Montana Medical. Upon execution of these documents, the federal judge reduced Steven Boyd\u2019s prison term to sixty days and Montana Medical\u2019s fine to $19.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">At about the same time as the pleas to the federal medicare fraud indictments were entered, Montana Medical and Steven Boyd were suspended from receiving Medicare reimbursements. As a result of the suspension and the criminal fines against Montana Medical, Williams, Hungerford, and Cloutier formed a new corporation, State Medical Oxygen and Supply, Inc. (State Medical), to purchase the assets of Montana Medical rather than purchasing the corporation outright. Once the federal sentences against Boyd and Montana Medical were reduced, controversy between the parties delayed the closing date. Ultimately the Boyds terminated the defendants\u2019 powers of attorney. The Boyds claimed that defendants\u2019 continued management of the company beyond the termination of the powers of attorney was conversion. The Boyds also claimed that State Medical refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to close the deal resulting in breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On the other side, State Medical claimed that the Boyds had fraudulently misrepresented the financial condition of Montana Medical which resulted in Williams, Hungerford and Cloutier having to infuse massive amounts of capital into the business to keep it going. Because Steven Boyd had to divest himself of ownership of Montana Medical within 120 days of the federal sentencing, the agreements between the parties were executed before in-depth audits had been completed. Defendants claimed that the Boyds were the ones who never showed any interest in closing the deal, resulting in breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The deal never closed and each party sought damages against the other, asserting that the other had caused the breach. The jury found against both parties and neither party recovered. The Boyds filed a motion for a new trial and the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Boyds claim that they are entitled to a new trial under the provisions of Rule 59(a), M.R.Civ.P., and under the provisions of \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, subsections (1), (3) an (7). Rule 59(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cRule 59(a). Grounds. A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues for any of the reasons provided by the statutes of the state of Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cA motion for new trial shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, it not being sufficient merely to set forth the statutory grounds, but the motion maybe amended, upon reasonable notice, up to and including the time of hearing the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u201cOn motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury, the court may take additional testimony, amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, set aside, vacate, modify or confirm any judgment that may have been entered or direct the entry of a new judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Section 25-11-102, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">\u201c25-11-102. Grounds for new trial. The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">\u201c(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u201c(3) accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u201c(7) error in law occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Are the plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court erred in rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 special verdict form and replacing it with the court\u2019s own general verdict form?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The District Court rejected the Boyds\u2019 special verdict form, concluding that it was virtually impossible to follow and was an invitation for error. The Boyds\u2019 special verdict form had specifically delineated each of their three causes of action requiring the jury to vote separately on each claim. The court\u2019s general verdict form submitted to the jury stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">\u201c1. Upon Plaintiffs\u2019 claims we find in favor of the Plaintiffs and award damages against the Defendant in the amount of $_.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If your verdict is in favor of the Plaintiffs and includes damages for wrongful conversion of personal property, the date of conversion is found to be_and the value of the property converted on the date is $_and which value is to be included in the total amount due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">The Boyds submit affidavits from eight of the twelve jurors, claiming that these affidavits prove that the majority of the jurors thought that they must find all three of the Boyds\u2019 causes of action were present before they could award damages to the Boyds, and that the problem arose in establishing a date of conversion. The Boyds contend that such an interpretation by the jury was not contemplated by any of the parties or by the court at the time the court\u2019s general verdict form was presented to the jury. The Boyds assert the juror affidavits prove the jury was misled in its duties and is an irregularity in the proceedings that prevented the Boyds from having a fair trial under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), MCA, and/or was an accident under \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">The Boyds are attempting to use juror affidavits to impeach the juror\u2019s own verdict. Montana law on the use of juror testimony and affidavits upon an inquiry into the verdict is summarized in Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201c(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing him to assent or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith. Nor may his affidavit or evidence of any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">\u201cHowever, as an exception to this subdivision, a juror may testify and an affidavit or evidence of any kind be received as to any matter or statement concerning only the following questions, whether occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or not: (1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; or (2) whether any outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror; or (3) whether any juror has been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The policy reasons behind this rale are well stated at 76 Am. Jur.2d, Trial, \u00a7 1219, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201cThe rule is founded on public policy, and is for the purpose of preventing litigants or the public from <em>invading the privacy of the jury room, either during the deliberations of the jury or afterward. It is to prevent overzealous litigants and a curious public from prying into deliberations </em>which are intended to be, and should be, private, frank, and free discussions of the questions under consideration. <em>Further, if after being discharged and mingling with the public, jurors are permitted to impeach verdicts which they have rendered, it would open the door for tampering with jurors and would place it in the power of a dissatisfied or corrupt juror to destroy a verdict to which he had deliberately given his assent under sanction of an oath ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201cTestimony of the jurors to impeach their own verdict is excluded not because it is irrelevant to the matter in issue, but because <em>experience has shown that it is more likely to prevent than to promote the discovery of the truth. Hence, the affidavit of a juror cannot be admitted to show anything relating to what passed in the jury room </em>during the investigation of the cause, or the effect of a colloquy between the court and a juror, or the arguments made to a juror by a fellow juryman.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The alleged misunderstanding of the jurors in this case does not fit into any of the three exceptions enumerated in Rule 606(b). Use of juror affidavits to prove irregularity or accident under \u00a7 25-11-102(1), (3), MCA, as attempted by the Boyds, is clearly improper. If a motion for a new trial is to be granted, an irregularity or accident in the jury proceedings must exist independent of juror affidavits. <em>Harry v. Elderkin </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 1, 6, 637 P.2d 809, 812. The Boyds present no evidence, other than the affidavits, of irregularity or accident allegedly stemming from misunderstanding by the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">The District Court properly denied the Boyds\u2019 motion for a new trial based on claims of irregularity or accident supported only by juror affidavits. We hold plaintiffs are not entitled to a new trial because the District Court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 special verdict form and replaced it with the court\u2019s own general verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because of improper admission of testimony of defendants\u2019 expert?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">During trial testimony State Medical\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Dennis O\u2019Donnell, referred to a report that was done by the Arthur Anderson CPA firm in Seattle, Washington. The report was an evaluation of Montana Medical\u2019s assets that had been done by the Arthur Anderson firm for Kalispell General\u2019 Hospital when the hospital had considered purchasing Montana Medical.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">State Medical had deposed Dr. O\u2019Donnell approximately eighteen months prior to trial and at that time Dr. O\u2019Donnell did not have access to the Arthur Anderson report. Thus, the Arthur Anderson report was not listed during discovery as one of the documents on which Dr. O\u2019Donnell based his opinion as to the value of Montana Medical. During trial Dr. O\u2019Donnell referred to the value that Arthur Anderson had placed on Montana Medical to illustrate that his value was comparable to the value arrived at by the Arthur Anderson firm. The Arthur Anderson report was not introduced as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The Boyds allege surprise as grounds for new trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA. The Boyds claim that the report was not made available to them through the discovery process, and that they did not have knowledge that Dr. O\u2019Donnell would be using the report in any way during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The Boyds argue that under Rule 26(e)(1) and (2), M.R.Civ.P., State Medical had a duty to supplement Dr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s responses to his deposition and reveal that Dr. O\u2019Donnell had obtained access to the Arthur Anderson report subsequent to Dr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Rule 26(e)(1) and (2) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201cRule 26(e). Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201c(1) Aparty is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (A) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the <em>subject matter </em>on which he is expected to testify, and the <em>substance </em>of his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">\u201c(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if he obtains information upon the basis of which (A) he <em>knows that the response was incorrect </em>when made, or (B) he knows that the response though correct when made is <em>no longer true </em>and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Each of seven criteria enumerated in <em>Ewing v. Esterholt </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 367, 373, 684 P.2d 1053, 1057, must be met before surprise can be the basis of a new trial. The Boyds are unable to establish two of the <em>Ewing </em>criteria which state in pertinent part: the facts from which the surprise resulted had a <em>material bearing </em>on the case, and the <em>result </em>of a new trial <em>will probably be different. </em>(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Dr. O\u2019Donnell testified at trial that he had formulated his opinion prior to the time that he received the Arthur Anderson report and that the report did not in any way affect his analysis or conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Since the Boyds are unable to show that the surprise had a material bearing on the case and that the result of a new trial will probably be different, we hold that the Boyds are not entitled to a new trial because of improper admission of testimony of State Medical\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court failed to properly instruct the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The Boyds claim the District Court failed to properly instruct the jury on three different issues of law, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">(A) the District Court failed to instruct the jury on termination of power of attorney,</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(B) the District Comb gave improper warranty instructions to the jury,</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">(C) the District Court improperly refused plaintiffs\u2019 proffered instruction on fraudulent conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Are plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court failed to instruct the jury on termination of power of attorney?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The District Court gave plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instructions 1 and 2 on power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Proposed Instruction No. 1 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">\u201cA power of attorney is an instrument in writing by which one person, as principal, appoints another as his agent and confers upon him the authority to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of the principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Proposed Instruction No. 2 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">\u201cAn agent can never have authority, either actual or ostensible, to do an act which is and is known or suspected by the person with whom he deals to be a fraud upon the principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Section 28-10-409, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">The court refused to give plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction No. 5 which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-16\">\u201cUnless the power of the agent is coupled with an interest in the subject of the agency, it is terminated as to every person having notice thereof by its revocation by the principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Section 28-10-802, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-18\">The court agreed with State Medical that the jury would have no independent understanding of what an \u201cagent coupled with an interest is.\u201d For that reason, there was undefined legal terms which rendered the instruction ambiguous or perhaps unintelligible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-19\">The Boyds argue that the termination of the power of attorney was central to their claim of conversion and that a failure of the court to give an instruction on the termination of power of attorney resulted in the inability of the jury to establish a date of conversion. The Boyds offer the juror affidavits as evidence of their contention. As already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>discussed under the first issue, juror affidavits may not be used to impeach a jury verdict. No other evidence was presented to indicate that the failure to give the proffered instruction substantially prejudiced the Boyds. In fact the Boyds specifically offered into evidence a document entitled \u201cTermination of Power of Attorney\u201d dated March 2, 1984. The jury did not need to be instructed regarding the power of attorney when they had the actual document in evidence to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We hold the District Court did not err in refusing to give plaintiffs\u2019 proffered instruction on termination of power of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Are the plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court gave improper warranty instructions to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The District Court gave the three following instructions, offered by State Medical, on warranties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\u201cNo. 25: One who sells or agrees to sell personal property knowing that the buyer relies upon his advice or judgment thereby warrants to the buyer that neither the seller nor any agent employed by him in the transaction knows the existence of any fact concerning the thing sold which would, to his knowledge, destroy the buyer\u2019s inducement to buy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Section 30-11-213, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">\u201cNo. 26: A warranty is an engagement by which a seller assures to a buyer the existence of some fact affecting the transaction, whether past, present, or future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Section 30-11-209, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">\u201cNo. 27: One who sells or agrees to sell personal property as his own thereby warrants that he has a good and unencumbered title thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Section 30-11-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The instructions were taken from Chapter 11 of Title 30 which applies to Sales. Section 30-11-224, MCA, states: \u201cThis part shall not apply to sales subject to the Uniform Commercial Code.\u201d The parties agreed in the Agreement to Purchase that the Uniform Commercial Code -Bulk Transfers, \u00a7 30-6-101 et seq., MCA, would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">The Uniform Commercial Code deals extensively with warranties in \u00a7\u00a7 30-2-312 through -318, MCA. The giving of Non-Uniform Commercial Code warranty instructions in a Uniform Commercial Code case may be a technical defect, but mere technical defects in the instructions, if considered as a whole, are not grounds for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>unless affecting the substantial rights of the party alleging the defect. <em>State v. DeTienne </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 249, 256, 707 P.2d 534, 538. The party alleging the defect must show that the instructions were prejudiced before a new trial may be granted. <em>Flynn v. Siren </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 359, 363, 711 P.2d 1371, 1373. Where the jury instructions, taken as a whole, state the law applicable to the case, the giving of the instruction is not grounds for a new trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We have compared the challenged instructions with the Uniform Commercial Code warranty statutes and conclude the instructions do not misstate the law. Absent a misstatement of the law, the Boyds are unable to establish prejudice or interference with their substantial rights. We hold that the giving of the warranty instructions is not grounds for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Are the plaintiffs entitled to a new trial because the District Court improperly refused plaintiffs\u2019 proffered instruction on fraudulent conveyances?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered instruction No. 23 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201cEvery conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Before an instruction can be given on fraudulent conveyances, there must be a showing that a conveyance occurred and a showing that the conveyance was intended to defraud the creditors. No such showing was made in this case. A conveyance for the purpose of fraudulent conveyances includes \u201cevery payment of money, assignment, release, transfer, lease, mortgage, or pledge of tangible or intangible property and the creation of any lien or encumbrance.\u201d Section 31-2-301(2), MCA. The District Corut determined that no evidence of a conveyance had been presented and so the instruction was improper. The Boyds argue that the security interest that the Boyds gave to the Small Business Administration (SBA) was a conveyance under the statute and the court had erroneously applied its own definition of conveyance when it stated that a security interest is not a conveyance. It is true that under \u00a7 31-2-301(2), MCA, the SBA\u2019s security interest is a conveyance. However there was no evidence presented that the giving of the security interest was fraudulent. The Boyds themselves are the ones who gave the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>interest to the SBA prior to any involvement with State Medical. The Boyds then gave a security interest to state Medical. This security interest does not in any way affect the SBA\u2019s perfected security interest and no evidence was presented to indicate that the giving of a security interest to State Medical was intended to defraud the SBA. The Boyds argue that State Medical took possession of assets owned by Montana Medical with the intent to defraud the SBA of its security interest. The transfer of possession of assets to third parties does not affect the SBA\u2019s perfected security interest and there is no evidence that there was any intent to deprive the SBA of its superior position as creditor. We conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to prove a fraudulent conveyance. We hold the court correctly refused to give an instruction on fraudulent conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES SHEEHY, McDONOUGH and HARRISON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
