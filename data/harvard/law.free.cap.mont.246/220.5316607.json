We reverse the District Court and stay the proceedings pending the outcome of National Labor Relations Board proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">1) Did the District Court err in concluding the dispute to be exempted under \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA of the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">2) Did appellants perfect this appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">The appellants in this case are 152 employees discharged by respondent Decker Coal Company for allegedly engaging in strike misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The collective bargaining agreement between Decker and its employees expired on October 1,1987. Appellants and other employees went on strike at that time. On June 24, 1988, the United Mine Workers of America, on behalf of the striking employees, made an unconditional offer to return to work, effective June 27, 1988. On June 28, 1988, Decker notified employees that approximately 80 of the striking employees would be recalled but that the remaining 152 employees would be discharged due to allegedly engaging in \"serious strike misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In November and December of 1988, the discharged employees, individually and through the UMWA, filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming their discharges to be retaliatory measures based on union activities. As of the date of this appeal, the NLRB has yet to file a complaint on behalf of the discharged employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The discharged employees filed the complaint leading to this appeal in District Court on June 23, 1989, alleging wrongful discharge pursuant to the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-901, et seq. Oral argument was held on October 25, 1989, and the court granted Decker\u2019s motion for summary judgment on November 6, 1989, ruling the Montana Act not applicable due to exemptions contained in the Act. This appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Appellants contend that the District Court erred in its determination that their wrongful discharge action is exempted under \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Section 39-2-912 states that Montana\u2019s Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act does not apply to a discharge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201c(1) that is subject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute. Such statutes include those that prohibit discharge for filing complaints, charges or claims with administrative bodies or that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, age, handicap, creed, religion, political belief, color, marital status, and other similar grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c(2) of an employee covered by a written collective bargaining agreement or a written contract of employment for a specific term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Appellants maintain that no statutory exemption applies in this instance. They contend that their labor relations dispute is not exempted by the statute, as all of the statute\u2019s exemptions are based on discrimination. We cannot interpret the statute so narrowly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Clearly, the statute\u2019s list is not meant to be all inclusive, as shown by the term \u201cand other similar grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">There is merit, however, in appellants\u2019 argument that no other state or federal statute providing a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute has yet taken effect, thereby exempting this dispute. Nor can the employees be said to be exempted from the Act\u2019s provisions by way of a collective bargaining agreement. It was the expiration of their collective bargaining agreement that set this litigation in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Should the NLRB eventually decide to enter into the dispute by filing a complaint on behalf of the discharged employees, a \u201cprocedure or remedy for contesting the dispute\u201d would be set in motion, and the statutory exemption of \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, would apply. As yet, no such procedure has taken place, and appellants state that the District Court\u2019s finding was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We find that the District Court was premature in its ruling that the claims for wrongful discharge were exempted. To ensure appellants a forum in which the dispute may be resolved, this cause is reversed and remanded to the District Court, with the proceedings stayed pending NLRB action.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Respondent Decker argues that only one appellant, Larry Deeds, has perfected an appeal. Appellants\u2019 notice of appeal is headed \u201cLarry Deeds, et al.,\u201d which Decker contends is insufficient to convey notice under Rule 4(c), Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 4(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cThe notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; and shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cAn appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Decker urges this Court to find that the term \u201cet al.\u201d is insufficient to specify the parties taking this appeal. Decker cites the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co. </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285, wherein a sharply divided Court held that Rule 3(c), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, (which is identical to Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P.), is jurisdictional in nature and requires the names of all parties taking part in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">We decline to follow the respondent\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Torres </em>decision. We instead choose to follow the Ninth Circuit decision in <em>National Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights v. I.N.S. </em>(9th Cir. 1989), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>892 F.2d 814, wherein the Circuit Court, directly addressing the use of \u201cet al.\u201d in the caption of the notice clearly indicated that all of the defendants were appealing the decision below. The Circuit Court noted that the <em>Torres </em>decision was premised on a fact pattern where one petitioner out of the sixteen plaintiffs was never named.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">It would be onerous, to say the least, to require all 152 appellants in this action to be named in the notice of appeal. In the complaint filed with the District Court, the names of all of the discharged employees takes two full pages to list. In the notice of appeal, the discharged employees were denominated \u201cLarry Deeds, et al., Plaintiffs,\u201d which we find to be sufficient to meet the intent of Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P., and provide Decker with notice of the parties appealing. \u201cEt al.\u201d in this instance is a commonly-used informality, and an appeal \u201cshall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal.\u201d Rule 4(c), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Reversed with directions to the District Court to stay proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HUNT, McDONOUGH and BARZ concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
