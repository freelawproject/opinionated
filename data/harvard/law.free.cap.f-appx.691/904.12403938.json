Bacharach Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Mr. Kenneth Huckfeldt was convicted in state court on charges of first-degree sexual assault and first-degree sexual abuse of a minor. After unsuccessfully appealing in state court, Mr. Huckfeldt sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. The district court denied relief, and Mr. Huck-feldt wants to appeal, and to obtain an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">To appeal, Mr. Huckfeldt needs a cprtifi-cate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (2012). For the certif\u00edcate, Mr. Huckfeldt must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). This showing exists only if reasonable jurists could characterize the district court\u2019s rulings as debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-20\">Mr. Huckfeldt argues that the federal district court should not have rejected his claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, conflict of interest, abuse of discretion, judicial bias, and prosecutorial misconduct. The state appellate court rejected these claims on the merits. Thus, Mr. Huckfeldt had to show that the state appellate court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">The federal district court denied habeas relief, thoroughly explaining the absence of a conflict with, or unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. We agree with that explanation and do not believe that any reasonable jurist could regard the habeas claims as reasonably debatable. As a result, we decline to issue a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">We also decline the request for an evi-dentiary hearing because the record shows the clear unavailability of habeas relief on any of the claims. <em>See Anderson v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Kan., </em>425 F.3d 853, 859 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[A]n evidentiary hearing is unnecessary if the claim can be resolved on the record.\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
