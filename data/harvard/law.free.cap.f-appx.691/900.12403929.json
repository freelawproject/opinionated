Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b926-23\">Kan. Stat. Ann \u00a7 <em>25-2309(l) </em>requires documentary proof of citizenship (\u201cDPOC\u201d) for all forms of voter registration. Plaintiffs-Appellees brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas to challenge that law as applied to applicants registering to vote while obtaining or renewing driver\u2019s licenses (the \u201cmotor voter\u201d process). The motor voter process is mandated and regulated by federal law, specifically section 5 of the National Voter Registration Act (the \u201cNVRA\u201d). Brought under the private right of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>established by the NVRA, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20510(b), the suit alleged that Kansas\u2019s DPOC requirement was preempted by the requirements of NVRA section 5. Plaintiffs-Appellees then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendant-Appellant Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. They sought to enjoin him from further enforcement of the DPOC requirement as applied to motor voter applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The district court granted the preliminary injunction. The court further ordered Secretary Kobach to register persons whose motor voter applications had been suspended or cancelled for failure to provide DPOC. In so doing, the district court held that the Plaintiffs-Appellees had made a strong showing that Kansas\u2019s DPOC law was preempted by NVRA section 5, insofar as DPOC was more than the \u201cminimum amount of information necessary\u201d to prevent duplicate registrations and to \u201cenable State election officials to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.\u201d \u00a7 20504(c)(2)(B). The district court further found that the Plaintiffs-Appellees had demonstrated irreparable harm, that the balance of the equities favored them, and that an injunction would serve the public interest. Secretary Kobach timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing \u25a0 the preliminary injunction. Under the facts of this case, section 5 of the NVRA preempts Kansas\u2019s DPOC requirement as applied to motor voter applications. Further, under the circumstances present here, no constitutional doubt arises as to whether the NVRA precludes Kansas from enforcing its voter qualifications under the Qualifications Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, the district court did not err in finding that the Plaintiffs-Appellees had made a strong showing of irreparable harm, that the balance of equities was strongly in their favor, and that an injunction would serve the public interest. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction against Secretary Kobach for reasons to be more fully explained in a forthcoming opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
