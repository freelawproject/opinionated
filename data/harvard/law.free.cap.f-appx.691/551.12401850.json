After entering into a plea agreement, Jose Luis Bernal Angulo pleaded guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>one count of possessing methamphetamine with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In the agreement, Mr. Angulo expressly waived \u201chis right to appeal his guilty plea,\u201d and \u201chis sentence as imposed by the Court ... and the manner in which the sentence is determined!,]\u201d provided the sentence is not \u201cabove the advisory guideline range determined by the Court to apply\u201d in his case. Plea Agt. at \u00b6 8(a),(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In addition to the plea agreement that stated the waivers were knowing and voluntary, <em>see </em>Plea Agt. at \u00b6 8, the district court confirmed at the plea hearing that Mr. Angulo understood the waivers in the plea agreement, <em>see </em>Plea Hr\u2019g Tr. at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The district court sentenced Mr. Angulo to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 below the advisory guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. Notwithstanding the appeal waivers, Mr. Angulo filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The government has filed a motipn to enforce the plea agreement pursuant to <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1328 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per cu-riam). In response, Mr. Angulo\u2019s counsel has stated that there are no non-frivolous arguments that can be presented in response to the motion to enforce, citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw as counsel. This court gave Mr. Angulo an opportunity to file a pro se response to the motion to enforce. The deadline for filing a response has passed and Mr. Angulo has not filed anything with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of the motion and the record and we conclude that Mr. Angulo\u2019s proposed appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver, that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights, and that enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325-28 (describing the factors this court considers when determining whether to enforce a waiver of appellate rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The motion to enforce is granted and this appeal is dismissed. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-23\"> This panel has determined that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and 'collateral estoppel. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed, R. App. P. 32.1 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>lOthCir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
