Holmes Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">Plaintiffs-Appellants Alan and Colelyn Blakely appeal from an adverse summary judgment in which the district court determined that they failed to demonstrate the damages necessary to advance a cognizable claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (\u201cImplied Covenant\u201d) against their homeowner\u2019s insurance provider, USAA Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cUSAA\u201d). This is the third time the Blakelys have appealed to' this court based on the same underlying facts and allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Mr. and Ms. Blakely own a home in Bountiful, Utah, which was insured under \u25a0a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by USAA. The policy insured against losses to the home and personal property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>gust 2002, a fire broke out in the basement of the home after a flooring contractor, Desert Rose Roofing, Inc., doing business as Stone Touch (\u201cStone Touch\u201d), applied a flammable sealant. Although the fire was contained within the basement, smoke and soot damaged other sections of the home, including floor joists, exposed subflooring, and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The Blakelys prepared an inventory of their losses and made a claim under their USAA policy. USAA then sent an adjuster to inspect the damage, and USAA\u2019s preferred contractor ultimately repaired most of the damage to the home. By mid-2003, USAA had paid out $93,332.20 on the <em>claim </em>\u2014 viz., $47,789.94 for the home, $37,832.70 for personal property, and $7,709.56 for temporary housing. However, the Blakelys were dissatisfied with the repairs to their home and the extent to which their personal property had been cleaned or replaced. Although USAA refused to authorize additional expenses, the Blakelys paid for further cleaning and repairs themselves. Around this time, the Blakelys also filed suit against Stone Touch.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">In January 2005, the Blakelys invoked their contractual right to an appraisal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Blakelys asserted that they were entitled to $468,575.05 on the claim; however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>in October 2005, the three appraisers retained under the policy\u2019s terms \u2014 one by the Blakelys \u2014 awarded only $291,356.52. After a credit for the $93,332.20 that USAA had already paid under the policy, the Blakelys were still owed $197,524.32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Blakelys admit that with the payment of the remaining appraisal award on December 5, 2005, USAA. owes them nothing further under the policy\u2019s plain terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In 2006, the Blakelys filed suit against USAA in state court, claiming breach of contract, breach of the Implied Covenant, breach of industry and statutory standards, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Blakelys alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that they suffered financial and emotional damages resulting from USAA\u2019s failure to make adequate and timely repairs, reimbursements, and investigations. USAA removed the suit to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. Following discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of USAA on all claims except the claim for breach of the Implied Covenant. Instead of summary judgment, the district court granted USAA\u2019s oral motion to dismiss the Blakelys\u2019 Implied-Covenant claim as frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Blakelys appealed for the first time, and our court affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, but reversed the dismissal of the Implied-Covenant claim. Without expressing an opinion \u201con the merits of the Blakelys\u2019 claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\u201d we specifically held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">the Blakelys alleged and put forth the following evidence suggesting that USAA acted unreasonably in taking its initial position regarding the loss amount: the appraisal award was nearly three times, or $200,000 more, than USAA\u2019s initial payout of $93,322.20; USAA\u2019s adjuster refused to communicate with the Blakelys; USAA\u2019s adjuster claimed that he could not smell smoke when the smell proved noticeable [to the appraisers] in the house three years later; USAA delegated adjustment of the contents claim to a non-adjuster; and USAA refused to pay for any repairs other than structural ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\"><em>Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>633 F.3d 944, 950 (10th Cir. 2011). On remand, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of USAA on the Blakelys\u2019 Implied-Covenant claim. <em>See Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>No. 2:06-CV-00506, 2011 WL 6218212 (D. Utah Dec. 6, 2011), <em>reversed and remanded by </em>500 Fed.Appx. 734 (10th Cir. 2012) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The Blakelys appealed a second time to this court, mounting a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that they had put forward no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Blakely, </em>500 Fed.Appx. at 738. A panel of this court concluded that the following four material facts suggested that USAA acted unreasonably: <em>viz., </em>(1) USAA refused to replace several charred floor joists, and only replaced a small section of burned subflooring after repeated complaints from the Blakelys; (2) USAA\u2019s structural adjuster refused at times to communicate with the Blakelys; (3) the structural adjuster claimed not to be able to smell smoke, even though the appraisers could smell smoke three years later; and (4) USAA\u2019s personal-property adjuster did not travel to Utah, delegated her duties to a person who was not an adjuster, and denied coverage for numerous per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>sonal and household items. <em>See id. </em>at 739-40. Pointing to <em>Jones v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, </em>286 P.3d 301 (Utah 2012), the panel explained that summary judgment was inappropriate under Utah law, because \u201c[a] jury could conclude [USAA] breached its duties by undervaluing [the Blakelys\u2019] loss\u201d or \u201cacted unreasonably by hot instructing [the Blakelys] to submit their claims in a signed proof of loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On remand a second time, the district court again granted summary judgment in USAA\u2019s favor. This time, however, the district court reasoned that the Blakelys \u201cfailed to proffer plausible damages attributable to the alleged breach of the implied contract covenant,\u201d and \u201c[a]bsent viable damages, the exercise of trial pursuant to the Tenth Circuit\u2019s mandate and application of <em>Jones </em>would be purely academic.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1683 (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Apr. 2, 2015). More specifically, the district court considered the Blakelys\u2019 alleged damages for emotional distress, economic loss, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and concluded that none were recoverable under Utah law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The Blakelys timely appealed this decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">This appeal presents the single issue of whether the Blakelys advanced a theory of recoverable damages as part of their claim against USAA for breach of the Implied Covenant. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claim on a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Hertz v. Luzenac Grp., </em>576 F.3d 1103, 1107 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe review the dismissal of these claims on a motion for summary judgment de novo.\u201d); <em>accord Harvey Barnett, Inc. v. Shidler, </em>338 F.3d 1125, 1129 (10th Cir. 2003). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); <em>accord Macon v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>743 F.3d 708, 712 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Because this is a diversity case, we must independently discern the content of and apply state law \u2014 specifically, Utah law. <em>See, e.g., Mid-Continent Gas. Co. v. Circle S Feed Store, LLC, </em>754 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201cBecause this is a diversity case, we ascertain and apply state law\u2014 in this case, New Mexico law.\u201d); <em>Yousuf v. Cohlmia, </em>741 F.3d 31, 47 (10th Cir. 2014) (noting that, where jurisdiction is based on the parties\u2019 diverse citizenship, a federal court is \u201cnot to reach our own judgment regarding the substance of the common law, but simply to ascertain and apply state law.\u201d (quoting <em>Kokins v. Teleflex, Inc., </em>621 F.3d 1290, 1295 (10th Cir. 2010))); <em>McIntosh v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>992 F.2d 251, 253 (10th Cir. 1993) (\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s rulings with respect to Kansas law.\u201d). Under Utah law,' the construction of an insurance policy is a legal question, which we review de novo. <em>See Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>754 F.3d at 1178; <em>see also </em>S.W. <em>Energy Corp. v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>974 P.2d 1239, 1242 (Utah 1999) (\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy involves ordinary rules of contract construction. We accord no deference to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the policy, but review the court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">\u201cWhen the federal courts are called upon to interpret state law, the federal court must look to the rulings of the highest state court, and, if no such rulings exist, must endeavor to predict how that high court would rule.\u201d <em>Stickley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>505 F.3d 1070, 1077 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Riddle, </em>305 F.3d 1107, 1118 (10th Cir. 2002)). \u201cThe decision of an intermediate appellate state court is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Kokins, </em>621 F.3d at 1297 (quoting <em>Stickley, </em>505 F.3d at 1077); <em>accord Etherton v. Owners Ins. Co., </em>829 F.3d 1209, 1223 (10th Cir. 2016); <em>cf. A.M. v. Holmes, </em>830 F.3d 1123, 1140-41 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cWhen a state Supreme Court has not spoken on the question at issue, we assume (without deciding) that a reasonable officer would seek guidance regarding the scope of proper conduct at least in part from any on-point decisions of the state's intermediate court of appeals.\u201d). However, under the principles of stare decisis, \u201c[w]hen a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, <em>and </em>on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state\u2019s highest court has resolved the issue.\u201d <em>Kokins, </em>621 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Wankier v. Crown Equip. Corp., </em>353 F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">At the outset, we must clarify the scope of the legal claim at issue in this appeal. As discussed above, what remains of the Blakelys\u2019 original cause of action is their claim that USAA breached the Implied Covenant prior to January 2005 by failing, <em>inter alia, </em>to reasonably investigate the loss caused' by the 2002 fire in their home. <em>See Berube v. Fashion Ctr., Ltd., </em>771 P.2d 1033, 1046 (Utah 1989) (\u201cUtah has recognized that all contracts contain a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d). Utah courts have stated that \u201can insurer\u2019s \u2018implied obligation of good faith performance contemplates, at the very least, that the insurer will diligently investigate the facts to enable it to determine whether a claim is valid, will fairly evaluate the claim, and will thereafter act promptly and reasonably in rejecting or settling the claim.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Jones, </em>286 P.3d at 304 (quoting <em>Beck v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>701 P.2d 795, 801 (Utah 1985)). As we noted in the Blakelys\u2019 first appeal to this court, in Utah, \u201cthe covenant of good faith and fair dealing.... is [not] confined to the obligations imposed by the contract itself.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>633 F.3d at 947 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Under Utah law, \u201c[djamages recoverable for breach of contract include both general damages, <em>i.e., </em>those flowing naturally from the breach, and consequential damages, <em>i.e., </em>those reasonably within the contemplation of, or reasonably foreseeable by, the parties at the time the cbntract was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>made.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801. As noted, the Blakelys admit that, with the payment of the remaining appraisal award on December 5, 2005, USAA owes them no farther amounts under the policy\u2019s express terms. <em>See Blakely, </em>683 F.3d at 947 (noting the Blakelys\u2019 admission that \u201cno further amounts are either claimed or owing under the policy\u201d). Therefore, we must determine only whether the Blakelys established that they have recoverable consequential damages \u2014 i.e., damages not flowing naturally from the breach \u2014 under their claim for breach of the Implied Covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Utah law recognizes \u201ca broad range of recoverable [consequential] damages\u201d in an action for breach of the Implied Covenant. <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 (noting that a \u201cbroad range\u201d of damages \u201cin excess of the policy limits\u201d may be \u201cforeseeabl[e]\u201d and \u201cprovable\u201d in the Implied-Covenant context, because \u201can insured frequently faces catastrophic consequences if funds are not available within a reasonable period of time to cover an insured loss\u201d); <em>accord Machan v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>116 P.3d 342, 345-46 (Utah 2005) (discussing <em>Beck\u2019s </em>holding). Although Utah law categorizes actions for breach of the Implied Covenant as contractual disputes, Utah courts have stated that \u201cthe measure of damages ... should \u2018not ignor[e] the principal reason for [other courts\u2019] adoption of the [otherwise theoretically unsound] tort approach.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Billings v. Union Bankers Ins. Co, </em>918 P.2d 461, 466 (Utah 1996) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801). Specifically, the operative rationale is \u201cto remove any incentive for insurers to breach the duty of good faith by expanding their exposure to damages caused by such a breach beyond the predictable fixed dollar amount of coverage provided by the policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">However, Utah\u2019s adoption of a doctrine expanding insurers\u2019 exposure \u201cbeyond the bare contract terms\u201d in the Implied-Covenant context remains subject to important limitations. <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801. More precisely, an insured is entitled only to \u201cthose [consequential damages] reasonably within the contemplation of, or reasonably foreseeable by, the parties at the time the contract was made.\u201d <em>Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 346 (quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801). And, <em>Beck </em>teaches that \u201c[t]he foreseeability of [consequential] damages will always hinge upon the nature and language of the [insurance] contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802; <em>see </em>J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts, \u00a7 14-5 at 548 (4th ed. 1998) (noting that \u201cthere must be an express or implied manifestation of intent to assume the risk of foreseeable consequential damages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the theories of consequential damages that the Blakelys have advanced in their claim for breach of the Implied Covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>against USAA. In brief, the Blakelys contend that they are entitled to damages for emotional distress and aggravation of medical conditions, the appraisal and diminution in value of their home, and attorney\u2019s fees. Having surveyed Utah law, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the Blakelys have failed to advance a viable theory of recoverable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Turning first to the Blakelys\u2019 theory that they were entitled to consequential damages related to emotional distress and aggravation of medical conditions, they argue that the district court erred in ruling that \u201csuch damages are only available in \u2018rare\u2019 and \u2018unusual\u2019 cases.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 26 (quoting the record). In their view, Utah law only requires an insured to \u201cconvince a jury that his <em>damages </em>are \u2018unusual\u2019 in that they are more than the typical disappointment, frustration, and anxiety \u2018normally\u2019 associated with an insurance claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28 (emphasis added). In this regard, the Blakelys assert that they need not \u201cshow both bad faith and that it was unusual,\u201d to survive a motion for summary judgment with respect to emotional distress damages. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The Blakelys have asserted, as part of their theory of emotional-distress damages, that \u201cstress related to USAA\u2019s misconduct\u201d exacerbated Ms. Blakely\u2019s preexisting medical condition and her high blood pressure. <em>Id. </em>at 33. However, having concluded that the Blakelys\u2019 amended complaint \u201cmakes no mention of physical injuries and otherwise fails to provide notice that [the Blakelys] seek damages for physical injuries,\u201d the district court declined to consider physical injuries as a basis for an award of damages. Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1683 n.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">USAA argues that the Blakelys failed to allege a separate theory of physical injuries, apart from their prayer for emotional-distress damages. In addressing this argument, the Blakelys point to several filings that refer to Ms. Blakely\u2019s medical condition: <em>viz, </em>an expert report attached to USAA\u2019s memorandum in support of summary judgment, which notes that stressful situations tended to aggravate Ms. Blakely\u2019s fibromyalgia; statements by the Blake-lys\u2019 counsel during a pretrial conference that Ms. Blakely\u2019s fibromyalgia had been aggravated; and an assertion at the first summary-judgment hearing that Ms. Blakely\u2019s medical conditions had been aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Despite these references to Ms. Blakely\u2019s medical conditions in the summary-judgment proceedings, we cannot glean from the pleadings any assertion of damages for physical injuries <em>separate </em>from the claimed emotional-distress damages. That is, the Blakelys reference medical conditions only in advancing a theory of emotional-distress damages, not in support of independent damages related to the aggravation of a medical condition. For this reason, we consider this <em>separate </em>theory of physical-injury damages to be forfeited in the district court and \u2014 given that the Blakelys do not call for application of plain-error review on appeal \u2014 to be also effectively waived. <em>See, e.g., Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., </em>634 F.3d 1123, 1131 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he failure to argue for plain error and its application on appeal\u2014 surely marks the end of the road for an argument for reversal not first presented to the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Although we consider the Blakelys\u2019 physical-injury damages theory waived, we must still assay the Blakelys\u2019 theory of emotional-distress damages under Utah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>legal standard for proving consequential damages in claims for breach of the Implied Covenant. The specific legal standard that Utah applies to claims for emotional distress under the Implied Covenant .is that, \u201cin <em>unusual </em>cases, damages for mental anguish might be provable\u201d where foreseeable given \u201cthe nature and language of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 (emphasis added). However, \u201cdamages will not be available for the mere disappointment, frustration, or anxiety normally experienced in the process of filing an insurance claim and negotiating a settlement with an insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802 n.6. In discussing this standard in an analogous (but non-insurance) setting, the Utah Supreme Court held that \u201ca non-breaching party may recover general and/or consequential damages related to emotional distress or mental anguish arising from a breach of contract <em>when such damages were both a foreseeable result of the breach and explicitly within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.\u201d Cabaness v. Thomas, </em>232 P.3d 486, 608 (Utah 2010) (emphasis added). The <em>Cabaness </em>court then reiterated <em>Beck\u2019s </em>statement that \u201cthe applicability of [emotional distress or mental anguish] damages \u2018will always hinge upon the nature and language of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Challenging the district court\u2019s summary-judgment decision, the Blakelys draw our attention to an interpretive dispute \u2014 namely, whether <em>Beck\u2019s </em>limitation of \u201cdamages for mental anguish\u201d to <em>\u201cunusual </em>cases\u201d envisions \u201cunusual\u201d'conduct by the insurer (the view advanced by USAA and adopted by the district court), or \u201cunusual\u201d damages by the insured (the Blakelys\u2019 competing perspective). <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 27-30. We need not \u2014 and thus do not \u2014 definitively opine on this interpretive dispute. That is because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>Beck </em>speaks to unusual <em>damages </em>\u2014 the view the Blakelys have propounded \u2014 the express limitations on a consequential-damages award for emotional distress squarely defeat the Blakelys\u2019 entitlement to such damages here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Critically, <em>Beck </em>stated that, in \u201cunusual cases,\u201d \u201cdamages for mental anguish <em>might </em>be provable\u201d if \u201cforeseeabl[e]\u201d given \u201cthe nature and language of the [insurance] contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 (emphasis added). <em>Beck, </em>however, expressly defined those damages to exclude \u201cthe mere disappointment, frustration, or anxiety normally experienced in the process of filing an insurance claim and negotiating a settlement with an insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802 n.6. In other words, <em>Beck </em>stressed the noncom-pensable nature of damages derived from the stress, strain, and aggravation inherent in any loss of property and subsequent insurance adjustment. Analogously, the Utah Supreme Court teaches us that <em>some </em>delay necessarily attends claim administration, stating that \u201cparties to an insurance contract <em>should expect </em>that an insurance company may require a reasonable amount of time to process or investigate a claim before determining whether to pay or deny it.\u201d <em>Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 347 (emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201c[w]here an insurance company\u2019s breach consists only of ultimately resolving a claim incorrectly and failing to pay the insured, we may presume that any damages sustained by the insured during the initial reasonable investigation period were not caused by the- breach, as these damages would have been sustained even if the insurance company had resolved the claim correctly in the insured\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Invoking <em>Beck, </em>the Blakelys argue that the fire <em>caused by Stone Touch </em>\u201cdisrupted\u201d their \u201cliving circumstances,\u201d because the fire \u201cdestroyed or damaged\u201d \u201c[m]uch of their personal belongings and interior contents\u201d and displaced them from \u201ctheir home for many weeks.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 32. Pressing forward, the Blakelys then claim that \u201cthe actions of USAA enhanced the already existing anxiety from the fire,\u201d because USAA (1) \u201cwanted to replace their upscale, custom furnishings with mediocre replacements\u201d; (2) \u201clowballed [them during claims administration] by nearly $300,000\u201d; and (3) investigated and underwrote their claim in a way that forced them \u201cto live in their home before construction was completed\u201d and to endure \u201cthe smell of smoke\u201d \u201cfor more than three years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From this, the Blakelys reason, their emotional distress exceeded \u201cthe disappointment or frustra-' tion \u2018normally\u2019 experienced during the insurance claim process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Not so. The Blakelys\u2019 claim of <em>\u201cunusual\u201d </em>damages relies on the prototypical \u201cdisappointment, frustration, or anxiety <em>normally </em>experienced in the process of filing an insurance claim and negotiating a settlement with an insurer\u201d \u2014 a patently insufficient basis under <em>Beck </em>for an inward of emotional-distress damages. <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 n.6 (emphases added). Indeed, the first two alleged breaches \u2014 USAA\u2019s effort to replace the Blakelys\u2019 \u201ccustom furnishings with mediocre replacements\" and the initial \u201clowballf]\u201d adjustment, Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 32 \u2014 express only the Blakelys\u2019 disappointment and frustration with USAA\u2019s evaluative process. <em>Beck </em>forecloses precisely this sort of consequential-damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The Blakelys\u2019 third source of distress\u2014 that they had to live in their home before construction was completed and had to endure the smell of smoke for more than three years \u2014 fares no better in advancing their cause. Although the Blakelys take exception to living in an unrepaired house smelling strongly of smoke, they offer no explanation for their three-year delay in invoking the appraisal procedure authorized by the parties\u2019 policy. As discussed above, Utah law makes clear that damages under the Implied Covenant must <em>at least </em>be foreseeable within \u201cthe nature and language of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802. Because the policy here expressly authorized the Blakelys to demand an <em>appraisal </em>\u2014 viz., to invoke a contractual mechanism clearly designed to bring loss-payment disputes to a reasonably <em>prompt </em>conclusion \u2014 we see nothing foreseeable about their purported, delay-related distress, which allegedly stemmed from the Blakelys\u2019 need to occupy an unrepaired home that was permeated with the smell of smoke for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Furthermore, although the cases the Blakelys cite \u2014 e.g., <em>Kewin v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>409 Mich. 401, 295 N.W.2d 50, 53 (1980); <em>Stewart v. Rudner, </em>349 Mich. 459, 84 N.W.2d 816, 824 (1957); and <em>Lamm v. Shingleton, </em>231 N.C. 10, 55 S.E.2d 810, 813 (1949) \u2014 support an award <em>of </em>damages for emotional distress when the failure to perform contractual obligations \u201cconcerns matters of mental concern and solicitude,\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 31, the Blakelys provide no direct legal support for an award of emotional-distress, damages in the context of an insurance policy that provides, as here, a basis to enforce contractual obligations against the insurer (i.e., the appraisal provision). Again, the Blakelys do not explain their delayed invocation of the appraisal clause \u2014 and when they did finally invoke it, USAA <em>fully </em>compensated them for the damage to their home in accordance with that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In sura, we see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Blakelys failed to demonstrate emotional-distress damages. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that <em>Beck\u2019s </em>focus is on \u201cunusual\u201d damages (as opposed to \u201cunusual\u201d insurer conduct), the Blakelys have not presented the sort of \u201cunusual case[ ]\u201d that <em>Beck </em>contemplates. <em>See Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The Blakelys next argue that \u201chad USAA fulfilled its obligations to fairly and timely investigate, evaluate, and pay, [they] would not have been forced to invoke the insurance policy\u2019s appraisal policy, which cost them significant amounts of money.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 39. At the outset, it is clear that Utah law forbids contracts from abrogating relief appropriately available under the Implied Covenant. <em>See Christiansen v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>116 P.3d 259, 261-62 (Utah 2005) (\u201cA claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing ... is based on judicially recognized duties not found within the four corners of the contract. These duties, unlike the duties expressly stated in the contract, are not subject to alteration by the parties.\u201d (citation omitted)). However, relief under the Implied Covenant must be \u201c \u2018consistent with the agreed common purpose\u2019 of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262 (quoting <em>St. Benedict\u2019s Dev. Co. v. St. Benedict\u2019s Hosp., </em>811 P.2d 194, 200 (Utah 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">As the district court explained, the Blakelys \u201chave not argued that [USAA] did not pay the cost of its own appraiser or split the other expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the umpire.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1689. The appraisal clause provided that \u201c[e]ach appraiser will be paid by the party selecting that appraiser,\u201d <em>id. </em>Vol. VI, at 1226, and that \u201c[o]ther expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the umpire will be equally paid by you and us,\u201d <em>id. </em>Because the Blakelys argue only that they should be compensated for the costs of the appraisal, in order to grant the Blakelys\u2019 requested relief, the district court would have had to override the express terms of the policy (which, as noted, allocated appraisal-related expenses between the parties). Put another way, the Blakelys are, in effect, seeking compensatory damages for the cost of the appraisal, not consequential damages for a breach of the Implied Covenant. Granting such damages on appeal would require us to override an express provision of the policy. For this reason, the Blakelys\u2019 prayer for consequential damages with respect to the appraisal clause must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The Blakelys next argue that they are entitled to be compensated for attorney\u2019s fees incurred as a result of (1) their suit against Stone Touch (the contractor that caused the fire), (2) their invocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the appraisal clause, and (3) the litigation expenses related to the instant case. The district court disagreed, ruling that it was not \u201cforeseeable that Plaintiffs [would] go outside th[e] methodology [of the policy and appraisal clause] and instead sue Stone Touch,\u201d <em>id. </em>Vol. VIII, at 1688, and that the appraisal clause already allocated costs associated with its invocation under the express terms of the policy, <em>see id. </em>at 1689. The district court further explained that \u201cthe fees and costs in the instant case are not stand-alone damages sufficient to support a breach of the implied covenant claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">It is beyond peradventure that \u201c[u]nder Utah law, plaintiffs may recover attorney fees if they are successful in pursuing a first-party bad faith suit against their insurer.\u201d <em>Campbell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>65 P.3d 1134, 1168 (Utah 2001), <em>vacated on other grounds by </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003); <em>accord Gibbs M. Smith, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>949 P.2d 337, 344 (Utah 1997) (\u201c[I]n first-party actions, attorney fees are recoverable where there has been a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing which inheres in every insurance contract.\u201d); <em>see also Billings, </em>918 P.2d at 468 (\u201cAttorney fees may be recoverable as consequential damages flowing from an insurer\u2019s breach of either the express or implied terms of an insurance contract.\u201d). \u201cHowever, as consequential damages, attorney fees are recoverable only if they were \u2018reasonably within the contemplation of, or reasonably foreseeable by, the parties at the time the contract was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Billings, </em>918 P.2d at 468 (quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801). And, \u201c[t]he foreseeability of any such damages will always hinge upon the nature and language of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the parties.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802. In this case, we cannot conclude that additional attorney\u2019s fees would have been foreseeable to the parties, because the Blakelys only invoked the appraisal clause after filing suit against Stone Touch and the policy\u2019s express terms clearly spelled out the allocation of the resulting appraisal costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As for the attorney\u2019s fees related to the instant case, the Blakelys are correct that they would be entitled to a fee award if they were adjudicated the prevailing party. <em>See Highland Constr. Co. v. Stevenson, </em>636 P.2d 1034, 1038 (Utah 1981) (\u201cIn any action brought upon either of the bonds provided herein ... the prevailing party, upon each separate cause of action, shall recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be taxed as costs.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 14-1-8 (1953))). However, as the district court noted, this rule does not provide an independent cause of action for attorney\u2019s fees, but rather allows a fee award \u201cupon each separate cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Utah Code. Ann. \u00a7 14-1-8). Therefore, to be entitled to a fee award in the instant case, the Blakelys must prevail in advancing a theory of damages under the Implied Covenant independent of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Because the Blakelys have not done so, an attorney\u2019s fees award for costs incurred in litigating the instant case would not be proper. We are equally unpersuaded that attorney\u2019s fees incurred in litigating the Stone Touch case and in invoking the appraisal clause are warranted, because those costs and fees were avoidable or accounted for under the express terms of the policy, and the Blakelys have not offered an explanation to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The Blakelys nonetheless argue that they would be entitled to a fee award if they prevailed in a claim for nominal damages. <em>See </em>Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 44; <em>see, e.g., Turtle Mgmt., Inc. v. Haggis Mgmt., Inc., </em>645 P.2d 667, 670 (Utah 1982) (\u201cNom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>mal damages are recoverable upon a breach of contract if no actual or substantial damages resulted from the breach or if the amount of damages has not been proven.\u201d); <em>accord Holmes Dev., LLC v. Cook, </em>48 P.3d 895, 906 (Utah 2002) (finding that the plaintiff\u2019s recovery would be \u201climited to nominal damages\u201d because the defendant \u201ccured the breach\u201d before the plaintiff \u201cincurred actual damages\u201d). However, the Blakelys stumble at the outset because they have not advanced a theory of nominal damages independent of their other damages theories. More specifically, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a prevailing party in a suit for nominal damages under the Implied Covenant would be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 a proposition the Blakelys do not support with any legal authority\u2014 the party would still be obliged to advance a theory of nominal damages. And, as noted, the Blakelys have not done so. Thus, we conclude that the Blakelys have made no showing qualifying them for any attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Finally, we address the Blakelys\u2019 entitlement to consequential damages for the alleged diminution in their property\u2019s value. During the final pretrial hearing on April 23, 2013, the Blakelys\u2019 counsel and the district court engaged in the following colloquy concerning the diminution-in-value claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">Court: Now, does that come in \u2014 well, now, you talk about devaluation of the home. I thought the home was paid for by the express con-traed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">Counsel: The reason why [the Blakelys] are asserting a claim for the devaluation in their home is based upon the following. Had USAA paid the appropriate amount, done their investigation, properly evaluated and timely paid, they would not have incurred the attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses, both associated with the Stone Touch as well as the appraisal. And because of the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in that regard, they did not have sufficient money to replace the floor joists and the other items that needed to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">Court: That was part of the adjustment amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">Counsel: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">Court: They were paid for that. The adjustment amount paid for the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\">Counsel: Correct. But the consequential damages under the bad faith claim is that because they incurred the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, that was not available to them to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\">Court: They were paid for that. The fact that they didn\u2019t do it is telling in two ways. It\u2019s one thing to talk about attorney\u2019s fees and quite another thing to talk about a house that you say is diminished because they didn\u2019t do what they were paid to do. That\u2019s just gone. I won\u2019t deal with the devaluation of the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1575-76 (capitalization omitted) (Tr. of Final Pretrial Hr\u2019g, dated Apr. 23, 2013). Thus, the Blakelys contended that USAA\u2019s allegedly bad-faith adjustment required them to incur \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and [litigation] expenses\u201d to obtain full payment on their insurance claim, leaving them without \u201csufficient\u201d funds to perform repairs, even after being paid the appraisal amount; that, in turn, resulted in a devaluation in their home\u2019s fair market value. <em>Id. </em>at 1576; <em>see also </em>Aplts.\u2019 Reply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Br. at 26 (\u201cThe Blakelys have alleged that, because of USAA\u2019s delays and other bad faith, they had to use the appraisal payment to pay down debt they had incurred because of that bad faith, such as the appraisal and litigation expenses discussed above. They were left with insufficient funds to make needed repairs, as a result of which (in addition to the length of time itself to that point) the value of the house diminished.\u201d). The district court effectively dismissed this claim during the final pretrial hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As noted, the court said that the Blakelys \u201cwere paid for that.... [TJhey didn\u2019t do what they were paid to do.... I won\u2019t deal with the devaluation of the home.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1576 (capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">On appeal, the Blakelys challenge the district court\u2019s reasoning, arguing that the district court erroneously \u201cassumed that the appraisers\u2019 determination of policy benefits barred the Blakelys\u2019 claims for consequential damages arising from the untimely payment of those benefits.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 48. Citing <em>Miller v. USAA Casualty Insurance Co., 44 </em>P.3d 663 (Utah 2002), the Blakelys contend instead that Utah law \u201cquite clear[ly]\u201d permits this very claim for consequential damages, e.g., a devaluation claim arising from the untimely payment of insurance benefits. Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 48. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Blakelys\u2019 diminution-in-value claim is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">yVe first introduce <em>Miller, </em>then explain our reasoning. In <em>Miller, </em>the Miller family filed an insurance claim with USAA after their basement water heater burst, and USAA retained an independent adjuster to assess the damage. 44 P.3d at 667. Dissatisfied with the assessment, the Millers filed suit against USAA asserting a contractual claim for the recovery of physical damage to their home, and extra-contractual claims for, among other things, emotional distress and loss of use. USAA moved to dismiss, arguing that the parties\u2019 appraisal clause \u2014 in all material respects, the same one implicated here \u2014 required that the parties\u2019 dispute \u201cbe resolved via the appraisal process.\u201d Id. at 668 (quoting the record). Reasoning that the \u201cparties [were] bound by contract to settle the dispute in th[e] case by appraisal,\u201d the trial court \u201cdismissed <em>all </em>of the Millers\u2019 claims, including the extra-contractual claims, because USAA invoked the appraisal clause of the insurance contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675 (first alteration in original). After the appraisal panel declined \u201cto embark on the laborious task of analyzing the extra-contractual claims\u201d \u2014 but did reach an award on their contractual claims, <em>id. </em>at 669 \u2014 the Millers proceeded to raise their extra-contractual claims in a separate civil' action. The trial court in that separate civil action, however, \u201cdismiss[ed] the extra-contractual claims,\u201d reasoning that the earlier dismissal \u201cconstituted a final judgment on the merits and, thus, those claims were precluded by res judicata and the appraisal agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">On appeal, the Utah Supreme Court considered the Millers\u2019 argument that the trial courts\u2019 treatment of their extra-contractual claims deprived them of due process. As part of that inquiry, the <em>Miller </em>court noted that the appraisal clause required only that the appraisers \u201cset the \u2018amount of loss,\u2019 \u201d meaning that \u201cthe clause necessarily appliefd] only to property damage claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. The court then explained that the \u201camount of loss as used in the appraisal clause refers to the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>of the injury or damage for which the Millers may seek indemnity,\u201d and contrasted contractual claims over that \u201camount of loss\u201d with extra-contractual claims that do not \u201cpertain to the amount of loss under the insurance contract,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In contesting the district court\u2019s order, the Blakelys seize on <em>Miller </em>to rebut any suggestion that their \u201camount of loss\u201d payment under the appraisal clause precluded them, as a matter of law, from recovering consequential damages under a diminution-in-value theory. We do not question that <em>if </em>the district court had predicated its dismissal on this legal ground, its ruling would, at the very least, have been in tension with <em>Miller. </em>But we do not interpret the district court\u2019s order that way. In response to the Blakelys\u2019 argument, the district court held: \u201cThey were paid for that.... It\u2019s one thing to talk about attorney\u2019s fees and <em>quite another thing to talk about a house that you say is diminished because they didn\u2019t do what they were paid to do.\u201d </em>Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1576 (emphases added) (capitalization omitted). In other words, the district court simply reasoned that the Blakelys\u2019 own conduct\u2014 i.e., failing to allocate the money from the appraisal process to restoration and repairs, as intended \u2014 caused any diminution in value, <em>see id., not </em>that the appraisal award itself precluded, as a matter of law, the recovery of consequential damages under a diminution-in-value theory. Accordingly, we perceive no conflict between the district court\u2019s rationale and <em>Miller.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Nor, for that matter, can we conclude that these sorts of self-inflicted injuries would have been foreseen by the parties or within their reasonable expectations, as <em>Beck </em>requires. As articulated in <em>Beck, </em>Utah law limits an award of consequential damages to \u201cthose [harms] reasonably within the contemplation of, or reasonably foreseeable by, the parties at the time the contract was made.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801. The harms at issue here \u2014 that effected the alleged diminution in value of the Blakelys\u2019 property \u2014 do not satisfy this standard because USAA and the Blakelys could not have reasonably contemplated or foreseen that the Blakelys would be the primary actors in imposing these harms on themselves, especially when doing so involved the Blakelys\u2019 decision to forgo contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>remedies. More specifically, it was <em>the Blakelys </em>who elected to pursue litigation against Stone Touch in lieu of an early contractual appraisal process, and <em>the Blakelys </em>who allocated, in significant part, the appraisal payout to litigation rather than restoring their home to its original value, as intended under the policy. In short, because the Blakelys\u2019 own conduct engendered much of the claimed delay in restoring their home and the resulting (ostensible) diminution in value, we discern no basis to conclude that then.' diminution-in-value claim would have been \u201creasonably within the contemplation of, or reasonably foreseeable by, the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, their diminution-in-value claim fails under <em>Beck,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Finally, even if the Blakelys could overcome these deficiencies, we detect an alternative ground for affirmance. <em>See Elwell v. Byers, </em>699 F.3d 1208, 1213 (10th Cir. 2012) (\u201cWe can affirm a lower court\u2019s ruling on any grounds adequately supported by the record, even grounds not relied upon by the district court.\u201d). Specifically, regardless of the substantive merits of their diminution-in-value claim, the Blakelys do not directs us \u2014 as USAA observes \u2014 to any record evidence of the alleged diminution in value. Rather, they cite an irrelevant portion of USAA\u2019s briefing before the district court, and then assert, without actual evidentiary support, that \u201cthe burned joists, floor, and other fire/smoke damage ,., caused a significant devaluation in the home\u2019s fair market value.\u201d Aplts.\u2019 Opening Br. at 17. That is not enough. On this alternative ground too, we find the diminution-in-value claim untenable. In sum, the Blakelys cannot prevail on appeal on their diminution-in-value claim.

US A A underscores the distinction between the implied obligation to perform an insurance contract in good faith in the \"first-party\u201d and \"third-party\u201d contexts. In a first-party case, as here, \"the insured sue[s] its insurer for bad faith refusal to settle the insured\u2019s claim,\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>840 P.2d 130, 137 (Utah Ct. App. 1992). On the other hand, in the third-party context, \u201can insurer is obligated to defend the insured against claims by others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138. More specifically, in the third-party context, because the insurer owes a \"fiduciaiy duty to its insured to protect the insured\u2019s interests,\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 799, \"an insured may state a cause of action in tort for an insurer's breach of its obligations,\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>840 P.2d at 138. However, the implied contractual obligation to perform a first-party insurance contract in good faith \u2014 though implicating similar considerations as a third-party tort claim \u2014 involves a <em>contractual </em>obligation. <em>See Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 800 (\"We therefore hold in a first-party relationship between an insurer and its insured, the duties and obligations of the parties are contractual rather than fiduciary.\u201d); <em>see also Black v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>100 P.3d 1163, 1169 (Utah 2004) (noting that, with respect to a first-party situation, \"[w]ith-out more, a breach of those implied or express duties can give rise only to a cause of action in contract, not one in tort\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 800)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b567-6\">. To be clear, Utah courts have observed that there are two approaches to measuring damages that various states apply to claims for breach of the Implied Covenant: <em>viz., </em>the contract approach and the tort approach. <em>See Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 801, Although Utah courts have \"rejected the tort approach\u201d in first-party insurance claims, <em>Billings, </em>918 P.2d at 466, and even noted that \"the ability of a plaintiff to recover in tort for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a contract 'has the potential for distort-tag well-established principles of contract law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Berube, </em>771 P.2d at 1046 (quoting <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 799), \"a first-party insurer who breaches the implied covenant by unreasonably denying the insured the benefits bargained for may be held liable for broad consequential damages foreseeably caused by the breach, damages which might include those for mental anguish and which would be closely analogous to those available in states taking a tort approach,\u201d <em>Billings, </em>918 P.2d at 466.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">. The Blakelys also argue that they are entitled to damages for economic loss and lost income because they \"had to spend their personal time [performing remedial work], resulting in lost income.\u201d Aplts.' Opening Br. at 45. They assert that the district court conflated <em>benefits </em>and <em>damages </em>when it noted that \u201c[t]he policy does not provide personal injury protection or other first-party losses' for lost wages or income that are typically a part of other types of insurance policies (e.g., auto insurance).\u201d Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VIII, at 1687. Although the Blakelys are correct that consequential damages may exceed contract benefits, <em>see Billings, </em>918 P.2d at 467, they must still allege and develop facts showing that USAA\u2019s alleged breach of the Implied Covenant caused the consequential loss and that the loss was foreseeable within the nature of the contract, <em>see Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802. The Blakelys have not made this showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\">. We view the district court's pretrial exclusion of the Blakelys\u2019 diminution-in-value claim as .an effective dismissal. <em>See Blakely, </em>633 F.3d at 949 (construing similar action by the district court as a \"dismissal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\">. In arguing to the contrary, the Blakelys refer to remarks made during an earlier pretrial hearing on March 31, 2008. <em>See </em>Aplt.'s Reply Br. at 27. There, they claim, the district court expressed a view that \"the \u2018measure\u2019 of the Blakelys\u2019 \u25a0 damage [was] the amount awarded in the property damage appraisal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our reading of the relevant aspect of the pretrial hearing transcript reveals some ambiguity in the district court\u2019s remarks regarding the legal effect of the appraisal award. <em>See </em>Aplts.\u2019 App., Vol. VII, 1360-61 (Tr. of Pretrial Hr\u2019g, dated Mar. 31, 2008). Nonetheless, even if we interpreted the court\u2019s comments in the 2008 pretrial hearing as the Blakelys do, we would recognize our focus should be on the rationale the court articulated in dismissing the diminution-of-value claim more than five years later. That is because district courts are not encouraged or obliged to adhere to prior interlocutory rulings \u2014 much less prior comments \u2014 if they conclude that those rulings (or comments) are erroneous and would result in reversal. <em>See, e.g., Major v. Benton, </em>647 F.2d 110, 112 (10th Cir. 1981) (\"When a lower court is convinced that an interlocutory ruling it has made is substantially erroneous, the only sensible thing to do is to set itself right to avoid subsequent reversal.\u201d); <em>see also Unioil v. Elledge (In re Unioil, Inc.), </em>962 F.2d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 1992) (\"Only final judgments may qualify as law of the case; where a ruling remains subject to reconsideration, the doctrine is inapplicable.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bettenhausen, </em>499 F.2d 1223, 1230 (10th Cir. 1974) (\u201cThe rule of the law of the case does not apply unless there is a final judgment that decided the issue.... The ruling in question here could have been reconsidered by the trial court and was not final.\u201d (citations omitted)). And the district court\u2019s rationale supporting its dismissal five years after the 2008 pretrial hearing do not evince any conflict with <em>Miller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b576-9\">BACHARACH, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ayy-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">I respectfully dissent. Unlike the majority, I believe that a reasonable fact-finder, guided by applicable Utah law, could find that as a result of the defendant\u2019s bad faith, the Blakelys suffered damages for</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">\u2022 emotional distress,</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">\u2022 lost income,</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">\u2022 appraisal expenses and attorney fees, and</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">\u2022 other attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">I also believe that the Blakelys could at least reasonably argue that the recoverable damages included the diminution in the value of their house. As a result, I would reverse the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">I. The Blakelys allegedly suffered damages from breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">Plaintiffs Mr. Alan Blakely and Mrs. Colelyn Blakely had a home insurance policy with Defendant USAA Casualty Insurance Company. In August 2002, a home fire caused significant damage to their home, leading the Blakelys to submit an insurance claim to USAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">The Blakelys were dissatisfied with USAA\u2019s response, believing that USAA had not paid enough for the fire damage, had refused to make necessary repairs, had avoided communication, and had im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>properly delegated tasks to non-adjusters. This dissatisfaction led the Blakelys to take matters into their own hands, making repairs at their own expense, suing the contractor responsible for the fire (Stone Touch), and invoking the insurance policy\u2019s option for an appraisal procedure. The appraisal procedure led to a determination that USAA had substantially underpaid the Blakelys. Complying with this determination, USAA paid more to the Blakelys; and the parties agree that USAA has now paid everything required under the express terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">But the Blakelys allege that USAA had acted improperly earlier, leading to this suit, which comes to us for the third time. <em>See Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>633 F.3d 944 (10th Cir. 2011); <em>Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>500 Fed.Appx. 734 (10th Cir. 2012). The only remaining claim is USAA\u2019s alleged breach of the insurance policy\u2019s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On this claim, the Blakelys assert five theories of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">1. injuries from emotional distress</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">2. loss of income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">3. expenses and attorney fees from the appraisal procedure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">4. other attorney fees and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">5. diminution in the value of their house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">At a pretrial conference, the district court dismissed the Blakelys\u2019 \u201cdiminution-in-value theory\u201d as legally frivolous. USAA then moved for summary judgment, asserting that the Blakelys could not legally recover damages on their four other theories. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment to USAA on these four theories. The majority affirms, but I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">II, Legal Background</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">In this diversity case, we apply Utah substantive law. <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In applying Utah law, we follow the opinions of Utah\u2019s Supreme Court. <em>Wade v. EMCASCO Ins. Co., </em>483 F.3d 657, 665-66 (10th Cir. 2007). If the Utah Supreme Court has not issued a controlling opinion, we predict what the court would do, drawing guidance from Utah\u2019s other courts, appellate opinions in other states with similar legal principles, federal district court opinions interpreting Utah law, and \u201c\u2018the general weight and trend of authority.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666 (quoting <em>MidAmerica Constr, Mgmt., Inc. v. Mas-Tec N. Am., Inc., </em>436 F.3d 1257, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">A. Utah\u2019s Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">All contracts in Utah contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Prince v. Bear River Mut. Ins. Co., </em>56 P.3d 524, 533 (Utah 2002). Under this covenant, the parties promise not to intentionally injure one another\u2019s right to the fruits of the contract. <em>Id. </em>To keep this promise, the parties must act consistently with the contract\u2019s common purpose and the parties\u2019 justified expectations. <em>Id. </em>In the insurance context, this means that the insurer must reasonably- investigate, evaluate, and resolve an insured\u2019s claim. <em>Jones v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>286 P.3d 301, 304 (Utah 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>B. Consequential Damages for Breaching the Implied Covenant</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">A party who breaches the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can incur liability for consequential damages. <em>Machan v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>116 P.3d 342, 345 (Utah 2005). These damages are not confined to the parties\u2019 express contractual obligations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">To recover such damages, the non-breaching party must prove that the particular damages were foreseeable when the parties contracted. <em>Mahmood v. Ross, </em>990 P.2d 933, 938 (Utah 1999). Foreseeability hinges on the nature and language of the contract and on the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations. <em>Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Because damages lie \u201c \u2018within the jury\u2019s province,\u2019\u201d the existence and amount of damages constitute questions of fact. <em>Lopez v. United Auto. Ins. Co., </em>274 P.3d 897, 905 (Utah 2012) (quoting <em>Judd v. Drezga, </em>103 P.3d 135, 144 (Utah 2004)). In any given case, however, the court must \u201cconform the jury\u2019s findings to applicable law.\u201d <em>Judd, </em>103 P.3d at 144. Put otherwise, the jury makes factual findings against the backdrop of Utah law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">This backdrop includes guidance from the Utah Supreme Court on the availability of damages for emotional distress. In an \u201c \u2018ordinary commercial contract,\u2019 \u201d emotional-distress damages are foreseeable only if the damages were both \u201ca foreseeable result of the breach of contract and <em>explicitly </em>within the contemplation of the parties.\u201d <em>Cabaness v. Thomas, </em>232 P.3d 486, 508 (Utah 2010) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Stewart v. Rudner, </em>349 Mich. 459, 84 N.W.2d 816, 823 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">In the insurance context, however, explicit contemplation is not required. Insurance is purchased not only for compensation of a loss, but also to \u201c \u2018provide peace of mind for the insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507 (quoting <em>Beck v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>701 P.2d 795, 802 (Utah 1985)). Such peace of mind is a fruit of the contract that \u201cthe insured has bargained for.\u201d <em>Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 345. Put otherwise, an insured\u2019s mental wellbeing is always on the minds of the contracting, parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">But not every type of an insured\u2019s mental distress is foreseeable. The Utah Supreme Court has held that emotional-distress damages are foreseeable only in \u201cunusual cases.\u201d <em>Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802. The court did not expressly define an \u201cunusual\u201d case, but indicated that an insurer could not foresee the need to compensate for the \u201cdisappointment, frustration, or anxiety\u201d that an insured \u201cnormally\u201d experiences in trying to obtain insurance proceeds from the insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 802 n.6; <em>see Cabaness, </em>232 P.3d at 507-08. It appears, then, that emotional-distress damages are \u201cunusual\u201d if these damages extend beyond the \u201cnormal! ]\u201d reactions of disappointment, frustration, or anxiety. <em>See Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 n.6; <em>see also Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 346 (suggesting that an insured could be compensated for the exacerbation of medical conditions caused by emotional stress (citing <em>Acquista v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., </em>285 A.D.2d 73, 730 N.Y.S.2d 272, 276 (2001))); <em>Billings v. Union Bankers Ins. Co., </em>918 P.2d 461, 467-68 (Utah 1996) (affirming an award of emotional-distress damages when the insured\u2019s lack of a complete recovery resulted in great mental distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">To summarize, for an insured to recover emotional-distress damages, the damages must be unusual and foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">III. Summary Judgment Rulings: Emotional Distress, Lost Income, Expenses and Attorney Fees for the Appraisal Procedure, and Other Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">We apply these legal principles in reviewing the summary-judgment rulings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>These rulings rejected the availability of damages for emotional distress, lost income, use of the appraisal procedure, and attorney fees unrelated to the approval procedure. I would reverse these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We engage in de novo review, viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the Blakelys. <em>Birch v. Polaris Indus., Inc., </em>812 F.3d 1238, 1251 (10th Cir. 2015). Summary judgment was proper only if</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u2022 there was no genuine dispute regarding a material fact and</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\u2022 USAA was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">B. The district court improperly concluded that the Blakelys are not entitled to consequential damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">The district court concluded that the Blakelys had failed to prove that their emotional distress was unusual or foreseeable. This conclusion was erroneous for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-12\">1. The Blakelys presented evidence of damages for emotional distress surpassing the mere \u201cdisappointment, frustration, or anxiety\u201d that commonly arises when seeking insurance proceeds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">2. When entering the insurance agreement, the parties could foresee emotional-distress damages arising from USAA\u2019s bad faith, as this agreement was meant to provide security and peace of mind by insuring the Blake-lys\u2019 most intimate space \u2014 their home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">First, Mr. and Mrs. Blakely\u2019s injuries are \u201cunusual\u201d and would be compensable under Utah law. For example, the Blakelys presented evidence of the development and exacerbation of medical conditions resulting from stress created by USAA\u2019s alleged bad faith. <em>See Machan, </em>116 P.3d at 346 (suggesting that an insured could be compensated for stress-induced exacerbation of medical conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">For example, Mr. Blakely presented evidence of high blood pressure caused by his interactions with USAA. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. II at 353; Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VII at 1318; Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VIII at 1614. Mrs. Blakely similarly presented evidence of depression, fibromyal-gia, and headaches from the' \u201ccontinued stress\u201d created by USAA\u2019s conduct. Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. I at 176; Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VI at 1138; <em>see also </em>Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. II at 353 (alleging that the conflict with USAA \u201cseriously progressed\u201d Mrs. Blakely\u2019s physical conditions). These injuries are not the result of typical \u201cdisappointment, frustration, or anxiety\u201d from dealing with an insurance company, and the district court erred in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">The Blakelys also presented evidence involving heightened distress when they had to leave their home for an extended period and return before the repairs were complete. This evidence indicated that the Blakelys needed to return too early, exposing them to the sight of fire damage and the smell of smoke, which created distress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that was beyond ordinary. Appellant\u2019s App\u2019x, vol. II at 353, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Second, the district court erred by concluding that the contracting parties could not have foreseen damages for emotional distress. The Utah Supreme Court has explained that insurance is purchased to \u201cprovide peace of mind.\u201d <em>Beck v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>701 P.2d 795, 802 (Utah 1985), And a breach of the implied covenant of good faith for a contract that is \u201cspecifically directed toward matters of mental concern and solicitude\u201d is likely to result in damages for emotional distress and mental anguish. <em>Cabaness v. Thomas, </em>232 P.3d 486, 508 (Utah 2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Not all damages are foreseeable when an insurer violates an insurance policy in bad faith. <em>See Beck, </em>701 P.2d at 802 (noting that in unusual cases, emotional-distress damages \u201cmight be provable\u201d). But this was not just any insurance policy; this was insurance that covered the insureds\u2019 home. <em>See Hargrave v. Leigh, </em>73 Utah 178, 273 P. 298, 301 (1928) (noting that the \u201cnatural consequence\u201d for being forced to leave one\u2019s home can include \u201cmental anguish and suffering\u201d). A fact-finder might reasonably find that USAA could foresee that its conduct would directly affect the Blake-lys\u2019 ability to enjoy the refuge and solace of their home, resulting in the sort of emotional distress that the Blakelys allegedly suffered. <em>See Orkin Exterminating Co. v. Donavan, </em>519 So.2d 1330, 1333 (Ala. 1988) (\u201cThe breach of a contract ... which affects the habitability of a house, can reasonably be foreseen to affect the solicitude and well-being of the occupants.\u201d); <em>see also </em>John A. Sebert, Jr., <em>Punitive and Nowpecuniary Damages in Actions Based Upon Contract: Toward Achieving the Objective of Full Compensation, </em>33 UCLA L. Rev. 1565, 1589 <em>&amp; </em>n.88 (1986) (explaining that courts permit damages for emotional distress in connection with contracts involving a person\u2019s home, while courts have disallowed damages for emotional distress in commercial contexts).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The Blakelys\u2019 policy specifically addressed their ability to live in their house. For example, USAA promised to insure any additional living expenses if the Blake-lys\u2019 house was \u201cnot fit to live in ... so that [the Blakelys could] maintain [their] normal standard of living.\u201d Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VI at 1233. And the policy specifically disclaimed coverage for the Blakelys\u2019 commercial activities conducted on the premises, providing further evidence that the insurance policy was specifically directed toward matters of mental concern and solicitude. <em>See id, </em>at 1216, 1228 (excluding insurance coverage for \u201cbusiness\u201d or \u201crental\u201d property and activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">For this reason, a material fact-question existed on whether USAA could have foreseen the availability of emotional-distress damages. The Blakelys presented evidence suggesting more than simple disappointment, frustration or anxiety; and the parties\u2019 focus on the intimate space of a home could have led USAA to foresee damages for emotional distress. Thus, the district court erred in granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ment to USAA on the claim for emotional-distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">C. The district court erred in granting summary judgment to USAA on the Blakelys\u2019 claims for consequential damages from (1) lost income, (2) expenses and attorney fees incurred in the appraisal procedure, and (3) attorney fees unrelated to the appraisal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The summary-judgment ruling also addressed three other forms of consequential damages: (1) lost income, (2) expenses and attorney fees from using the optional appraisal procedure, and (3) other attorney fees. For the first two \u2014 lost income and appraisal damages \u2014 the district court held that the damages were unavailable because they were unforeseeable. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">For the third form of damages \u2014 attorney fees unrelated to the appraisal \u2014 the district court divided the damages into two subcategories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">1. attorney fees from the Stone Touch litigation and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">2. attorney fees from the present litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">For the first subcategory, the district court held that attorney fees were not reasonably foreseeable. For the second subcategory, the court concluded that the Blakelys could not recover such fees given the absence of any other predicate damages. I believe that the district court erred with regard to both subcategories.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">1. The fact-finder might reasonably infer that USAA could foresee the need to compensate for lost income upon a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">The district court concluded that the Blakelys\u2019 home insurance policy did not cover lost income. According to the district court, the absence of express coverage for lost income prevented USAA from foreseeing this type of loss. But the district court mistook the nature of its inquiry. \u201c[Cjonse-quential damages that an insured might foreseeably incur due to an insurance company\u2019s breach of the implied covenant of good faith may encompass \u2018losses well in excess of the policy limits, such as for a home...\u201d <em>Machan v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>116 P.3d 342, 345-46 (Utah 2005) (quoting <em>Beck v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>701 P.2d 795, 802 (Utah 1985)). The Blake-lys allegedly suffered lost income because they had spent personal time repairing their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">The fact-finder might reasonably find that USAA could foresee the need to compensate for lost income upon a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And foreseeability is a question of fact, which generally cannot be decided on summary judgment. <em>See Rees v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>587 P.2d 130, 133 (Utah 1978) (stating that causation requires reasonable foreseeability, which involves a factual question \u201cgenerally for the fact-trier, court or jury, to determine\u201d). Thus, USAA was not entitled to summary judgment on the claim for lost income.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">2. Appraisal-related expenses and attorney fees could be recoverable upon a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">The district court also rejected the Blakelys\u2019 claims involving expenses and attorney fees from using the appraisal procedure, reasoning that the insurance policy defined who would pay. But the Blakelys presented evidence showing that they had resorted to the appraisal procedure only because USAA had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>This evidence suggests that the Blakelys would not have needed to use the appraisal procedure if USAA had acted in good faith. The appraisal procedure was only an option, not a requirement, in the event of a dispute. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VI at 1226 (\u201c[E]ither party <em>can </em>demand ... appraisal .... \u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>at 1235 (noting that' USAA will pay for losses if the parties either reach an agreement, go through appraisal, or receive \u201centry of a final judgment\u201d). A fact-finder could reasonably find that the policy had been designed to allocate expenses for reasonable disputes, not disputes created by USAA\u2019s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. <em>See Beck v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>701 P.2d 795, 801 (Utah 1985) (\u201cWhen an insurer has breached [the implied] duty [of good faith], it is liable for damages suffered in consequence of that breach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Nonetheless, USAA argues that the Blakelys waited too long to invoke the appraisal procedure. Appellee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 22. The majority similarly states that the Blakelys \u201coffer no explanation for their three-year delay in invoking the appraisal procedure\u201d and characterizes the appraisal damages as \u201cdelay-related distress.\u201d Maj. Op. at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">But the appraisal procedure was optional, and the fact-finder could reasonably find that the Blakelys had a good reason for delaying appraisal. As we said in a prior appeal, the Blakelys waited because \u201cthey had been trying to pursue their claims against [Stone Touch].\u201d <em>Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>500 Fed.Appx. 734, 737 (10th Cir. 2012). And the Blakelys presented evidence indicating that they had to sue Stone Touch only because USAA had allegedly acted in bad faith. In these circumstances, the fact-finder could justifiably find that the Blakelys had acted reasonably in the face of USAA\u2019s resistance, pursuing the tortfeasor that caused the fire and then resorting to the appraisal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In my view, a genuine, material factual dispute exists on the recoverability of the Blakelys\u2019 expenses and attorney fees incurred in the appraisal procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">3. The parties\u2019 agreement may have contemplated other attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">The Blakelys also claimed attorney fees from the Stone Touch litigation and from the present litigation. The district court rejected these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">For attorney fees from the Stone Touch litigation, the district court reasoned that attorney fees were not foreseeable given the policy\u2019s discussion of the appraisal procedure. But as discussed above, the appraisal procedure was optional. <em>See </em>Part 111(C)(2). A fact-finder could reasonably find that USAA had foreseen that the Blakelys would sue a responsible third party and incur attorney fees as a result of USAA\u2019s bad faith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>For attorney fees from the present litigation, the district court did not discuss foreseeability. Instead, the district court determined that such attorney fees could be awarded only if there was another predicate damage award. Having disposed of all of the Blakelys\u2019 other theories on damages, the district court denied these attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In my view, however,.the Blakelys may be able to recover other damages. Thus, I would reject the district court\u2019s rationale for denying attorney fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, I believe that a jury could find that such attorney fees were foreseeable. Thus, I would reverse the award of summary judgment on the Blakelys\u2019 claim for attorney fees incurred in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">IV. Ruling on Frivolousness: Damages for Diminution in the Value of the Blakelys\u2019 House</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">At a pretrial conference, the district court dismissed as legally frivolous the Blakelys\u2019 claim involving damages from diminution in the value of their house. Appellants\u2019 App\u2019x, vol. VIII at 1575-76; <em>see also Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>633 F.3d 944, 949 (10th Cir. 2011) (noting that a district court may dismiss frivolous claims at a pretrial conference under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(c)(2)(A)). In my view, the ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In considering this ruling, we apply the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Blakely, </em>633 F.3d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">We previously found an abuse of discretion when the district court dismissed the implied-covenant claim. <em>Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>633 F.3d 944, 949-50 (10th Cir. 2011). There we stated the standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201c[A] complaint ... is frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (describing frivolous claims as \u201cfanciful,\u201d \u201cfantastic,\u201d and \u201cdelusional,\u201d and holding \u201ca finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-12\"><em>Id. </em>Applying this standard, our court concluded that the Blakelys\u2019 claim was not \u201cwholly incredible\u201d and was not frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 950. In my view, these conclusions are equally fitting here.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">The district court considered the diminution-in-value claim as frivolous because USAA had fulfilled its express contractual obligations, which included paying for home repairs. Appellants\u2019 \u2022 App\u2019x, vol. VIII at 1575-76. The Blakelys agreed that USAA had paid for such repairs, but claimed that USAA\u2019s bad faith had required use of the insurance proceeds for appraisal and litigation expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 1576. The district court regarded the claim as frivolous because the Blakelys had not repaired their home even though they had been paid for these repairs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">On appeal, the Blakelys reassert then-position with some embellishment. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 46-50. In response, USAA reasserts the district court\u2019s reasoning. Appellee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 32-33 (\u201cDespite receiving money to restore the home to its original condition, the Blakelys did not repair that home.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>We need not opine on whether the Blakelys\u2019 claim is persuasive, for it is at least arguable. Because of USAA\u2019s alleged bad faith, the Blakelys had to spend substantial funds for the appraisal and litigation. To spend those funds, the Blakelys had to dip into coffers that could otherwise have been used.for home repairs. Thus, the Blakelys can reasonably argue that USAA\u2019s breach of the implied covenant caused the house to diminish in value notwithstanding USAA\u2019s eventual payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Neither USAA nor the district court has directly addressed the Blakelys\u2019 theory or identified any pertinent case law. Indeed, the issue appears to be one of first impression for <em>any </em>state. In light of the absence of pertinent guidance from USAA or any case law, I would regard the Blakelys\u2019 theory as at least arguable. <em>See Suazo v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., </em>822 F.3d 543, 556 (11th Cir. 2016) (\u201cWhere an appeal requires a court to decide an issue of first impression in a circuit court, it is not frivolous.\u201d). As a result, I would reverse the 1 dismissal of this claim based on frivolousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In my view, we should reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The district court erroneously concluded that the Blakelys were foreclosed from claiming consequential damages for emotional distress, and the district court made factual findings that should have been left for the jury to decide. The district court also erroneously dismissed the Blakelys\u2019 claim for damages from their home\u2019s diminution in value. Because the majority upholds these rulings, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">. The Blakelys also appear to assert a sixth theory: physical damages from the exacerbation of their preexisting medical conditions. As the majority explains, however, the Blake-lys never presented this theory in district court as a stand-alone claim. Maj. Op, at 534-35. Therefore, I consider such damages as encompassed within the Blakelys\u2019 emotional-distress damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-14\">. In the alternative, USAA contends that the Blakelys lack evidence of exacerbation of their medical conditions. Appellee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 19-22. The Blakelys maintain otherwise and point out that this contention was not argued as a ground for summary judgment. Appellants' Reply Br. at 12. Assuming that USAA properly raised this contention, I would conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could infer exacerbation of medical conditions from USAA\u2019s handling of the claim. <em>See id. </em>at 13-15 (providing citations to the summary-judgment record).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">. The district court characterized <em>Cabaness </em>as a clarification or modification of <em>Beck, </em>creating a requirement for explicit contemplation of emotional-distress damages at the time of the contract. <em>See Blakely v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>No. 06-CV-00506, 2015 WL 1522752, at *9 (D. Utah Apr. 2, 2015) (stating that <em>Cabaness </em>\"clarified, or at least modified\u201d <em>Beck, </em>and holding that emotional-distress damages were not foreseeable in part because \"there is no evidence that emotional damages ... were contemplated explicitly, by the parties\u201d). But, <em>Cabaness </em>discussed explicit contemplation in the context of an \"ordinary commercial contract,\u201d as opposed to insurance contracts, which always contemplate an insured's peace of mind. <em>See </em>Part 11(B), above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">. USAA also asserts that it acted in good faith because it \"did not deny the appraisal request.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Resp. Br, at 23. But USAA\u2019s participation in the appraisal does not prevent a finding of bad faith for earlier conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">. In the alternative, USAA argues that (1) a subrogation agreement precludes such fees and (2) USAA already paid such fees. Appel-lee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 25-26. The Blakelys maintain otherwise and contend that USAA did not raise these arguments in the motion for summary judgment. Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. at 21-22. I agree that USAA did not raise these arguments in its summary-judgment motion; therefore I would not consider these arguments. See <em>Burnette v. Dresser Indus., Inc., </em>849 F.2d 1277, 1285 (10th Cir. 1988) (\"We will not address the first theory because [the defendant] did not raise it in its motion for summary judgment....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">. As a result, I have not addressed the Blake-lys\u2019 contention that attorney fees for this litigation should be available even if the compensatory award were limited to nominal damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-16\">. In the alternative, USAA asserts that the policy did \"not provide for any diminution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>value.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 32. But damages for breaching the covenant of good faith and faith dealing are not confined to the parties' express contractual obligations. <em>Machan v. UNUM Life Ins.
