Lucero, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Bristow Endeavor Healthcare, LLC, (\u201cBristow\u201d) appeals a district court order granting motions to dismiss filed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (\u201cBCBSA\u201d) and Health Care Service Corporation (\u201cHCSC\u201d). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Bristow is a healthcare company that operates three facilities in northeast Oklahoma: Bristow Medical Center (\u201cBMC\u201d), Cimarron Healthcare Center (\u201cCimar-ron\u201d), and the Center for Orthopaedic Reconstruction and Excellence (\u201cCORE\u201d). BCBSA is a federation of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, including HCSC, which does business as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma. Bris-tow alleges that HCSC exercises market dominance in. the northeast Oklahoma market, with at least 64% of the market for health insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">BMC is an in-network provider with HCSC. In-network providers receive contractually set payments for healthcare services offered to individuals with HCSC plans. In 2013, Bristow requested that Ci-marron be added to the existing in-network provider agreement with BMC. Following negotiations, the parties agreed to add Cimarron and adopt a blended rate for reimbursement payments to both facilities. In March 2014, Bristow and HCSC executed a BlueTraditional Network Participating Hospital Agreement (the \u201cProvider Agreement\u201d), which applied to. both BMC and Cimarron. Bristow states that it had an \u201cimplicit understanding\u201d that the Provider Agreement would also include all future Bristow entities. However, the Provider Agreement specifically states that additional entities may be added only with the consent of HCSC.</p>\n<p id=\"AlP\">In March 2015, Bristow requested that HCSC add Bristow\u2019s new facility, CORE, to the Provider Agreement. HCSC sent Bristow a credentialing application for CORE. After requesting additional information, HCSC informed Bristow that it would not agree to add CORE to the Provider Agreement, but it offered to enter into a separate agreement with the facility. The parties continued discussions through December 2015 but did not reach an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Bristow alleges that HCSC refused to grant CORE in-network status as a result of a conspiracy to restrain trade with Hill-crest Healthcare System (\u201cHillcrest\u201d) and Ardent Health Services (\u201cArdent\u201d). Hill-crest operates several healthcare facilities in northeast Oklahoma and is Bristow\u2019s largest competitor. Ardent owns Hillcrest. Bristow alleges that Hillcrest and its affiliated companies exercise mark\u00e9t dominance in the northeast Oklahoma market. But Bristow merely characterizes Hill-crest\u2019s market share as \u201chigh\u201d without any particular factual allegations. Bristow also alleges that HCSC reimburses Hillcrest at higher rates than those offered to BMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and Cimarron. It claims that the purpose of the conspiracy is to prevent CORE from fully competing with Hillcrest in the northeast Oklahoma healthcare market, thereby allowing Hillcrest to maintain and expand its market share in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In support of its conspiracy claim, Bris-tow alleges that representatives of Tulsa Spine &amp; Specialty. Hospital (\u201cTulsa Spine\u201d), a Hillcrest facility, met with representatives of Hillcrest and Ardent on a weekly basis between 2011 and 2015 to \u201cdiscuss affairs, including CORE.\u201d In the summer of 2014, Tulsa Spine hired a private investigator to look into individuals involved in the start-up of CORE. Bristow further alleges, on information and belief, that HCSC participated in some of these meetings and related phone calls, during which it discussed ways to prevent CORE from becoming an in-network provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Bristow provides two particular allegations in support of its claim of conspiracy. First, it alleges, on information and belief, that a \u201crepresentative of Blue Cross Blue Shield\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> told a Bristow representative CORE was being denied a contract for \u201cCORE\u2019S own protection\" and that \u201cif Hill-crest tried to open a facility in Bristow, we [Blue Cross Blue Shield] would \u2018protect you [Bristow].\u201d\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Bristow claims that sometime between December 2014 and January 2015, Eddie Gwock, an Ardent representative, told Tulsa Spine that \u201che could leverage his relationship with Blue Cross Blue Shield to keep CORE out of the network.\u201d Gwock \u201calso reported that he spoke with Blue Cross Blue Shield, and in connection with the \u2018strategic initiative\u2019 between Blue Cross Blue Shield, [Ardent, and Hillcrest], Blue Cross Blue Shield would be able to keep CORE out of network.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Bristow filed suit against HCSC, BCBSA, Ardent, Hillcrest, and related entities advancing four claims: (1) violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C \u00a7 1; (2) state law conspiracy in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 79, \u00a7 203(A); (3) attempt to monopolize in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 79, \u00a7 203(B); and (4) tortious interference with business relations. The district court granted motions to dismiss filed by HCSC and BCBSA. Bristow then voluntarily dismissed its claims against the remaining defendants with prejudice and filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">We review a Fed. R. Civ. P, 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo, accepting as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible if the plaintiff has pled \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. A complaint that \u201ctenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d is insufficient. Id. (quotations and alteration omitted). Further, if a complaint alleges \u201cfacts that are merely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability, it stops short of the line between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d Id. (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal to engage in a \u201cconspiracy[ j in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. The Act \u201cdoes not prohibit [all] unreasonable restraints of trade ... but only restraints effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy.\u201d Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 775, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984). The \u201ccrucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quotations and alteration omitted). To prevail on a \u00a7 1 claim, a plaintiff \u201cmust include evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.\u201d Id. at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. A \u201cnaked assertion of conspiracy in a \u00a7 1 complaint ... gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.\u201d Id. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">When a defendant asserts complex claims against multiple defendants, it is \u201cparticularly important\u201d to \u201cmake clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations.\u201d Kan. Penn Gaming, LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1215 (10th Cir. 2011) (emphases omitted). \u201cThe Twombly Court was particularly critical of complaints that mentioned no specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies.\u201d Robbins v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., 519 F.3d 1242, 1248 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Although it is a reasonably close question, we agree with the district court that the complaint does not plausibly allege a conspiracy with respect to HCSC and BCBSA. An inference of conspiracy is impermissible if the defendants \u201chad no rational economic motive to conspire, and if their conduct is consistent, with other, equally plausible explanations.\u201d Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 596, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). As the district court explained, Hillcrest and Ardent may have been motivated to undermine Bristow as a direct competitor, but HCSC \u2014 a purchaser of healthcare services \u2014 would be acting directly against its own interest if it agreed to reduce competition in the healthcare provider market, particularly in light of Bristow\u2019s allegation that HCSC pays Hill-crest higher reimbursement rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The complaint does not advance any reason HCSC would agree to act against its self-interest and it does not identify any benefit that HCSC obtained from Hillcrest or Ardent as part of the alleged conspiracy. A complaint is insufficient if the alleged \u201cbehavior was as likely to have been the result of legal, unilateral action as the product of illicit collusion.\u201d Kan. Penn Gaming, 656 F.3d at 1214; see also Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984) (noting that a company \u201cgenerally has a right to deal, or refuse to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently\u201d). On appeal, Bristow suggests that HCSC acted at the behest of Hillcrest because it needed to maintain Hillcrest\u2019s business. But the complaint does not contain any particularized allegations permitting an inference that Hillcrest possessed market power such that it could compel HCSC to act against its own interest. See Buccaneer Energy (USA) Inc. v. Gunnison Energy Corp., 846 F.3d 1297, 1312 (10th Cir. 2017)'(a plaintiff can show market power by \u201cpointing to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>dant\u2019s share of the relevant market and perhaps barriers to entry\u201d (quotation and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Bristow relies heavily on the statements attributed to Gwock. Although those statements make a conspiracy possible, we agree with the district court that they are insufficient. Gwock claimed that he could leverage his; relationship with HCSC to keep CORE out of network, and he later reported that CORE would indeed not join the HCSC network. But there are ncj allegations detailing who Gwock dealt with at HCSC, what was agreed to, or why HCSC agreed to harm itself. In light of HCSC\u2019s rational economic motives not to engage in this type of agreement, we think such particularity is necessary. See Matsushita Elec. Indus., 475 U.S. at 596-97, 106 S.Ct. 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In addition to Gwock\u2019s statement, Bris-tow highlights the comments of an unidentified representative of either HCSC or BCBSA, who stated that CORE was denied in-network status for its \u201cown protection\u201d and indicated that Bristow would similarly be protected if Hillcrest attempted to open a facility in areas where Bristow operates. Assuming that these statements evince a preference by HCSC to limit its network by geographical sub-regions, it does not suggest coordination between HCSC and Hillcrest. To the contrary, the unidentified representative apparently offered to \u201cprotect\u201d Bristow unilaterally, without any proposed agreement with Bristow. If HCSC was willing to take unilateral action to \u201cprotect\u201d Bris-tow, it may well have done so with respect to Hillcrest. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (a plaintiff \u201cmust include evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action\u201d). Absent plausible allegations that HCSC or BCBSA conspired to restrain trade, Bris-tow\u2019s \u00a7 1 Sherman Act and state law conspiracy claims were properly dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Under Oklahoma law, \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 79, \u00a7 203(B). Bristow asserts a claim for attempted monopolization, which requires proof of: \u201c(1) relevant market (including geographic market and relevant product market); (2) dangerous probability of success in monopolizing the relevant market; (3) specific intent to monopolize; and (4) conduct in furtherance of such an attempt.\u201d TV Commc\u2019ns Network, Inc. v. Turner Network Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1025 (10th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">In its complaint, Bristow alleges that Hillcrest and Ardent, with the assistance of HCSC and BCBSA \u201care attempting to monopolize or conspiring to monopolize the market for inpatient and outpatient healthcare services in the Northeast Oklahoma/Tulsa area.\u201d Bristow cites to the allegation that HCSC has a 64% share of the health insurance market in northeast Oklahoma, but the complaint does not allege attempted monopolization of the health insurance market. Instead, it alleges attempted monopolization of the market to deliver healthcare services to patients. And although the complaint summarily asserts that Hillcrest \u201cexercis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>es market dominance,\u201d it does not contain any well-pled allegations to support that assertion. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (holding \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d are insufficient (quotations and alteration omitted)). Accordingly the complaint fails to plausibly allege a dangerous probability that the healthcare market in northeast Oklahoma would be monopolized.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Bristow also suggests that HCSC, as a purchaser of healthcare services, may be exercising monopsony buying power. But we agree with'the district court that this monopsony theory was not fairly pled in the complaint. See Maldonado v. City of Altus, 433 F.3d 1294, 1314 (10th Cir. 2006) (declining to consider a theory that did not appear in the complaint), overruled on other grounds as recognized by Metzler v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of Topeka, 464 F.3d 1164, 1171 n.2 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Lastly, Bristow appeals the dismissal of its claim for tortious interference with a business relation. To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must show: \u201c1) interference with a business or contractual right; 2) malicious and wrongful interference that is neither justified, privileged, nor excusable; and 3) damage proximately sustained as a result of the interference.\u201d Tuffy\u2019s, Inc. v. City of Okla. City, 212 P.3d 1158, 1165 (Okla. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The complaint alleges that Bristow, BMC, Cimarron, and CORE \u201call had business and contractual rights,\u201d and that through tortious conduct \u201cdescribed at length therein, the Defendants have interfered with said business and contractual rights.\u201d We agree with the district court that this claim presents nothing more than \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,\u201d which the Court rejected in Iqbal. 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. It does not identify what contracts or relationships HCSC or BCBSA might have harmed, and accordingly does not provide those parties with sufficient notice to defend against this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. In the complaint, Bristow uses \"Blue Cross Blue Shield\u201d to refer collectively to HCSC and BCBSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-12\">. BMC is located in Bristow, Oklahoma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. The district court concluded Bristow's state law conspiracy claim failed for the same reasons as its Sherman Act claim. Bristow does not contest that conclusion on appeal. See Green Country Food Mkt., Inc. v. Bottling Grp., LLC, 371 F.3d 1275, 1281 (10th Cir. 2004) (\"The Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act is construed in accordance with federal antitrust law.\u201d); see also Okla. Stat. tit. 79, \u00a7 212 (\"The provisions of this act shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Federal Antitrust Law 15 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
