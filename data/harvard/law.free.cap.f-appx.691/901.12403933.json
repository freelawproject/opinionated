But while this appeal was pending, the district court vacated Mr. Washington\u2019s sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, rendering this appeal moot. <em>See United States v. Moore, 83 F.3d </em>1231, 1235 (10th Cir. 1996) (when a sentence is vacated under \u00a7 2255, \u201cthe original sentence ... is eviscerated\u201d). We therefore grant Mr. Washington\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">We grant Mr. Washington\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees. The relevant statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1916(a)(1), does not permit litigants to avoid payment of filing and docketing fees, only <em>prepayment </em>of those fees. Although we have dismissed this appeal, Mr. Washington remains obligated to pay all filing and docketing fees. He is directed to pay the fees in full to the clerk of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
