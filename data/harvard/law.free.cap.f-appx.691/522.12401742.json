Bacharach Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">This appeal involves the denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The threshold issue is whether the defendant has justified a certificate of appealability. We answer \u201cno\u201d and decline to issue a certificate of appealability. This decision requires us to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The defendant, Mr. Fernando Delgado-Ornelas, wants to appeal a conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Delgado was charged in federal court with illegal reentry after removal based on a conviction for an aggravated felony. After conferring with counsel, Mr. Delgado pleaded guilty. The district court accepted the plea and imposed a prison term of 37 months. According to Mr. Delgado, his attorney provided ineffective assistance by promising a lower sentence. The district court rejected this claim, reasoning that the plea colloquy belied the alleged promise and that the alleged ineffectiveness would not have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">To appeal this ruling, Mr. Delgado-Ornelas needs a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Such a certificate may issue only if Mr. Delgado-Ornelas has made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Where, as here, the district court has dismissed a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim on the merits, the petitioner must show that the district court\u2019s conclusion was subject to reasonable debate. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">In our view, the district court\u2019s reasoning is not subject to reasonable debate. As a result, we decline to issue a certificate of appealability. And in the absence of a certificate of appealability, we must dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
