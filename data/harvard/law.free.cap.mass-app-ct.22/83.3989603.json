Construing the plaintiff\u2019s request as one for an order directing the inspector to act on the application, the board refused to issue any such directive. The reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>given by the board was that the plaintiff could obtain a permit only if it were exempt from zoning on the ground that it intended to use the radio station for religious or educational purposes. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, because the plaintiff\u2019s articles of organization (filed under G. L. c. 180) did not authorize it to advance religious purposes and because a \u201cradio station is not educational in the sense that it should be exempt\u201d from zoning regulation, it was unnecessary to order the inspector to act. On the plaintiff\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, the judge concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to the exemption. He annulled the board\u2019s decision and remanded the matter, ordering the board to direct the inspector to act on the plaintiff\u2019s application. We conclude that whether the plaintiff is exempt under \u00a7 3 is still an open question which must be decided, in the first instance, by the inspector. We amend the judgment to reflect our conclusion, and as amended, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">1. <em>Alleged jurisdictional defect. </em>In arguing for a reversal of the judgment, the board challenges the court\u2019s jurisdiction under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, by attacking its own jurisdiction to hear and decide the plaintiff\u2019s appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 8, and \u00a7 VII (B) (1) of the Spencer zoning by-law. We need not set out the board\u2019s argument in any detail. It is sufficient to state that it is based upon the fact that the inspector, by his failure to act, failed to file a decision with the town clerk, a condition precedent, alleges the board, to any appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Two recent cases dealing with jurisdictional issues arising out of an inspector\u2019s failure to act on enforcement requests are sufficiently analogous to control and dispose of the board\u2019s contention. In <em>Vokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 471,479 n. 11 (1984), the court specifically left for \u201canother occasion analysis of the concern that a slothful building inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tor could prevent complaining parties from exercising their rights by doing nothing upon receipt of an enforcement request and whether, if the inspector refuses to act, the parties seeking enforcement may have an alternative to the time and expense which might accompany resort to a complaint in the nature of mandamus.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 399, 402-403 (1985), the court concluded that under <em>Vokes, </em>an inspector\u2019s failure to make a written response to an enforcement request, either \u201cvoluntarily or by compulsion,\u201d did create a defect which could be raised in ensuing proceedings. However, the court went on to hold: \u201cThe defect, although it may be spoken of as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 appears not to be of such significance that a court must take notice of it even if the opposing party fails to press it, cf. Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3), 365 Mass. 757 (1974) (subject matter defect); rather, like a defect of \u2018personal\u2019 jurisdiction, it may be overlooked if not <em>timely </em>objected to, cf. Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(i), 365 Mass. 757 (1974)\u201d (emphasis supplied). Here the board raised the defect, but not until after the plaintiff had appealed under G. L. c. 40 A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Reading <em>Yokes </em>and <em>Hogan </em>together, we conclude that the board\u2019s assertion of want of jurisdiction for it to have entertained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was not timely asserted in the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff sought a permit from the board on the specific ground that the inspector had failed to act. Knowing full well that only the inspector could issue (or deny the issuance of) the permit and that the inspector had failed to act, the board could have declined to act and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>forced the plaintiff then to seek whatever alternative remedies it might have. See <em>Vokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 479 n.ll. However, the board deliberately construed the plaintiff\u2019s request as one simply seeking an order to the inspector to act. Rather than issuing the order, the board chose to do more. It reached the merits of the application, decided that the permit could not be granted as matter of law, and advised the plaintiff of its right of appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Now the board asks that the plaintiff be put to further expense and delay and be required to press its request anew in order to cure a jurisdictional flaw of no major significance. Had the board, on the basis of the jurisdictional ground presently asserted, refrained from hearing the matter and deciding it on the merits, we might well have been put to the task of deciding the question left open in <em>Vokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. at 479 n.ll. We conclude, however, that the judge correctly rejected the board\u2019s argument, as its actions constituted a waiver of the claimed jurisdictional defect. See <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">2. <em>The plaintiffs intended use. </em>In annulling the board\u2019s decision, the judge concluded that the plaintiff is a nonprofit educational corporation and that the purpose of the radio station is \u201cboth religious and educational in nature.\u201d The board does not dispute that the plaintiff is a nonprofit corporation, and there is record support for that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">What the board contends first is that the plaintiff has no right to further any religious purposes, as its articles of organization provide that the radio station is to be operated \u201cexclusively for charitable, scientific, and educational purposes.\u201d The board claims that the plaintiff cannot advance any religious purposes without first amending its articles of organization. The argument lacks persuasive force. Cf. <em>Congregational Church of Chicopee Falls </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>376 Mass. 545, 549 (1978) (\u201c[T]o hold that \u2018charitable\u2019 is not thus distinct from \u2018religious\u2019 and encompasses or engrosses \u2018religious,\u2019 appeals to common sense and conforms to ordinary speech. The point is strengthened by our remarks in <em>Matter of Troy, </em>364 Mass. 15, 57-58 [1973] [an educational purpose, for example, has been considered charitable]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Although the plaintiff is not an educational institution in the traditional sense of that phrase, that is, a school, we do not agree with the board\u2019s second contention that the plaintiff cannot, therefore, qualify for the G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, zoning regulation exemption. By the plain language of that part of the statute relied upon by the plaintiff, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>all that is required is that the plaintiff be a nonprofit corporation intending to use its land or structures for religious or educational purposes. It may be that the formal trappings of religious and educational institutions assist in the determination that the intended use is for the appropriate limited purposes, but, as we read \u00a7 3, the exemption is not restricted to religious sects and educational institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">To determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s intended use is for religious or educational purposes and, hence, within the protective ambit of \u00a7 3, focus must be placed on the use of the structure rather than on the structure itself. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>327 Mass. 601, 603-604 (1951); <em>Whitinsville Retirement Soc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbridge, </em>394 Mass. 757, 760 (1985); <em>Commission of Code Inspection of Worcester </em>v. <em>Worcester Dynamy, Inc., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 97, 100 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think this especially pertinent in view of constant advances in the communications industry and their relationship to the furtherance of educational goals. Hence, the judge was correct in rejecting the board\u2019s premise that a radio station can never be educational within the meaning of \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s intended use of its proposed radio station is provided in its licensing application filed with the Federal Communications Commission (commission).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to that application is a document labelled \u201cStatement of Educational Purpose\u201d which reads in full: \u201cThe station proposed will serve an educational purpose by presenting high quality programs designed to be educational, cultural, and informative in nature. The station will carry information pertaining to local events including local news, public affairs, and other programs of topical local interest. To the extent that the proposed station presents programs of a religious nature, those programs will be designed to enhance and improve the lives of our listeners. All religious denominations in the service area will be given an opportunity to present programming on the proposed facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">From the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cProposed Program Schedule,\u201d also filed with its application before the commission, we learn that of the daily eighteen hours of airtime, approximately four hours will be for designated religious programs described only as \u201cMorning Devotion,\u201d \u201cMorning Service,\u201d \u201cInspirational Programs,\u201d \u201cEvening Service,\u201d and \u201cEvening Inspiration.\u201d Remaining hours are assigned to categories such as news, weather, sports, classical music, and community events.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">There is evidence to show that the commission issued the plaintiff a license to operate its radio station in a \u201crange of frequencies known as the \u201c\u2018Educational Band.\u2019\u201d It does not follow from this fact, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s use of the radio station is for religious or educational purposes within the meaning of \u00a7 3. There are very distinct differences between the purposes of zoning regulation (\u201cto stabilize the use of property and to protect an area from deleterious uses,\u201d <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>354 Mass. 278, 280 [1968]) and radio communication licensing (\u201cto maintain the control of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>over all the channels of radio transmission; and to provide for the use of such channels . . . 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 [1982].</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Although the plaintiff apparently satisfied the commission\u2019s licensing requirements, see 47 Code Fed. Regs. \u00a7 73.503 (1985), there is nothing in those regulations which requires an applicant to make any demonstration of a furtherance of a \u201cgoal that reasonably could be described as educationally significant,\u201d <em>Whitinsville Retirement Soc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbridge, </em>394 Mass, at 761 n.3, such as is necessary under \u00a7 3. However broad the phrase \u201creligious or educational purposes\u201d may seem, see, e.g., <em>Mount Hermon Boys\u2019 School </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>145 Mass. 139, 146 (1887), in the context of zoning those words \u201cshould be interpreted \u2018according to the common and approved usages of the language . . . without enlargement or restriction and without regard to . . . [the court\u2019s] own conceptions of expediency. \u2019 \u201d <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Milton, </em>312 Mass. 195, 198 (1942), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>S.S. Kresge Co., </em>267 Mass. 145, 148 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Our holding is a narrow one. We do not conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s intended use can never be exempt from regulation under \u00a7 3 or that its presently intended use may not in fact be for religious or educational purposes. If the plaintiff claims the exemption, much more information will be needed, such as greater descriptions of the information to be conveyed, by whom it will be conveyed, and what religious or educational goals will be furthered thereby. See, e.g., <em>Whitinsville Retirement Soc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbridge, </em>394 Mass, at 761 &amp; n.3, and cases discussed therein. For all that appears in the record before us, the plaintiff\u2019s intended use of the radio station is to provide a listening audience with programs which the plaintiff perceives to be of greater intellectual and inspirational value than those currently available. Although that purpose is laudable, it is neither religious nor educational within the plain meaning of \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">3. <em>The judgment. </em>No error appears on the face of the judgment. By its terms, the building inspector will be directed by the board to act on the plaintiff\u2019s application. From the decision which accompanied the judgment, however, the board and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>inspector reasonably (but erroneously) could infer that the only question to be decided in acting upon that application is what reasonable conditions, as set out in \u00a7 3, at note 1, <em>supra, </em>can be imposed upon the plaintiff in constructing a radio tower and ground broadcasting system. We have concluded, however, that whether the plaintiff\u2019s intended use is for religious or educational purposes is still an open question under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Accordingly, the final paragraph of the judgment is amended to provide that the matter is remanded to the board of appeals with the direction that it enter a decision instructing the building inspector to determine whether the plaintiff is exempt from zoning regulation and, if so, what reasonable regulations are to be imposed upon the plaintiff in the construction of its radio tower and ground broadcasting system. As amended, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo zoning . . . by-law shall. . . regulate or restrict the use of land or structures for religious purposes or for educational purposes on land owned or leased ... by a nonprofit educational corporation; provided, however, that such land or structures may be subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and determining yard sizes, lot area, setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage requirements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The board contends that when a person is aggrieved by an inspector\u2019s refusal or failure to act on an application for a building permit, the administrative remedy is an appeal to the State Building Code Appeals Board pursuant to 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 126.1 (1980). If there are certain situations in which this argument may have force, the instant case does not represent one of them. We see no applicability of the State Building Code to the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s intended use of its proposed radio station is for religious or educational purposes, as compared to issues involving the proposed structure itself, such as \u201cstructural strength, adequate egress facilities, sanitary conditions, equipment, light and ventilation and fire safety.\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 100.4 (1980). See also <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>354 Mass. 278, 280-281 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> The board cites <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>32 Pa. D.&amp;C.2d 669, 673 (1963), as authority for the proposition that a radio station is not within the common understanding of church or religious use. The reliance is misguided. That decision is based on the peculiarities of the zoning code there controlling and providing, in pertinent part: \u2018\u201c[Cjhurches, chapels, convents, monasteries, and their adjunct residential dwellings or other places of worship\u2019 are permitted uses . . .and. . .\u2018accessory uses . . . customarily incident to any of the . . . permitted uses\u2019 are permissible.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s licensing application was specifically relied upon by the judge in reaching his conclusion that the intended use \u201cis both religious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>educational in nature.\u201d The board, however, did not include the application in the record appendix, and the plaintiff argues that the board is precluded on its appeal from contesting the judge\u2019s conclusions. By reason of Mass.R.A.P. 18(a), as amended, 392 Mass. 1106 (1984), we are not bound by the board\u2019s failure to have included the application in the appendix. Because the board\u2019s failure does not reflect a total disregard for our procedural rules, we look to the application. Contrast <em>Kunen </em>v. <em>First Agricultural Natl. Bank, </em>6 Mass.
