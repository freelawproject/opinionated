For the reasons stated below, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The victim gave the following account of the events of January 1, 1980. About 4:00 p.m. the defendant, a man known to the victim,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> accompanied by three male companions, forced his way into her apartment. By pushing the door, the defendant \u201cslammed\u201d her against a wall. After entering, the defendant slapped her repeatedly on the face, held her by the hair, and banged her head against a wall. He then grabbed her by her jersey and threw her on the floor. She landed on her back, her head hitting the floor \u201creal hard.\u201d The defendant was standing over her. He picked her up by the neck of her jersey, forced her into the bedroom and hurled her on the bed. Still slapping her, he told her he wanted her \u201cto take care of his friends.\u201d He demanded that she take off her clothes; when she refused, he tore them off.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>One of the defendant\u2019s companions came into the bedroom, undressed himself, forced his penis into her mouth and thereafter had anal and vaginal intercourse with her. After the first companion left, the second followed, and had anal and vaginal intercourse with her. A few minutes later, the third man entered and took off his clothes. While he was in the room, the defendant came in, told the victim not to give the third man a hard time and hit her again. The third man had vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse with her. As soon as the men had left, the victim called the police. She was taken to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital where she arrived about 5:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">At the hospital the victim was first seen by a nurse. The victim was so distraught that it took an hour and fifteen mintues to obtain her history. The nurse described her clothing as ripped and wet with a very pungent odor \u2014 the odor of semen. Her blouse was saturated \u2014 \u201cI could have probably wrung it out.\u201d The nurse also noticed that the victim\u2019s cheek was reddened. The nurse put the victim in a special room because of \u201cher condition with the clothing and the smell; and that she also was a very anxious woman. And I thought she needed to be isolated from the rest of the emergency room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The nurse related as fresh complaint testimony what the victim had told her, a description of events similar to that testified to by the victim. The threats were more graphic \u2014 \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do this with his three dudes that I would \u2014 I\u2019d be killed; that he would break my nose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The emergency room physician who saw her about 6:15 p.m. with the nurse, also described the victim\u2019s condition. She was in a state of disarray; her blouse was ripped, wet, dirty and smelling of semen. She was upset and withdrawn. She had a reddened area on her cheek several inches in diameter, \u201cremarkable enough that we ... we did take a Polaroid photograph of it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cHer major fear, to me, was whether or not she had been damaged internally.\u201d She complained of back pain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>She had evidence of dried fluid on her chin and neck which upon examination with a Wood\u2019s lamp<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> gave a positive test, highly suggestive of semen. The victim also had a \u201cvery prominent angry scratch ... a welt\u201d across her chest,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and had fresh scratches on her lower back \u2014 as if it had been rubbed against some rough surface. Motile sperm was found in her vagina and semen in her rectal area. The doctor testified that of all the alleged rape cases he had seen during his two months in the emergency room, this case was the \u201cmost striking to me, because it was the case that there was the most evidence of physical violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The defendant took the stand. While he admitted having been in the victim\u2019s apartment (according to his account it was much earlier in the day), he insisted that the victim had consented to having sex with his three companions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">1. <em>Evidence of the victim\u2019s motive. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in limiting his cross-examination of the victim for bias. He claims that the sexual acts were consensual; the victim, had fabricated a story of rape because she feared that if it became known that she was entertaining various men in her apartment, she would be unable to regain custody of her five children. When defense counsel asked the complainant where her children were living, the Commonwealth objected. Defense counsel informed the judge that he intended to establish bias by showing that the victim\u2019s children had been taken away from her, that they had been placed in a foster home, and that because the victim was trying to regain them, she had second thoughts about \u201centertaining willingly.\u201d After holding a voir dire, the judge, for the reasons stated in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> excluded further inquiry as to the custody of the victim\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The judge\u2019s ruling was unwise. Even if no one in the Department of Social Services or in the Probate Court was informed of the victim\u2019s activities with men, her own concern that her attempts to regain custody of her children would be weakened by a showing of her promiscuity could show a motive to lie. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 117 (1985). The judge should have allowed the jury to hear and evaluate this evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 587 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 229 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Any error, however, in this regard was harmless. \u201c[H]ad the judge admitted the [excluded] testimony ... it would have been without material effect on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldron, </em>383 Mass. 86, 93 (1981). First, there was considerable testimony of other witnesses that the victim was trying to obtain her children. The defendant\u2019s former lawyer testified to the victim\u2019s fears of \u201cwhat people would think after seeing her with several men in her apartment.\u201d The defendant testified that the victim was worried about it being known \u201cthat she was entertaining three black men,\u201d that she \u201cwas trying to get her kids\u201d and that her social worker might find out. Two other defense witnesses also alluded to these concerns, and defense counsel in his closing argument pointed out that the victim\u2019s interest in getting her children back gave her a reason to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We do not base our decision solely on the foregoing testimony which came entirely from the defendant\u2019s witnesses and must be viewed with caution. As indicated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britland, </em>300 Mass. 492, 496 (1938), \u201cEvidence of statements favorable to the defendant coming from the lips of the witnesses for the prosecution would be apt to be given complete credence by the jury, whereas coming from the defendant alone, they might be viewed with the suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>they were of later invention.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 119; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piedra, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 155, 158 (1985). If the only evidence of lack of consent had come from the victim, the inability to cross-examine that witness on these questions might have precluded the jury from making \u201ca discriminating appraisal of [her] possible biases and motivations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 831 (1985), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tracey, </em>675 F.2d 433, 437 (1st Cir. 1982). But cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mormando, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 815 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Here, however, there was overwhelming evidence, quite apart from the complainant\u2019s testimony, that her acts of sexual intercourse with the defendant\u2019s three companions were not entered into willingly. The victim\u2019s physical and emotional condition upon arrival of the hospital forcefully rebuts any claim of consent. We think there is no \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the excluded evidence might have made a difference. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967). <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679-680 (1986). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>377 Mass. 503, 510-511 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">2. <em>Opinion of the examining physician. </em>The emergency room physician was questioned by the prosecution as to whether he had reached a diagnosis based on the victim\u2019s history and his examination. The specific questions and answers, as well as the judge\u2019s curative instruction, are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The defendant claims it was error to permit the doctor to express an opinion based in part upon the victim\u2019s history. He also claims as a separate ground that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis was improper because an expert may not give his opinion on the ultimate question in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">While a physician may testify to certain statements given to him by a patient, such as complaints and symptoms of pain, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>355 Mass. 526, 528-529 (1969); see Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 346 (5th ed. 1981); 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 688 (Chadboum rev. 1970), he may not repeat the patient\u2019s statements that her injuries were caused by a sexual assault. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>195 Mass. 100, 108-109 (1907). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>355 Mass, at 528-530. See <em>Roosa </em>v. <em>Boston Loan Co., </em>132 Mass. 439, 440-441 (1882); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 666-667 (1966); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guidry, post </em>907, 908 (1986). Compare <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 529 (1978). To permit such testimony would enhance the complainant\u2019s account of what had happened by the evidence of an expert. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 n.8 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In addition, another somewhat related limitation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is placed on a doctor\u2019s testimony in rape cases. Unless there are particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>facts which require a medical expert, a physician is not considered to have professional knowledge which would be of assistance to the jury in determining whether a rape has occurred. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass, at 667, the court stated, \u201cWe are not persuaded that a gynecologist, or other expert, possesses skills or special experience which might enable him to determine, from factors such as these [bruises and the victim\u2019s own statement of what had happened] that acts of intercourse amounted to rape. . . . Where the jury are equally capable of drawing the conclusion sought from an expert witness, the expert\u2019s testimony is inadmissible.\u201d Thus, in the absence of special circumstances, a physician \u201cno matter how well qualified, may not be asked directly whether a rape or a sexual assault has occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 404. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526, 528 (1971). This is not because the opinion touches on the ultimate issues that the jury must decide, but because they are as well equipped as the expert to assess the issues. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, supra </em>at 403, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guidry, supra </em>at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The doctor\u2019s first answer, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>was inappropriate. Nothing suggests, however, that the question was \u201can attempt to elicit from the expert witness a direct opinion that a [sexual assault] had occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass, at 528. The judge immediately instructed the jury to disregard the \u201cdoctor\u2019s statement that it was a result of sexual assault.\u201d Although unfortunate, we do not think the statement, in these circumstances, requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The doctor\u2019s diagnosis, which was admitted in evidence: \u201crecent sexual intercourse; evidence of trauma to the cheek, anterior chest and lower back,\u201d was an entirely proper answer even if based on the \u201chistory . . . obtained from the patient,\u201d including her account of what had happened.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>as related to the jury contained no information additional to that previously given by the doctor which had been based only on his direct observations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peets, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 916-917 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">3. <em>Refusal to instruct concerning photographic array. </em>A police detective investigating the case was questioned about the victim\u2019s identification of one of the defendant\u2019s companions. He testified that he had shown the victim an array of pictures, <em>not including the defendant\u2019s picture, </em>in September, 1980. At that time, the detective testified, the defendant\u2019s companion was under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The defendant requested, but was refused, an instruction that \u201cany reference made to any photographs shown to the . . . alleged victim . . . should not reflect adversely or suggest any comparability on the part of this defendant.\u201d On appeal the defendant argues that the detective\u2019s testimony could well have suggested to the jury that the array of photographs were \u201cmugshots\u201d and thus that the companion had a criminal record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, </em>387 Mass. 628, 637-638 (1982). Since the defendant was tried on a joint enterprise theory, he argues that this inference was damaging.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We think the cases relied on by the defendant<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are inapposite. The picture was not introduced in evidence, compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fosher, </em>568 F.2d 207, 214 (1st Cir. 1978), it was not of the defendant, its source was not given, and there was no suggestion that it was a mugshot. Moreover, the companion had been arrested prior to the array being shown, and \u201cthe jurors might well have inferred\u201d that his picture was taken subsequent to his arrest for the crime at bar. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 730, 736-737 (1974). There was no error in refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>4. <em>Admission of hospital records. </em>The defendant claims it was error to admit in evidence the sanitized medical records of the complainant as the contents of the records had already been made known to the jury through the testimony of the doctor and nurse who had prepared them. Relying on <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass, at 527, he argues that this duplication is contrary to the intent of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">There was no error in admitting the records. Although G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, was \u201cenacted primarily to relieve the physicians and nurses of . . . hospitals from the hardship and inconvenience of attending court as witnesses\u201d <em>Bouchie, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 482 (1920), the statute does not limit the admissibility of hospital records to those cases where the preparers of the reports are absent. Even if the information was entirely cumulative, the judge had discretion to admit the records. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffie, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 1016, 1017 (1983), is misplaced. There, a rape incident report was held inadmissible as a hospital record under \u00a7 79 primarily because much of the report contained multiple hearsay statements. It does not appear that the report would have been excluded solely on the ground that the Commonwealth did not need the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The defendant also objects to the refusal of the judge to order the words \u201calleged rape\u201d removed<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from the records on the ground that these words have \u201creference to the question of liability\u201d and must be excluded under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. The words \u201calleged rape\u201d are similar to terms considered inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>dental to \u201ctreatment and medical history\u201d and are admissible under the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concepcion, 362 </em>Mass. 653, 655-656 (1972), and cases cited. Even if not, the words added nothing to other evidence presented in this case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gogan, </em>389 Mass. 255, 264 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cutter, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 876, 877 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">5. <em>The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. </em>We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit. His claim that it was error to allow the victim to testify to her fresh complaint to the nurse is indistinguishable from the claim rejected in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 886, 887 (1981). Although the defendant also argues that the victim\u2019s testimony permitted her to fill in some gaps, no omissions or additions are specified. Our review of the testimony indicates that it added nothing to the nurse\u2019s fresh complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Nor did the judge err in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction to the effect that the jury were not to consider the fresh complaint testimony even for limited purposes \u201cif you find the statements made by\u201d the complainant to the doctor, the detective, and the nurse \u201cwere not made reasonably promptly after the alleged rapes occurred.\u201d The promptness of the complaints was never an issue at trial, they were made within hours of the incident and it was obvious that the judge concluded, quite correctly, that the complaints were \u201cfresh.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 691 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The defendant also argues that no limiting instructions were given as to the use of the fresh complaint testimony with respect to the witnesses, other than the nurse, who reported the victim\u2019s statements. The defendant did not object to the instructions, and there is here no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. Moreover, the judge\u2019s instructions were probably sufficient to cover all such fresh complaint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, a review of the transcript indicates that the judge did not abdicate his role or refuse to consider the evidence in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The judge merely disagreed with the defendant as to the strength of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In sum, we see no reason to set aside the verdicts or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\"> He was acquitted on an indictment for rape by unnatural intercourse and on an indictment for breaking and entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> Although at first the victim testified that she had not previously had sexual relations with the defendant, after a side bar conference she admitted that she had had such a relationship with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> Some three hours later, at 9:00 p.m. , a police officer who was investigating the matter saw the victim and described her cheeks as being bruised and red.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> The doctor explained that a Wood\u2019s lamp is a \u201clamp that shines ultraviolet light which gives a characteristic slightly fluorescent green tinge to semen when examined.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\"> A tetanus injection was administered as a prophylactic measure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\"> There was no claim the defendant had sexual relations with the victim on the date in question; he was tried on a theory of joint enterprise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The Court: \u201cNow, let me make my ruling.
