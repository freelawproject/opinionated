L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, the defendant was found guilty by a Superior Court jury of possession of heroin with intent to distribute (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32[a]) and of having been convicted of the same offense on one or more prior occasions (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32[b\\, </em>as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 6). On appeal, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the indictment on the latter charge and, as to the former charge, certain of the judge\u2019s rulings, portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. Finding no error, we affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">1. <em>The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his prior criminal convictions. </em>The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the admission for impeachment purposes of the defendant\u2019s fourteen prior criminal convictions. In so doing, the defendant followed the suggestion that a ruling on such questions should be sought at an early time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 81-82 (1981),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>cited. The defendant\u2019s particular concern was with prior convictions for the same or similar offenses as the primary crime which was currently being charged; the defendant had been convicted once of illegal possession of narcotic drugs, twice of illegal possession of heroin, once of possession of heroin with intent to sell, once of possession of a Class A controlled substance, second offense (heroin is a Class A controlled substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31), and thrice of distribution of a Class A controlled substance, all second offenses. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the motion because the danger of prejudice from the admission of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions for the same or similar crimes, even though limited to impeachment purposes, far outweighed their probative value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984). The Commonwealth, relying on <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38 (1984), contends that as the defendant did not testify and the prior convictions were, therefore, not admitted, the question of the balancing of prejudice and probative worth is not open on appeal. The defendant counters that he did not testify because of the adverse ruling and that if he had testified, he would have denied all involvement in the incident. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 680 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">First, we state some basic principles. We are not dealing with an issue of Federal or State constitutional dimension. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 75-79, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 470 n.8. A judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for impeachment purposes when a defendant testifies is reviewable on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 470. \u201cThe question on appeal will normally be whether there was an abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of a prior conviction because the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence of a prior conviction for the purposes of impeachment\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Ibid. </em>This standard of review is essentially the same as that explicitly provided in Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 468 n.2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among Federal Courts of Appeal on the question presented here. 469 U.S. at 40. A unanimous court (Stevens, J., taking no part, and Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in the reasoning and result) held that in order to present for review a claim of abuse of discretion in a ruling to admit, after application of the balancing test in Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(1), evidence of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, a defendant must testify at trial. We set forth in the margin the relevant portions of the opinion of the Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our appellate courts have not yet considered the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. at 680 (Hen-nessey, J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192 (1984) (defendant did not testify but \u201cnarrow question\u201d before court <em>[id. </em>at 195] was whether judge knew he had discretion and exercised it; case decided before <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra)\u2019, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 571-572 (1982) (defendant did not testify but error as matter of law for judge to refuse to exercise discretion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 948 (1983) (same). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass, at 467, the defendant testified and was impeached by a prior conviction. In announcing the standard of review to which we have referred, the court held: \u201cWe will consider seasonably raised challenges to the admission of evidence of prior convictions of a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>who testified at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. We are not, of course, bound to follow the holding of the Supreme Court in <em>Luce.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On the record before us, we need not reach the question whether the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in ruling on the in limine motion to exclude evidence of prior convictions for impeachment of the defendant is reviewable. The record of the proceedings on the motion is before us on the contents of the defendant\u2019s motion to expand the record on appeal, which was allowed by the judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From that motion we learn only the following. The hearing was held before the jury were em-panelled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel stated that the defendant wanted to testify but would not do so if the Commonwealth should be permitted to impeach him with evidence of convictions for the same or similar offenses. If the defendant should testify, counsel represented, \u201chis testimony would include a complete denial of participation in the heroin sale at issue in the case.\u201d The judge examined copies of the defendant\u2019s records of convictions. The prosecutor stated that he intended to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, but there is no indication that the prosecutor informed the judge of the nature of the other evidence the Commonwealth intended to produce. \u201cThus the judge was not furnished with a scenario which would have given him some indication of the course the trial might be expected to take, by which he could measure the prejudicial effect of the impeaching evidence as against its relevance to the defendant\u2019s credibility\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 35 (1979). See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass, at 81-82, and cases cited. The statement of counsel that the defendant would deny the allegations of the Commonwealth was, without more, an insufficient offer of proof. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 751 n.8 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We hold only that, if the question of abuse of discretion in the denial of an in limine motion to exclude evidence is open on review at all in the case of a defendant who does not testify, see <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>469 U.S. at 41-42, it must be presented on a record which allows the reviewing court to evaluate the judge\u2019s balancing of unfair prejudice and probative value. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass, at 470. Absent extraordinary circumstances, which we do not find here, such a record must include descriptions of the nature of the evidence the parties intend to present and such other information as bears on the factors mentioned in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, supra </em>at 81. We may review the exercise of discretion only on the basis of what was before the judge at the time of exercise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">2. <em>The curtailment of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case was based upon a single street sale of .85 grams of heroin for $50 to undercover police officers operating out of a pickup truck. There was evidence that the defendant, one of a group of males standing in an abandoned lot, approached the truck, and the officers asked him if they could purchase some heroin. The defendant retrieved the heroin, and the sale was consummated. The defendant then advised the officers to deal with him \u201cor you\u2019ll get ripped off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>On cross-examination of an undercover police detective (experienced in narcotics investigations) who observed but did not take part in the transaction just described, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked him to describe what one would have to do to establish an operation for the sale of narcotics. The prosecutor\u2019s objection was sustained. At a bench conference, the defendant\u2019s counsel explained that he wanted the detective\u2019s testimony to show \u201cthat it takes a substantial amount of time, energy, cash and other resources to set up any type of drug-dealing operation.\u201d With that evidence, the defendant would contend that, as he was released after serving a seven-year sentence at M.C.I., Walpole, just seven days before the transaction in question, it would have been impossible for the defendant then to have been an \u201cactive drug dealer.\u201d The judge thought that the proffered evidence was not relevant to the case presented by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cWhether evidence is legally relevant is a question which is generally left to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 187 (1981). While we think it would not have been error to admit the evidence which the defendant sought to elicit, we cannot say, given the nature of the evidence on which the Commonwealth relied, that its exclusion constituted an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>353 Mass. 197, 213-214 (1967), cert, denied, 390 U.S. 982 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 656-657 (1981); <em>Commonwealth v. Bettencourt, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924-925 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">3. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The comments of the prosecutor in his closing argument of which the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel now complains were not objected to by trial counsel. Our review, therefore, is confined to a determination whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth v. Daigle, </em>379 Mass. 541, 549 (1980). We conclude that there is no such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">During the course of his closing argument, the prosecutor said: \u201cPlease wade through some of the smoke that\u2019s been thrown up in this case. You know, the defendant doesn\u2019t want to talk about the drug deal. He wants to talk about how they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>[the police officers] got to this point from Holiday Inn and what streets they took. Is that important? Or is it important what happened right here on South First Street [indicating]?\u201d When considered in context, this portion of the argument (as well as others) was in reference to the closing argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel in which he concentrated on what he perceived to be inconsistencies in the testimony of the police officers. It cannot reasonably be read otherwise. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, 332 </em>Mass. 66, 69 (1954). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>392 Mass. 632, 640-641 (1984), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On appeal, the defendant plucks from the prosecutor\u2019s statement one sentence \u2014 \u201cYou know, the defendant doesn\u2019t want to talk about the drug deal.\u201d \u2014 and argues that it constituted improper comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The argument is frivolous.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201csmoke\u201d unfairly demeaned and discredited legitimate defense strategy. The prosecutor used the word to describe what he considered the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s emphasis on noncritical aspects of the evidence. As such, this was fair comment. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunker, </em>363 Mass. 792, 798-800 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 618-619 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Easterling, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 230 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">4. <em>The judge\u2019s instructions on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument that the \u201cisolated utterance\u201d that proof beyond reasonable doubt \u201cis not proof beyond all reasonable doubt\u201d created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is foreclosed by the holding of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile (No. 2), </em>396 Mass. 215, 217-220 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>5. <em>The judge\u2019s refusal to honor the request of the jury that a portion of the testimony of one witness be read to them. </em>The jury interrupted their deliberations with a written question to the judge requesting that they be allowed to hear a portion of the testimony of the first witness, a police officer. On appeal, the defendant argues that there was error of law in the judge\u2019s refusal to grant the request because in doing so he indicated that he did not understand that he had discretion to grant it. See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192, 195 (1984), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 948, 948-949 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The defendant isolates expressions of the judge in his colloquy with counsel and in his response to the jury \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think I can answer this question . . \u201cwhich I don\u2019t think I\u2019m permitted to do\u201d; \u201cit would be inappropriate for me . . . .\u201d However, our review of the entire colloquy and response sufficiently persuades us that the judge was aware that he had the discretion to grant or deny the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the request for a reading of a portion of the testimony of one witness. See <em>Commonwealth v. Fitzpatrick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 106,107-109 (1984), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth v. Hunter, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 224 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">6. <em>The sufficiency of the indictment under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(b). </em>The defendant argues that that part of the indictment which charged him with being a repeat offender<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is fatally defective because it fails to state that the defendant had been convicted<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the two offenses set forth or that he was the person accused of them. \u201cAs the defendant did not raise this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>issue in the trial court on either a motion to dismiss or a motion for a required finding of not guilty, brought under Mass.R. Crim.P. 13(c) and 25, 378 Mass. 872, 896 (1979), respectively, our consideration is confined to whether the indictment ] fail[s] \u2018to charge an offense,\u2019 G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 47A, ... or whether there is a substantial risk that a miscarriage of justice otherwise has occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 57 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u201cThe test of the sufficiency of the indictment[ j is whether [it] \u2018fully and plainly, substantially and formally\u2019 describe^] the crimes or offenses for which the defendant ] [is] held to answer. Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 395-396 (1944).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 339 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 194, 195 (1979). An indictment must contain \u201ca plain, concise description of the act which constitutes the crime or an appropriate legal term descriptive thereof.\u201d Mass. R.Crim.P. 4(a), 378 Mass. 849 (1979). \u201cAn indictment shall not be dismissed or be considered defective or insufficient if it is sufficient to enable the defendant to understand the charge and to prepare his defense; nor shall it be considered defective or insufficient for lack of any description or information which might be obtained by requiring a bill of particulars.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 34, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 34. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McClaine, </em>367 Mass. 559, 560 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soule, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 973, 973-974 (1979). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 724 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Here, the indictment was sufficient to inform the defendant that he was being charged with being a repeat offender under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(6), and to enable him to prepare a defense. The indictment set forth the specific prior charges, the dates on which the defendant was convicted and the court in which the proceedings took place. The defendant does not argue that he did not know of those convictions. There is explicit reference to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(6), which deals solely with punishment for repeated convictions of the laws governing controlled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>stances. The defendant\u2019s contention that the indictment is defective because it did not state that the defendant was the accused in the prior cases is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Any perceived deficiencies in the indictment could easily have been cured by a request for a bill of particulars. Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(b)(1), 378 Mass. 872 (1979). Finally, the defendant does not argue that he was prejudiced by the allegations in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> \u201cAs to the time when a ruling should be made on a motion by a defendant to bar his impeachment through prior convictions, it is desirable, if feasible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>that this should occur at an early moment, since it may affect counsel\u2019s conduct of the trial all down the line.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, supra </em>at 81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> The defendant\u2019s other convictions were for breaking and entering in the nighttime and larceny, larceny of a motor vehicle, operating a motor vehicle after suspension of license, possession of counterfeit bills with intent to pass, uttering forged checks and escape. All of the defendant\u2019s convictions would appear to have been admissible under the conditions prescribed by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> On appeal, the defendant does not argue that there was error in the judge\u2019s ruling insofar as it related to the nondrug-related convictions. Indeed, at least some of those convictions were for crimes directly concerned with the defendant\u2019s prior untruthfulness. See <em>Commonwealth v. Diaz, supra </em>at 81; <em>Commonwealth v. Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466,469 (1984), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> Proposed Massachusetts Rule of Evidence 609(a) (1980) contains the same standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, supra </em>at 469 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> \u201cA reviewing court is handicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context.11 This is particularly true under Rule 609(a)(1), which directs the court to weigh the probative value of a prior conviction against the prejudicial effect to the defendant. To perform this balancing, the court must know the precise nature of the defendant\u2019s testimony, which is unknowable when, as here, the defendant does not testify.1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>1</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u201cAny possible harm flowing from a district court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative. The ruling</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">[*] \u201cRequiring a defendant to make a proffer of testimony is no answer; his trial testimony could, for any number of reasons, differ from the proffer. \u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass, at 81-82. Compare also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750-751 &amp; n.8 (1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>is subject to change when the case unfolds, particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was contained in the defendant\u2019s proffer. Indeed even if nothing unexpected happens at trial, the district judge is free, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, to alter a previous <em>in limine </em>ruling. On a record such as here, it would be a matter of conjecture whether the District Court would have allowed the Government to attack petitioner\u2019s credibility at trial by means of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u201cWhen the defendant does not testify, the reviewing court also has no way of knowing whether the Government would have sought to impeach with the prior conviction. If, for example, the Government\u2019s case is strong, and the defendant is subject to impeachment by other means, a prosecutor might elect not to use an arguably inadmissible prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cBecause an accused\u2019s decision whether to testify \u2018seldom turns on the resolution of one factor,\u2019 <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>Portash, </em>440 U.S. 450, 467 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting), a reviewing court cannot assume that the adverse ruling motivated a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. In support of his motion a defendant might make a commitment to testify if his motion is granted; but such a commitment is virtually risk free because of the difficulty of enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u201cEven if these difficulties could be surmounted, the reviewing court would still face the question of harmless error. See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499 (1983). Were <em>in limine </em>rulings under Rule 609(a) reviewable on appeal, almost any error would result in the windfall of automatic reversal; the appellate court could not logically term \u2018harmless\u2019 an error that presumptively kept the defendant from testifying. Requiring that a defendant testify in order to preserve Rule 609(a) claims will enable the reviewing court to determine the impact any erroneous impeachment may have had in light of the record as a whole; it will also tend to discourage making such motions solely to \u2018plant\u2019 reversible error in the event of conviction.\u201d 469 U.S. at 41-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\"> For examples of the conflicting views of Federal Courts of Appeal, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>608 F.2d 1175, 1183-1188 (9th Cir. 1979), cert, denied, 444 U.S. 1034 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kiendra, </em>663 F.2d 349, 352-353 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>713 F.2d 1236, 1237-1242 (6th Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> The motion to exclude evidence of the convictions was heard in the judge\u2019s lobby; no record was made.
