J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">Following trial by a six-person jury in a District Court, the defendant was convicted of possession of marihuana with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(a). He was sentenced to a term of two years in a house of correction, six months of the sentence to be served and the balance sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>pended on probation. The trial judge denied a stay of sentence pending appeal. A stay of sentence was subsequently granted by q single justice of this court. We reverse the conviction, concluding that the trial judge erred in allowing the defendant to be impeached by his prior convictions of more serious drug crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The prosecution\u2019s case was based upon the testimony of an undercover police officer assigned to the special investigation unit of the Pittsfield police department. This officer testified that on April 22, 1985, at about 11:30 p.m., she met the defendant in a bar in Pittsfield. After some conversation, she asked the defendant \u201cif he had a joint that I could buy.\u201d The defendant left for about fifteen minutes. According to the officer, when the defendant returned, he \u201cgave me a joint\u201d by \u201csliding] it to me, like on the side, so no one else could see it.\u201d The officer further testified that the defendant refused an offer of payment for the cigarette. No other controlled substance was exchanged. The defendant was subsequently charged with possession of marihuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The defendant\u2019s case raised issues of misidentification and alibi. Two persons who had been identified by the undercover officer as having been in the bar at the time of the transfer of the cigarette testified that they had not been present. The defendant\u2019s wife testified that he was home with her on April 22, and that they had retired for the night at about 11:00 p.m. The defendant testified that he had never seen the undercover officer before and that on the night of April 22 he had been home with his wife and two year old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On cross-examination, the defendant was impeached by the prosecutor with prior criminal convictions for violations of the controlled substance laws. The convictions resulted from the defendant\u2019s pleas of guilty in Superior Court in Berkshire County on June 5, 1981, on six indictments which had been returned in August, 1980, more than five years before the trial of the present case. As for the defendant\u2019s criminal background, the jurors were informed by the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination, and by introduction of the indictments in evidence, of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Offense Disposition Original sentence</p>\n<p id=\"Azf\">1. Unlawful possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute guilty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Five to seven years,M.C.I., Walpole, committed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4e\">2. Unlawful distribution of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) guilty<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> same as above, concurrent</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">3. Unlawful distribution of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) guilty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> same as above, concurrent</p>\n<p id=\"ase-dedup-0\">4. Unlawful possession of a class B controlled substance (methaqua-lone) with intent to distribute guilty same as above, concurrent</p>\n<p id=\"AJ1\">5. Unlawful possession of a class B controlled substance (phenmetra-zine) guilty same as above, concurrent</p>\n<p id=\"AhzQ\">6. Unlawful possession of a class B controlled guilty same as above, concurrent substance (amphetamines)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The indictments in evidence also advised the jury of other details: that, on July 1, 1982, the sentences had been revised by the Superior Court judge who had accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, to place on file three of the cases (nos. 4, 5 and 6, above, involving possession of methaqualone, phenmet-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>trazine and amphetamines), but to leave the concurrent five-to-seven year sentences on the other three convictions in effect; that the defendant had posted $1,000 bail to gain his release prior to trial; and that there was no credit against the sentences for time in confinement pending disposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The question whether the convictions should be allowed for impeachment was taken up by the judge at a hearing prior to trial, held in response to a motion in limine filed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, as suggested in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>383 Mass. 73, 81-82 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, ante </em>274, 275 (1986). The motion was strenuously pressed by defense counsel in view of the alibi and misidentification issues and the need for the defendant to take the stand to get the jury to consider the issues seriously. The trial judge, while recognizing that he had discretion to exclude the convictions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not feel so inclined. To defense counsel\u2019s argument that the impeaching crimes were so similar to the offense being tried that the effect would be \u201cdevastating,\u201d and to defense counsel\u2019s observation that the age of the convictions said little about the defendant\u2019s credibility, the judge made the remarks set out below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To defense counsel\u2019s further question, \u201cHow does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>fact that he pled guilty, your Honor, back in 1980 [defense counsel had the date wrong; it was 1981], to all these offenses suggest that he should not be believed today?,\u201d the judge gave the answer noted below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further colloquy, generally along the same line as set forth in nn. 6 and 7, culminated in the judge\u2019s ruling that the criminal convictions could come in if the defendant elected to testify. When the convictions did come in they were objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>398 Mass. 1, 7 (1986). We note finally that the prosecutor did not refer to the convictions in his final argument, no limiting instruction was requested or given when the impeachment occurred, and the judge\u2019s closing charge contained the standard instruction that the impeachment was to be used by the jury only to evaluate the defendant\u2019s credibility and for no other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>1. The present state of the law of impeachment by prior convictions has been reviewed in recent decisions and need not be reiterated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192, 194 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 833-834 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 276-277; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, ante </em>297, 301 (1986). A trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting a defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions may be reviewed on appeal and may be reversed for abuse of that discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466, 470 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In this case there was such abuse. The comments by the judge disclose two bases for his ruling. The first basis \u2014 not expressed directly but implicit, we think, in the judge\u2019s reference to the need for the jury to know about repeat offenses of like kind, such as drunken driving convictions (to use the judge\u2019s example) \u2014 is the notion that impeachment is more probative than prejudicial when there is similarity between the crime of which the defendant had been previously convicted and the crime on which he is standing trial. Such \u201csimilarity is precisely the \u2018unfair prejudice\u2019 to which the language of <em>Maguire </em>is directed. It is all too easy for a jury to surmise that if a defendant earlier committed a crime, he probably committed the crime for which he is being tried, particularly if the crimes are similar\u201d. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guilfoyle, </em>396 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1985). Admitting the convictions for this reason constituted error. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The judge\u2019s second basis for allowing the impeachment \u2014 expressed directly several times \u2014 is the notion that the jury could consider the defendant\u2019s testimony unbelievable because, as a repeat drug offender, he would face a stiffer penalty. The rationale for impeachment by prior conviction lies in the fact that the defendant\u2019s past conduct may have a tendency to demonstrate present untruthfulness; that is, a defendant\u2019s earlier disregard for the law may suggest to the fact finder similar disregard for the courtroom oath. This point was made some time ago by Justice Holmes in <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Fitchburg R.R., </em>137 Mass. 77, 78 (1884), a civil case, as follows: \u201c[Wjhen it is proved that a witness has been convicted of a crime, the <em>only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ground for disbelieving him which such proof affords is the general readiness to do evil which the conviction may be supposed to show. It is from that general disposition <em>alone </em>that the jury is asked to infer a readiness to lie in the particular case, and thence that he has lied in fact. The evidence has no tendency to prove that [the witness] was mistaken, but only that he has perjured himself, and it reaches that conclusion <em>solely </em>through the general proposition that he is of bad character and unworthy of credit\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, 392 </em>Mass, at 195 n.2. The point remains valid today, see Advisory Committee Note to First Draft of Proposed Fed. R. Evid. 609(a), 46 F.R.D. 161, 297 (1969) (\u201cA demonstrated instance of willingness to engage in conduct in disregard of accepted patterns is translatable into willingness to give false testimony\u201d), and applies to criminal cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, 393 </em>Mass, at 835 (Lynch, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We think it was a distortion of this relatively circumscribed purpose of impeachment testimony for the judge to reason as he did. In essence, he reasoned that the jury could infer present untruthfulness from the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct through speculation that such conduct, which was more than five years old, might lead to some harsh but unspecified future punishment. Such an inference would necessarily assume more than general awareness by the jury of an unknown factor, namely, the nature of the defendant\u2019s punishment should conviction result on a charge that he possessed and gave away a single marihuana cigarette, and it would also include the additional assumption that the judge would imprison the defendant for such an offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, admitting the convictions in this case on the rationale that the defendant was a repeat drug offender who could suffer severe punishment would necessarily inject the consequences of sentencing into the jurors\u2019 deliberations. Such consideration is prohibited \u201cbecause the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>jury\u2019s function is to reach a verdict based solely on the evidence presented to them considered in light of the judge\u2019s charge to them concerning the applicable legal standards.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 882 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth v. Medeiros, </em>395 Mass. 336, 350 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 675 (1983). (See also G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1967, c. 213, creating safeguards for the trial of a defendant who has been charged as a second or subsequent offender.) Indeed, it is difficult to discern how a jury could be permitted to speculate about sentencing consequences in evaluating the weight of the defendant\u2019s testimony \u2014 a process that bears directly on the verdict they reach \u2014 while they are simultaneously barred from considering sentencing in arriving at a verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that the reasons relied upon by the judge do not warrant an exercise of discretion in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. Even if the judge presiding at any retrial were to approach the problem in a different manner, we think that the probability for prejudice as to these particular convictions outweighs any possible insight they might provide as to the defendant\u2019s credibility. The panel concludes, in the circumstances, that the impeachment is to be barred at any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">3. Based on the disposition of the appeal on the impeachment issue, we need not consider the arguments the defendant makes in reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 316-318 (1979). As for the issue raised by these arguments, the defendant will be free to pursue a motion to suppress the undercover police officer\u2019s identification testimony prior to any retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8c\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\"> The date of this offense was alleged in the indictment to be July 18,1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> The date of this offense was alleged in the indictment to be May 22,1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> The date of this offense was alleged in the indictment to be July 2,1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> Some of this information might be considered extraneous to the impeachment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>397 Mass. 298, 300 (1986), but we need not concern ourselves with that issue as we ultimately conclude that, on retrial, the impeachment should not be allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> The defendant argues on appeal that, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, ante </em>297 (1986), the trial judge did not know he had discretion. The record does not support the argument. The judge\u2019s attention was specifically directed to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>392 Mass. 466 (1984), and he stated at several points in the course of the argument that he knew he had discretion. The defendant\u2019s real contention may be that the judge, while cognizant of his discretion, indicated, in substance, that he would never exercise it in favor of one accused of drug offenses. This interpretation could be placed on some of the isolated remarks made by the judge. On the whole, however, we think that the judge \u201cknew he had discretion and exercised it in favor of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>392 Mass. 192, 195 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">\u201cLet me say this to you, Mr. Campoli [the defendant\u2019s counsel], you asked a question and I\u2019ll try to answer it (inaudible).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\u201cLet\u2019s take \u2014 we have a lot of driving under cases, and we had someone here a couple of days ago (inaudible) not guilty (inaudible). (Inaudible.) And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>I\u2019ve heard it expressed time and time again, and a jury when they get through a session, are quite upset about the fact that they\u2019ve found, in a given case, if they found the defendant not guilty, they were unaware of the fact that it was his second or third or fourth offense. I think it\u2019s giving the jury something less than that to which they\u2019re entitled. I think the jury ought to have all the evidence, and let the jury decide what the evidence suggests. I think a person who comes in and testifies, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a second or third offender, driving under, has many reasons why he doesn\u2019t want to admit to or speak truthfully about the fact that he was driving under, because the penalty of the second or third offender may be more severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\u201cI think you could make an argument to that, and I think as a practical matter the juries recognize and feel cheated by the fact that they haven\u2019t been made aware, when trying a case to the Jury of Six, that the defendant was in fact before them not as a first offender but as a second or third offender. And I\u2019ve had juries express that very thought, \u2018Judge, I think something is wrong in the way it\u2019s being done.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\u201cSo to answer your question, Mr. Campoli, I think that it is material, on the question of whether or not a person who is in for a second or third or fourth or whatever the offense may be, there\u2019s a reason why he would be inclined to speak something less than the truth. And I think the jury is entitled to know those things.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\u201cI think it is a question of credibility, and I think they\u2019re entitled to know all the things that may affect a person\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> \u201cWell, because of the fact that he may be facing a stiffer penalty. He, in his mind, okay, he may realize he\u2019s not a first offender, in fact he\u2019s got a drug problem. What we do, as a first offender, let\u2019s say, of possession of marihuana, we order the case continued without a finding, with court costs of $50. But if in fact he\u2019s a person who is a second offender, a third offender, or what have you, the penalty is more severe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\"> We perceive another defect in the judge\u2019s reasoning. The desire to avoid punishment is a characteristic of first time defendants as well as repeat offenders. This fact vitiates the argument that a repeat offender is more likely to lie in order to escape criminal sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> The proof of likely unfair prejudice in this case, on both bases relied upon by the judge, may be shown empirically by his observation, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>that some jurors in other cases who had voted to acquit defendants had told him that they would have voted to convict had they known (by way of impeachment) that the defendants had committed prior similar offenses. This is precisely the prejudice that the careful exercise of discretion is meant to obviate when similar prior offenses are involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
