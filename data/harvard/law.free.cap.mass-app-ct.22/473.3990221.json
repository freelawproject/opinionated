Daniels and Madeline Daniels. The special permit was granted for the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>version of property located in Barnstable from its present use as an inn to use as apartments. The Danielses contend on cross appeal that the judge was incorrect in ruling that the plaintiffs had standing to appeal from the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Danielses own and operate the Cotuit Inn. The zoning by-law of Barnstable does not permit the operation of an inn in the area where the premises are located.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the use of the property as an inn predates the adoption of a zoning by-law in Barnstable. Therefore, it is undisputed that the use of the premises as an inn is a valid preexisting nonconforming use. The inn property consists of five buildings which contain an office, cocktail lounge, dining room, cottages, single rooms and housekeeping suites. The Danielses applied to the board for a special permit to change the valid nonconforming use of their property to apartment use.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In their application, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Danielses stated that they planned to eliminate the inn, restaurant, and bar uses on the property and create ten apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The board held a public hearing and reviewed the Danielses\u2019 application. After the board voted unanimously to grant the requested application, the plaintiffs brought this action in the Superior Court. Their complaint, which sought to annul the grant of the permit, contended that the board\u2019s decision suffered from substantive and procedural defects. In their answer, the Danielses alleged, among other things, that the plaintiffs lacked the required standing to appeal from the board\u2019s decision. In addition, the Danielses filed a motion requesting a remand to the board in order that it might make findings required by the zoning by-law and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge allowed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">After the matter was remanded, the board conducted another public hearing on the petition and voted a second time to grant the special permit to the Danielses. In its decision, the board made a specific finding that \u201cthe proposed use will not only not be substantially more detrimental or objectionable to the neighborhood than the present use, but will, in fact, bring about an improvement and substantial upgrading and will be more in keeping with the district\u2019s essentially residential character, and is therefore in keeping with the spirit and intent of the zoning by-law.\u201d A Superior Court judge, after a trial, upheld the board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">1. <em>Standing issue. </em>The Danielses contend that the judge erred when he ruled that the plaintiffs were aggrieved persons within the meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 533, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under that statute, \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>by a decision of the board of appeals . . . whether or not previously a party . . . may appeal to the superior court.\u201d A judge\u2019s finding that a person is aggrieved is not to be set aside unless it is clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). <em>Paulding </em>v. <em>Bruins, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 709 (1984). Here, there was evidence that some of the plaintiffs were abutters to abutters and as \u201cparties in interest\u201d had received notice of the public hearings. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11. There is a rebuttable presumption that such persons are aggrieved persons under G. L. c. 40 A, \u00a7 6. <em>Marotta </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Revere, </em>336 Mass. 199, 204 (1957). <em>Paulding </em>v. <em>Bruins, supra </em>at 709. The record does not demonstrate that the Danielses presented evidence sufficient to overcome that presumption. In addition, such abutters, owners of property located in the same zoning district \u2014 a single-family, one-acre district \u2014 had a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of the district from the intrusion of multi-family housing. Certainly, the interest of at least these plaintiffs was more than a general civic interest in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance. <em>Compare. Amherst Growth Study Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Amherst, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 826, 827 (1973). There was no error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">2. <em>Application of \u00a7 M. </em>The zoning by-law contains special regulations in \u00a7 M governing apartments. That section provides that \u201c[ajpartment dwelling structures may hereafter be built or established in an existing building when authorized only in accordance with the following requirements.\u201d Various requirements, generally classified as intensity regulations, are then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>set forth in that section.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 M is applicable to the conversion of the inn to apartment use because the apartments are \u201cestablished in an existing building.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Danielses contended that it was evident from the reading of the entire by-law that the town did not intend to add the requirements of \u00a7 M to those general requirements governing a change in a lawful nonconforming use.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge ruled that \u00a7 M was not applicable. We agree with the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">A zoning by-law must be read in its complete context and be given a sensible meaning within that context. <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>362 Mass. 821, 826 (1973). The intent of the by-law is to be ascertained from all its terms and parts as well as the subject matter to which it relates. <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577-578 (1942). It is settled that where the language of an enactment is clear and unambiguous it should be followed even if an injustice or hardship results. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>363 Mass. 685, 690 (1973). However, where a statute (or by-law) is faulty, lacks precision or is ambiguous, a court may utilize general rules of construction, presumptions and interpre-tational aids to glean its meaning. See, for example, the nonexclusive list of construction aids in <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., supra </em>at 690 n.8. See also <em>School Comm, of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Assn., </em>385 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1982). Here, the zoning by-law is not free from ambiguity with regard to the question whether \u00a7 M applies to a change in a nonconforming use. Therefore, we utilize the full panoply of interpretational aids that are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">At the outset, we note that \u00a7 G (B) of the by-law (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>is \u201cpermissive in spirit\u201d in that it sanctions, by special permit, changes in nonconforming uses. <em>SeeMcAleer </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>361 Mass. 317, 323-324 (1972); <em>Berliner </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>363 Mass. 767, <em>777 </em>(1973); <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Harwich, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 286, 289-290 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(1983). If the town had intended that \u00a7 M alter or limit the permissive nature of \u00a7 G, it could have done so by cross referencing the sections (and \u00a7 P[A] [6], see note <em>4, </em>supra) to one another. Indeed, there are other sections of the by-laws wherein the drafters <em>did </em>cross reference to \u00a7 M.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The absence of an explicit reference to \u00a7 M is a strong indication that the drafters intended an exclusion. See <em>First Nat\u2019l. Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Center, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982). Moreover, it has also been stated, in the context of statutory interpretation, that if an omission from a statute was intended (e.g., a specific cross reference), no court can supply it; if the omission was due to inadvertence, an attempt to supply it would be tantamount' to adding to a statute a meaning not intended by the Legislature. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>312 Mass. 154, 161 (1942). <em>Boylston Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Tahanto Regional Sch. Dist., </em>353 Mass. 81, 84 (1967). <em>Cranberry Realty &amp; Mortgage Co. </em>v. <em>Ackerley Communications, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Although \u00a7 M is clearly entitled \u201cSpecial Regulations \u2014 Apartments,\u201d the board of appeals did not refer to it in the minutes of its hearings or in its decision. A local board, of course, has an \u201cintimate understanding\u201d not only of conditions within a town but also \u201cof the background and purposes of the entire [zoning] by-law.\u201d <em>Fitzsimonds </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chatham, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 57 (1985). It is reasonable to assume that the board did not consider \u00a7 M because it felt that it was inapplicable to an application for a special permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>for a change of a nonconforming use.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the Supreme Judicial Court recently stated in <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examrs. of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238 (1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cAuthority actually granted by [the Legislature] of course cannot evaporate through lack of administrative exercise. But just as established practice may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is equally significant in determining whether such power was actually conferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 246, quoting from <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Bunte Bros, </em>312 U.S. 349, 352 (1941). See also 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 49.05, at 364 (4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We note that \u00a7 M will not be rendered nugatory should it be found inapplicable to a change in a nonconforming use, and may, in fact, be construed consistently and harmoniously with the remainder of the by-law. Section M provides that \u201c[a]partment dwelling structures may hereafter be built or established in an existing building when <em>authorized </em>only in accordance with the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cA. The gross land area of the lot or group of contiguous lots on which an apartment structure is <em>permitted </em>shall not be less . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The above language can be construed to mean that the requirements of \u00a7 M shall apply only where apartments are \u201cauthorized\u201d or \u201cpermitted\u201d by the by-law. Apartments are presently allowed in Barnstable as of right in three zoning districts and by special permit in two additional districts. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the amendment of the by-law (in 1982) to include the words \u201cor established in an existing building\u201d does not necessarily require a conclusion, as the plaintiffs argue, that \u00a7 M must apply to a change in a nonconforming use but could simply be viewed as a recognition by the town that large buildings located in a district where apartments are permitted are frequently renovated to contain apartment units.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Lastly, it is not lightly to be supposed that major changes in a statute or by-law were intended where not \u201cplainly expressed.\u201d <em>Ferullo\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 635, 637 (1954). In the instant matter, \u00a7 M did not apply to changes in a nonconforming use prior to 1982, as it referred only to apartment dwelling structures \u201chereafter . . . built\u201d (see 1980 by-law). The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 M now applies to changes in a nonconforming use can certainly be classified as a major or substantial change in the by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that there was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling that \u00a7 M does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> The inn is located in an area which is designated as an \u201cRF\u201d zone under the Barnstable zoning by-law. The only permitted uses in that zone are detached, single-family residences, professional home occupation, and rented rooms in buildings occupied by fewer than six lodgers where a member of the owner\u2019s family lives on the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> Two different sections of the zoning by-law refer specifically to special permits for a change in a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Section G(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201cB. Any change of a non-conforming use, any alteration, relocation or increase in size of an existing non-conforming building or structure to extend the non-conforming use on the same lot, or use of existing or construction of a new building or structure, shall be allowed only by Special Permit of the Board of Appeals. Any of the foregoing shall not result in the creation of any use or structure more objectionable or substantially detrimental to the neighborhood or the creation of two or more non-conforming uses differing in use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Section P is the general section of the by-law governing special permits, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">\u201cA. The Board of Appeals may grant a special permit for the following exceptions to the zoning by-law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">\u201c6. Change of a non-conforming use to any specified use not more detrimental to a neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The board had neglected to make a finding, as required by the zoning by-law and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, that the change in the nonconforming use was not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> The Danielses filed a motion for summary judgment contending that there was no genuine issue of material fact that ten of the fifteen plaintiffs were not aggrieved persons. An assessors\u2019 map, real estate listings, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>other materials accompanied the motion. The plaintiffs responded with affidavits. The judge reserved his decision on the motion. At the trial, the Danielses contended that those plaintiffs not mentioned in the summary judgment motion were also not aggrieved persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> It is not necessary for the judge to determine that <em>all </em>of the plaintiffs had standing. The fact that only <em>one </em>of the plaintiffs was an aggrieved person is sufficient to permit an appeal from the board\u2019s decision. See <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>366 Mass. 667, 674-675 (1975); <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Sancta Maria Hosp., 5 </em>Mass.
