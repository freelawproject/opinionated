(Crane), was entitled to recover damages from USF&amp;G of $127,541.60, plus interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The uncontroverted material facts come largely from an affidavit of the president of Crape, who apparently made the affidavit with a copy of <em>Insurance Co. of N. America </em>v. <em>Northwestern Natl. Ins. Co., </em>371 F. Supp. 550 (E.D. Mich. 1973), aff\u2019d., 494 F.2d 1192 (6th Cir. 1974), at his elbow. Those facts are as follows: Crane supplied a Model TM 650 Grove hydraulic truck crane to USF&amp;G\u2019s insured, J. L. Caputo Construction Company (Caputo), in September, 1978, for service in connection with a job Caputo was doing in Newburyport. The agreement was verbal. Crane furnished the machine, an oiler, who drove the crane, and an operator, who operated the levers to make lifts. Although acting under the general supervision of Caputo, Crane\u2019s operator and oiler retained physical control over the crane at all times. Caputo paid an hourly fee for the crane and its crew. Members of the crew were employees of Crane, which paid their salaries, employment taxes, and provided their workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Crane retained control over the hiring and firing of the crew apd responsibility for fueling and repairing the crane. At the end of a work day, the operator and oiler secured the crane and held on to the keys. Crane reserved the right to substitute functionally equivalent equipment and crew. When it rendered invoices, Crane was in the habit of referring to \u201ccrane rental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>1. <em>Status of the crane under the exclusions. </em>The broad purpose of the comprehensive general liability insurance policy, so far as it related to property, was to cover property other than that which was Caputo\u2019s, i.e., other people\u2019s property. The policy exclusions recognize that, for reasons of conserving capital and tax avoidance, businesses frequently rent equipment which they in all respects control and which they operate. A fleet of trucks is a common example. The position of USF&amp;G throughout the case has been that Crane\u2019s use of the word \u201crental\u201d on its invoices is conclusive of the intention of the parties. We think that ignores the on-the-ground facts. Such has been the view of courts in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A common thread in the cases is that reference to a contractual arrangement as a \u201clease\u201d or \u201crental\u201d does not dictate its true nature. See <em>Insurance Co. of N. America </em>v. <em>Northwestern Natl. Ins. Co., </em>371 F. Supp. at 554 &amp; n.5; <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Trans-America Ins. Co., </em>75 A.D.2d 312, 317 (N.Y. 1980). See also <em>Allegheny Intl. Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Bio-Energy of Lincoln, Inc. </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 155,160-162 &amp; n. 12 (1985). Rather, courts look to who has possession and who has control of the property. See <em>Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>216 F.2d 441, 442 (10th Cir. 1954), cert, denied, 348 U.S. 953 (1955) (oil rig); <em>Insurance Co. of N. America </em>v. <em>Northwestern Natl. Ins. Co,, supra </em>(crane); <em>State </em>v. <em>Steel City Crane Rental, Inc., </em>345 So.2d 1371, 1373 (Ala. 1977) (crane); <em>Rice Bros. </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Indem. Co., </em>121 Cal. App. 2d 206, 209 (1953) (dump trucks); <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Trans-America Ins. Co., </em>75 A.D.2d at 317 (crane); <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Soltau, </em>283 Minn. 25, 29 (1969) (dump truck), which, at 29, collects some of the other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In the case before us, the dispositive factors of possession and control line up decisively in favor of construing the transaction as a service contract rather than an equipment lease. Only Crane\u2019s employees drove, operated, fueled, maintained, or repaired the equipment. Those employees kept the keys and were responsible for securing the machine. They could move the machine to another job and substitute equipment which was capable of the same work. Employees of the general contractor could direct where and when the crane should make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>lifts but that coordinating function is typical of the relationship between general contractors and subcontractors. Similar facts in the cases cited were resolved against qualification for the \u201crented to, in the custody of, or used by\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The very analysis which determines that Caputo did not rent the crane also determines that the crane did not fall under the \u201cin the custody of\u201d branch of the exclusion. In the absence of any indicia of possession or control, it could hardly be said that Caputo had custody. USF&amp;G\u2019s last line of defense is that surely the crane was \u201cused by\u201d Caputo in the construction project. In context, however, \u201cused by\u201d implies those same elements of responsibility for the damaged object which Caputo did not have. See <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Puryear Wood Prod. Co., </em>247 Ark. 673, 679-680 (1969); <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>169 Conn. 603, 607 (1975); <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Trans-America Ins. Co., </em>75 A.D.2d at 318. \u201c[I]f the term \u2018use\u2019 is construed to embrace all its possible meanings and ramifications, practically every activity of mankind would amount to a \u2018use\u2019 of something. However, the term must be considered with regard to the setting in which it is employed.\u201d <em>Great American Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Saltzman, </em>213 F.2d 743, 747 (8th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">2. <em>Duty to defend. </em>We think it clear that USF&amp;G had a duty to defend Crane\u2019s action against its insured. The duty to defend attaches \u201cif the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\u201d <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146 (1984). See <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965). Deciding whether there is a duty to defend involves \u201cenvisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). See <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 166-167 (1983). On any but the most constricted reading of the policy, the damage complained of fell within its coverage. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>cases previously discussed demonstrate, USF&amp;G\u2019s theory of exclusion, however unresolved in Massachusetts, has been consistently rejected in jurisdictions where it has been raised. Moreover, USF&amp;G \u201cflatly renounced coverage and liability\u201d without taking any steps to demonstrate that Crane could not establish a claim within the policy. <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 323-324. See <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 169; <em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>v. <em>Parsons Corp., </em>430 F.2d 531, 538-539 (8th Cir. 1970). Having defaulted in its duty to defend, USF&amp;G is bound by the judgment against Caputo. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>291 Mass. 445, 448-449 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">There is no merit in USF&amp;G\u2019s argument that the factual basis for allowing the motion for summary judgment was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">. <em>Text of Pertinent Exclusions Appearing in the Insurance Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The Property Damage Liability Coverage (including property damage coverage under Part III Contractual Liability) applies to property damage to property in the care, custody, or control of the Insured and to property damage to work performed by or on behalf of the Named Insured, subject to the following additional provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">1.
