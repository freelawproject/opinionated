That was an action brought in 1977 by Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart, a Boston law partnership (hereafter CHS), against the corporation (SCA) to recover fees for legal work done on behalf of Berton Steir. CHS billed SCA for these fees, claiming that SCA was directly obligated to CHS under the terms of a general settlement agreement between Steir and SCA (and others). By motion for summary judgment, SCA tested whether CHS, not a party to the agreement, had standing to sue upon it. The court, finally overthrowing the regime of <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>1 Gray 317, 321 (1854), held that CHS, as an \u201cintended,\u201d \u201ccreditor\u201d beneficiary of SCA\u2019s undertaking in the agreement, did have a locus standi to maintain an action to enforce it. Left for trial were the substantive claim and defenses. In 1984 the action was tried, jury-waived, and upon findings of fact, rulings of law, and order for judgment, a judge of the Superior Court held for CHS. From the (amended) judgment which followed, SCA takes the present appeal. We note here that the record appendix contains very little of the trial transcript and accordingly the judge\u2019s findings by and large are not open to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">1. <em>The agreement, </em>a. <em>Background. </em>Around March, 1976, SCA\u2019s eight-man board of directors found itself equally divided and in stalemate. A cause of doubt and contention was charges (and ramifications of charges) that Christopher P. Recklitis, past president and treasurer and once a dominant figure in the company, had defrauded it in the period 1972-1975 by the devices of taking for his personal use (or that of corporations controlled by him) moneys ostensibly advanced by SCA for legitimate purposes; causing SCA to purchase at excessive prices properties in fact, though not ostensibly, owned by him; and secretly and illicitly using funds of SCA for bribes and payoffs. To uncover the facts, SCA had commissioned invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>gations by the law firms of Sk\u00e1dden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom and Hale &amp; Dorr, and by the date of the settlement agreement SCA and others had before them the reports of these firms as well as an audit report by the accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. By that date, SCA had commenced separate actions against Recklitis, Stanton L. Kurzman, a director, and Steir, a past president and then currently chairman of the board of directors. The action against Steir, lodged in the Superior Court in Norfolk County in May, 1976, charged Steir with breach of his fiduciary duties toward SCA and with intentional waste of corporate funds in that (we omit details) he had assisted Recklitis in his schemes regarding the purchase of properties and the making of false loans. In their turn, Steir, Kurzman, and two other directors, Stanley Lesnick and Jack Kanfer, had commenced an action against SCA (and others) in a Delaware court and another in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had undertaken an investigation of possible irregularities in SCA affairs (File No. HO-867).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">b. <em>Terms. </em>The settlement agreement of August 13, 1976, broke the deadlock and resolved certain confrontations. Parties of the first part were the Steir group; those of the second part were SCA and the four remaining directors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By the terms of the agreement, the lawsuits mentioned, other than that against Recklitis, were dismissed with prejudice. There was to be an exchange of releases; the release running to the Steir group is summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Steir and his three colleagues were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to resign as directors and officers of SCA and its affiliates. They agreed to deliver to designated proxy agents their irrevocable proxies (suitably warranted) covering their shareholdings in the company. Steir contracted with SCA to provide future consulting services, and there were contracts also with Lesnick and Kanfer. A corporation named GCT, Inc., was to enter into an agreement to take over assets and liabilities of Garden City Travel Service, Inc., an SCA subsidiary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SCA undertook to pay certain past legal and other expenses that had been incurred by the Steir group. The provision sued on in the present action by CHS against SCA appears as paragraph 15 of the settlement agreement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201c15. SCA shall continue to indemnify and hold harmless each of the parties of the first part for any and all losses, liabilities or expenses, if any . . ., suffered or incurred by such party arising out of or resulting from any acts or omissions to act by such party while a director, officer or employee of SCA or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective date hereof and each of the parties of the first part may select his own counsel whose reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid on a current basis directly by SCA, all to the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law. SCA\u2019s current charter and bylaw provisions with regard to indemnification will not hereafter be changed to terms which are in any respect less favorable to the parties of the first part. This obligation includes without limitation all legal and other fees and expenses incurred after the date hereof and arising from the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of SCA, File No. HO-867.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>c. <em>Claimed breach of paragraph 15. </em>Putting to one side, for the moment, the significance of the reference in paragraph 15 to Delaware law, Steir is shown by the evidence to have incurred expenses fitting that paragraph, i.e., charges by CHS, his attorneys, arising from his acts or omissions while a director or officer of SCA prior to August 13, 1976, including chiefly such charges incurred after that date stemming from the SEC investigation. SCA paid CHS direct, without cavil, its bills through March, 1977, for services to Steir totaling $19,979.22, but it refused payment of later CHS bills. Here was the claimed breach by SCA of the settlement agreement, particularly paragraph 15, for which the present action was brought on July 25, 1977. The (amended) judgment in the action awarded CHS $22,796.21, which in substance covered bills for services from January, 1978, through November, 1981. The judgment declared, further, that payments of bills for services during the prior intervening period were properly exacted from SCA under a preliminary injunction obtained by CHS early in the action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Other details of the judgment need not be rehearsed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">2. <em>Defenses. </em>SCA attempted to explain or justify its breach of contract in a number of ways. In our view, the trial judge correctly held that these defensive efforts failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">a. <em>Authority for indemnification of directors. </em>SCA has contended that paragraph 15, obliging it to indemnify Steir for his legal expenses, was invalid by Delaware law which, the parties agree, controls on this question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reference is to \u00a7 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann, tit. 8, \u00a7 145 (1983), set out, in part, as an appendix to this opinion. SCA argues, in effect, that the only proper source for paragraph 15 was subsection (a) of \u00a7 145, and for lack of \u201cgood faith,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>etc., Steir did not qualify \u2014 a possiblity that SCA presumably overlooked when it entered into the settlement agreement and made the first payments to CHS. Passing the question of the availability of subsection (a), we agree with the trial judge that subsection (f) was available. This is the \u201cnonexclusion\u201d provision which says that there may be an agreement to indemnify for legal expenses which is not founded in, or limited by, the other provisions of the statute. A similar \u201cnonexclusion\u201d provision appeared in a predecessor statute, Delaware Corporation Law \u00a7 2(10) (1943) (hereinafter \u201c\u00a7 2[10]\u201d), 44 Del. Laws c. 125, \u00a7 1 (1943) (codified at Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 122[10] [1953]) (repealed 1967).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was interpreted by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Willys-Overland Motors, Inc., </em>204 F.2d 888 (1953). According to the court (per Biggs, C.J.), the provision was invoked by an agreement between the corporate officer and the corporation on sundry solid considerations of which the indemnification of the officer formed an understandable part \u2014 not one dragged in arbitrarily.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Bishop, Corporate Officers and Directors par. 6.03 [l][b] &amp; 7.06 (1981). The present statute, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 145(f) (1983), has the same intent and similar coverage. See <em>Hibbert </em>v. <em>Hollywood Park, Inc., </em>457 A.2d 339, 344 (Del. 1983) (by-law provision); <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>Wolfson, </em>321 A.2d 138, 142 (Del. Super. Ct. 1974) (same). See also E.L. Folk, III, The Delaware General Corporation Law 101-103 (1972); Arsht &amp; Stapleton, Delaware\u2019s New General Corporation Law: Substantive Changes, 23 Bus. Law. 75, 80 (1967); Sebring, Recent Legislative Changes in the Law of Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others, 23 Bus. Law. 95, 105 (1967). Our case fits \u00a7 145(f).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>b. <em>Alleged forfeiture of rights of indemnity. </em>However, agreements \u2014 even compendious settlement agreements \u2014 under which directors secure indemnification from the corporations they have served carry a potential for mischief and for harm to stockholders and others. (The considerations of policy are well stated in the introductory comment on subchapter E, Indemnification, 2 Model Business Corporation Act Annotated 1081-1082 [3d ed. 1985].) Accordingly, it is generally accepted that an agreement to indemnify within \u00a7 145(f), to survive into enforceability, must be able to withstand an attack on grounds of policy or basic equity, that is, a defense amounting to illegality, as in Mass.R.Civ.P.8(c), 365 Mass. 750 (1974) (affirmative defenses). See Bishop, <em>supra </em>at par. 6.03 [1]; Arsht &amp; Stapleton, <em>supra; </em>Sebring, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In its brief, SCA makes various dark insinuations about Steir especially in respect to his supposed relationship with Recklitis, which should, they aver, deprive him of indemnity. We cannot, however, go by suspicion, we must go by the record put before us, and, as already noted, that leads us to the judge\u2019s findings. These do not denigrate Steir\u2019s conduct as director and officer of SCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">(1) Project \u201cA\u201d. With respect to the claim that Steir had a knowing hand in SCA\u2019s purchase of properties at excessive prices, more particularly certain properties in Amesbury, Massachusetts, there were detailed findings, ending in a ruling that \u201cSCA failed to prove that it suffered any actual loss in the Project A transaction, that it paid anything other than a fair market price, or that Steir acted to SCA\u2019s detriment\u201d (ruling ll).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">(2) Carlton receivable. Under this caption we may refer to the question of alleged complicity of Steir in improper loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>to Recklitis or his companies (including Carlton Hotel Corporation). \u201cThere was no evidence adduced at trial,\u201d says finding 42, \u201cthat Steir knew ... at the time the cash advances were being made that they were being made improperly nor was there any evidence of any wrongdoing or breach of fiduciary duty on Steir\u2019s part with regard to the Carlton receivable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, \u201c [t]here was no proof of a breach of duty or harm to SCA with regard to Steir\u2019s guarantee of certain of Recklitis\u2019 debts . . .\u201d (ruling 11).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">(3) Steir\u2019s guilty plea. In 1979 an information was filed against Steir in the Federal District Court in Massachusetts charging that in 1974 he had knowingly caused to be filed with the SEC an amendment to the company\u2019s statement for a prior fiscal year in which the Carlton receivable was described as being for services purchased, whereas Steir knew that it resulted primarily from cash advances to Recklitis and Carlton.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Steir pleaded guilty. As part of the negotiated plea bargain,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the government agreed it would not bring further charges against Steir \u201carising directly or indirectly out of the continuing SEC investigation into SCA\u201d (finding 42). The judge evidently considered the conviction less than grievous, as he indicated in ruling 12 that, were Steir\u2019s indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 145(a) of the Delaware statute, the guilty plea would not be disqualifying under that text. (CHS did not represent Steir in the criminal proceeding and no claim for legal services in that connection is at bar.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">(4) SEC civil suit. SEC commenced a civil action in August, 1977, for injunctive and other relief against SCA, Recklitis, Steir, and others in the Federal court for the District of Columbia alleging wrongdoing regarding the matters mentioned in (1) and (2) above. The record herein reproduces the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The allegations are not themselves proof, and the judge\u2019s findings in the present action relating to the subjects of those allegations have been noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">(5) Conclusion. The judge concluded in finding 46: \u201cSCA produced no evidence that Steir breached his fiduciary duty to SCA and improperly benefited at SCA\u2019s expense in the sum of $125,000 [see note 11, supra] or any other sum. There was no evidence adduced at trial that Steir intentionally or wilfully violated any fiduciary duty owed to SCA, material to this case, or aided or abetted in any wrongdoing to the detriment of SCA and to his own benefit or that of those with whom he acted in concert.\u201d (See also ruling 11.) In ruling 10, the judge denied that \u201cbad faith\u201d on Steir\u2019s part had been shown that might deprive him of his \u00a7 145(f) rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">c. <em>Attack on the settlement agreement. </em>The judge found no merit in SCA\u2019s contention that Steir made misrepresentations to, or concealed information from, the parties of the second part with the result, according to SCA\u2019s claim, that the settlement agreement was undermined at least as far as Steir was concerned. (Although, if accepted, this might look to rescission, there was little indication how the status quo ante could be achieved.) The judge\u2019s rejection of the argument was flat (finding 45): \u201cSCA produced no evidence at trial that establishes or tend[s] to show any misrepresentation to it or concealment from it of any material fact in connection with the execution or negotiations of the agreement in 1976.\u201d He added (finding 44) that SCA had \u201cextensive knowledge\u201d from the several reports and otherwise of the matters alleged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>SEC against Steir or should have anticipated their development in the course of the SEC investigation. He thought it was the parties\u2019 intention \u201cto put at rest all litigation past and future in connection with the matters alleged (but not proved) in the SEC complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(See also ruling 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">3. A <em>procedural point. </em>As SCA refused to pay the amount now in suit to CHS, Steir paid it. This, according to SCA, should bar the present action since CHS is left without a grievance. CHS, however, has represented that it will hold the recovery herein for the benefit of Steir, and Steir has undertaken to be bound by the result of the present action. To make SCA\u2019s own default the occasion for destroying the action would be indeed stultifying. We may observe that, when it was originally held in Superior Court that CHS was disqualified as plaintiff under <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>and CHS, therefore, moved to substitute Steir as plaintiff, SCA did not acquiesce in the motion and it was denied (see 378 Mass, at 540). At no stage through trial did SCA attempt by pleading or motion to take its present objection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The objection is without merit, as the judge held.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00a7 145. <em>\u201cIdemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">(a) A corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

An independent legal ground for such claims must be shown in every case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Alternatively, the court upheld the indemnification under the terms of \u00a7 2(10) preceding the \u201cnonexclusion\u201d provision. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> For decisions touching other aspects of \u00a7 145 or its predecessor, see <em>Essential Enterprises Corp. </em>v. <em>Automatic Steel Products, Inc., </em>39 Del.

The form letter was probably suggested by \u00a7 145(e), which provides for current payment of legal expenses (\u201cin advance of the final disposition of such action\u201d). We agree with the judge that the reference to (a)-(c) did not impeach the right to rely on (f) as authority for the indemnification.
