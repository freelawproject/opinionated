He\u2019s very in control. He doesn\u2019t show his emotions when he doesn\u2019t want to, does he? \u201d Defense counsel promptly objected to those remarks. Appellate counsel for the defendant argues that the remarks were so unfair as to deprive the defendant of due process and, inferentially, deprived the defendant of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In the context of the trial, we do not think the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were unfair or that they could reasonably be considered as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failing to take the stand. To be sure, a defendant \u201chas the right to remain passive, and to insist that the Commonwealth prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt without explanation or denial by him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 771, 774 (1980), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 307 (1926). Prosecutorial remarks \u201creasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on [a defendant\u2019s] failure to take the stand\u201d are impermissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 69 (1954). See <em>Borodine </em>v. <em>Douzanis, </em>592 F.2d 1202, 1210-1211 (1st Cir. 1979). Evidence of guilt is not to be implied from a defendant\u2019s sitting calmly in the courtroom. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borodine, </em>371 Mass. 1, 11 (1976), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977). Suggesting that a defendant\u2019s courtroom behavior betrays consciousness of guilt is proscribed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>366 Mass. 479, 494-495 (1974), but comment on coolness of demeanor is not necessarily out of bounds. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 907 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 853 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burston, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1036 (1981); <em>Commmonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 355, 364 n.7 (1985), further appellate review granted, 397 Mass. 1101 (1986). Cf. 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 274 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In this case comment on the defendant\u2019s coolness was germane and responsive. Defense counsel, in her closing speech, had argued the unlikelihood of murder following upon an apparently friendly meeting between the defendant and D. J. Walker. The prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s demeanor was a comment on his ability to dissemble. We do not think the prosecutor\u2019s remarks on demeanor can reasonably be construed as a comment on the failure of the defendant to testify. Indeed, in her own closing argument, defense counsel had, as a matter of tactics, made more direct reference to her client\u2019s declining to testify. Moreover, the judge gave emphatic instructions that the jury were not to draw inferences adverse to the defendant from his exercising his right not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Our opinion that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about the defendant\u2019s calm were permissible, and not a basis for reversal, should not be read as a general endorsement of comment on a defendant\u2019s, calm demeanor in any prosecution. The cases cited, read in the light of their facts, do not stand for a blanket rule that comment on the demeanor of the defendant is permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>sible in every case. Defense counsel are well advised to \u2014 and do \u2014 instruct their clients that courtroom decorum calls for quiet and controlled behavior. \u201cSit there,\u201d as the saying goes, \u201clike a fire hydrant.\u201d It cannot be fair to pillory a defendant for behaving appropriately. We caution prosecutors that comment on demeanor is a dangerous device, not to be employed as a matter of routine, but only if the record context provides solid ground for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Another portion of the prosecution\u2019s closing which the defendant protests as an adverse comment on his silence went as follows: \u201cAnd D. J. and Young went into a room together for forty-five minutes, and nobody knows what that conversation was except David Young. And then came out.\u201d In view of the effort of the defense, in closing, to characterize the same encounter between D. J. Walker and the defendant, which occurred on the day D. J. was murdered, as one of reconciliation in an atmosphere of amity, the prosecution\u2019s remark was a permissible comment on the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 323-324 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">A third element of the closing argument to which the defendant objects was its emphasis on the victim D. J. Walker\u2019s connection to the defendant as a low-level drug dealer for the latter, who stood somewhat higher in the chain of distribution. That relationship could fairly be argued on the basis of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>391 Mass. 369, 372 (1984). As to the relevance of the drug-dealing setting to the homicides, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass, at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">2. <em>Testimony about weapons. </em>Three witnesses testified that they had seen the defendant with handguns prior to the murders. Anthony Grant (who had been beaten, shot at, and pistol-whipped three days before the murders)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified over objection that he had seen the defendant display a black-barreled .38 calibre handgun and a silver handgun which looked like a .32 or .38 calibre weapon to him. The victims\u2019 sister saw the defendant with a silver, brown-handled handgun tucked into his trousers two days before the murders, and had earlier seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>him with a smaller black handgun which she took to be a .22 calibre weapon. A third witness testified he had seen the defendant with a pistol handle sticking out from his trousers the day before the murders. The murder weapon was a .38, but there was ballistic evidence tending to prove that the handgun used to shoot at the witness Grant was a different .38. On the basis of the evidence it was a matter of conjecture whether any of the handguns described by the witnesses was the murder weapon. None of the handguns described came into the possession of the Commonwealth, and none was received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error is that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s gun toting and gun display was of a \u201cprior bad acts\u201d character and, therefore, not admissible. See generally Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 420 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985, at 190). Here, however, the probative force of the evidence was not that the defendant was a bad man (evidence of the brutal assault on Grant, which was tied to the murders, was more potent in that regard), but that he possessed the means to commit the crimes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 371 (1974). Ten .38 calibre bullets had been fired into the two victims. That the defendant had been in possession of weapons which might have been used in committing the crimes was, in the judge\u2019s discretion, admissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 356 (1985). Unlike the evidence in the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, supra </em>at 357-358, the evidence received did not concern weapons which had definitively been established to be unconnected with the crime around which the trial revolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">3. <em>Admission of hearsay. </em>Anthony Grant testified that, after the defendant had fired a hangun at him in the basement of the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 house, the defendant\u2019s father called down, \u201cDave, don\u2019t kill him in here, don\u2019t kill him in here; I told you not to kill him in here.\u201d The extrajudicial statement was not offered to establish the truth of any facts asserted in it, but for atmospherics, to give the jury the benefit of the complete occurrence. As such it was admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule which permits receiving evidence of spontaneous statements closely connected with, and perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>affecting, the conduct in issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>376 Mass. 201, 206-207 (1978); Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 350-352; 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1746-1750 (Chadbourn rev. 1976). See also <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>McMahan, </em>168 Mass. 3 (1897); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>300 Mass. 45, 50, cert, denied, 304 U.S. 565 (1938). Parenthetically, in the context in which the statement came into the record, its capacity to impress the jury must have been marginal if the jury were inclined to credit Grant\u2019s testimony. That testimony recounted a tale rich in brutality, vengeance, and threatened murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The first trial of the murder indictments ended with a hung jury. The second trial resulted in guilty verdicts. The convictions were affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448 (1981). The defendant had raised as an issue on appeal that he had been denied permission to sit with counsel and had been relegated to the prisoner\u2019s dock. The court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, supra </em>at 461-462, acknowledged that it had, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>379 Mass. 106, 107-111 (1979), adopted as the governing principle for Massachusetts that defendants ought not to be consigned to the prisoner\u2019s dock unless specific and articulated security considerations so required. That principle, however, was to be given prospective effect and the second trial of David Young occurred before the <em>Moore </em>case was decided. Upon application for writ of habeas corpus, the rule regarding not placing defendants in the dock without a finding of reasonable necessity to maintain order was given retrospective effect. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>700 F.2d 32 (1st Cir. 1983). In consequence the conviction was set aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass, at 451-452, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 953 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b477-6\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0LG\">(concurring). Unlike some who think that overreaching and various other transgressions by the Commonwealth occur most often in close cases, I still cling to the notion that thoughtlessness rather than contrived unfairness precipitate the vast majority of the alleged errors presented on appeal. Here we see the Commonwealth in its third effort to convict this defendant. One would have thought it would have avoided steering straight for the iceberg. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 355, 366 (1985) (Brown, J., concurring), further appellate review granted, 397 Mass. 1101 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">I accept the majority\u2019s justification, on the facts of this particular case, for the comment about the defendant\u2019s controlled demeanor, but I wish to highlight what the majority touches on too gently, namely, the \u201cCatch-22\u201d quality of the prosecutor\u2019s comment that \u201c[h]e\u2019s very in control.\u201d The defendant would be adversely affected if he were not calm and under control. What was this defendant, or any defendant, supposed to do in such a situation?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Finally, in passing, I note that the admission of the prejudicial extrajudicial statement of Anthony Grant was at the margin and needlessly daring. The Commonwealth did not need this potentially explosive piece of evidence and the judge\u2019s handling of it was questionable. Judges and prosecutors, alike, are responsible for ensuring the fairness of criminal trials. '</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> Regrettably, it must be said again that if prosecutors cannot get it right or at least strive to make it right, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paiva, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 563 (1983), they should turn in their tickets. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 367 n.2 (Brown, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
