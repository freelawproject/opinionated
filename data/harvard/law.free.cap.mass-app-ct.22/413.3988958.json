L. c. 265, \u00a7 19. Following the conviction, the defendant proceeded to trial,before the judge who had presided at the jury trial, on the additional charge of being a habitual criminal. G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25. The judge found the defendant guilty of that offense. Pursuant to the requirement in G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, the maximum penalty prescribed in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 19, for unarmed robbery. On appeal, the defendant argues error: with respect to the robbery conviction, in the denial of his motion to suppress his identification, and in the exclusion of evidence designed to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony on the issue of identification; and, with respect to the habitual criminal conviction, in the denial of his motion for a required finding of hot guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">1. <em>The motion to suppress. </em>The circumstances of the crime and the defendant\u2019s identification were as follows. On September 23, 1982, at about 6:30 p.m., Edward Plummer and his employer closed up the Springfield market where Plummer was employed. Plummer\u2019s employer gave him a ride up State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Street and dropped him at a bar known as the Charm Cafe. After having a couple of beers at that establishment, Plummer went to a fast food restaurant, where he purchased a few pieces of chicken. He then walked down State Street and on to Wil-braham Road, eating the chicken along the way, to another bar known as the Elks or Harmony Lounge. As he entered that establishment, Plummer met the defendant, whom he had known for a couple of years, but only by the name of \u201cErnest.\u201d The defendant told Plummer that a friend, \u201cJoe,\u201d had asked the defendant to tell Plummer that \u201cJoe\u201d would be waiting for him at Megan\u2019s Cafe. Megan\u2019s Cafe is located on State Street about a block from the Harmony Lounge. Plummer immediately left the Harmony Lounge and walked to Megan\u2019s in search of \u201cJoe.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Plummer arrived at Megan\u2019s, \u201cJoe\u201d was nowhere to be found. He looked for Joe\u2019s car but was unable to find it anywhere nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">After a stop at a pizza parlor, Plummer started toward his home at about 9:00 p.m. Street lights provided some dim illumination. As Plummer neared his home, he was suddenly seized from behind by a man who said, \u201cGive it up!\u201d Plummer testified that he recognized the voice as the defendant\u2019s. While Plummer was being held from behind, a second man confronted him, reached into his pocket and took his money. He did not recognize the second man but did notice what appeared to be a shiny object in his hand. At that moment the man in front of him said, \u201cCut him!\u201d Plummer dropped to one knee and spun around so that he was able to confront his assailant, whom (as he testified) he recognized as the defendant. Plummer broke away and ran to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Plummer did not call the police until the next day, September 24.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On that morning, he called the police department\u2019s emergency telephone number, 911, and gave an account of the robbery to a police cadet. After this call, Plummer spread word about the robbery around the neighborhood and made inquiries in an effort to ascertain the defendant\u2019s last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Plummer testified that several days later he learned that the last name of the man he knew as \u201cErnest\u201d was \u201cAllen.\u201d He again called the 911 line at police headquarters and was referred to Detective Joseph Assad at the detective bureau. Plummer told Detective Assad about the robbery, stating that he had recognized one of the assailants as a man he knew only as \u201cErnest\u201d and that he had just learned that Ernest\u2019s last name was \u201cAllen.\u201d Assad indicated that he knew an Ernest Allen and would soon be up to see Plummer to show him a picture of Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Later that same day, Detective Assad visited Plummer at the market. He brought with him five photographs, including a photograph of the defendant. The photographs were laid out on a countertop, and Plummer was asked whether he recognized anyone. Plummer immediately picked out the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The foregoing account is taken from the thorough findings of fact made by the judge on the motion to suppress. The findings are fully supported by the evidence and must stand. <em>Commonwealth v. Correia, </em>381 Mass. 65, 76 (1980). On these findings, the judge could properly conclude (as he did) that the photographic identification procedure arranged by Detective Assad was not impermissibly suggestive. The detective neither said nor did anything to direct Plummer\u2019s attention to the defendant\u2019s photograph, and the five photographs are sufficiently similar in appearance to constitute a fair array. The judge noted that \u201c[i]t would have been better if the array had been larger and if Detective Assad had not made the remark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that he did make on the telephone\u201d but concluded that \u201cthere was nothing so improper about the procedure as would deprive the defendant of due process.\u201d We agree with the judge\u2019s observation as to the detective\u2019s remark and his ultimate assessment of the constitutional adequacy of the identification procedure. There was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">2. <em>Exclusion of impeaching evidence in the robbery trial.. </em>Plummer\u2019s testimony at the trial repeated the circumstances of the crime and the resulting investigation substantially as recounted above, adding that $15 had been taken in the robbery. Plummer\u2019s identification of the defendant at the trial was strong and unequivocal, and included testimony that he: (a) had been acquainted with the defendant for years; (b) had seen and spoken with him in the neighborhood and at work on several occasions; (c) had immediately recognized the defendant\u2019s voice at the time of the robbery and had looked him \u201cdead in the face\u201d during the incident; (d) had given the police cadet who had received his 911 telephone call the day after the robbery the defendant\u2019s first name as \u201cErnest\u201d or \u201cErnie\u201d; and (e) had learned a few days later that the defendant\u2019s last name was \u201cAllen.\u201d Plummer\u2019s trial testimony was supported by testimony from Joseph W. Major, Sr. (said by Plummer to be the \u201cJoe\u201d mentioned by the defendant as waiting for him at Megan\u2019s Cafe), Detective Assad, and the police cadet. Major testified that he had never told the defendant to send Plummer to Megan\u2019s. Detective Assad testified that Plummer had told him that the name of one of the robbers was \u201cErnest Allen\u201d and that Plummer had immediately selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array shown to him. The police cadet testified that she had taken the 911 telephone call from Plummer and that Plummer had told her that he knew one of the men who had robbed him and that the man\u2019s first name was \u201cErnie\u201d or \u201cErnest.\u201d The defendant\u2019s trial counsel made little headway in cross-examination in refuting this formidable identification testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant did not testify in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>It is with the identification testimony in this posture that we come to the evidence which the defendant\u2019s trial counsel offered to impeach Plummer. That evidence consisted of a typed transcript of the 911 telephone call made by Plummer to the police station on September 24, 1982. The transcript was made from a copy of the tape which had recorded the conversation. It was undisputed that some portion of the conversation was missing from the tape (through no fault of the police), but that the transcript accurately reported so much of the conversation as had been preserved. The relevant material in the conversation is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The defendant\u2019s trial counsel attempted twice at the trial to introduce the material. The first time occurred in cross-examination of Plummer when the material was offered to impeach the credibility of Plummer\u2019s identification. The judge excluded the offer on the basis that Plummer\u2019s answers in the telephone conversation may not have been inconsistent with his trial testimony because Plummer might have stated that he knew his assailant as \u201cErnest\u201d or \u201cErnie\u201d in the missing portion of the conversation. The judge indicated, however, that he would reconsider his ruling after he had an opportunity to listen to the tape. After the tape was produced the defendant\u2019s trial counsel renewed his offer to introduce the transcript. The judge made a final ruling excluding it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201c\u2018[A] fair and full cross-examination to develop facts in issue or relevant to the issue is a matter of absolute right and is not a mere privilege to be exercised at the sound discretion of the presiding judge, and the denial of the right is prejudicial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>365 Mass. 534, 543 (1974), quoting from <em>Gossman </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>237 Mass. 122, 124 (1921). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 354,355 (1983). This principle necessarily encompasses the \u201cright to prove statements inconsistent with [a witness\u2019s] testimony,\u201d and \u201ccannot be denied by the judge when the testimony bears directly upon a material and not collateral issue in the case . . . .\u201d <em>Assessors of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>W.T. Grant Co., </em>329 Mass. 359, 360 (1952), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We have no doubt that the excluded evidence bore on a material issue. When identification is controverted, the importance of the victim\u2019s opportunity to identify his assailant at the scene of the crime cannot be underestimated. That opportunity will most likely be scrutinized by the jury to see if an identification based upon observations at the time of the crime is reliable. If the initial identification is found to be trustworthy, it will also probably enhance the weight to be given by the jury to subsequent identifications by the victim, such as the photographic identification that occurred in this case. Moreover, common sense indicates that a jury will probably consider as convincing any initial identification which is rooted in the victim\u2019s apprehension of individualizing physical characteristics of a defendant such as voice, smell, body type or clothes. The initial identification is all the more strengthened if it is shown that the victim and the defendant knew each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Here, the principal contested issue at trial concerned Plum-mer\u2019s ability to identify the defendant. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the issue was powerful. That proof tended to show that the defendant may have used a subterfuge to lure Plummer back to the vicinity of Megan\u2019s Cafe as part of a plan to set him up for a robbery. It further indicated that on the basis of prior contacts with the defendant, Plummer immediately identified him as one of his assailants, and reported to the police the next day what could have been found by the jury to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>highly reliable identification. Plummer\u2019s identification testimony, supported by the other police testimony, went largely uncontradicted at trial. The excluded evidence, on the other hand, if it had been introduced and accepted by the jury, could have substantially undermined Plummer\u2019s identification by tending to show that he never really saw his assailants and had no idea who they were.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Realistically appraised, the evidence presented about the only chance the defendant had to create a reasonable doubt in a prosecution in which he faced (and ultimately received) a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The judge initially excluded the evidence on the ground that the missing portion of the recording could very well have contained Plummer\u2019s identification of the defendant as \u201cErnie\u201d or \u201cErnest,\u201d as Plummer had testified at the trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s final ruling on the evidence, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>was to the effect that the evidence, because of incompleteness, might be too untrustworthy to be admitted. A trial judge, of course, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>discretion to exclude this type of evidence on the ground that the evidence might mislead or confuse the jury. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>443 F.2d 792, 795 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 404 U.S. 944 (1971). The measure of the judge\u2019s discretion has been put in these general terms: \u201cThe task of the trial court, in detennining whether to admit tape recordings into evidence which contain [missing or] inaudible portions, is to assess whether the . . . portions are \u2018so substantial, in view of the purpose for which the tapes are offered, as to render the recording as a whole untrustworthy.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>651 F.2d 1255, 1259 (8th Cir. 1981), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young, </em>488 F.2d 1211, 1214 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In this case, unlike perhaps some others in which the lack of substantiality in the evidence is primarily dependent on the trial judge\u2019s examination, the concept of discretion is circumscribed by the fact that we are in about the same position as the trial judge to make the appropriate evaluation. We have an authenticated transcription of the recording and the testimony at trial against which its probative value is to be measured. We note that, in circumstances like those in the present case, several State and Federal appellate courts have dealt with the problem by applying a test similar to the one enunciated by the court in <em>Bell, </em>and with the limitation of discretion that has been described above. These decisions, as a general proposition, favor admission of the evidence (with a full explanation of its defects) when it would be of some practical value in the jury\u2019s resolution of relevant issues. The basis of these decisions is the thought that the common sense of the jury can be trusted to evaluate the parties\u2019 contentions and to give to the evidence the weight that they think it deserves. See, e.g., <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>State, </em>397 P.2d 976, 979 (Alaska 1965) (that a transcript of a tape recorded telephone conversation contained only part of the conversation is only one factor for the jury to consider in determining its weight for impeachment; trial judge\u2019s finding that the recording was unreliable reversed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Steinbrecher, </em>409 So. 2d 510, 511-512 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (partial inaudibility of a tape recording insufficient ground for excluding otherwise properly admissible evidence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>order excluding recording quashed); <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>608 S.W.2d 897, 899 (Tex. 1980) (error for trial judge to exclude partially inaudible tape recording, much of which was understandable, where it was the only \u201cunbiased evidence\u201d). See also <em>Gorin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>313 F.2d 641,652 (1st Cir. 1963), cert, denied, 374 U.S. 829 (1963) (appellate court examined transcription of tape recordings and concluded that \u201cinaudible parts are [not] so substantial as to make the rest more misleading than helpful\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, supra </em>(trial judge properly admitted partially inaudible tape recordings, giving opponent opportunity to offer his version of the inaudible portions). See also (in an analogous area) the inquiry suggested for the jury in Fed. R. Evid. 1008, and the discussion in McCormick, Evidence 138-139 (3d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">As has been discussed, the evidence excluded in this case was obviously relevant to a principal issue. The need for the evidence could be considered critical in order to assure the defendant a fair trial. The jury could easily have been acquainted with the Commonwealth\u2019s contention about the information allegedly contained in the missing portion of the conversation and the circumstances leading to its omission. We think the jury would not have been confused or misled by the controversy over the recording and that they could have resolved ambiguities in a manner consistent with their usual function of deciding the weight to be given to the evidence. We conclude that the judge erred by excluding the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">3. <em>The habitual criminal conviction. </em>The defendant argues that he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the habitual criminal charge because (1) the Commonwealth failed to prove that he had been \u201ctwice committed to prison in this . . . state\u201d for previous convictions as required by G. L. c. 279, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u00a7 25, see note 2, <em>supra; </em>(2) the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant\u2019s two previous commitments had been \u201cfor terms of not less than three years each,\u201d as required by the statute; and (3) his sentence and commitment to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord for one of the two previous convictions cannot constitute a prior conviction under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">(a) An assistant clerk of the Superior Court in Hampden County testified that the defendant had been sentenced, and committed, on September 26, 1967, for a term of five years and one day at M.C.I., Concord, on his conviction for being privy to assault and battery with intent to maim and disfigure by means of a dangerous weapon; and that he had been sentenced, and committed, on October 27, 1969, to M.C.I., Walpole, for a term of not more than twelve and not less than seven years on his conviction of manslaughter. The indictments containing the clerk\u2019s entries of these dispositions, including the orders of commitment, were placed in evidence. A Springfield police officer and Detective Assad also testified that they were familiar with the defendant, these charges, and their dispositions. This evidence was sufficient to permit the judge, who was sitting alone as the fact finder, to infer beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Basch, </em>386 Mass. 620, 622 (1982), that the defendant had been twice convicted of felonies and twice actually committed to prison, as required by G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, it was not necessary for the Commonwealth to introduce the mittimuses involved in the execution of the two sentences to prove the commitment element of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">(b) The defendant\u2019s further contention, that he had to actually serve at least three years on each prior felony conviction before he could be sentenced as a habitual criminal, has been disposed of adversely to him in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 812 n.ll (1985).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>(c) The defendant\u2019s last contention is that a sentence and commitment to M.C.I., Concord, for a term of three years or more cannot qualify as a prior conviction under G. L. c. 279, \u00a725. He argues that \u201cunder a schedule promulgated by the parole board, a prisoner at Concord is eligible for parole between six months and two and one-half years. Consequently, there is no possibility a Concord prisoner will directly serve three years.\u201d This contention is in error, because eligibility for parole does not require the Parole Board to grant parole. It is possible for a prisoner to serve in excess of three years on a Concord sentence. To the extent that the defendant contends that a sentence to M.C.I., Concord, for a felony conviction will not qualify as a sentence to a \u201cprison,\u201d as that word is used in the habitual criminal statute, we note (i) the inclusion of Concord as a \u201cstate correctional facility\u201d in G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(n), </em>the statute governing the administration of the correctional institutions of the Commonwealth, and (ii) the dictum in <em>Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>158 Mass. 598, 600 (1893), which indicates that a sentence to Concord for the three-year term required by the habitual criminal statute is a sentence that counts under the statute. The possible unfairness of considering a Concord sentence for purposes of the habitual offender act, as thoughtfully developed by the judge in his posttrial memorandum, would appear to be a matter for the Legislature to consider. On the present language of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25, we must reject the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">4. <em>Disposition. </em>The judgment of the defendant\u2019s conviction of unarmed robbery is reversed, and the verdict is set aside. If the defendant is retried and convicted again of unarmed robbery, his conviction as a habitual criminal is to stand. If the defendant is either not retried or is acquitted of unarmed robbery, his habitual criminal conviction is to be vacated in the Superior Court and that charge is to be dismissed. In view of the circumstances, the retrial should be prompt. Consideration of when the retrial should occur, and bail in the interim, is to be had in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> The indictment upon which the conviction was returned charged the defendant with armed robbery under G.

What happened, why the first part of the conversation was not recorded on the tape, I have no idea, as it is evident from the tape itself that something happened, something was said before the tape started recording. For that reason I am not going to admit it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b441-6\"> We also think that the evidence could have been found by the jury to create an inconsistency with Plummer\u2019s trial testimony. \u201c[I]t is not necessary that there should be a contradiction in plain terms. It is enough if the proffered testimony, taken as a whole, either by what it says or by what it omits to say, affords some indication that the fact was different from the testimony of the witness whom it is sought to contradict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>312 Mass. 438, 440 (1942). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hesketh, </em>386 Mass. 153, 160-161 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> The Commonwealth argues that the partial recording could have been excluded because it could not be authenticated. The problem, as we see it, is not one of authentication. It was established or uncontested: (1) that the portion of the recording which had not been lost accurately reflected in the typewritten transcript the exact words of the conversation between Plummer and the police cadet who took his 911 telephone call; (2) that no changes, additions, or deletions had been made in the recording; (3) that the recording had been properly preserved (and that the loss of a portion of it was not attributable to fault on the part of the Commonwealth); and (4) that the conversation was made voluntarily and in good faith. These considerations satisfy the criteria for the authentication of this kind of evidence, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKeever, </em>169 F.Supp. 426, 430 (S.D. N.Y. 1958); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Acavino, </em>467 F. Supp. 284, 285 (E.D. Pa. 1979), and together with the considerations governing relevancy that have been previously discussed, also satisfy the authentication criteria for the admission of an audio recording. See <em>Commonwealth v. Gordon, </em>389 Mass. 351,354-356 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the error is harmless because the .defendant made the point he sought to establish with Plummer by impeachment of the police cadet with the fact that her written report of the telephone call contained no reference to the defendant\u2019s first name. It is obvious to us that the impeachment by the material which was excluded could be far more probative than the impeachment of the police cadet, and, if permitted, could have created a reasonable doubt in the jurors\u2019 minds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The defendant\u2019s contention that his conviction as a habitual criminal violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is also answered in <em>Tuitt </em>at 813-814.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
