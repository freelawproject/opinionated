L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A) and indecent assault and battery upon a child under fourteen, the defendants were each convicted on one charge of rape of a child by force.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants were sentenced to the same term of years; however, the sentence of the male defendant was suspended. Except for the female defendant\u2019s challenge to her sentence, both defendants raise the same issues on appeal, none of which rises to the level of reversible error. We discuss each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">1. The defendants claim that their motions for required findings of not guilty of the rape should have been allowed because the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence of force, an essential element of the proof required to establish an offense under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A. We disagree. On the state of the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, force was reasonably inferable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 687 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The offenses allegedly took place while the minor victim was in the foster care of the defendant Karoline. Karoline\u2019s son Andrew, the codefendant, and one William Martin, Karoline\u2019s boyfriend,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also resided in the home. At the time of the foster placement in 1979 the victim was approximately two years of age. The child remained in Karoline\u2019s custody until she was adopted in 1983. The correctness of the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for required findings of not guilty is manifest from the victim\u2019s testimony and from an abbreviated version of the properly admitted corroborative fresh complaint testimony<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the victim\u2019s adoptive mother, which was essentially similar to the victim\u2019s: Andrew \u201chad taken [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>victim] out of her crib several times and had hurt her in different ways . . . with his tail \u201d; Andrew and William Martin had put their penises in the victim\u2019s mouth and in her \u201chole\u201d; and Andrew, Karoline, and Martin had \u201ctickled\u201d her; the victim told her mother that tickling meant putting fingers \u201cin her little hole.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was also supportive testimony from a medical doctor, expert in the area of sexual and physical abuse. The doctor had used anatomically correct dolls in his examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">As to proof of force, it takes no great leap of imagination to appreciate that the requisite degree of force on this two year old foster child was implicit in such a coercive environment as is presented in the circumstances. The jury need only focus on the victim\u2019s age and size reasonably to conclude that the episodes alleged occurred without her consent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 580 (1982) ( \u201cagainst [victim\u2019s] will \u201d may properly be equated with \u201cwithout her consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">2. There was no error in allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s medical expert to give his opinion on whether the result of his examination of the victim was consistent with sexual molestation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>355 Mass. 526, 530-531 (1969). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendrala, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402-404 (1985). Nor was it error for him to state his opinion that the victim\u2019s level of sexual knowledge was very sophisticated for her age. See <em>id. </em>at 404 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The expert witness, relying on his experience and training, based his evaluation of the victim primarily on a physical examination and his observations of her manipulating anatomically correct dolls. He also extracted history from the victim. Although the doctor admitted that he had received information from other sources, he stated that his testimony (that his \u201cexamination was consistent with sexual molestation\u201d) was based entirely on the information Obtained from the victim and his own examination and observation of her. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>v. <em>Peets, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 917 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, ante </em>114, 121-122 (1986) (\u201cThe diagnosis as related to the jury contained no information additional to that previously given by the doctor which had been based only on his direct observations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Likewise, the doctor\u2019s opinion about the victim\u2019s level of sexual sophistication was properly admitted, as it fell within an area of his special expertise. He was a pediatrician with extensive experience in evaluating sexual abuse in children.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">3. The trial judge did not err in imposing a greater punishment on the female defendant. The judge could properly have considered Karoline\u2019s position as a foster parent and as the person entrusted with the responsibility for primary care of the victim. Abuse of such a relationship would warrant a conclusion that her conduct was more culpable than that of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> Prior to trial the judge dismissed an indictment charging the female defendant with failure to provide for the support and maintenance of a minor child in violation of G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"> Martin also was accused of sexually molesting the minor victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\"> As to the proper use of fresh complaint testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-397 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> The victim indicated in her testimony that she had been \u201churt\u201d by the defendants, that Andrew had put his finger and his penis or \u201ctail\u201d in her \u201chole,\u201d and that Karoline had put her finger \u201cin [the victim\u2019s] little hole.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
